By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As carriers prepare for deployment, months of smaller exercises culminate in bringing all the pieces together in a huge exercise, which includes combining the Carrier Strike Group’s (CSG) ships, submarines, air wing, and more into a single integrated fighting unit. The peak of this process is the Composite Unit Training Exercise, or COMPTUEX . This advanced evolution stress tests the CSG’s defenses. It often includes a small air armada of U.S. military and contractor-owned tactical aircraft that act as enemy fighters, bombers, and cruise missiles in a coordinated fashion, employing similar ‘red air’ tactics as to what the CSG may face from a foreign adversary when on deployment. Using open-source flight tracking websites, in this case, ADSBExchange.com , a bit of what goes on during these events can be seen, as was the case on December 18th, 2020, when the supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and her escorts were training off Mexico’s Baja Peninsula in preparation for a new deployment . The ‘red force’ holding around San Clemente Island. A second KC-10 was there, likely to provide refueling for the Navy’s own ‘red force’ elements, which usually includes a number of aggressors from one of the Navy’s dedicated aggressor squadrons, with fuel for the exercise. , ADSBexchange.com Involved in the exercise and visible on flight tracking sites were the following: 4X Mk 58 Hawker Hunters owned by Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) 1X F-21 Kfir owned by ATAC 4X F-5ATs owned by Tactical Air Support, Inc. (TacAir) 3X Learjet 35s owned by Phoenix Air 2X U.S. Air Force KC-10s , one orbiting down south supporting the carrier’s air wing and another around San Clemente Island, likely supporting Navy aggressors. ATAC Mk58 Hawker Hunter at NAS Point Magu. , Tyler Rogoway/Author Keep in mind that this is the force we are allowed to see. The ‘Red Air’ component of these exercises also usually includes a detachment of fighters from one of the Navy’s aggressor squadrons, such as Hornets from Fighter Composite Squadron 12 (VFC-12) or Strike Fighter Squadron 204 (VFA-204). Other assets are also brought in, including those from the Air Force. In recent west coast COMPTUEXs , the Air Force’s secretive pocket force of stealthy F-117 Nighthawks have been players , as well, complicating things for Navy defenders with a hard to track aircraft the likes of which they have never seen before—certainly a valuable wildcard element. We also don’t see the ships themselves, or the U.S. Navy fighters and airborne early warning aircraft that are airborne to protect the fleet from the mock attack. Also, it’s important to note that a minimum of three Aegis -equipped warships, usually a Ticonderoga class cruiser and two Arleigh Burke class destroyers , are tasked with defending the carrier and themselves and are the most advanced air defense assets on planet earth. They are all down there, too, swirling around, deep in what has become something of a notorious training area off the coast of Baja. A good overall view of the west coast training areas, including the expansive SOCAL complex. , FAS.org So, you have to use your imagination a bit as to what is going on in the video and who all is out there, but the contractors give us a good idea of what the red air game plan was on this one sortie. Also, keep in mind that these events change radically from day-to-day and from COMPTUEX to COMPTUEX. The idea is to present as many different complex threat scenarios as possible, that are as relevant as possible, to the CSG. In the late afternoon on December 18th, all these red air assets were in holding over and around San Clemente Island , when, on cue, many of them started pushing south. It was a wall of tactical aircraft, a dozen jets being visible on the tracker, and surely more being present in reality. A wall of four Hunters pressed south at high-subsonic speed at around 10,000 feet, while a single transonic F-21 Kfir led out in front at 40,000 feet. Often times the Kfirs are used to simulate the attack profiles of high-speed anti-ship cruise missiles, using their supersonic capabilities to dive onto the ships below from high altitude, and then skimming low over the water for their simulated terminal attack. You can read more about this attack profile in this past piece I wrote about ATAC’s operations a decade ago. ATAC F-21 Kfir blasting out of KBFI on a mission. For the better part of two decades, ATAC’s F-21s were the only supersonic contractor aggressors.  , Tyler Rogoway/Author These jets, like all the contractor aircraft involved in this training mission, usually pack electronic countermeasures pods and can also be equipped with cruise missile radar seeker emulator pods to give similar cues to sailors as they would see in a real-life anti-ship missile attack. The Kfir disappeared on the flight tracking website as it headed south, likely because it dove down to a very low altitude. Meanwhile, the Hunters were still making their run-in at the CSG, while two sections (two groups of two) of F-5ATs began their own runs towards the CSG, offset behind and to either side of the Hunters. This is where our video picks up. It is sped-up roughly 10X. The Hawker Hunters pushed south in a wall, traveling at around 450 knots and 10,000 feet, while a single Kfir raced forward at transonic speed and at 40,000 feet, before dropping off the tracker. Right after this is where the video picks up., ADSBexchange.com As you can see, the Hunters reach a certain area and then abruptly turn west and east, and extend out in those directions before heading back north. Meanwhile, the F-5ATs do a similar beaming maneuver, but they turn south and commit to a second push at the CSG before also breaking off to the west and returning north for eventual recovery. The Hunters would head back to their operating location at Naval Air Station Point Mugu and the F-5ATs head back to Naval Air Station North Island . Also during this time, the KC-10 supporting the CSG’s air wing looks as if it evades the fighter onslaught, breaking off its tight racetrack pattern and heading south deeper into the CSG’s protective umbrella. Tactical Air Services highly upgraded F-5AT. , CHRISTOPHER MCGREEVY As the F-5ATs and Hunters head back north, a third group of ‘bad guys’ turns to the south to make its run on the CSG. This time it is a trio of electronic warfare pod-toting Learjet 35s owned by Phoenix Air. These aircraft fly out of NAS North Island and provide daily target emulation, among other services, for fleet surface combatant training. They can represent a number of threats, from bombers to anti-ship cruise missiles. In this case, they make a similar run at the CSG as the Hunters made. Traveling south in a wide line-abreast arrangement at about 10,000 feet and about 350 knots. Then, like the Hunters before them, they all turn abeam at the same time, all to the east though, where they linger for a bit before returning north to North Island. Phoenix Air Learjet 35 packing electronic warfare pods., Phoenix Air The entire activity lasted about 45 minutes, with the action really occurring over less than 30 minutes. Things move very fast and one could imagine that these contractor aircraft likely ‘died’ as a result of the aggression towards the bristling Carrier Strike Group and its air wing. Once again, this is just one scenario that the red forces presented to the CSG, and we only get to see a fraction of what is really going on. Still, it is fascinating to see the contractors throw a dozen jets made up of three types, all with greatly different performance capabilities, at the CSG during a complex training evolution. ATAC F-21 Kfirs and Mk 58 Hawker Hunters lined up at their forward operating base at NAS Point Mugu., Tyler Rogoway/Author You can see how, when combined with certain rules of engagement, other higher-performance U.S. military aircraft, dense electronic warfare, as well as other unique variables, these types of training missions can sharpen the CSG’s skills so that they can be prepared to quickly react to the unknown while sailing overseas in less than friendly neighborhoods. It is also a reminder of why the Southern California Range Complex is so important to the Navy. It offers enough area to really get this type of training done, electronic warfare included, without setting far out to sea where adversary aircraft would have trouble even reaching them. As such, the training area off the coast of Baja remains an ideally quiet place to put the latest and greatest naval air defense technologies, tactics, and procedures to the test.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",This Is All The Survival Gear That Apache Attack Helicopter Crews Fly Into Combat With,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AH-64 Apache attack helicopter just gets better with age , but its crews still have to be ready for the possibility that will they find themselves stuck on the ground behind enemy lines. Unlike most of their fixed-wing cousins, they don’t have the luxury of being able to eject from their aircraft if things go terribly wrong. They also normally fly at low altitudes, which means they have less of an opportunity to get as far away from enemy forces as possible before ending up on terra firma. As such, they have to carry a unique mix of gear with them so that they have a fighting chance of surviving long enough until dedicated combat search and rescue (CSAR) assetsâ€”or even another Apacheâ€”arrives to pluck them out of harm’s way.Â The British Army’s WAH-64D Apache Longbows have seen their fair share of combat since being introduced into service a decade and a half ago. Now the fleet is in the process of being recapitalized in the form of the more capable AH-64E Apache Guardian. You can read all about this initiative in this recent piece of ours .Â A British Army Apache Longbow crewman in the helicopter’s front weapons systems operator or ‘gunner’s’ seat., British Army/MoD While this new version of the Apache aircraft will be a bit different, the survival gear the pilots will carry is unlikely to change much. With that being said, NATO put together a quick video showing what a British Army Apache crewman carries into combat. While some of the elements are similar to what jet pilots would carry, other elements are unique.Â Check out the video below for a good roundup on this essential survival gear (if the tweet does not show up in your browser, you can access it directly by clicking here ): ğŸš What are the essentials of an #Apache pilotâ€™s kit? We asked ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ @BritishArmy pilot Jonny earlier this year. #WeAreNATO pic.twitter.com/yvs1lCMbVD — NATO (@NATO) December 26, 2020 Of unique note are the short-barreled SA80 compact aircrew survival rifle and the Glock 19 pistol, but also the inclusion of ‘strops.’ These have become a key and potentially life-saving tool for Apache crews.Â During the first decade and a half of the Global War on Terror, multiple extractions of personnel occurred by strapping themselves to the sides of attack helicopters. This has since become an established capability as doing so means the person in need doesn’t have to wait for CSAR elements that could be hours away. It is especially important for dealing with the contingency of an attack helicopter rapidly snatching another downed attack helicopter’s crew in a combat zone, before the enemy can surround and capture them. This sounds like the stuff that far-fetched action movies are made of, but it is a real capability that can avert a horrible prisoner of war scenario or even death.Â Being strapped to the sponsons of an AH-64 is one wild, but potentially life-saving ride. , Public Domain/MoD You can read all about this tactic and how it quickly evolved in this past piece of ours . Regardless, strops are needed to best hook someone in to fly ‘sidesaddle’ on the outside of a WAH-64.Â So, there you have it, that is what’s in a British Army Apache helicopter crew’s survival kit.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s that time of year! St. Nick has made his list, he has checked it twice, and is now about to set out on his annual global present-giving power projection mission. While there have been many non-magical interpretations of Santa’s mass gift distribution platform, aka his sleigh and reindeer, some of the folks at the U.S. Army’s 1st Armored Division looked towards the M1 Abrams main battle tank for inspiration. Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, whose last posting was as commander of U.S. Army Europe and who has since become a regular commentator on CNN , posted a video of the tank version of Santa’s sleigh on Twitter along with the following message: Oldest son commands a tank battalion in ⁦ @1stArmoredDiv ⁩ To “prepare” for the holidays, the troops had a contest to decorate their vehicles. Never saw a tank platoon replicating Santa’s sleigh before! Proud of these soldiers. Good leaders create memories. The design work on those M1s is really pretty well done—Rudolf’s red nose and antlers and all. While there are bound to be some who may be taken aback by war machines being portrayed as Santa’s sleigh, I would counter that they are grossly overthinking it. This type of thing is a tradition across the military, with Santa often arriving in fighter jets and armored personnel carriers to bring cheer to the children of service members in various U.S. military units. This year, in particular, where close-up events are not allowed, a display like this serves as a great holiday distraction for military families who have had a long year of COVID-19 hell. In this case, it was also a morale-builder for those in the unit themselves. A little Christmas competition never hurt anyone. Santa arrives to greet military families on all types of vehicles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 20, 2021",Video Taken By Pilots Of What Could Be The Elusive Los Angeles Jet Pack Guy Emerges (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to weird stories that keep getting weirder, the elusive “Jet Pack Guy” of Los Angeles pretty much takes the cake. After multiple reported sightings from airline pilots on more than one occasion of a guy in a jet pack flying around at thousands of feet near Los Angeles International Airport—some of the most congested airspace on earth—as well as ongoing FAA and FBI investigations into the matter, we now have credible video of what seems to be the flying object in question. The footage doesn’t come to us from some random Reddit board or YouTube channel, either. It was taken during an instructional flight from Sling Pilot Academy in the training area off Palos Verdes. We reached out to the flight school, which is based out of Zamperini Field, in Torrance, California for additional details. The red circled area is roughly where the encounter occurred. , VFRmap.com One of the pilots involved in the bizarre incident told The War Zone that they were flying along their route in the practice area between Palos Verdes and Catalina Island when they caught what appeared to at least resemble a guy in a jet pack flying towards them in the opposite direction at about 3,000 feet. The object passed along the right side of their aircraft and kept going until it was out of sight. There was no communication from the object or about the object on the usually busy radio channel used for the training area. As such, the pilots did report the encounter with the FAA, but because there wasn’t really any detail to add, an official report was not filed. They were able to grab the video seen below (if for some reason it doesn’t show up in your browser, you can click here to view it directly on Instagram). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sling Pilot Academy (@slingpilotacademy) A guy flying out over the ocean in a jet pack at around 3,000 feet, especially one without any lifting surfaces, is a puzzling proposition, to say the least. Jet packs that do exist have very short ranges and are not equipped to be flying in dense airspace, especially thousands of feet in the air. It is possible that this is some sort of a drone dressed up to look like a guy in a jet pack, as seen in the video below. Then the question becomes why would someone be doing this? What could possibly be worth the risk? Also, it’s not like executing such a feat would be a cheap or simple operation. In this case, the craft wasn’t even flying over a populated area, it was out to sea where there are far fewer eyes to even recognize it. Then again, maybe this is something else altogether. But what? Let us know what you think is going on in the comments below. Regardless, our investigation into this matter, which includes multiple open FOIAs, continues. UPDATE: The FAA contacted us with the following official statement: “The FAA has not received any recent reports from pilots who believe they may have seen someone in a jetpack in the skies around Los Angeles. The FAA has taken the sighting reports it has received seriously, and has worked closely with the FBI to investigate them. However, the FAA has been unable to validate the reports.” This fits with what the pilot told us, that there wasn’t an official report filed. The War Zone has also learned that the officials are going to contact the flight school directly to investigate this incident further and that they replayed radar tapes from around the time of previous sightings, but did not see anything abnormal. No witnesses on the ground have provided any evidence of someone with a jet pack taking off or landing, either. Author’s note: A big hat tip to @OinDC for the heads up on the video!

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2020",Britain’s Shackleton Radar Plane Was Born As An Already Antiquated Cold War Dinosaur,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Royal Air Force announced recently that its forthcoming E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will be based at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. This is a move that will see the new aircraft operate alongside another 737-derived platform, the Royal Air Force P-8 Poseidon , but it’s also a base with its own unique airborne early warning history. Up until the end of the Cold War, Lossiemouth was home to an extraordinary, almost Rube Goldberg-esque radar plane, the Avro Shackleton AEW2, which ended up defending British airspace for far longer than was reasonable. The airborne early warning (AEW) version of the Mk 2 variant of the Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft, hence the designation AEW2, only began to be fielded in 1973, a full 24 years after the aircraft had made its first flight. The underlying airframe of all Shackletons traced its DNA all the way back to the Avro Lincoln four-engine bomber, first flown during World War II, and which was itself a further development of the iconic Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A Shackleton AEW2 at RAF Alconbury in 1988., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons The Shackleton inherited the wings and undercarriage of the Lincoln bomber, but got a new, roomier fuselage and replaced the previous Merlin engines with more powerful Griffon engines , driving six-bladed contra-rotating propellers. When the decision was made to use the platform for the aerial early warning role, production of the aircraft had long come to an end, so a dozen Shackleton MR2 maritime patrollers were instead modified for the surveillance role, gaining a “guppy” radome below the forward fuselage. Another three Shackleton MR2 aircraft were prepared to serve as crew trainers, without the radar fitted. The first iteration of the Shackleton to enter service was the MR1, seen in RAF Coastal Command service in 1953., RuthAS/Wikimedia Commons The radar inside that radome was the AN/APS-20, which had originally entered U.S. Navy service onboard adapted Grumman Avengers way back in the final months of World War II. The radar and radome both were taken from the Royal Navy’s Gannet AEW3s , carrier-based airborne early warning and control aircraft that had entered service in 1960, but began being withdrawn at the end of that decade after the United Kingdom decided to get rid of its conventional catapult-configured aircraft carriers. The Royal Navy Gannet AEW3 was the source of the APS-20 radar used on the Shackleton AEW2., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons While the airborne early warning role was considered vital to the defense of the United Kingdom, the AN/APS-20 was antiquated even when the Shackleton AEW2 entered service and it lacked a height-finding capability. Its performance overall was variable and depended on factors including altitude, weather, sea state, as well as the skills of the operators. Ultimately, the radar had been selected as the cheapest solution, although they were at least rebuilt and updated before being installed in the Shackletons. A number of former Royal Navy Gannet AEW3 radar operators were also transferred to the RAF, to build up skills. Other equipment on the converted Shackletons included the Orange Harvest broadband electronic countermeasures receiver — a passive detection device originally installed to locate surface ships or submarines — as well the AN/APX-7 identification friend or foe (IFF) interrogator. A Shackleton AEW2 at RAF Lossiemouth. The radar was mounted directly below the flight deck., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons The crew itself typically comprised of two pilots, two navigators, an engineer, and four radar operators. The way these airmen went about their tasks also had much in common with a previous era, the radar requiring constant “knob-turning,” while grease pencils stood in for computer screens. One of the first pilots assigned to No 8 Squadron, the Shackleton AEW2 unit, was Bill Howard, who describes the unusual crew composition in Ian Shaw and Sérgio Santana’s Beyond the Horizon , The History of Airborne Early Warning: The front-end crews were hairy old Coastal Command/maritime types — pilots, flight engineers, and navigators — who would rather have been chasing submarines or doing a rewarding SAR [search and rescue] job, while the rear-end chaps were a mix of Royal Navy/RAF radar operators, sorely piqued at the loss of their beloved aircraft carriers, and who were appalled at the prospect of spending up to 10 hours in a cold, noisy Shackleton. Somehow, however, we managed to get it all together. A Shackleton AEW2 taxiing for departure from RAF Fairford., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons The primary role of the Shackleton AEW2 was to keep watch over the airspace off the northern coasts of the United Kingdom, where Soviet bombers and maritime patrol aircraft were expected to launch their potential attacks against the country. Since ground-based radars provided only a limited detection capability, especially against low-altitude intruders, the Shackletons were expected to fill the gaps, working alongside RAF interceptors. At the height of operations, the Shackletons were managing the interception of at least six Soviet aircraft per week. In response, a quick reaction alert (QRA) system was set up, under which a Shackleton had to get airborne as rapidly as possible after the first detection of a Soviet aircraft by ground-based radar, or by another NATO asset. Bill Howard provides the following account of the QRA mission from Lossiemouth: We held a QRA capability at ‘Lossie’, with a target of getting airborne within two hours after being activated, depending on the day and the time. If it were a normal working day then the response would be much faster. However, if it was a weekend or out of hours, with crew members off base at home, then nearly two hours would be needed. We would be given a target time to arrive ‘on station’ and would aim to arrive at that time, there being no point in arriving too early and wasting fuel while waiting for ‘trade’. Around the UK, we would work with GCI [ground controlled intercept] controllers from RAF Buchan [also in Scotland]. Before going on task we would normally carry out a gentle climb, continuously recording the outside air temperature, looking particularly for evidence of an inversion, which might affect radar performance. Depending on the height of the target, we would plan to operate the barrier at an appropriate level. Normally the expected target would be high level and hence we would aim to be above any inversion layer, flying a racetrack pattern with straight legs of around 40 nautical miles, generally at right angles to the expected target track. The Mk 9 autopilot was pretty basic and a bit fiddly, requiring constant adjustment. Most pilots preferred to hand-fly the aircraft. As long as you trimmed the aircraft well, it was quite responsive to hand flying. We would cruise and operate in the 5,000 to 10,000 feet bracket as the aircraft was unpressurized. While working alongside RAF, or occasionally other NATO fighters, was a key part of the Shackleton AEW2 mission, the aircraft could not work as a true fighter controller, like a modern airborne early warning and control platform. Instead, the crew provided only advisory guidance to the interceptors, which they communicated with using discreet frequencies on UHF radios. The antenna of the AN/APS-20 radar., Hammersfan/Wikimedia Commons Early on in the life of the Shackleton AEW2, it had been planned that the aircraft would also provide protection for Royal Navy operations, which had been deprived of AEW cover after the drawdown of the Gannet AEW3 fleet. However, this proved overly ambitious and the Royal Navy task force that retook the Falkland Islands in 1982 did so without an AEW component, an omission that has been blamed, at least in part, for the heavy losses the British sustained. Nicknamed “Growler” by their crews, on account of its thunderous engines, the Shackleton AEW2 provided a less-than-comfortable working environment for the crew, with noise and vibration adding to their fatigue on long missions, which could last up to 12 hours, ranging far out over the North Sea. In fact, some of the previous soundproofing had been removed from the aircraft to save weight. What is more, the power demands of the radar meant the Griffon engines had to be operated much of the time at almost maximum power, making things even noisier. A Shackleton AEW2 over RAF Mildenhall., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons As well as noisy and cramped working conditions, the Shackleton AEW2 was seriously limited by its performance — with a ceiling of just 20,000 feet, the maximum line-of-sight radar radius was initially around 80 miles, compared to approximately 250 miles for a high-flying jet. In 1973, an airborne moving-target indication mode was added to the radar. More reminiscent of a World War II-era bomber, the taildragger landing gear was another of the Shackleton AEW2’s anachronisms, as Bill Howard recalled: The Mk 2 tailwheel ‘Shack’ was a notoriously tricky beast to land for the uninitiated and even the ‘old hands’ were capable of ‘hairy’ landings from time to time. The important thing was to know how to rescue a bad landing, as failure to take timely corrective action could further exacerbate an already unsettling situation. One such incident of a mishandled landing, during a training sortie, resulted in the write-off of one of our two MR2 training ‘hacks’. The fuselage was salvaged, set on concrete plinths, and ingeniously converted into a static crew-training simulator for the navigation/radar crew. There were plans to replace the Shackleton AEW2 with an airborne early warning and control version of the jet-powered Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft from 1982, but the failure of the Nimrod AEW3 meant the Shackleton had to soldier on for far longer than anticipated. By this time, the Shackleton AEW2 fleet had been reduced by half due to budget cuts. A Nimrod AEW3., Mike Freer/Wikimedia Commons Ultimately, the United Kingdom ordered the E-3D Sentry AWACS to replace the Shackleton AEW2 and finally provide a modern airborne early warning and control capability. The first of the RAF Sentry aircraft arrived at its base of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, in 1990 and the Shackleton AEW2 was finally retired in July 1991, Lossiemouth in the process losing its function as an AEW base. An RAF Sentry AEW1 as night falls on its RAF Waddington base., Crown Copyright All said, the fact that the piston-engine Shackleton AEW2 was still patrolling the northern approaches to the United Kingdom as late as 1991 is little short of remarkable. The last airworthy Shackleton was AEW2 serial number WL970, belonging to the Pima Air & Space Museum , Tucson, Arizona., Mike LaChance/Wikimedia Commons Now, Lossiemouth is set to receive the RAF’s E-7 Wedgetails, also marking the return to the base of No 8 Squadron, the Shackleton AEW2 unit, after an absence of 30 years. While it is currently uncertain if all five of the planned E-7s will ultimately be purchased, you can read all about the background to the Wedgetail deal here . With this latest development, the Scottish base will once again take on the vital airborne early warning and control role, with the new Boeing Wedgetail jets continuing in the tradition of the “Growler.” Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Forces Airborne Radar Airborne Sensors Military Aviation History Royal Air Force"

The video then cuts to footage of an F-35B performing a gun run into the ocean near the amphibious assault ship, emitting a familiar “brrrt” sound as the aircraft pulls up. “The F-35Bs are providing close-air support to Operation Octave Quartz [OOQ],” the video’s caption says, referring to the official name of the Somalia withdrawal operation. “The mission of OOQ is to relocate U.S. Department of Defense forces in Somalia to other East Africa operating locations while maintaining pressure on violent extremists and supporting partner forces.” The GPU-9/A is the only gun presently available for the F-35B, as well as the U.S. Navy’s F-35C variant , which is designed to operate from Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configured aircraft carriers. The pod contains a four-barrel 25mm GAU-22/A Gatling-type cannon with a rate of fire of around 3,300 rounds per minute, along with 220 rounds of ammunition, or enough for around four seconds to total firing time. The F-35A version of the Joint Strike Fighter, which the U.S. Air Force, among others, operates, has an internally-mounted GAU-22/A gun. Though designed to have as little impact on the radar signature of the F-35B and the F-35C, the gun pod does still make the aircraft less stealthy. It also imposes weight and drag penalties just like any other external store. As such, it is generally not installed when these jets must be at their stealthiest and most maneuverable. A US Marine Corps F-35B equipped with the GPU-9/A gun pod launches from the USS Makin Island off the coast of Somalia on Dec. 22., USN However, it’s not necessarily surprising that the 15th MEU’s F-35Bs are flying with them in the course of their current mission, given the nature of the threats U.S. forces in Somalia face from terrorist groups, including Al Shabaab, which is Al Qaeda’s franchise in the country, and an ISIS faction. Al Shabaab, in particular, does present a very real danger in the region, as was made painfully clear when the group carried out an unprecedented attack on an airfield that U.S. forces operate from in Kenya in January, killing three Americans and destroying six aircraft. At the same time, it has no aircraft of its own or major air defense systems, though these militants have employed shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), in the past. Instead, the group is primarily armed with a variety of light weapons and also employs light vehicles, motorbikes, and all-terrain vehicles, as well as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. Al Shabaab militants in Somalia., AP As such, an F-35B employing its gun pod could well be enough to help break up an attack on U.S. forces, as well as their local partners, in Somalia. The ability to focus the gun’s fire more narrowly on a small target might actually make it the optimal weapon, even compared to the relatively small 500-pound class precision-guided bombs the Marine jets can carry, if the enemy is situated close to friendly forces or innocent bystanders. The F-35Bs could also simply conduct show-of-force-type sorties , flying low and popping off flares , to help drive off attackers. This isn’t the first time that a Navy amphibious assault ship carrying F-35Bs has taken up station off Somalia and been prepared to support U.S. and partner forces in that country. In 2018, these stealth jets made their first-ever deployment to the Horn of Africa region aboard the Wasp class USS Essex and they were reportedly on call to provide close air support ashore, if necessary. At that time, the U.S. military also released pictures of the F-35Bs flying with their gun pods installed, though there were no reports that they conducted any strikes in Somalia while they were in the region. The Joint Strike Fighters aboard Essex during that cruise did go on to become the first Marine F-35Bs to conduct strike missions, but against targets in Afghanistan . A US Marine Corps F-35B equipped with a GPU-9/A gun pod flying somewhere off the Horn of Africa in 2018. , USAF Stealth fighters, such as the F-35B, may seem like overkill for strikes in Somalia or Afghanistan, but there will increasingly be no other option for Marines when it comes to conducting fixed-wing strike operations from Navy amphibious assault ships. The service plans to eventually retire all of its existing AV-8B Harrier jump jets with these short takeoff and vertical landing capable variants of the Joint Strike Fighter taking their place. Though the Marine Corps, together with the Navy, are beginning to explore new distributed warfare concepts , with less emphasis on traditional amphibious warfare ships , ARGs, and the MEUs they carry, will continue to be an important part of the two services’ forces posture. They are likely to continue patrolling around the world specifically in order to be better positioned to help respond to various kinds of contingencies, including ones in lower-threat environments such as Somalia, on relatively short notice. “The arrival of the ARG/MEU and its significant combat capability demonstrates our resolve to support our partners and protect our forces through this transition,” U.S. Air Force Major General Dagvin Anderson, the commander of the overall task force supporting Operation Octave Quartz, known as Joint Task Force Quartz (JTF-Q), and the head of Special Operations Command-Africa (SOCAFRICA), had said in a statement on Dec. 21. “This is a great example of how the United States can rapidly aggregate combat power to respond to emerging issues. We will look to leverage this inherent flexibility of the U.S. military in support of our future engagements in East Africa.” US Marine Corps F-35Bs prepare to land aboard the USS Makin Island as it sails in the Indian Ocean on Dec. 18. 2020. , USMC All told, what we’ve seen of the F-35Bs operating off the coast of Somalia, including being prepared to employ their gun pods, looks set to only become increasingly the norm for the service, even in lower-intensity conflict zones. With regards specifically to the current effort to withdraw the majority of U.S. forces from Somalia, the Pentagon has said that it expects that operation to wrap up by Jan. 15. Between now and then it remains to be seen if any Marine Joint Strike Fighters will employ their gun pods, or any other weapons, in anger in Somalia.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 17, 2022",Fighter Pilots Are Taking Full Advantage Of The Air Force’s Lifted Ban On Custom Helmet Art,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force pilots are creating incredible personalized artwork to adorn their flying helmets. Previous strict USAF rules regarding any changes to flying helmets have been relaxed as part of a push to improve morale in squadrons and empower the more junior ranks. The result is some stunning helmet wraps that are now appearing in increasing numbers throughout the Air Force. These helmet decals are often designed to represent an individual squadron or airframe and foster esprit de corps among the aircrews that wear them. Disgruntled officers approached then USAF Chief of Staff Gen Dave Goldfein in 2019 to seek his blessing to implement changes in regulations as part of the wider bid to help improve squadron culture and morale, thus helping to address a serious issue with retention. U.S. Naval aviators have traditionally customized their flying helmets with reflective tape, callsigns, and squadron emblems, but USAF aircrews have been prohibited from doing so in recent years due to specific Air Force Instructions, or AFIs. Helmet wraps include callsigns and must be in good taste., Nugget Wraps In fact, the only USAF aircrews officially allowed to apply any sort of artwork to their flying helmets were those assigned to the Air Force Demonstration Team, better known as The Thunderbirds, and from aggressor units , the latter of which were permitted to apply a small red star to their helmets. So, aircrews took their argument directly to General Goldfein, who was supportive. The official regulations would take time to change, however, the wheels were set in motion. Initially, personnel at Holloman and Eglin Air Force Bases started working with their Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in order to receive a waiver that would mean they could bypass the official regulations. It was seen as something of a rebellious movement initially, but an increasing number of MAJCOMs issued year-long waivers that allowed the practice to continue. In fact, over 20 squadrons are now thought to be actively engaged in applying helmet wraps. A-10C Thunderbolt II pilots at the 23rd Fighter Group at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, started using helmet wraps in early 2020 in a bid to “help increase morale and keep pilots, aircrew flight equipment specialists and crew chiefs connected to the rich history of the ‘Flying Tigers,’” according to a USAF news release . U.S. Navy aircrews have been customizing helmets for years., Jamie Hunter “There’s a lot of pride that goes along with it,” said Air Force Captain Jonathan Swift, the 23rd Operations Support Squadron (OSS) Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) flight commander. “We’re a part of the 23rd Fighter Group, a very historic unit within the Air Force. There’s a lot of heritage that comes with that. So there’s a strong connection between putting these wraps on the helmet and that heritage that we all share.” “These helmet wraps are emblematic of the pride we feel in who we are, what we do, how good our predecessors were and how well we continue to do our mission,” said Air Force Colonel Ryan Haden, the 23rd Fighter Group commander. Haden noticed a growing interest in helmet wraps around the Air Force and jumped at the opportunity to implement them for the 23rd. Captain Swift coordinated with a local graphics and commercial printing company to design, print and form the wraps to the HGU-55/P helmet . An A-10 pilot with a helmet wrap on his HGU-55/P that is fitted with a Scorpion helmet mounted sight., U.S. Air Force/A1C Hayden Legg The 494th Fighter Squadron , the “Mighty Black Panthers,” at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom was the first unit within the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) MAJCOM to start adding wraps to aircrew helmets. “There are a lot of rules and paperwork that you need to go through even though you have approval from top generals,” said an F-15E pilot from the unit, identified only as Captain “Rogue.” “I saw the whole story of the helmet wrap initiative and took it upon myself to start writing a waiver to send up the chain to the USAFE MAJCOM — we were the first USAFE squadron to try anything like this.” “Rogue” says the waiver hit roadblocks early on as some fellow officers in other departments simply weren’t aware of the initiative. “The irony was that while top generals had said yes, those in the units still had rules to follow and good reasons to say no. However, as we started to work through the details our Operations Support Squadron [OSS] commander, who essentially owns the Aircrew Flight Equipment [AFE] shop, agreed to the plans.” “The issue is that the fighter squadron doesn’t technically own our flight gear. We — the aircrew— don’t own our helmets. While they are custom fitted to us and you are pretty much tied to that helmet, it’s not technically yours. The biggest hurdle was making sure the proposed wraps didn’t somehow damage the helmet. In fact it’s quite the reverse, it actually helps to protect it.” “Once our OSS signed off the waiver, it went via our Operations Group commander and up to USAFE for approval. It’s great that the air force has agreed to trust us with this. There was a lot of back and forth on the actual details in the waiver, mainly the fine detail regarding which parts of the helmet can be covered by the wrap, and which parts cannot. Certain areas of the helmet are more prone to cracking, so they need to be available to be visually inspected. The wrap cannot go under the visor, and it can’t go onto the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System [ JHMCS ] part that is added to the standard HGU-55/P shell. Different MAJCOMs have different waivers, and this is an evolving project.” A 494th Fighter Squadron F-15E pilot wearing a helmet with a custom wrap., Jamie Hunter At Lakenheath, one of the biggest concerns was that the custom wraps might make aircrews more easily identifiable if they are deployed on combat operations. “That was well founded, but we mitigated the risk by only allowing the callsign at most — so it’s actually not that big of a deal.” The 494th Fighter Squadron approached commercial car wrap firms in the local area and eventually found a company that could look after the design and manufacturing process. After some tests and a lot of careful refinements of measurements the first helmet wrap was completed earlier this year. “We now have close to 20 custom flight helmets in the squadron,” explains “Rogue,” adding that some aircrews have been hesitant to follow the trend. “If we go on operations it’s down to the deployed wing commander to decide whether or not we can fly combat missions with the wrap. If they said no then we can easily peel them off.” So, what’s allowed and what isn’t? For the 494th, “Rogue” is the aptly designated approval authority. “We are going to remain very cautious, we don’t want to ruin the trust that has been put in us. Each squadron has their own guidance, and ours is that the design can be whatever the individual wants it to be, but it must be in good taste. The company puts together the design for us based on our sketch. The guys love it. We have a pilot in the squadron with the callsign “PInball.” Her helmet has an incredible chrome effect wrap. I just got my helmet done and it’s a Black Panther with a big claw rip effect.” While some squadrons are using local firms to wrap their helmets, Brad “Scooby” Hunt has started Nugget Wraps , a company specializing in a bespoke service. Hunt told The War Zone that his motivation was to help improve morale among fighter pilots. “I tried to find a local company to wrap a helmet, but they either said no or it turned out terrible. So, one weekend I decided to try to figure out how to do it for myself. I looked at how the Navy does it, and it’s actually not a single piece, they use adhesive strips. So I went to a car shop and got some red, white and blue vinyl, and wrapped my first flying helmet.” Some of the helmet designs from Nugget Wraps., Nugget Wraps “More guys saw what I’d done, so I started to develop the technique and it grew from there. It took a few weeks to figure out how pilots could do it for themselves, so I nailed down the process and now if they order from me they get a video and PDF instructions for how to apply the wrap. Someone message me with details like their callsign and a theme they might like, and I can put an idea together for them. Others have sketched out the entire design. I do a quick mock-up, they will have a few tweaks, and we roll from there.” The Nugget Wraps kit includes a base color of strips, and printed decals that are then applied — all in the type of hard-wearing vinyl that is used in car wraps or on commercial airliners. The do-it-yourself helmet kit can be mailed to the aircrews to apply themselves. Hunt says he is expanding into other areas and has just started doing vinyl printed A-10 ladder door art. By far the best A-10 door art I've ever seen. From: https://t.co/gqInZPb2qN pic.twitter.com/4BNom9l1vx — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) January 4, 2020 The helmet wrap phenomenon is gathering pace — and the feeling in the USAF pilot community is that this really is going to become a big thing. The initial one-year waiver that was granted by the MAJCOMs expired in October 2020, but this has now evolved into an indefinite waiver that will last until the official regulations catch up. The USAF’s F-15, F-16, F-22 , and A-10 squadrons, as well as a growing number of other air forces, are going all-out on helmet wraps. The craze has already expanded into bomber squadrons and other communities within the USAF are following suit. F-35A pilots are trying to get waivers, too, but their helmet is significantly different and doesn’t come under the same waiver as the HGU-55/P and JHMCS. It remains to be seen if the highly-expensive F-35 Gen III Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS) will be granted approval for similar eye-catching treatment, but word on the street is that it’s only a matter of time. Whether or not F-35 pilots are approved to adorn their noggins with similarly impressive wraps, it’s the latest craze for USAF fighter pilots, and looks set to grow and help perpetuate that feeling of camaraderie and squadron culture that the USAF has been working so hard to promote in recent years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 23, 2020",America’s East Africa Military Hub Sees Spike In Activity As Somalia Withdrawals Continue,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery examined by The War Zone shows a major surge in U.S. military aviation activity at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti as the Pentagon proceeds with the redeployment of the bulk of its forces out of neighboring Somalia . The U.S. Navy has also deployed an armada of ships off the Somali coast, including the supercarrier USS Nimitz and the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island , as well as the expeditionary sea base USS Hershel “Woody” Williams , to support this repositioning of American troops in East Africa. The image of the sprawling Camp Lemonnier complex that The War Zone reviewed came from Planet Labs and was taken on Dec. 21, 2020. There are no less than 13 C-130s visible at the base, a number of which are parked on a newer ramp at the eastern edge of the base that is typically used by forward-deployed fighter aircraft and transports making relatively short visits. A C-146A Wolfhound special operations transport plane is also on that portion of that tarmac, and another is in front of a hangar directly adjacent to it, though these are much more common sights. Three C-130J Hercules cargo aircraft sit on the tarmac at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti in April 2020., USAF It’s not clear kind of C-130s these might be, but standard cargo types, as well as HC-130 rescue versions , are known to be based at Camp Lemonnier. Some of the aircraft look like they could potentially be MC-130 special operations transports or AC-130 gunships , as well. U.S. Africa Command has publicly said that AC-130W Stinger IIs are supporting the withdrawal of forces out of Somalia. At least four V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors are also seen across the base. Some of these are U.S. Air Force CV-22s , a detachment of which are part of the U.S. special operations aviation element at Camp Lemonnier. CV-22s, as well as U.S. Marine Corps MV-22s , are known to be helping with the troop pullout and are otherwise common types at the base. Lastly, there is a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane parked on a ramp in the center portion of the base. With the steady retirement of that service’s P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, detachments of Poseidons continuously deploy to Camp Lemonnier instead. Camp Lemonnier base is America’s premier operational hub in Africa and also serves as an important node for U.S. military activities on the Arabian Peninsula , including in Yemen , on the other side of the Gulf of Aden. However, the total number of aircraft visible in the Dec. 21 satellite image is significantly larger than are generally seen there at any one time. An older satellite image from Google Earth dated October, 2020, shows just two aircraft on the tarmac at the eastern end, a C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft and a ubiquitous C-146A. Two C-130s, two P-8As, three V-22s, as well as Gulfstream executive transport and Beechcraft King Air turboprop, possibly one configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, are also visible elsewhere around the base. Another satellite image of Camp Lemonnier from October 2020, for comparison, showing far fewer aircraft across the base, overall., Google Earth This visible spike in activity at Camp Lemonnier comes nearly four weeks after the Pentagon first publicly announced plans to pull the bulk of U.S. forces out of Somalia. The U.S. military has not provided specific figures for how many American troops are in that country and how many of them are set to leave. As of November, there were reportedly between 650 and 800 U.S. military personnel in Somalia. In addition, the Pentagon has said that at least a portion of the personnel that are withdrawing from Somalia will remain in the region, but at facilities in other countries. This could include Camp Lemonnier, as well as other U.S. military facilities in the general geographical area , including in Kenya further to the South. This will “allow cross-border operations by both U.S. and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia,” according to an official press release on Dec. 4. The redeployments are presently scheduled to be completed by Jan. 15, 2021. For more than a decade now, the United States has been actively involved in the fight against Al Shabaab , Al Qaeda’s franchise in Somalia, and has more recently also found itself fighting a nascent ISIS faction in the country. The U.S. military, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency , has been deeply involved in the training of Somali government security forces, as well. The increased number of aircraft at Camp Lemonnier also comes just three days after U.S. Africa Command announced the establishment of Joint Task Force-Quartz (JTF-Q) to support these redeployments out of Somalia, a mission that is now known as Operation Octave Quartz. Special Operations Command-Africa’s (SOCAFRICA) headquarters is the lead entity within JTF-Q. US Air Force CV-22 Ospreys on the ground in Somalia in support of Operation Octave Quartz on Dec. 18, 2020., DOD “To be clear, the U.S. is not withdrawing or disengaging from East Africa. We remain committed to helping our African partners build a more secure future,” U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, the commander of AFRICOM, said in a statement regarding the standing up of JTF-Q on Dec. 19. “We also remain capable of striking Al-Shabaab at the time and place of our choosing—they should not test us.” “We will execute this mission swiftly, methodically, and with additional forces to protect both our partners and U.S. forces,” Air Force Major General Dagvin Anderson, the JTF-Q commander and head of SOCAFRICA, added. “[Our] Enemies should expect continued pressure and swift retribution if they choose to attack.” With this in mind, in addition to the increased presence at Camp Lemonnier, elements of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) are now parked off the coast of Somalia. The USS Nimitz has a full air wing embarked onboard, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters, capable of rushing to support operations ongoing ashore. A F/A-18E Super Hornet takes off from the USS Nimitz on Dec. 10., USN There are also the 2,500 Marines assigned to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) spread across the USS Makin Island , as well as the San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious ships USS San Diego and USS Somerset , which are also part of Makin Island ARG. The 15th MEU’s air component includes F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , as well as MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, CH-53E Super Stallion heavy-lift helicopters, AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters, UH-1Y Venom light utility helicopters, and RQ-21 Blackjack drones. It also has a ground component, elements of which could be ferried ashore, either on tilt-rotors and helicopters or Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercrafts, if necessary. US Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters come into land on board the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island ., USN Marines board an MV-22 Osprey on the USS Makin Island as it sails off the coast of Somalia. Other MV-22s, as well as US Navy MH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters, are visible parked to the right., USN US Marines board a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter during a quick reaction force exercise on the San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious warfare ship USS San Diego off the coast of Somalia., USN This is also the most significant operation that the expeditionary sea base USS Hershel “Woody” Williams has taken part in since it kicked off its first-ever operational deployment, primarily in support of AFRICOM , earlier this year. This ship provides an afloat platform to support various mission sets , especially in areas where they may be limited facilities ashore, such as Somalia, and this is definitely one of the types of operations the Navy had in mind when it decided to acquire these sea bases. You can read more about these ships in this past War Zone piece . The expeditionary sea base USS Hershel “Woody” Williams , with Ospreys on its flight deck, supporting Operation Octave Quartz., USN In addition, as already noted, AFRICOM has said that AC-130Ws from Air Force Special Operations Command are supporting Operation Octave Quartz. It’s almost certain that other assets are in position, or otherwise on call, both in the region and beyond , to help cover the troop movements out of Somalia, if necessary. Al Shabaab certainly remains a real threat, both inside Somalia and in neighboring countries. In January, the terrorist group launched an unprecedented attack on a military airfield in Kenya where U.S. forces, and private contractors supporting them, operate from, killing three Americans and destroying six aircraft. In 2019, the militants also hit a U.S. base at an airfield in Baledogle, Somalia, with a complex attack that included the use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, but did not succeed in killing any U.S. service members. This is to say nothing of the Al Shabaab’s repeated attacks on Somali government forces and innocent civilians in Somalia and Kenya . The last publicly announced U.S. military strike on Al Shabaab was on Dec. 10, when unspecified aircraft targeted some of the group’s explosives experts near the town of Jilib in the southern portion of the country. “The initial assessment indicates the strike killed terrorists who were known to play important roles in producing explosives for al-Shabaab, to include vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs),” according to an official press release . There has been criticism of the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Somalia, including from within that country , due to the continued threats posed by Al Shabaab and other groups. There are concerns about whether the shift in force posture will negatively impact training and other support for Somali units, especially the Danab Brigade , a commando unit that operates very closely with U.S. special operations forces and is widely seen as one of the most effective and reliable within the country’s military. No matter what, the uptick in activity at Camp Lemonnier, together with the massive naval deployment off Somalia’s coast, shows that the U.S. military is moving ahead very quickly to ensure these planned withdrawals from the country are complete within the coming weeks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 5, 2021",Early Christmas Present: Army Receives Potentially Revolutionary Unmanned Ground Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days before Christmas, the U.S. Army has taken delivery of two Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light unmanned ground vehicle prototypes, or RCV-Ls, ahead of schedule. American firm Pratt Miller, which is working on the RCV-L program with U.K.-headquartered defense contractor QinetiQ, released a picture of the vehicles sporting red bows just like you’d see in any holiday car commercial. The Army had announced that Pratt Miller and QinetiQ’s Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle (EMAV) was the winning RCV-L submission in January. The two companies were initially awarded a contract to deliver a total of four prototypes for further development and testing. The service’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) received the first example in November and the second one earlier this month. The RCV-L effort is one part of a broader Army push to acquire multiple tiers of unmanned vehicles , as well as aerial drones , to support various types of units. Pratt Miller and QinetiQ’s RCV-L design., Pratt Miller “We are proud to deliver the first Robotic Combat Vehicle to the U.S. Army,” Laurent Lannibois, QinetiQ’s RCV Program Manager, said in a statement in November. “This delivery will provide the Army with an unmanned vehicle ready for integration into ground combat operations.” “This is an important step forward for the RCV enterprise and, more importantly, for our Soldiers,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Ross Coffman, the director of the service’s Next Generation Combat Vehicles Cross Functional Team, added at the time. “We look forward to getting this prototype into the hands of our Soldiers and getting their feedback on how we can best utilize Robotic Combat Vehicles in defense of our great nation.” Pratt Miller and QinetiQ’s design is a small tracked vehicle that weighs in at around seven tons in its base configuration. The Army’s required the RCV-L contenders to be under 10 tons. The EMAV is a hybrid-electric design, which promises to offer better fuel economy over vehicles powered by more traditional engines, as well as a reduced acoustic signature when operating in the electric mode. Reducing fuel demands for Army units, in general, is an increasing area of interest for the service. The first RCV-L prototype delivered to the US Army in November., Pratt Miller It also uses so-called “rubber band tracks,” which are single-piece rubberized units. These offer a variety of benefits over typical tracks made of up individual metallic links, including improved all-terrain mobility, higher running speeds, and just being quieter while on the move. Pratt Miller says that the EMAV can reach speeds up to 30 miles per hour. As it stands now, the vehicle is capable of operating under the direct control of a human operator or in certain semi-autonomous modes, such as driving along a pre-planned route. The Army’s goal is to improve the semi-autonomous functionality of these vehicles as time goes on and potentially even add fully autonomous capabilities. The stated primary mission for the RCV-L is to be an unmanned reconnaissance vehicle, intended to scout ahead of Army units. The service also wants it to be “attritable,” meaning that it is low cost enough that it could be employed on riskier operations where there is an increased possibility that it could be destroyed, which would preclude the use of a higher-end platform. As such, the vehicle’s current standard configuration includes a version of the M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station II (CROWS II), which a soldier would operate. The M153 can be equipped with various kinds of weapons, including a .50 caliber M2 machine gun or a 40mm Mk 19 Mod 3 automatic grenade launcher. A subvariant, known as CROWS-J, adds in a Javelin anti-tank missile launcher . CROWS II also has electro-optical and infrared cameras, allowing it to function as a reconnaissance and surveillance system. However, from the very beginning, the EMAV was designed to be modular and it has a flat deck on top that can accommodate various payloads weighing up to 7,000 pounds in total. In demonstrations for the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps , Pratt Miller and QinetiQ have shown versions of the vehicle equipped with an electronically ‘tethered’ quad-copter-type drone, offering an elevated sensor platform, as well as launchers for rockets and smoke grenades . There has been discussion of adding electronic warfare and counter-drone systems, which could include directed energy weapons , to the RCV-Ls in the future, as well. An EMAV equipped with a tethered quad-copter-type drone system., Pratt Miller The RCV-L is one of three RCV types the Army is looking to acquire in the coming years. In January, the service also selected the M5 Ripsaw from Howe and Howe Technologies, a division of Textron, as the winner for the RCV-Medium (RCV-M) competition. The RCV-M is meant to be a larger, more capable, and more durable companion to the RCV-L. The M5, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , has the visual appearance of a miniature tank and its primary armament is a turreted 30mm automatic cannon. The Army has yet to pick a design to meet its requirements for the RCV-Heavy (RCV-H), which it envisions as a much more robust unmanned light tank with an overall weight of between 20 to 30 tons. The RCV-H would not be intended to be attritable to any degree and would have sufficiently heavy armament to directly take on enemy armored vehicles and other similarly serious threats. “The RCV-heavy is arguably the hardest problem to solve,” Army Major Cory Wallace, the Robotic Combat Vehicle Requirements Developer for the service’s Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team, told National Defense magazine earlier this year. “For example, if it’s going to be a decisive lethality wingman, it needs to be able to fight as well as a manned tank crew. So how do we make a turret that has the same kind of lethality on a platform that a tank has, but has an autoloader that can load rounds just as fast as a human tank crew?” A briefing slide showing the Army’s core requirements for the RCV family., US Army The RCV family is only one component of a broader push to integrated unmanned systems across the service. Last year, the Army selected General Dynamics Land Systems’ Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) as the winner of a competition to supply unmanned ground vehicles to support squad-level operations. Textron, which had submitted a design via Howe and Howe, subsequently protested that award, prompting the Army to scrap the contract with General Dynamics and reboot the competition entirely . “I think in 10 years much of the battlefield, if not all of the battlefield, will be comprised of RCV-type vehicles that allow the soldier to create that standoff and still maintain a sense of lethality but at reduced risk to them,” Mike Howe, Senior Vice President of Howe and Howe, said in an interview with National Defense earlier in the year. “It’s 100 percent the future of the U.S. Army as well as all the armed forces.” In 2019, the Army also announced plans to give various smaller units tiny Black Hornet nano drones , which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The service is also pushing ahead with expanding its larger unmanned aircraft capabilities, as well. The Army’s early Christmas gift of the last two RCV-L prototypes are just the latest example of how the service is steadily pushing further and further ahead toward its unmanned future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020","You Can Buy The Royal Air Force’s Impressive Sentinel Radar Planes, But Only In Pieces","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The axe has finally fallen on the United Kingdom’s unloved Sentinel R1 radar planes after the government announced plans to sell them. Any potential customers should be aware, however, that the five aircraft — which are based on the Bombardier Global Express business jet airframe — are only being offered in the form of spare parts. The aircraft, which are yet to be formally withdrawn, entered service in 2007 and began flying operationally over Afghanistan the following year. In the past, The War Zone looked in detail at the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) Sentinel R1, the capabilities of which suggested that it might have been possible to find a buyer interested in taking the aircraft as complete systems and putting them back into service. Instead, the aircraft will now be dismantled to harvest reusable parts. An RAF Sentinel R1 operating from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus during operations in the Middle East., Crown Copyright Sale of the Sentinels, together with a pair of E-3D Sentry AEW1 Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) aircraft, was announced recently on the U.K. government’s website, which provides the following notice : The Defence Equipment Sales Authority (DESA) is inviting expressions of interest from companies interested in being considered for receiving an Invitation to Tender (ITT) in respect of the proposed sale of the aircraft for stripping so to harvest all reusable parts for potential resale, recycling or disposal and final dismantling and removal of the remaining platforms. Note these aircraft are not for reuse. No dates for disposal are mentioned, but other sources suggested that the aircraft would begin to be broken down for spares beginning next year. As well as the five Sentinels themselves, the DESA is offering a “significant number of associated inventory spares and ground support equipment.” Meanwhile, the two Sentry aircraft comprise airframes that were put into storage at their base at RAF Waddington , Lincolnshire, last year, as part of the drawdown of the RAF’s airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) fleet. The RAF’s Sentry is being replaced by the E-7 Wedgetail AEW1 , while the Sentinel — which has seen operational service over Iraq, Libya, Mali, and Syria — will be retired without a direct replacement. The War Zone ’s Tyler Rogoway provided a summary of the impressive capabilities offered by the RAF Sentinel R1, back in 2017: These aircraft provide unique intelligence by keeping track of moving vehicles and taking highly detailed synthetic aperture radar “pictures” or “maps” of the battlefield. They can do this at standoff ranges and over huge swathes of the Earth’s surface. They have secondary overwater maritime surveillance and low and slow flying target tracking capabilities, as well. Their data can be used in real-time to inform and reposition ground forces, or to order attacks on enemy columns , or to divert tactical reconnaissance aircraft, such as MQ-9 drones or MC-12s , to take a closer look at a certain area using their electro-optical or tactical GMTI radar systems . The Sentinel’s “imagery” can also be used for planning future strikes, for bomb damage assessment, and for keeping track of the enemy’s pattern of life around key areas. In essence, it gives its warfighting “team” an unfair advantage over the enemy, and it can even do so through bad weather and smoke when optical and infrared sensors are left all but useless. An infographic of the RAF Sentinel R1 networking concept., Public Domain The fate of the Sentinel R1 has long been a subject of debate and the fleet was earmarked for permanent retirement as long ago as the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). The aircraft were originally to be disposed of in 2018, but the continued demand for their services saw that date pushed out to March 2021 as part of revised planning under the 2015 SDSR. However, at the same time, the operational fleet was reduced to four aircraft, with one Sentinel going into storage in May 2017. Having only entered service with the RAF in 2008, the Sentinel was still a relatively young platform. A comparison could be made to the age of the U.S. Air Force’s fleet of veteran E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control aircraft, which performs a broadly similar role to the Sentinel R1. However, the JSTARS jets were built around secondhand Boeing 707 airliner airframes that were far from new when they were introduced into U.S. Air Force service starting back in the early 1990s. Bearing in mind the potential years of useful service that the Sentinel could still provide, the decision to simply scrap these aircraft seems all the more bizarre. An RAF Sentinel R1 undergoing an engine test as part of routine maintenance at RAF Akrotiri., Crown Copyright As recently as last summer, a report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a U.K.-based defense and security think-tank, described the remaining four RAF Sentinels as “superb and relatively efficient aircraft which provide critical airborne intelligence-gathering services for joint commanders around the world.” That same report made the case for replacing the Sentinels with the AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) that could be mounted on the RAF’s fleet of P-8A Poseidon MRA1 maritime patrol aircraft, nine of which are on order, with first deliveries taking place earlier this year. The LSRS is already in service on a number of U.S. Navy P-8As . An RAF Sentinel R1 taking off from RAF Akrotiri., Crown Copyright Ultimately, operating such a small and bespoke fleet proved simply too expensive for the United Kingdom and the Sentinel was unable to escape the long-planned cuts. The War Zone argued in the past that the Sentinel R1 could provide the U.S. Air Force with a nearly off-the-shelf augmentation of the tired JSTARS fleet, but with that avenue now closed off, the best that could be hoped for is a supply of spares for the USAF the E-11 Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) fleet, which is also based on the Global Express airframe. It is noteworthy, perhaps, that the U.S. military snapped up the UK’s Harrier fleet , once those short takeoff and vertical landing jet fighters were withdrawn, to provide spares for the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B fleet. Now, with the jets set to fly their last sorties, those that operated the Sentinel — and those that benefited from the intelligence it gathered — may well wonder what could have been, had the fleet been sold intact.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Christmas is almost here. If you’ve got a child or collector in your life, you’ve no doubt already bought some of the season’s newest toys. Among the hot new selections this year are the many toy aircraft and vessels spun off from the highly-anticipated Top Gun: Maverick film now set to release on July 1, 2021. While the Matchbox Top Gun: Maverick toys largely center on existing aircraft that are featured in the film from the past and present of aviation, such as the P-51, F-16, F-35, and F/A-18 Super Hornet, there is one fictitious addition to the line-up: the “Darkstar.” The Darkstar is the secret hypersonic jet that Maverick takes on a test mission in the upcoming film, as seen in the trailers . Regardless of its recent release, the new Matchbox toy, seen later on in this piece, closely resembles many other famous “black jet” toys and models that have hit shelves over the last few decades. These toys, models, and the occasional video game, all depict an aircraft featuring an elongated, chined forward fuselage that extends back into a delta-like wing situated behind the fuselage’s midpoint, and usually features two inward-canted tail fins. The configuration is reminiscent of the SR-71 Blackbird , but only very loosely so. These toys and games also describe this mythical aircraft as being extremely fast, stealthy, and sometimes capable of spaceflight. One interpretation, coming from model maker Monogram, of the mythical F-19. , www.rare-planedetective.com Since toys and nostalgia go together so well at Christmas, mix up a cup of hot cocoa and join us for a look back at the most popular plastic and pixelated depictions of these fictitious phantom aircraft from the 1980s to today. Testors F-19 Stealth Fighter Model Kit (1986) In 1986, model maker Testors rolled out one of its most enduring and famous model kits, called the “F-19 Stealth Fighter.” The model, designed by John Andrews, was based on various accounts Andrews had collected from aircraft spotters, engineers, and pilots. Rare-PlaneDetective.Com To this day, the F-19 remains Testors’ highest-selling model, having sold over 1 million units. As it turns out, Andrews had likely based his design, at least partially, on bits of information about the F-117 that had trickled out into the public sphere. Worthpoint.com Monogram F-19 Stealth Fighter Model Kit (1987) After the success of Testors’ kit, one of its biggest competitors on the model market, Monogram, rushed to put out its own competing version of the “F-19 Stealth Fighter.” Unlike the preceding model, the Monogram stealth fighter featured highly prominent leading-edge canards and foldable wingtips. It also eschewed an all-black finish in favor of a two-tone grey scheme. Spruemeister Model Werkes Monogram’s model design appears to have largely been influenced by concept art by Northrop/Loral , who proposed designs early on for the Advanced Tactical Fighter program. That program would later lead to Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23 . None of Loral’s highly notional concept art appears to have led to anything other than some awesome toys and models. A notional Loral/Northrop ATF concept shown at an Air Force convention in Las Vegas in 1986., Hitechweb.Genezis.Eu Revell F-19 Stealth Fighter (1988) Not to be outdone by its main competitors, model maker Revell released its own “F-19 Stealth Fighter” in 1988. Revell’s design seemed to blend together aspects of the Monogram and Testors kits’ designs, featuring an all-black finish, rounded canards, prominent inward-canted tail fins, and downward-curving wings. ScaleMates.com F-19 Stealth Fighter on DOS (1988) The flight combat simulator games of the 1980s were their own special blend of horrible-yet-fun gameplay, pixelated graphics, and motion sickness. Games back then really knew how to punish a player. Amidst the “F-19” model madness, legendary game designer Sid Meier cranked out F-19 Stealth Fighter in the late ‘80s for the Commodore 64 and DOS, a game that put players in the cockpit of the mythical aircraft. The game was later re-released in 1991 under the title Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 . This new version allowed the player to choose between the F-117 or the fictional F-19. Air Diver on Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (1990) Like the DOS-based F-19 Stealth Fighter released a few years prior, the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console game Air Diver put the player at the controls of a high-speed, top-secret fighter similar to the many F-19 designs that came before it, although this version would be known as the “F-119.” This is likely because, by then, the F-117 was already disclosed. Seismic, Inc. The craft in Air Diver featured prominent canards similar to the Monogram F-19 model released in 1987 and mimicked the designs of other hypothetical F-19 models that came before it. In Air Diver , the game was played from the perspective of the aircraft’s cockpit and allowed the player to venture outside of the atmosphere to battle massive terrorist space cruisers in Earth’s orbit. Whisper from Transformers (1988) Sometimes written as “Visper,” Whisper was a Decepticon who first appeared in Marvel’s Transformers comic books. When not in robot form, Whisper could transform into a working “F-19” stealth jet with the same planform, canards, and inward canted twin tail fins as other depictions of the F-19. TFWiki.net Whisper would later reappear in the Transformers Trading Card Game in 2019 and the 2020 Netflix series Transformers: War for Cybertron . G.I. Joe Phantom X-19 (1988) Hasbro Toys released a G.I Joe version of the apocryphal F-19 the same year Whisper appeared in Transformers, another Hasbro property. G.I. Joe changed the aircraft’s designation, naming its version the “Phantom X-19 Stealth Fighter.” The craft was piloted by the character Ghostrider, real name Jonas S. Jeffries, who is described as being as invisible as his aircraft. YoJoe.com On the back of the Phantom X-19’s box, the aircraft is described as “the most secret and most lethal aircraft in existence today” and a multi-role fighter “able to penetrate enemy air-space at speeds over Mach 3.5.” YoJoe.com Hasbro’s G.I. Joe black jet came with an action figure of its pilot, “top-secret blueprints of an actual Phantom X-19” and two removable cruise missiles. Various Die Cast Models and Toys (1980s & 1990s) Aside from the many well-known “F-19” toys and models cranked out in the 1980s and 1990s by major toy makers, there were dozens of diecast F-19s made by lower-end manufacturers, such as Ertl or Micro Machines, looking to capitalize on the successes of Revell and Testors. Many of these cheaper diecasts were made for foreign markets, but can be found today on various toy collection or online auction sites. eBay.com Among the rather similar designs of these various diecast or battery-operated F-19 toys, the influence of the Testors and Monogram models can be clearly seen. Some of these “F-19” designs still pop up in generic diecast aircraft sets still sold today. Matchbox Sky Busters “Stealth Launch” (2011) While the Matchbox Sky Busters “Stealth Launch” diecast toy clearly owes some of its design elements to the Grumman X-29 , it’s also reminiscent of many of the Testor, Revell, and Monogram “F-19 Stealth Fighter” designs of the 1980s. Battlegrip.com The “Stealth Launch” features the same basic design as other “F-19” plastic depictions, but this more recent Matchbox version features a forward-swept wing configuration, more reminiscent of the X-29. Still, its “Stealth” name, twin tail fins, canards, and downward-curved wings harken back to the classic F-19 toys and models of the ‘80s. Matchbox Top Gun “Darkstar” (2020) The latest “black jet” to hit the toy market is the Matchbox ‘Darkstar” from the Top Gun: Maverick line of toys that debuted this year. While the release of the film was delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Matchbox forged ahead with their toy releases, clueing us in somewhat about the fictional aircraft Tom Cruise’s titular character can be seen flying in the film’s trailer. Brett Tingley The “Darkstar,” as Matchbox is calling it, appears to have some design elements in common with the renderings of the long-teased SR-72 hypersonic jet , which has been speculated to be the inspiration for the mysterious aircraft in the Top Gun: Maverick trailer. The aircraft in the film’s trailer has a more angular planform, while the Darkstar toy is more rounded in some areas, however. This could be a result of the toy’s production mold not being fully representative of the final onscreen model, or maybe the film’s renders will be more refined when the actual movie debuts. Still from the Top Gun: Maverick trailer., YouTube/Paramount Pictures Of course, this also could have been a design choice made by Matchbox in order to keep sharp corners away from young children. Whatever the case may be with this latest in a long line of fictional, but similar ‘black jet’ toys, the Matchbox Darkstar, like so many other toys, appears to owe at least a part of its design lineage to the Testor F-19 Stealth Fighter of 1986. Testor F-19 (1986), left, and Matchbox Darkstar (2020), right., Alan B. Ury/Brett Tingley While these toys, models, and games are merely fanciful misinterpretations of early advanced combat aircraft concepts, some of which surrounded the Air Force’s first stealth jet, similar designs have been used in the insignia of actual military units, like the Alabama Air National Guard’s 117th Intelligence Squadron. DOD A Department of Defense spokesperson stated in regards to the insignia that “an emblem is supposed to last for generations, therefore we do not depict anything mission-specific, because then the emblem would be mismatched or obsolete.” Just as in the toy world, the mythos and imagery of the mysterious “black jet” F-19 have became enshrined within the military itself. You can read all about this insignia and its lineage in this past piece of ours. The most detailed rendering of Loral’s proposed F-19 Specter stealth fighter. Apparently, the illustration was born from the artist’s mind, not from input from company engineers., Loral Ultimately, these toys should be viewed as just that: toys, meant to stimulate the childhood imagination. Who knows what little girl or boy will open up the Matchbox “Darkstar” this Christmas morning and be inspired to pursue a lifetime of aviation photography, aerospace engineering, or a career as a pilot or aircraft mechanic? Who knows how many countless others, like many of us here at The War Zone , were inspired by the black jet toys, model kits, and video games of the 1980s and 90s? So, with that in mind, it’s great to see Top Gun’s Darkstar carry on what has become something of a rich tradition.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 23, 2019",South Korea Scrambles Fighters To Intercept Russian And Chinese Bombers On Joint Maneuvers (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian and Chinese strategic bombers flew together today over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. According to Seoul, the bombers entered its air defense identification zone, prompting South Korean fighter jets to be scrambled in response. This is the second in what seems to be a planned series of Sino-Russian maneuvers that began last year and which The War Zone discussed in detail at the time. Once again, the area of sea between Japan, Russia, and the Korean Peninsula has become the scene of a potential flashpoint between these regional powers. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that today’s pre-planned drills were “the second joint air patrol in the Asia-Pacific region” by the Russian and Chinese air forces and released a video showing some of the aircraft involved. The footage showed both Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, Tu-95MS Bear-H , and People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) H-6K Badger bombers, as well as VKS Su-35S Flanker fighter escorts. The flight deck of a Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-95MS Bear-H during the exercise., Russian MOD/Screencap This seems to have been only a portion of the aircraft involved in the exercise, however, with South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) reporting that a total of 15 Russian and four Chinese military aircraft entered its air defense identification zone, known as the KADIZ, on December 22. Official Russian sources only mention the participation of two Tu-95MS and four H-6K bombers, examples of which are also seen in the Russian Ministry of Defense video, which you can watch here : The incursion led to the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) launching fighter jets, likely F-15Ks and/or F-16s , to intercept the intruders. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the Chinese aircraft were first to enter the KADIZ, followed by their Russian counterparts. Some accounts indicate that a VKS A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft was also involved, presumably to coordinate the maneuvers and monitor the ROKAF’s response. The ROKAF fighters undertook undisclosed “tactical measures,” according to Seoul. This could imply that warning shots were fired, as they were in the Sino-Russian maneuvers last year , and which would represent a serious escalation, but it could equally refer to anything from simply escorting the Russian and Chinese aircraft to launching infrared flares as a warning. The South Korean military also said that it had been expecting that the PLAAF aircraft, at least, would be conducting maneuvers in the region, after Beijing had informed Seoul of the planned “routine training.” According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, quoted by Reuters , the South Korean foreign ministry contacted Beijing and Moscow in the wake of the incident and “told them there should not be a recurrence.” The Russian Ministry of Defense put out an official statement relating to today’s flight, stating that “the aircraft of both countries [China and Russia] acted strictly in accordance with the provisions of international law. The airspace of foreign states was not violated.” “The joint patrolling was carried out with the aim of deepening and developing the Russian-Chinese relations of comprehensive partnership, further increasing the level of interaction between the armed forces of the two countries, improving their capabilities to conduct joint actions, as well as strengthening global strategic stability,” the Russian Ministry of Defense added. A Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-95MS Bear-H seen from the cockpit of an escorting Flanker fighter jet., Russian Ministry of Defense /Youtube Screencap The first of these Sino-Russian drills took place in the same region in July of last year and led to ROKAF jets reportedly firing warning shots when a Russian aircraft entered Korean airspace. At the time, South Korea said this was the first time a foreign aircraft to have violated its national airspace since the end of the Korean War. The July 2019 incident saw fighters scrambled by both South Korea and Japan, both countries accusing Russia and China of violating their airspace. Russia and China denied these claims, while Moscow argued that no shots had been fired at all and, instead, said that flares had been launched, which they then ignored because it was their view they were in international airspace. The ground crew prepares a Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-95MS Bear-H at its base., Russian Ministry of Defense /Youtube Screencap Back in 2019, it was anticipated that there would be more Sino-Russian aerial maneuvers over the Sea of Japan as those two countries seek to demonstrate their potential for military collaboration in the region. The Sea of Japan is the scene of different disputes relating to conflicting air defense identification zones, small islands, fishing rights, and even nomenclature. South Korea claims that the area of water should be known as the East Sea, rather than the politically contentious Sea of Japan. These same waters also contain the disputed islets known to South Korea as Dokdo, and to Japan as Takeshima, which are administrated by Seoul. It was around these small islands that a single Russian aircraft reportedly penetrated South Korean airspace in July 2019, although Russia denied this, saying its aircraft remained at least 15 miles from the islets. A Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S holding station off a bomber during today’s mission., Russian Ministry of Defense /Youtube Screencap There are also points of conflict in the air over the Sea of Japan, where Russia has said it doesn’t recognize South Korea’s KADIZ air defense identification zone. The latest incident comes as China continues to embark on regular aerial and naval activity in the Pacific region, demonstrating its increasing ability to project power beyond the mainland. In recent years, Russia has also increased its own routine, long-distance aerial patrols in the Pacific, including off the coast of the United States. Today’s mission should also be seen in the context of the expanding military-to-military ties between Russia and China . With that in mind, the joint air patrol reinforces the fact both Russia and China are increasingly willing to assert their respective authorities in the region as well as their ability to potentially challenge South Korean and Japanese claims to airspace and maritime zones. UPDATE: 3:55 PM EST The Japanese Ministry of Defense has now issued its own statement regarding the Sino-Russian bomber mission, saying that it scrambled unspecified fighter jets to intercept the aircraft. The official press release only mentioned the two Russian Tu-95s and the four Chinese H-6s. In addition to pictures of the bombers, a map was also included that shows the flight paths of these aircraft, indicating that one pair of H-6s effectively took over from the other around halfway through.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 14, 2021",The Saga Of This Long-Busted Submarine Is An Example Of How Sad Canada’s Tiny Sub Fleet Is,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Canadian Navy’s Victoria class diesel-electric submarine HMCS Corner Brook will be out of commission until at least next summer after a recent leak caused damage to the boat, which has already been undergoing maintenance for some six years. The plight of the Corner Brook in many ways reflects the at best disappointing service career of all four of the Victorias , which Canada first agreed to acquire second-hand from the United Kingdom more than two decades ago and that have spent far more time laid up than at sea. The Canadian Department of Defense confirmed the leak aboard Corner Brook , which is presently at Victoria Shipyards in British Columbia, on Dec. 21, 2020. The incident occurred during a test back in March by personnel from Babcock Canada, which has been under contract to support the Victoria class submarines since 2008. The Royal Canadian Navy’s Victoria class submarine HMCS Corner Brook ., USN “During the test, the normal procedure for draining the tank was not followed and a leak was subsequently discovered,” Jessica Lamirande, a spokesperson for the Canadian Department of Defense, told The Canadian Press . “The tank was immediately depressurized and further testing was put on hold pending an investigation,” Lamirande said in a separate statement to CTV News . “Babcock Canada Inc. conducted an internal investigation to determine the root causes of the incident, modified its procedural controls, and has since resumed tank pressure testing.” “HMCS Corner Brook sustained damage while undertaking testing as part of the vessel’s ongoing deep maintenance,” Babcock President Mike Whalley also told The Canadian Press . “We continue to work closely with the government of Canada to ensure the deep maintenance and refit of HMCS Corner Brook is completed in the safest manner possible.” As it stands now, the Corner Brook isn’t scheduled to return to service until at least June 2021. This is more than a year longer than the submarine’s overhaul, which began in 2014, was originally supposed to take. The boat had already been largely out of commission after hitting the seabed off in the Nootka Sound during an exercise off Vancouver Island in the Pacific Ocean in 2011. An official inquiry subsequently blamed the incident on human error and there were concerns that the accident might have damaged the submarine’s pressure hull beyond repair. In April 2019, a fire also broke out on Corner Brook as it continued to undergo maintenance at Victoria Shipyards, but it was thankfully extinguished quickly. HMCS Corner Brook sails past Fort Amherst while entering St. John’s Harbor in Newfoundland., via Wikimedia Unfortunately, as particularly hapless as Corner Brook is, the state of the other Royal Canadian Navy’s other three Victoria class boats, the only submarines presently in Canadian service, already woefully small number for a major navy, is not much better. Their entire history has been an outright saga. The U.K. Royal Navy had first commissioned all four of these boats between 1990 and 1993, but retired them in 1994 after it was decided that the service would shift to only operating nuclear-powered types . U.K. authorities had also tried, unsuccessfully, to sell them to Pakistan. The United Kingdom agreed to transfer the submarines, then known as the Upholder class, to Canada as part of a lease-to-buy plan in 1998. Under the deal, Canadian authorities would pay $427 million for the boats over eight years, at which point the U.K. government would officially sell them for exactly one British pound. The arrangement was also tied to a tangential agreement for the U.K. armed forces to retain access to various Canadian military bases. The first boat, the ex-HMS Unseen , subsequently renamed HMCS Victoria , was formally commissioned in the Royal Canadian Navy in 2000. The ex-HMS Unicorn and ex-HMS Ursula , which became the HMCS Windsor and HMCS Corner Brook , respectively, followed in 2003. The last boat, the ex-HMS Upholder , which would become the HMCS Chicoutimi , caught fire after seawater entered the conning tower while sailing from the United Kingdom to Canada in 2004. A Canadian sailor died and eight more suffered injuries in the accident. A heavy-lift vessel eventually brought the stricken submarine to Canada in 2005 and authorities in that country finally decided to repair it in 2009. Ultimately, it was not formally commissioned into Canadian Navy service until 2015. A picture of some of the fire damage inside HMCS Chicoutimi in 2004., Canadian Forces The HMCS Chicoutimi on the heavy lift vessel Tern in preparation for its movement to a shipyard for repair 2009., Hoggy 88 via Wikimedia The Canadian acquisition plan also included major overhauls and refits for all four boats, which had been in mothballs for years before the purchase, at the cost of an additional $98 million in total. In the process, the boats lost their ability to fire Harpoon anti-ship missiles from their six torpedo tubes, as well as their mine-laying capabilities. They did gain a new Lockheed Martin Librascope submarine fire-control system , enabling them to employ the U.S.-designed Mk 48 Mod 4 heavyweight torpedo. Those refits, as well as subsequent maintenance availabilities, have been beset by their own issues. A dent was found in Victoria ‘s hull in 2000, which prevented the submarine from actually entering service for three years. That same submarine also suffered “ catastrophic damage ” to its electrical system when Royal Canadian Navy personnel attempted to install a more modern generator in 2006. The HMCS Victoria ., USN There have been a host of other issues, including the discovery of dangerous sub-standard welds across all four boats , that plagued the class over the years. Victoria ultimately spent just 115 days at sea between 2000 and 2010. Corner Brook had only 81 days of sailing time between 2006 and 2008. By all accounts, all four Victoria class submarines have seen relatively limited use in the past two decades. To date, Chicoutimi holds the record for the longest cruise of any of these boats in Canadian service at 197 consecutive days , or around six months, a journey it completed in 2018. The next year, none of the Victoria class submarines made it out to sea , with all of them being in various stages of further maintenance. The plan had been to have all but the Corner Brook back in service again this year, but this was upended in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. In September, Victoria finally returned to the fleet , but at the time of writing it is still undergoing its post-maintenance shakedown. Windsor is presently scheduled to return to service early next year, but it’s unclear when work on Chicoutimi will be completed. The entire future of the Victoria class submarines is very much up in the air. HMCS Victoria is set to reach the end of its stated operational lifespan in 2022 and the other boats could follow soon after. Since 2017, the Canadian government has stated that it plans to conduct a major life-extension program for these submarines, but has not yet formally authorized it. The cost of that project, which would keep the boats sailing into the late 2030s or early 2040s, is estimated to be around two billion Canadian dollars, or around $1.5 billion at the present rate of exchange. “While chronologically 20 years older, they have not been operated extensively during that time,” one 2016 briefing on the then-proposed life-extension plan reportedly said . The suggestion here is that the fact that the Victoria class submarines have been pierside for decades, collectively, would make it easier to keep them in service beyond their original out-of-service date. At the same time, “while it is considered unrealistic to predict the material state of 40-year-old platforms, 20 years into the future, certain items such as the pressure hull and main motor will require additional monitoring and maintenance above the current regime, since unpredicted degradation in such areas may not be cost effective to repair and mitigate,” that same briefing warned. HMCS Windsor ., Canadian Forces Given the Victoria class’s history, so far, it’s not at all clear what kind of operational utility the boats really offer the Canadian Navy, no matter how easy or hard it may be to technically keep them in service for another two decades or so. The Canadian government has already spent more than a billion dollars in the past 20 years to keep them running at all. There have been, unsurprisingly, calls to pursue the acquisition of new submarines. All of this comes at a time when the Royal Canadian Navy is looking to modernize and improve its overall capabilities, both when operating independently and together with its allies and partners, especially fellow members of NATO. That Alliance is particularly attuned to an uptick in Russian submarine activity and the potential threats that poses, which has led to a renewed focus among its members on submarine and anti-submarine warfare. Canada also has national security interests in the Pacific, where Chinese naval capabilities, above and below the waves , are notably growing, as well as in the increasingly strategic Arctic region . Canada is already in the process of acquiring a new, highly capable class of guided-missile frigates that will significantly increase the country’s naval power projection capabilities, as we at The War Zone have previously discussed. However, submarines are unique valuable assets for any modern navy, presenting entirely different kinds of challenges for potential opponents compared to surface warships and also having inherent capabilities to act as discreet intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms . The Royal Canadian Navy definitely has a need for submarines, but attempting to keep the Victoria class operating in some fashion for years to come, after they have already spent most of the careers in various states of disrepair pierside, would seem to present increasingly diminishing returns.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 23, 2020","F-35s, F-16 Aggressors, KC-135 Tankers Put On Impressive “Elephant Walk” In Alaska","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the same day that the U.S. Air Force officially stood up a second squadron of F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, the station’s resident flying units conducted an impressive “Elephant Walk” to show off its ability to rapidly generate combat airpower. The base’s critical value, especially with regards to the Arctic, a region of growing strategic importance , is something The War Zone has discussed in considerable detail in this previous article . On December 18, no fewer than 18 F-35As, 12 F-16 Fighting Falcons , and two KC-135 Stratotankers arrived on the base’s flight line and prepared for takeoff, yielding the stunning photos seen in this piece. The Elephant Walk “tested the rapid readiness of every flying unit on Eielson AFB and displayed the airpower of the 354th Fighter Wing and the 168th Wing together,” the Air Force explained in an accompanying press release. The KC-135 aerial refueling tankers are assigned to the 168th Wing, Alaska Air National Guard. Exercises such as this demonstrate the ability of units to put large numbers of aircraft in the air quickly, just as they might be required to do during a major crisis.

These exercises also have special resonance at bases that are geographically closer to potential foes and flashpoints , which is the case at Eielson, located only around 110 miles south of the Arctic Circle. “The Elephant Walk isn’t only to practice our abilities to respond quickly,” said Air Force Colonel David Skalicky, 354th Operations Group commander. “This is to show our airmen who work behind the scenes what Eielson AFB is about, it’s about showing our strength in the Arctic arena. We are executing this despite Coronavirus, despite the extreme weather conditions, and despite [it being] one of the shortest days of the year.” “Every airman across the [354th] Fighter Wing contributed to today’s event, and we proved what our team is capable of supporting, defending, or delivering fifth-generation airpower and advanced training,” added Air Force Colonel David Berkland, the 354th’s commander. “Stay tuned, because our combat capability will continue to grow, and I’m incredibly proud of the disciplined, professional, combat-focused approach our team displayed today.” An F-16C assigned to the 18th Aggressor Squadron flies over Eielson on December 18, 2020. , U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt.

The buildup of the Alaskan stealth fighter fleet has been rapid following the arrival of the first pair of F-35As at the base in April 2020 . The installation has received huge funding over the past three years to create a massive secure enclave for its new stealthy inhabitants. Ultimately, plans call for a total of 54 F-35As to be based at Eielson. F-35As assigned to the 354th Fighter Wing taxi on the flight line at Eielson., U.S. Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2022",The Navy’s Wants To Go Back To Flying The C-130 Hercules As Its Next Doomsday Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it has determined that a modified C-130J-30 Hercules turboprop airlifter is the best available platform to provide airborne command and control support for America’s nuclear deterrent forces, including relaying orders to carry out a nuclear strike or even remotely initiating the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles from their silos. A fleet of E-6B Mercury jets, modified versions of the Boeing 707 airliner , that are commonly referred to as “doomsday planes,” presently fulfill this mission. It’s a role known as Take Charge and Move Out, or TACAMO. The E-6Bs had replaced an earlier EC-130Q aircraft just over 30 years ago. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) revealed the results of its so-called “analysis of alternatives” in a notice it issued on Dec. 18, 2020. That posting on the U.S. government’s official contracting website beta.SAM.gov also announced the service’s intent to acquire up to three C-130J-30s for TACAMO test purposes via a sole-source deal with Lockheed Martin, the aircraft’s manufacturer. A Navy EC-130Q TACAMO aircraft., USN “The Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) results indicated that the four-engine, militarized C-130J-30 is optimally configured aircraft for performing the TACAMO mission,” the contracting notice said. “The characteristics of this airframe also maximize the operational deployability of the assets to austere environments.” “The C-130 is currently extensively fielded within the Department of Defense, and deployed at various bases that create operation, training and logistics support synergies for TACAMO execution,” it continued. “Lockheed Martin already has an established domestic production line that has the ability to produce test units for PMA271 [NAVAIR’s Airborne Strategic Command, Control and Communications Program office] that will enable acceleration of the risk reduction and subsequent engineering and manufacturing development test program.” A US Navy E-6B Mercury aircraft, which presently performed the TACAMO mission., USAF The C-130J is the latest model in the famous Hercules family , a large number of variants of which certainly do remain in widespread service across the U.S. military. The Navy itself operates a relatively small fleet of older C-130T cargo planes, some of which have received eight-bladed NP2000 propellers and associated engine upgrades in recent years. There is also now the lone C-130J, nicknamed Fat Albert , assigned to the service’s Flight Demonstration Squadron, better known as the Blue Angels . The C-130J-30 is an extended length version of the standard C-130J that is 15 feet longer, overall. This increased “usable space (two more pallets of equipment) in the cargo compartment,” according to the Lockheed Martin website . A US Navy C-130T with the NP2000 propellers., USN A C-130J-30 of the California Air National Guard., Christopher McGreevy For a TACAMO-configured aircraft, this would provide important additional space for the extensive suite of secure communications equipment that the aircraft would need to carry out that mission, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . In addition, the added room would help with the installation of the extremely long Very Low Frequency (VLF) antenna necessary for communicating with submerged ballistic missile submarines. These VLF antennas are essentially lengthy wires – just over five miles long in the case of the E-6B – that trail behind the aircraft. The plane then flies in a series of tight circles, causing the line to spiral down toward the surface for optimal performance. You can read more about how all this works in this previous War Zone story . An annotated image showing an E-6B aircraft with a red arrow pointing to the drogue at the end of the aircraft’s VLF antenna, which is seen here in its stowed position., USAF TACAMO is an absolutely vital mission for ensuring the credibility of America’s nuclear deterrent. It is part of a larger command and control infrastructure designed to make sure the U.S. government can launch a massive nuclear retaliatory strike no matter what the circumstances, even in the event of a surprise attack. It’s perhaps not surprising on many levels that the Navy has determined that the C-130J-30 is the best available option for a new TACAMO aircraft. Since the first flight of the Hercules in 1954, the C-130 series has proven time and again to be an eminently adaptable platform. This has included various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance types , multiple command post variants , and psychological warfare platforms , as well as the U.S. Air Force’s famous AC-130 gunships . The spacious interior also makes it particularly well suited to the addition of roll-on/roll-off mission kits of various kinds, which you read more about in this War Zone piece . The Navy’s first four TACAMO aircraft, which entered service in 1963, were actually conversions of C-130 airlifters originally destined for the Air Force. The service had supplemented these EC-130Gs with an additional eight EC-130Q aircraft by the end of the decade. At that time, these aircraft were only intended to act as airborne command and control centers to support ballistic missile submarine operations. A US Navy EC-130Q TACAMO aircraft. The red-colored drogue at the end of the aircraft’s VLF antenna, which is in the stowed position, is visible at the rear of the plane., Alain Rioux via Wikimedia In 1989, the Navy began replacing the remaining EC-130Qs with the E-6A Mercury. The service subsequently upgraded those aircraft to E-6B standard, at which time they also assumed the role of providing aerial command and control support for the Air Force’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and nuclear-armed bomber forces. Until 1998, the Air Force has flown its own EC-135C Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) aircraft, also known by the nickname Looking Glass, in this role. It’s certainly worth pointing out that the E-6Bs, conversions of what were some of the last and most modern 707 airliners built, were larger and higher performance platforms than the EC-130Qs. The C-130J-30 is certainly a more capable aircraft than the C-130H on which the EC-130Q was based, but it won’t have the base speed and altitude capabilities of an airliner-sized multi-engine jet. Compared to the Mercuries, any TACAMO-configured C-130J-30 would not be able to get on station as quickly, or fly as high, limiting its ability to get above bad weather or establish a better line of sight for its communications systems. At the same time, as the Navy itself has noted, the C-130J-30 platform does immediately open up the ability to use a larger number of air bases, airports, and airfields, including austere ones that the E-6B cannot operate from. This could be very useful in a contingency scenario where an opponent may have destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable many well-established bases, as well as larger secondary dispersal sites, which include large commercial airports. Being able to fly from smaller, tertiary locations could help to ensure that the TACAMO mission continues without significant disruption under such circumstances. This is also true during peacetime as targeting the TACAMOs on the ground would be much harder if they could easily operate from and sit alert at a much larger number of airports. A C-130J-30 configured for the TACAMO mission would certainly have a mid-air refueling capability and the Hercules is already a platform that has demonstrated the ability to loiter over particular areas for long periods of time. Unlike the Boeing 707, the C-130J is still in production, as well, meaning that TACAMO aircraft based on this plane would be inherently easier to maintain and support logistically, and may also be easier to convert to this specialized configuration begin with. As time goes on, the J looks set to increasingly become the default base C-130 model across the U.S. military, as well. Compared to the long out of production 707-based E-6, support for the C-130J is already distributed across the U.S., and beyond. Training C-130J crews is even an easier proposition. All told, crafting a new TACAMO aircraft based on the C-130J-30 to replace existing E-6Bs would trade a certain amount of performance for being more flexible, adaptable, sustainable, and readily maintainable. The C-130J’s ability to loiter for long periods of time and the robustness of its airframe will also come in handy. It’s also interesting to note that the Air Force, in cooperation with the Navy, had explored the potential of acquiring a single aircraft, or at least a common base aircraft, to perform the missions of the E-6B, as well as the Boeing 747-based E-4B Nightwatch National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) and the Boeing 757-based C-32A Air Force Two executive transport aircraft. That program had been known as NEAT , a nested acronym combining NAOC, Executive Airlift, ABNCP, and TACAMO. The NEAT effort appears to have been shelved last year and the Air Force subsequently announced the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) program. SAOC is seeking a replacement only for the E-4Bs, rather than some sort of common plane that could also take over for the E-6B and the C-32A. It is still possible that this service could choose a smaller platform for the SAOC than the 747, which might also be a suitable C-32A replacement—the already militarized KC-46 seems would seem like a no-brainer—but a C-130 variant would not be sufficient in either of these roles. It’s not clear how committed the Navy is to a C-130J-30-based TACAMO aircraft, either. The service only expects to begin receiving the modified Hercules aircraft for testing between Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023. The E-6Bs are presently scheduled to fly until at least 2038. It’s certainly possible that the eventual TACAMO force could include a mixture of platforms. No matter what, it’s certainly interesting to see the Navy moving toward a TACAMO platform based on a C-130 variant just over three decades after retiring its EC-130Qs that served in a similar role.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 14, 2021",Message To Iran: Navy Sends Guided-Missile Submarine On Rare Trip Into The Persian Gulf (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has publicly announced the transit of USS Georgia , one of its four Ohio class guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, from the Gulf of Oman into the Persian Gulf by way of the highly strategic and often tense Strait of Hormuz . This is the first time one of these boats has sailed into that body of water in eight years. These four submarines are among the most in-demand across the service’s submarine fleets and Georgia ‘s rare appearance in the region would seem to be, at least in part, a signal aimed squarely at Iran and its regional proxies. Georgia passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 21, 2020, accompanied by two Ticonderoga class cruisers, USS Port Royal and USS Philippine Sea . This trio traveled into the Persian Gulf following the movement of the supercarrier USS Nimitz , and elements of its carrier strike group, further south in the Arabian Sea to support Operation Octave Quartz , the repositioning of the bulk of U.S. forces out of Somalia. USN The Ohio class SSGNs are best known for their ability to carry up to 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles . However, they typically only carry around 100 of these weapons – a still impressive amount – and are actually multi-mission platforms capable of carrying special operations forces and other highly specialized equipment, including various unmanned platforms , all while acting as discreet underwater intelligence fusion nodes and command centers. In the pictures of the boat heading into the Persian Gulf, a dry deck shelter , primarily for deploying special operators underwater , including in mini-submarines , is visible mounted behind Georgia’s sail. The SSGNs can carry up to two dry dock shelters at one time to support relatively special operations contingents that can be deployed aboard. You can read much more about these submarine’s unique genesis and capabilities in this previous War Zone feature. “USS Georgia (SSGN 729) is supporting routine maritime security operations in the region,” Navy Commander Rebecca Rebarich, a spokesperson for the U.S. 5th Fleet, which oversees the service’s operations in and around the Middle East, as well as in parts of the Indian Ocean, told The War Zone . “The U.S. Navy, alongside our partners, maintain a constant state of vigilance to ensure the critical waterways remain safe for the free flow of commerce.” “ Georgia ’s presence in the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations (AOO) demonstrates the U.S. Navy’s ability to sail and operate wherever international law allows,” an official news story also said. “As an inherently flexible maneuver force, capable of supporting routine and contingency operations, Georgia ’s presence demonstrates the United States’ commitment to regional partners and maritime security with a full spectrum of capabilities to remain ready to defend against any threat at any time.” Though the Navy has described Georgia ‘s activities as being in support of routine operations, it is still highly unusual that it would make light of this transit at all. Commander Rebarich told The War Zone that this is the first time the service has publicly announced the arrival of an Ohio class SSGN in the Persian Gulf since 2012, when the USS Florida sailed in via the Strait of Hormuz. USS Georgia had also previously made a public trip into that body of water in 2009. The Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Georgia sails together with the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Philippine Sea in the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 21., USN USN USN The service is typically very tight-lipped about releasing information about the movements of its submarines, in general, and is even more secretive about the more specialized boats it has in service. That Georgia made the transit through such a sensitive area on the surface, where it would draw more attention, but also be at greater risk , is noteworthy, as well. It’s also not clear how long Georgia was in the general area before heading into the Persian Gulf proper. In September, the submarine made a port visit to Diego Garcia , a British territory in the Indian Ocean that hosts major U.S. air and naval bases . The month before that, that boat stopped at Naval Station Rota in Spain, which sits on the Atlantic Ocean right at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea. Sailors stand on the rear of USS Georgia ‘s hull during the port visit to Diego Garcia in September 2020., USN Now that it is in the Persian Gulf, Georgia ‘s diverse capabilities give the Navy a powerful tool to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions along the Iranian coastline, as well as throughout the rest of the body of water, while remaining largely hidden from potential adversaries. This is extremely beneficial given the constrained nature of this body of water, which inherently presents greater risks for ships operating on the surface. Iranian forces, including shore-based anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles , small boat swarms , small submarines , and naval mines , among other capabilities , present very real threats to American and other warships in the region. Should a conflict arise, Georgia could engage a wide array of targets with Tomahawks, including ones deep inside Iran or those belonging to Iranian proxies, while remaining better protected below the waves. Basically, draw a 1,000 miles circle around the boat’s location and any suitable targets that lay inside of it are potentially within reach of its cruise missiles. The submarine could also launch special operations teams to conduct raids, gather intelligence , or conduct other missions ashore, as well. This would not be the first time an Ohio class SSGN has appeared in a region in the midst of increased geopolitical friction. In 2017, another one of these boats, the USS Michigan , stopped in South Korea’s port of Busan at a time when rhetoric, at least, between the United States and North Korea was quickly heating up. Georgia ‘s public arrival in the Persian Gulf comes amid a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as Tehran’s regional proxies. Just overnight , Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launched rockets at the sprawling Green Zone area in the country’s capital Baghdad, which contains the U.S. Embassy, as well as various Iraqi government buildings, killing at least one innocent bystander. Rocket attacks in Iraq targeting U.S. military and diplomatic personnel have been a regular occurrence for years . However, this latest strike on the Green Zone does come as there has been something of an uptick in such incidents after various Iranian-backed groups announced earlier this month that they were ending a truce they had previously declared with American forces. At least one group has now claimed multiple attacks on logistics convoys supporting elements of the U.S.-led coalition in the country. All of this followed the Pentagon’s announcement of plans to withdraw additional forces from Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, in November. “All those are factors that make it prudent to have a strong defensive posture right now in the region,” a military official told Politico earlier this month, but added that, while there were “troubling indicators of potential attack preparations” in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias, there were no clear “offensive” movements at that time. “There is no plan here [on the U.S. part] to act, there is a plan to portray a strong defensive posture that would give a potential adversary pause.” Friction between Washington and Tehran has also been heightened in recent weeks following the assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in November, which Iranian authorities have blamed on Israeli operatives . Just days before Fakhrizadeh, the Navy had sent the USS Nimitz and elements of its carrier strike group into the North Arabian Sea, on the other side of the Strait of Hormuz, ostensibly to be in a position to support the troop withdrawals from both Iraq and Afghanistan. As noted, that carrier is now operating off the coast of Somalia to support the withdrawals there. Since then, the Air Force has also sent B-52 bombers on two separate long-range round-trip sorties to the Middle East. Those were missions were also framed as strategic messages aimed at officials in Iran. A US Air Force B-52 bomber refuels somewhere over the Middle East during a non-stop, round-trip sortie from the United States earlier in December 2020., USAF Georgia ‘s appearance in the Persian Gulf also comes as the parties to the controversial multi-national deal over Iran’s nuclear program have declared that Tehran is now violating the most significant restrictions imposed by that agreement, including how much enriched uranium it can have and how pure that uranium can be. There have also been reports that Iran appears to be pursuing new nuclear-related construction , including of underground facilities that would be better protected from airstrikes or other attacks. Hard-line elements in Iran have been pushing for expanding uranium enrichment activities, which the United States and Israel fear could speed up the process of Iran building a nuclear bomb, should it choose to do so, for months now in response to the U.S. government’s “ maximum pressure ” campaign, which has included ever-more crippling sanctions. The incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden has expressed interest in returning to the Iran Deal, which President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from in 2018. As such, this posturing by Iran could also be an effort on part of the regime in Tehran to improve its negotiation position before the formal transition of power in January. All told, Georgia’s presence in the Persian Gulf is a clear signal to Tehran of the U.S. government’s willingness and ability to respond to any acts of aggression in the region and it also provides a valuable platform to monitor for potentially malign activity in the meantime. If a conflict were to erupt, the relatively unique submarine’s massive arsenal of land-attack cruise missiles would be called upon to rain destruction on Iranian air defenses and critical infrastructure during the very opening moments of such a conflict. UPDATE: 3:15 PM EST The U.S. Navy has declined to tell The War Zone whether or not USS Georgia had to transit the Strait of Hormuz on the surface, either due to the depth of the waterway or relevant laws and regulations. The depth of the Strait is variable, but is said to be around 90 meters , or 295 feet deep, on average. It is also heavily trafficked by commercial vessels, as well as warships, with approximately 20 percent of all the world’s oil exports passing through it each year.

Patrick Koepke,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021",An Eagle Named Opus: The Legend Of The Air Force’s Most Notorious F-15,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every fighter jet ever made comes with its own unique quirks and personality. The pilots that fly and airmen that maintain these aircraft know this all too well. But occasionally an aircraft will roll off the production line destined for unique notoriety and will continue to stand out from the rest—for better or worse. Enter F-15C tail number 80-0002—or just 0002 in USAF parlance—nicknamed “Opus.” Unlike ships of the Navy that generally enjoy a well-documented and public-facing service career, jets in the Air Force are much harder to keep track of. It makes it difficult as airmen move on from their tours of duty to keep up with their favorite aircraft. As a result, much of the history of Opus is shrouded in the folklore that comes from countless retellings of its stories and the verbal “you just had to be there” history surrounding it. Opus awaiting its next flight., Patrick Koepke I like to imagine that Opus rolled off the McDonnell Douglas production line in 1980 looking like Stephen King’s Christine: painted bright red and ready to rock. While the truth is much more pedestrian, it wouldn’t have been surprising given what the future would hold. During this time, the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing, later renamed the 36th Fighter Wing, stationed at Bitburg Air Base in Germany, began receiving F-15C/D models to replace their A/B models. Opus and many of her sisters were ferried over to Europe and distributed amongst the wing’s three resident fighter squadrons, the 525th, 22nd, and 53rd. They were immediately put to work for U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), but Opus was already primed to stand out. US National Archives The story goes that while being towed back to the hangar, the towbar broke and Opus rolled down a graded pathway and collided with a building. There does not seem to be a record of this incident on file anywhere. It was not found on the Class A/B/C Mishap reports from the era, but that may be due to the incident occurring over 35 years ago. What is known is that the brand new F-15 spent more than a year up on jack stands while the Air Force decided whether it was worth the investment to repair her. This is where the nickname Opus originated. The jet was named after the penguin in the Bloom County comic strip. This must have seemed fitting since a penguin is a bird that can’t fly. Eventually, the decision was made to get Opus airworthy again, which leads us to Elmendorf Air Force Base. By May of 1987, Bitburg was in the process of reshuffling its stable of Eagles and some of its aircraft were being moved to squadrons located at other bases around the globe. A number of these jets went to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany and Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska. Opus was assigned to the latter, joining the 54th Tactical Fighter Squadron of World War II fame. The next big incident with Opus made the national news and marked a dubious first for an F-15. On March 19th, 1990, a two-ship flight including the squadron commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harris, flying 1054, and Lieutenant Lynch flying Opus, took off for “the sites”—small forward operating bases in Western Alaska. A number of circumstances coincided where a live AIM-9M Sidewinder air-to-air missile sat on Opus’s right pylon (station 8 A or B), while a captive training AIM-9 had been loaded on the left side. It wasn’t out of the ordinary at the time to ferry a live missile to King Salmon or Galena. Elmendorf F-15s high over the Alaska wilderness. , U.S. National Archives The pilots spent a portion of the mission dogfighting and when Lynch got a tone from the sidewinder signifying it had locked onto Harris’s jet, he hit the pickle button to simulate firing the missile. Suddenly, the live AIM-9 jumped off the launcher and raced towards 1054. Lieutenant Colonel Harris was able to break and evade, but the missile still shredded the tail of his F-15 and damaged its engine. And so Opus became the first F-15 to have hit another F-15 with live ordnance. Both jets were able to return to base and the incident brought several changes to the T.O.s (Technical Orders) at the time. An emphasis on visual indicators on the missiles was also mandated, to differentiate “CAP 9s” from live missiles. 1054 was repaired and continued to serve as the ‘squadron jet.’ USAF Like many airmen whose careers take them to the flightline, I experienced some minor hazing when I first arrived. While on the flightline learning how to pull my first pylon, I was sent in to tell Support (the tool room) that we needed prop wash. I could hear the laughter all the way across Hangar 1’s expanse as I made my way back out to the flightline. But my experience pales in comparison to another airman whose tour of duty with the 54th Fighter Squadron preceded mine. As the story goes, he was told to report to Opus, which was going to be doing an engine run up test. He was instructed to don the “wash rack” gear, which included full-length waterproof coveralls, safety goggles, and thick gloves—gear usually meant to be worn while washing the aircraft. Waiting for the airman was a small six-foot ladder set up about five feet behind Opus’s jet engine exhaust nozzles. Following instructions, this airman climbed to the top of the ladder, facing the business end of Opus, under the pretense of “measuring the thrust.” Had he actually attempted it, he would have been blown several hundred feet down the flightline. A1C Koepke checks flight controls while the pilot cycles through each using the stick and rudders. Getting this wrong could cost the pilot his life., Patrick Koepke They say he stood up there on the ladder like a statue, even as the JFS (Jet Fuel Starter that spools up Engine 1) began to howl. The crew that was in on the joke had to shut down the JSF before the airman got hurt. He was either incredibly naive or was willing to risk life and limb to call their bluff. Opus notched another first in 1995, while the 54th Fighter Squadron (now under 3rd Wing’s command) was on a detachment to Luke Air Force Base outside of Phoenix, Arizona. Typically the Air Force ground crews you see on a flightline are made up of three primary maintenance flights within the squadron: Crew Chiefs who maintain, launch, and recover the aircraft, Weapons Troops who load ordnance and assist with launch and recovery, and Avionics Technicians who deal with the aircraft’s electronic systems. View from the left main gear, the B-Man is waiting for the signal to kick the chocks so Opus can taxi. A1C Koepke waits for the signal., Patrick Koepke The entire launch process was a choreography of motion and coordination that was a sight to behold. The Crew Chief was the A-Man, a role that inspected the aircraft (usually before and with the pilot), helped the pilot buckle in, walked through the pre-launch checklist with the pilot, and confirmed flight surface checks were nominal. From there, the A-Man stood in front of the jet ready to marshal the aircraft out of its parking spot. The Weapons Troops owned the B-Man’s job, which was to pull safety pins and kick the chocks on launch, and be ready with the halon bottle should a fire occur. This makes sense because many of the safety pins are inserted into the Eagle’s weapons systems. Patrick Koepke I always wanted the A-Man role. I didn’t mind kicking chocks, but was envious of the Crew Chiefs. I somehow convinced my Flight Chief to let me get A-Man qualified, and spent some time prior to the trip to Luke training with Opus’s DCC (Dedicated Crew Chief). One early morning at Luke, the Quality Assurance team watched me launch Opus and declared me A-Man qualified. I remember being pretty nervous, especially during the flight control check, and remember telling the pilot “good hunting” as I disconnected the cable and moved to the front of the jet. To my knowledge, I was the first Weapons Troop member that got A-Man qualified from Elmendorf and it was fitting that Opus was the one being launched. A-Man qualifying in progress as A1C Koepke talks to Capt. Russell, the pilot of Opus just prior to launch., Patrick Koepke Opus was a different kind of aircraft. The life of a Crew Chief is such that you stayed on a broken aircraft until it was fixed. That meant many late nights under the hangar lights with every engine panel opened and every tool and diagnostic tool utilized. I remember Opus’s DCC often staying behind trying to chase an elusive “red X” (a serious problem impacting flying status) while nearly everyone else ended their shift and went home. As a Weapons Troop, I didn’t take part in this recurring “tradition,” other than occasionally helping pull panels on the aircraft when time permitted. We all had our nicknames for planes that were troublesome. “Pig.” “Hog.” “Hangar Queen.” One jet was broken down so long in Hangar 1 that someone taped a picture of an ear of corn to the nose cone. In Opus’s case, she was never out of commission long, but no repair was easy and no solution clear cut. Her reputation was as a high-visibility melodrama at all times. Maintaining an Eagle is a huge endeavor, but not all F-15s are alike when it comes to how much tender loving care they need to keep in the air., U.S. National Archives The next “first” involved a nose art initiative, this time in 1996. In talking with Opus’s DCC, we cooked up an idea to paint the Bloom County penguin character on Opus. At the time the Air Force was pretty strict regarding nose art and/or individualizing the aircraft, though they have lightened up a bit since then. As a result, we had the idea to conceal the artwork on the underside of the air brake, which is a huge panel that extends from the upper fuselage of the jet when the pilot wants to slow down fast. So, it wouldn’t be visible under normal circumstances. I wrote a proposal to the 3rd Wing’s Commander explaining how nose art fostered squadron unity and identity, and helped both the pilots and maintenance troops feel pride in their aircraft. I was expecting it to be rejected, but it was not only approved, but it was given the ‘wing king’s’ full support. This meant we could involve the Paint Shop—the hangar and airmen that paint the jets—in our ideas and they would make it happen. They helped make vinyl-like images that were applied with soap and water and were designed so they could withstand the weather. It made sense for Opus to carry the first artwork, which ended up being the character Opus with thumbs in its ears and its tongue sticking out. It was a way to “give the bird” to your opponent in a dogfight. Opus’s namesake cartoon mascot art lives beneath its ‘board.’, Patrick Koepke Other jets in the wing started being seen taxiing to EOR with artwork on the backside of their air brakes, and it was fun to see what others were coming up with. I don’t know how long the artwork stayed on the jets at Elmendorf. I out-processed near the end of 1997, but they were there when I left. The author with Opus doing the Opus., Patrick Koepke A few years after I left Alaska I heard the older F-15C/D aircraft (built between ‘78-82) were replaced with newer models (I believe ‘84-87). This sent Opus to Nellis Air Force Base, where she joined the 65th Aggressor Squadron. When the 65th was inactivated in 2014, Opus landed with the 159th Fighter Wing, flying for the 122nd Fighter Squadron. As of the time of writing this story, Opus is still flying high down in Belle Chasse for the Louisiana Air National Guard. In talking to a few maintenance members from the 159th, Opus took part in the F-15 Persistent Air Dominance Enabler test , which meant she was fitted with Conformal Fuel Tanks and used in the Boeing program. It is safe to say any maintenance issues Opus may have had up in Alaska seem to have cleared up. One crew chief called Opus a “code 1 machine”—code 1 meaning an aircraft with no broken systems and is fully mission capable before a flight. Opus wearing the “Persistent Air Dominance” Conformal Fuel Tanks and special missile rails during the Boeing test in 2018. The aircraft was and remains assigned to the “Bayou Militia.”, Jody Fisher Jody Fisher No doubt the pilots and maintenance troops in Louisiana have their own Opus stories to tell. No one person can claim sole ownership over the rich folklore surrounding Opus. This article only scratches the surface. It’s a safe bet nearly every pilot and maintenance crew that worked around 0002 has their own stories. One thing is certain, out of the 1,500 F-15s built over the years, Opus truly is one of a kind, and belongs to every pilot that has flown her and airman that have maintained her. Patrick Koepke Patrick Koepke served as a 462/2W1 “Load Toad” in the mid-’90s with the 54th FS “Fighting Leopards” at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of the country’s ever-increasing focus on the Arctic region , Russia has launched a new Arctic research vessel, named the North Pole . The Project 00903 ship is described as an “ice-resistant self-propelled platform” and is intended to drift through the waters of the frozen north, conducting geological, sonar, geophysical, and oceanographic surveys. It is also far from pretty. The vessel’s distinctly egg-shaped hull, constructed from special high-durability steel, stems from its requirement to deal with light ice, being propelled along at a speed of around 10 knots. This ship is not an icebreaker , however, and its reinforced hull is designed to be better able to shrug off ice rather than plow through it. Instead, its overall design has been optimized for endurance and autonomy. TASS The Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, which is part of Russia’s United Shipbuilding Corporation, launched the North Pole on December 18, almost exactly two years after construction began . The vessel has been built for the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, better known as Roshydromet, at a reported cost of $100 million. It is being run as a joint project between Roshydromet and Russia’s Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute . Measuring 276 feet long by 74 feet wide, and with a displacement of 10,225 tons, the North Pole is intended to be the first vessel of its kind to be permanently based in the high Arctic. TASS Previously, Russia, and before that the Soviet Union, made use of drifting ice stations for supporting Arctic research teams. These were built on naturally occurring ice packs or glacier fragments. Beginning in 1937, a total of 40 expeditions had been run, normally in the months of September to October. One of these ice stations provided the U.S. intelligence community with a rare windfall when, in May 1962, under Project Coldfeet , they investigated an abandoned Soviet research station high in the Arctic. However, the effects of global climate change since the early 2000s means that these kinds of stations are no longer a practical proposition since solid ice is increasingly hard to find. The last Russian ice station to serve for any length of time was North Pole-40 , established in October 2012, but this had to be evacuated in May 2013 when its ice floe began to break up. The scientists were eventually rescued by a nuclear-powered icebreaker. A follow-up attempt to set up an ice station in 2015 was abandoned after only four months. So, now Russia has turned to the “ice-resistant self-propelled platform,” or Project 00903, which will be able to venture into the Arctic region under its own power, or with the help of an icebreaker, before beginning its “autonomous” mission. In this case, the autonomy refers to being able to operate independently of resupply for extended periods of time, enabling researchers to study the Arctic region for up to two years at a time, without having to dock in port. TASS Since it will be underway for such long periods, the North Pole will be supplied either by passing icebreakers, or by air, and there’s provision for a permanently embarked Mi-8 helicopter. This will be a Mi-8AMTSh-VA version that has been specially tailored for operations in the Arctic environment. In the future, the ship’s helipad could also support variants of the Mi-38 and, perhaps, even more advanced rotary-wing aircraft . A computer-generated image of the North Pole underway, with a Mi-8 helicopter above the helipad., Roshydromet When construction work on the new ship began, the Barents Observer quoted Natalia Radkova, Deputy Director of Roshydromet, describing the North Pole as “a unique, comfortable and reliable drifting station that undoubtedly will open a new page in our national polar history.” While the North Pole will be operated as a scientific research vessel, its strategic relevance is clear. The same retreating ice caps that have made the previous ice stations impractical are opening up new sources of energy wealth in the region, which is fast becoming a new focus of great power rivalry . There are certain potential military applications to the kind of research the North Pole will supposedly be doing, too. Underwater surveys of the Arctic region, for example, could help provide valuable information in support of increased Russian Navy activities, both above and below the water . Russia, and for its part, the U.S. Navy, is also engaged in developing a system to support enhanced monitoring of environmental changes in the Arctic , officially for scientific purposes. The new Arctic research vessel will very likely help Russia extract more oil and gas from under the Arctic Sea or from previously ice-bound islands, which will have its own geostrategic implications. Already, the Russian military is busily increasing its capabilities in the region — including forward operating locations — to potentially defend thousands of miles of coastline from the sea, land, and air. Moscow’s exclusive economic zone in the Arctic provides oil, gas, and fishing rights, and these, too, will be both exploited and defended , especially as Russian claims are increasingly disputed by Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United States. Beyond its proposed mission set, Russia has basically built a very long-endurance multi-purpose floating platform that can survive the unique environmental challenges of the Arctic. So, the idea that the type could potentially have more extensive military applications sometime in the future is valid. In that regard, the North Pole could eventually help support the activities of a growing fleet of Arctic-oriented Russian vessels, ranging from the world’s largest and most powerful icebreaker to the Project 23550 Ice class patrol ships, which are essentially polar corvettes. The Arctic is clearly assuming ever greater importance to Moscow and it looks like the North Pole research vessel could play an important role in this new dynamic.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on May 18, 2020",Why The Navy Is Looking To End Carrier Qualifications Entirely For Its Pilots In Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking at ways that a new jet trainer aircraft could help the service to completely overhaul the way it trains its aviators. The planned successor to the current Boeing T-45 Goshawk could be employed across a number of roles in naval aviation — not just training brand new pilots. But above all else, top Navy officers are looking at how the aircraft could facilitate a totally new approach to the way it trains tactical jet pilots. Speaking in November, Rear Admiral Gregory “Hyfi” Harris, the Director of the Air Warfare Division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, said the service is talking to industry regarding the potential for a new training aircraft to grow into a multi-role platform as a future adversary, and potentially as a surrogate training aircraft — a move designed to reduce flight hours on expensive-to-operate front line fleet fighter aircraft. Separately, The War Zone understands that the same aircraft could also herald more even significant changes to the Navy’s training pipeline than were previously known . In fact, the advent of the new trainer could result in Naval Aviators tackling their very first flight to the aircraft carrier in a front line strike fighter, after they have already earned their coveted ‘ wings of gold .’ An F/A-18F from Fleet Replacement Squadron VFA-106 undertakes carrier qualifications., U.S. Navy/CPO RJ Stratchko While this sounds like a ludicrous break in deeply established and proven methodology that would outrage naval aviators old and new, based on our investigation, this isn’t entirely the case. New technologies and a number of other factors have made such a proposed change not just possible, but probable. Still, there is bound to be major controversy surrounding such a move, especially considering the deeply ingrained aviator-focused culture within the Navy’s air arm. A new training aircraft In May 2020, the Navy launched its Undergraduate Jet Training System (UJTS) effort, which is ultimately intended to acquire a replacement for the T-45C Goshawk that is currently used in the advanced pilot training role, including the demanding regime of carrier flight operations instruction. A request for information (RFI) was released to industry on May 14, with a view to acquiring a non-developmental, land-based jet trainer by 2028. The RFI said that rather than being able to land and take-off from the carrier like the current Goshawk and its predecessors, such as the TA-4J Skyhawk, the new trainer would be limited to conducting Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) and shipboard touch-and-go landings. You can read more about the training aircraft program RFI in this past War Zone piece . However, the program is already evolving and The War Zone understands that the Navy is no longer even pursuing the touch-and-go requirement. In fact, it is understood that the Navy is evaluating the potential implementation of one of the most dramatic changes ever in the way it trains new pilots in the complex art of big deck carrier operations with their associated arresting gear and catapults . Recent advances in technology mean that the Navy’s whole approach to operations from the aircraft carrier could be changing like never before. A T-45C Goshawk is prepared to launch, while another performs a touch-and-go aboard an aircraft carrier., U.S. Navy/PO2C Joseph Montemarano A new approach Until now, U.S. Naval Aviators have been required to fly manual approaches to aircraft carriers, requiring uncompromising levels of skill and competence, with little margin for error. This requires skilled throttle and control column inputs to nurse an aircraft down onto the deck with precision in order to catch one of the arresting wires. However, the advent of new flight control software has almost done away with the need to wrestle an unforgiving carrier-borne aircraft onto a narrow flight deck. So-called Delta Flight Path (DFP) technology was conceived to help make the F-35C Lightning II far easier to land on an aircraft carrier, even with a pitching and rolling deck. It led to a spin-off program for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler that is known as Magic Carpet, or PLM — Precision Landing Mode. This too features enhanced flight control logic that is designed to make the carrier landing easier and more predictable for the pilot. An F/A-18E from VFA-143 about to touch down on an aircraft carrier., U.S. Navy/MCS2C Kallysta Castillo In the case of the Super Hornet, PLM is a mode within the autopilot to enable a much smoother profile on the glideslope, all the way to touchdown. From a piloting perspective, it means a dramatic reduction in control inputs. The resulting effect is a lot more “passes” (successful arrested landings) that are safe and consistent. Data shows that the boarding rate across air wings has gone up significantly since PLM was introduced. As a result, pure manual flying around the carrier has become far less frequent for strike fighter aviators. This technology works by Super Hornet and Growler pilots engaging PLM as an autopilot mode and they then fly to a ship-referenced velocity-vector that is projected on the heads-up display (HUD) in the cockpit. A different command logic is also activated within the aircraft’s flight control system, which is translated to the aircraft’s control surfaces. In effect, the Super Hornet or Growler gains direct lift control via modulating its flaps, which can fine-tune the decent onto the carrier’s landing area. When using the system, the pilots still reference the traditional “Ball” on the carrier deck, and use stick inputs to make sure the aircraft is centered, but the jet will fly to the point on the deck where the velocity-vector is pointed, with the ship-referenced PLM accounting for wind, the fact that the ship is moving, and other factors. Studies showed that Super Hornet pilots who were flying manually made as many as 300 course corrections in the final 18 seconds of their landing approach to the carrier. With Magic Carpet, even new pilots with no experience had cut that down to around 20 corrections. In addition to the new flight control software, Navy aircraft can make use of the Instrument Carrier Landing System (ICLS) and the Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) to aid safe recoveries, especially in inclement weather. ACLS uses a dedicated radar on the carrier to provide course correction information, but it reportedly lacks the precision necessary to work by itself in all situations. Indeed, many ACLS-assisted recoveries see the pilot still needing to take control and make the final adjustments before landing. The replacement Joint Precision Approach and Landing Systems (JPALS) uses GPS-enabled position information, and it was first delivered to an operational ship in April 2020. You can read more about these systems in this previous War Zone piece . A pilot in the cockpit of an F/A-18E., Jamie Hunter A revolution in carrier aviation The addition of this automation has revolutionized the way in which the Navy’s modern strike fighters operate from the carrier deck. The resulting effect is that training pilots in the fine art of cat-and-trap carrier operations, and re-certifying fleet pilots during carrier qualifications (CQ), is able to be dramatically simplified with the use of technology. The Navy’s two Super Hornet Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS) are already carrier qualifying (CQing) new pilots coming to the “Rhino” using PLM, without the need for them to fly manual passes. It marks a seismic change in the overall approach to the training of both new and experienced pilots around the “boat.” It also means that the Navy will no longer place such high emphasis on ingraining the style of manual flying throughout carrier pilot training. New Naval Aviators destined for carrier operations currently begin their training journey in the T-6 Texan II , before moving to the T-45 Goshawk. It is in this aircraft that they will, from day one, fly in a way that prepares them for carrier ops — their ultimate goal. Currently, new pilots who are destined for carrier-borne types are required to fly a series of FCLPs at the culmination of nearly every training mission. This involves them using a marked out carrier deck on the airfield’s runway and flying a circuit pattern and descent rate and speed that is consistent with how it would be flown for real at the boat. This is designed as part of the building block process towards their initial carrier qualifications in the T-45. This approach to training makes for a prolonged course due to the emphasis on carrier-minded flying from the outset — Goshawk students rarely fly a standard straight-in approach. T-45s conduct training aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower ., U.S. Navy/MC3 Jameson Lynch Notably, the Goshawk is regarded as being the current inventory’s most challenging jet to fly behind the carrier. This is now even more pronounced due to the new landing aids in the Super Hornet, Growler, and Lightning II, a luxury the T-45 does not possess. Based on the land-based British Aerospace Hawk jet trainer, the T-45, which was introduced in 1991, was never conceived with the requisite handling characteristics to make carrier approaches easier for the pilot, unlike bespoke carrier aircraft such as the Super Hornet. The T-45 is described by aviators as being underpowered and twitchy during the final approach to the deck — though this certainly helps forge skilled hands. The advent of technology such as PLM is guiding the Navy towards one of its biggest potential changes in the way it trains new pilots. It is evaluating whether to completely remove carrier qualifications from the advanced pilot training syllabus, and would therefore not require any carrier flying from its follow-on UJTS training aircraft. Strike fighter pilots could instead get their first taste of carrier flying once at their respective Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS). The pilot of an F/A-18E of training squadron VFA-122 about to launch from an aircraft carrier., U.S. Navy/Airman D.J. Schwartz This is partly driven by the need to reduce training timelines and increase pilot production. The Navy is woefully short of pilots and, as a happy coincidence, it is now able to safely embrace new technology to enable it to simplify training for its new carrier aviators. A new training aircraft that goes hand-in-hand with the greatly increased use of high fidelity flight simulators, combined with front-line strike fighter aircraft that are now far less challenging to land on the carrier, are set to serve as a catalyst that allows the Navy to transform long-held training procedures. Removing the carrier qualification element from the advanced jet training phase — not even touch-and-go landings — would also eliminate the need to heavily modify the UJTS aircraft to be carrier-capable, allowing for the procurement of a more straightforward off-the-shelf solution. Indeed, the advanced technology embedded in modern jet training aircraft will likely present a far more rounded solution to training new carrier pilots that makes significant use of simulators. The flight control software in the new trainer could even include a system that is similar to DFP or PLM, presenting a much more intuitive transition for pilots between the training squadron and the FRS. In the past, new carrier aviators would not receive their coveted ‘wings of gold’ until they had completed carrier qualifications aboard an aircraft carrier in the T-45. However, the Navy could decide that new aviators receive their wings before they have ever flown from the ship. For EA-18G, F/A-18E/F, and F-35C pilots, their first taste of carrier flying would now come in the cockpits of their selected front line type. Not only will this reduce training timelines, but it will also massively reduce the burden on the already over-tasked aircraft carriers — with zero requirements for them to sail especially in order to support CNATRA (Chief of Naval Air Training) activities. The Navy no longer enjoys the luxury of having a dedicated training carrier and must request the use of operational fleet ships when they are available. The number of carriers in the fleet in total could also be further reduced in the coming years , making such a constant burden all that much more of a challenge to handle. A Landing Signals Officer (LSO) monitors FCLPs at NAS Lemoore., Jamie Hunter Air wing changes reflected in training plans In its RFI for the new trainer, the Navy said each UJTS aircraft would be required to fly 400 hours each year. The jets would conduct around 1,200 FCLP landings using simulated carrier decks ashore, as well as up to 45 touch-and-gos on actual carriers, annually. This model would be dramatically reduced if the new approach is adopted. In fact, such is the need for change, the Navy is said to be already evaluating removing CQ from its current T-45 syllabus. This also reflects a slightly reduced demand for complex cat-and-trap training due to the changing composition of the carrier air wing (CVW). The C-2 Greyhound Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft is being replaced by the CMV-22 Osprey — meaning one less type to include in this style of training. The Osprey lands on a carrier like a helicopter, versus the Greyhound, which relies on the arresting gear to land and the catapult to launch. Training new E-2 Hawkeye pilots presents a challenge to the Navy as these aircraft are required to be manually flown around the carrier, with no technology akin to PLM. New E-2 pilots are initially trained in the T-45, and while this provides carrier operations familiarity, there is little actual handling crossover in flying a T-45 around the ship and flying an E-2. New Hawkeye pilots have the luxury of a safety pilot/instructor sitting alongside them when they learn the ropes, and it is expected that this portion of training would be increased if the Goshawk course no longer includes CQ. So, in the future, the Navy’s new fast jet training aircraft may no longer be required to fly an FCLP nearly every time it returns to the air station, and it will never need to go to the carrier. As long as new pilots learn the basics, spend plenty of time in the simulator, and fly a sensible number of high sink-rate FCLP approaches, they will graduate, then go to their respective FRS to learn how to fly their operational aircraft type. Only then will they finally head to the carrier for the first time. A T-45C student conducts carrier qualifications., U.S. Navy/MC3 Joshua L. Leonard New trainer, new roles Rear Admiral Harris says that as part of its future planning, the Navy is looking at how the new training aircraft could grow into other roles. He emphasizes how expensive it is to operate modern fighter aircraft, and that a surrogate aircraft could provide the Navy with a low-cost companion to its front-line fleet fighters, which could be a way to make the cost and sustainability of Naval aviation “more manageable.” He added that the Navy could then “turn that saving back into the enterprise for some of the more exotic capabilities.” “I believe that in Naval aviation we’re probably looking at a platform that is multi-role. We’ve reached out to industry to see what is in the realm of possible, as much as finding a platform that we can do carrier aviation training with, but also may have the flexibility in that platform to be able to grow. Whether that’s similar to what the Air Force is looking at potentially with their [Boeing] T-7 or not, I don’t know.” Notably, the USAF has from the outset eyed its new Boeing T-7A Red Hawk training aircraft with an in-house aggressor role in mind. The Boeing T-7A Red Hawk., Boeing A rendering of a potential US Navy variant of the T-7., Boeing “This training platform I believe is going to need to have growth to have a surrogate role — I mean it is relatively expensive to fly F-35 and I don’t believe it’ll be significantly less expensive to fly NGAD [Next-Generation Air Defense], or FA-XX, I don’t think it’s going to be less expensive to fly Super Hornets and Growlers in the future. So, if we can find a platform that we can use as a surrogate, not necessarily for everybody, but I might put my more senior folks in those on a formation hop or some role like that.” The Navy is also looking at its organic adversary roles as a potential area where its new trainer could be employed. “We are trying to improve the capability of our adversaries,” explains Harris. “We’ve been flying the F-5s a significant amount of time and a few ‘Legacy’ Hornets . To provide that level of training, we’re going to be moving to F-16s to replace legacy Hornets, and then really working with our air force counterparts to see what else we can do from a surrogate aircraft that we may be able to use as an adversary.” In a previous feature , The War Zone exclusively detailed how Fighter Squadron Composite 12 (VFC-12), the “Fighting Omars,” at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, will trade its legacy Hornets for Super Hornets in 2021. The F-16 recapitalization plan is rumored to involve Strike Fighter Squadron 204 (VFA-204), the “River Rattlers,” which also flies aging F/A-18Cs, primarily in the adversary role. This is part of an overall move by the Navy to remove all legacy Hornets from the inventory in the coming year. The Navy is looking to retire its remaining F/A-18C/Ds in 2021, and a new Navy trainer could become a replacement adversary aircraft., Jamie Hunter Project Avenger In addition to re-evaluating the carrier qualification component in the T-45 syllabus, CNATRA is overhauling core elements of the pilot training program. Project Avenger started earlier this year as part of a Pilot Training Next initiative, and its name pays homage to the rate at which the Navy was able to train 35,000 new pilots at the height of World War II. The USAF is deeply engaged in similar projects that are designed to drastically overhaul pilot training. Named after the Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber of World War II fame, the Project Avenger initiative is about a new training philosophy using new technology to get new aviators trained in “18 months, street to fleet.” The aggressive timeline currently includes 20 students who are now in primary flight training. This first phase of the test period is expected to be complete early in 2021, before the students move to the T-45, and before joining a revamped strike fighter syllabus when they reach the FRS. A student in the Project Avenger program prepares for a first flight in the T-6B in November 2020., U.S. Navy/Lt Michelle Tucker The Navy is replacing traditional paper publications with iPads for each student so they can enjoy on-demand access to courseware, with their learning planned to be enhanced through deep repetitions. A series of 360-degree recorded training videos are being used by the students, so they can see what their actual live flight mission events look like via virtual reality goggles, ahead of the event. This is aimed at accelerated learning, so that students can advance through the syllabus and develop advanced skill sets, which will enable them to perform better in simulators, and in the air. The Navy is adamant that it is not cutting any flight hours , but that this will ultimately produce a better naval aviator, faster, thanks to increased efficiency. The use of Virtual Reality Part-Task Trainer systems are being rolled out first in the T-6B Texan II, and the Navy wants to repeat this in the follow-on advanced jet training syllabus. However, it acknowledges the move from the T-6 to the T-45 is currently something of a retrograde step in terms of advanced learning. The Navy’s new training aircraft will be aimed at addressing that requirement for advanced learning, with embedded, synthetic training being a vital component. The Navy could be heading for a new dawn in carrier aviation training., U.S. Navy/MCSN Jacob Hilgendorf So, the Navy’s new jet trainer will not only address a dramatic push to evolve the way the service trains new aviators, but it seems the winning candidate will also need to be a high-performance multi-role type, so that it can become a companion trainer, as well as potentially being the Navy’s next adversary fighter as well. And, based on what we now know, it is very possible, if not probable, that this aircraft will never see a carrier deck. An experienced U.S. Navy strike fighter pilot told The War Zone “The current [training] process is seen as a rite of passage in carrier aviation. That before carrier Naval Aviators are winged, they go to the boat solo — success or failure is up to the individual. The confidence gained during this process is immeasurable. The proposed new process will change something that has been in place for decades.” “It’s easier to land on the boat with PLM or DFP, but it is not automatic. Carrier qualification is more than catching the wire. It is the exposure to the carrier environment and how an individual deals with it. The pattern, the communications, the nuance, the stress. The ability to master this is one of our competitive advantages.” The War Zone reached out to the Navy Office of Information (CHINFO) regarding plans for the new jet training aircraft and received the following statement: “A final decision on the next training aircraft has not yet been made, so we cannot definitively say whether it will or will not be capable of shipboard operations at this time.” Overall, these potential major changes to how many Naval Aviators are trained represents an ambitious set of goals, ones that will surely press Naval Aviation’s highly ingrained cultural norms, which are largely built around carrier flying, to the absolute limit. But if it works, it could set new benchmarks in the way advanced jet training aircraft are employed by modern air arms going forward and result in a more efficient era in U.S. naval aviation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 14, 2020",We Talk Tomcats With A Veteran Navy Test Pilot On The F-14’s 50th Birthday,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s amazing how time flies. For the F-14 Tomcat, it flies even faster. First taking to the air 50 years ago, few aircraft in the history of aviation have captured imaginations and have sparked the passion for flight like the twin-tailed, swing-wing icon. It went from a big, loud, fire-breathing, hard turning, arrowhead-shaped flying technological marvel to a full-blown movie star after Top Gun touched down in theaters in 1986. From then on, Grumman’s biggest ‘cat’ sunk its claws into pop culture like no other fighter jet in history. Fast forward to today, and we sit on the precipice of the Tomcat’s golden anniversary. The first Full Scale Development F-14A, BuNo 157980, blasted into the skies on its maiden flight on December 21st, 1970 from Grumman’s test center in Calverton, on Long Island, just a mere 22 months after the company was awarded the VFX program contract. The sortie was short, but it was the beginning of a naval aviation revolution, one that would finally give the service the ‘fleet defender’ it had dreamed of, and later on, so much more. F-14A launches off the catapult. , USN To honor this historic milestone, The War Zone talked with Michael V. “Mike” Rabens, the President of The F-14 Tomcat Association and a guy with quite the career under his belt. Rabens retired as a Captain after commanding Naval Test Wing Pacific. Prior to that, he commanded the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, had multiple cruises on carriers, and graduated from the Navy Fighter Weapons School , better known as Topgun, on his first squadron tour. By the end of his Navy career, Rabens had amassed a whopping 4,700 flight hours in 58 different aircraft and more than 700 carrier landings. Today, he is currently the Director of System Integration Test & Evaluation at Northrop Grumman—the same company that built his beloved Tomcat. As part of the Tomcat’s half-century birthday, Rabens and The F-14 Tomcat Association are holding an event to commemorate the occasion on December 21st, 2020. More details can be found about the online streaming event, which you can watch, can be found here . Simply put, there are few better people to reminisce about the Tomcat than Mike Rabens. Michael V. “Mike” Rabens, now an executive at Northrop Grumman and President of The F-14 Tomcat Association., Northrop Grumman So, without further ado, here is our exclusive interview with the highly experienced Tomcat flyer. TR: How did the arrival of the Tomcat change the Navy? MR: The arrival of the F-14 was a game-changer. It really defined a whole era of aviation, particularly naval aviation, for a couple of reasons. The first reason was, it was the first Navy airplane with swing-wings. Obviously, F-111 was first , but it allowed it to be a Mach 2.4 class supersonic fighter and land on carriers with bring-back capability. In other words, it could bring back missiles that you hadn’t expended. So, that was one part of it. Probably even more important than that was the Phoenix missile system along with the AWG-9 weapon system, and later on APG [AN/APG-72 was an upgrade of the AN/AWG-9]. That was unheard of. At that time, the F-14 was the only airplane that had a ‘launch and leave’ missile with the Phoenix. The only airplane that had a radar that could see as far as it could. And the only weapon system where the Phoenix missile could be launched, you know, at ranges that are well-exceeded everything else that the US and enemy fighters were carrying at the time. So, in terms of dominating the sky, the F-14 was the top of the heap. It was the preeminent fighter of its time. And it really created many things, many innovations that came later on other airplanes, such as the AMRAAM launch and leave missile. So, I think the F-14 set the standard. It was at the top of the heap for quite a long time. And it really did define that whole era from the ’80s and the ’90s. It was the era of the F-14. F-14A letting lose an AIM-54 Phoenix missile. , US National Archives TR: Starting out, the F-14 had a pretty rough entry into service with the engine issues and other problems. That whole stretch of time when the aircraft was really teething, and it sort of turned the Tomcat into what it really could be later on. Can you talk about how the Navy learned from that? MR: Sure, anytime you’ve got ground-breaking technology, there’s always going to be some teething, as you said. The Grumman team, which was working hand in hand with the Naval Air Systems Command at the time, was right on the spot in developing solutions, every time there was a discovery of an issue, they came up with the sound engineering solution. They worked hand in hand with the Navy, and then they implemented those solutions. So, even though, like any first article being introduced to the fleet, there was a lot of learning, but there was a lot of improving and it was rapidly improving, and it was actually expansive, in that, they tackled every single issue and solved it. So, the airplane actually was a mainstay of carrier aviation for so long, 30-plus years, and I think that record is a testament to how successfully Grumman and the Navy teamed together to solve those issues. The F-14 Tomcat on its first flight., Grumman TR: Stick us in the ejection seat, what was it like flying the ‘Turkey Bird?’ You’ve flown so many airplanes through your test pilot career. How did the F-14 differentiate itself from the others? MR: Well, I’d love to bring you into the cockpit with me because if you had a chance to experience it, the visceral thrill of it would certainly be far better than the words I can use to paint a picture. But imagine if you will… Sitting into a relatively spacious cockpit. And I know from some of your previous work, you’ve talked to people that talked about that transition from the A-4 where I literally had to turn my shoulders obliquely to get the canopy down. Now again, in the F-14, and the first thing you notice is the incredible field of regard where you can see literally between the tails if you arched your neck around and looked around the ejection seat head. You’ve got great visibility downward towards the ground, and then with the canopy, you can just see all around you really well. So, that’s the first thing that jumps out at you. The Tomcat’s cockpit was comparatively roomy. , US National Archives Now, imagine, if you will, you’ve gone through the pre-flight, the pre-start, the pre-taxi checks… You’ve gone through your take-off checklist… You’ve gotten clearance from the tower to take off, and the first time you do it… It’s an afterburner take-off, at Miramar, back in the heyday of the F-14. You plug in the afterburner, even with the TF30 [engine], you feel the G-forces push you back into the seat, the airplane rapidly accelerates, lift off the ground, and you bring the gear up. As you fly the departure out of the La Jolla, you are… I was just amazed. I was just amazed at how the airplane flies because it’s a big airplane. It’s such a big airplane, but it flew really, really well. They’d really got well-harmonized controls so that the longitudinal and lateral control just felt fantastic. Then when you go to climb, oh my God! You go to full military power, typically we don’t go into afterburner to climb up into the operating areas. But when you can pitch the nose up 40 degrees and look behind you and see the earth receding. You’ve got all this power in your hands. It’s an ego rush that I can’t even… I don’t think I can do it adequate justice with my words, but you can just, imagine if you will, sitting in a recliner and having that feeling, but now you’re not in a recliner, you’re actually… Your body is in the same position as a recliner, but you’re just screaming into the sky, going through 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 feet, climbing up to your mission altitude. And you can just feel the thrust behind those engines, the F-14D engines were even more impressive. It is one heady rush. An F-14A blasts into the twilight. , US Navy/Lt. Baranek TR: Culturally speaking, the jet had a huger impact. Top Gun was a big part of it, the movie, as well as the Topgun Navy Fighter Weapons School. How did that culture change with the aircraft coming into the Navy in the late ’70s and the ’80s? What did the Tomcat community’s world feel like during that period of time? It seems like it was a magical moment for naval aviation. MR: Yeah, I think it really was. It was a confluence of a lot of things. First of all, there was a legacy of fighters that Grumman had built, and even Northrop with the F-5 , there was this rich legacy of fighters that came together in Northrop Grumman. And the fighter camaraderie and the fighter squadron atmosphere, I think was relatively constant along the way. What the F-14 brought to that was even more power, even more mastery of the skies, and a two-person crew. The F-8 was single piloted, the A-7 was single piloted, the A-6 , the Grumman platforms, the A-6 and the F-14, were dual-crewed. Of course, the F-4 had been dual-crewed too, but the backseater in the F-4 had far less capability than the F-14 Radar Intercept Officer [RIO], so that introduced just a tremendous pride in the airplane that you could feel in the squadrons. They certainly were confident of their ability to prevail in combat, something that’s so important. But then from the public, you mentioned Top Gun. Even before the movie anybody that saw the F-14 at an air show could not help but be impressed, and I suspect you’ve been to many air shows and… Did you ever see the F-14 in air shows? TR: Oh yeah, many. MR: Yeah, so you know it’s loud, it’s big, and it’s fast. When I was in my first squadron, they accidentally broke the sound barrier at the Miramar Air Show… And the crowd loved it, though the people that suffered some window damage didn’t, but the Navy made that all right. F-14 screams by the crowd in a high-speed pass during an air show., USN So, it was just such an impressive airplane. I am convinced that a generation of people joined the Navy because they either saw the F-14 in an air show or they saw the movie Top Gun, or maybe both. Being in an F-14 squadron in that era was a heady experience because you knew you were at the top of the world when it comes to mastery of the skies, air dominance—all those things. You had the equipment, you had the training, and you knew you could do what the nation needed you to do. TR: Talking about mastery of the sky, right alongside the F-14, the Air Force had the F-15. They originally had different roles to some degree—the fleet defender versus the air security fighter, but then again, they were still there alongside each other, teammates, but competitive ones. Can you talk a little bit about how the F-14 actually stacked up to the F-15 when you were flying it? How could they hold their own against each other? MR: It was the Air Force’s top-line fighter at the time [ the F-15 Eagle ], in it was the Navy’s top-line fighter at the time [the F-14 Tomcat]. I’ll just compare the F-14D against the F-15C because those were the most recent ones. Obviously, without getting into classified information, because the F-15 is still flying, I’ll just say that both were superb maneuvering vehicles. The F-14D with the big engines was amazing in a dogfight and the F-15 was too, but the key difference is you didn’t want to get in a dogfight, you didn’t want to get tangled up with enemy aircraft, because now you’re in one geographical area, you’re flying a relatively big airplane, both were, the F-15 and F-14, and people can see you. What you really want to do is influence the enemy from far away. HUD camera still from an F-14 with its gun pipper squarely on an F-15 Eagle’s canopy. The ideal end to a dogfight between the Tomcat and the Eagle for the F-14 crew., Public Domain/USN So, the F-15 with the Sparrow missile system just didn’t compare to the F-14 with the Phoenix missile system, and that was the biggest differentiator. You could influence the enemy from farther away, and you could do more in an air superiority role when you compare the F-14 to the F-15, depending on the missile load that was on the aircraft. Of course, that was the biggest thing, you could reach out and touch the enemy from further away, and if you got into a close-in dogfight, I think they were roughly equivalent. You would never find an Eagle Driver that would agree with that statement, but I would maintain that F-14D is equivalent, if not slightly better than an F-15 in a dogfight. The F-14 of course, being a little bit heavier, has a little more work to do, but as a well-flown airplane, the F-14D was a dream to fly and was amazing in aerial combat TR: Speaking of F-14D, that lines our next question up. So, the F-14D program gets cut early, and this was a tumultuous time for Naval Aviation, in the early ’90s. 50 or so F-14Ds were either re-manufactured or built. At the same time, we were coming out of the Cold War, the A-12 Avenger was canceled, the A-6F was passed over. The Naval ATF was abandoned. Eventually, the Super Hornet became the future of the Navy’s tactical aviation fleet looking into the 2000s. Was that the right decision to only acquire 50 or so F-14Ds? What about the other stuff that Grumman was working on that was so impressive looking, like the Super Tomcat 21 and the ASF-14 ? These were kind of the Super Hornet model for the F-14. Looking back, do you think the Navy made the right decision by abandoning those future platforms and just going all-in on the Super Hornet? MR: Wow, it’s a great question, but it’s a very complicated question, Tyler. And I have my personal opinion. My personal opinion is that the evolution of the F-14D into the Tomcat 21 and all the other variants that were envisioned would have been very, very successful for the Navy. Grumman, and eventually Northrop Grumman, really knew what it was doing with that airplane and with a larger platform, you can take more, you can stay out longer, and I think that offered a tremendous advantage to the Navy. F-14D flying alongside an F/A-18 Legacy Hornet., US Navy I certainly can’t comment on the inner Pentagon’s decision-making about all that. They were looking for efficiencies in a peace dividend kind of world, and I’m not in a position to comment on that. What I can say is that the airplane itself, and I loved your War Zone piece on what it would have been, it would have been incredible. And as we look forward into the future, you know all of those concepts are still relevant. I think you have to decide if you want a big platform that can carry a lot of weapons and can stay out a long time or go a long way, and that’s where the Tomcat 21 was going. And it would have been, I think, hugely successful. TR: Leaping into the future, we saw the F-14 get precision-guided ground attack capability, it was very successful, and working as a forward air controller airborne. I mean, hit a bunch of different areas that it wasn’t really intended to do, very well. And by the mid-2000s, it was chosen that they would be retired, the F-14s. The last F-14Ds that left the deck were so reliable, those jets were flying more than the Super Hornets that were replacing them. So the question often comes up that may be a smaller Tomcat force would have still been relevant. What is your viewpoint on when they decided to retire the F-14, that decision, and what that did to the air wing? MR: Well, it took some capability away, and again, I’m not in a position to second-guess what the fleet leadership was thinking about when they made those decisions. I can just tell you from a pilot’s viewpoint that the Grumman airplane was incredible. The F-14D, as you said, they could fly it a lot. It was the number one choice of people on the ground. When I was doing the combat air support mission with the precision weapons, the LANTIRN , the ROVER system , all those other enhancements that had been put in the airplane, in a way it was retired at the peak of its career. While that all just sounds like a nice cliché, that you want to go out on top, I just personally think that the Navy missed an opportunity to continue the platform into the future. The bottom line is the platform had so much potential. It was positioned to be the platform in the future too, and the Navy took a different path. What could have been, one of our renderings of the Super Tomcat 21. You can see more and read all about the program here . , HANGAR B PRODUCTIONS TR: Personally, what is your best memory in the Tomcat, and what is maybe your most terrifying? MR: Well, the worst day in a Tomcat was better than the best day anywhere else, for a lot of people. I think you’d hear that from a lot of pilots. I will say a couple of experiences really stand out to me. When I was deployed, there was a night when we climbed to get above the clouds so we could do intercepts, and we were in the North Pacific and there were thunderstorms in the area, so we kept climbing and climbing and climbing, and I ended up leveling off at about 42,000 feet so I could be above the clouds. There was cloud-to-cloud lightning, and you could see it. It was right below you, and it was beautiful and just a little bit frightening too, thinking you had to go back down through that to get back to the ship. But it was one of those moments. If I could paint the picture for you, where you’ve got this incredible star-studded sky above you, but it’s black with just the stars because it was night, then you’ve got this white blanket almost like snow beneath you, except you’ve got lightning flashes going off and you can see some of the lightning bolts and some are still inside the clouds. So, you’ve got the clouds kind of illuminating internally , and then you’ve got the occasional lightning bolt. It was just an incredible experience that happened, I don’t know, 30, not quite 30 years ago, but a long time ago, and I can remember it vividly as if it was just yesterday. In terms of other notable moments, just in my experience, was during carrier suitability testing in the Navy. We would go out and certify flight decks and check new features on the airplanes, and in the daytime, I just have very fond memories of blasting off the catapult, turning downwind, and doing multiple approaches and traps. At that point, I had a fair number of arrested landings under my belt, over 600, and I got up to about 700 during the carrier suitability testing. You just become so comfortable flying the airplane in that environment. It was just a thrill. It’s just an incredible memory. I could talk about those kind of things for hours, so you’ll have to stop me… F-14D heading into the pattern over the boat., US Navy TR: I get asked all the time why can’t somebody put one back in the air again, and I try to explain this to them, that even at a private party, and I know that that was tried actually after they were going to retire them, I believe [Dale] Snodgrass tried to do this and it didn’t work. Can you talk a little bit about that… You know, the reality of that and anybody who’s actually tried to get one of them back in the air? MR: Well, to my knowledge, it’s been talked about quite a bit. In fact, for the anniversary of naval aviation, we talked about doing that within the company. It is logistically though, a challenge… If you just think about picking an airplane from Tucson from the boneyard, you’ve got to have not just… We certainly have all the material you’d need to get the airplane back flying again, but then you’ve got to have spares and you’ve got have other things. I would be the first one to volunteer to go fly it, and in fact, I’d probably try and make sure nobody else knew about the opportunity, so I’d be hopefully on the shortlist. But the reality is that logistically taking anything that’s been retired for a few years, and in this case, we’re talking about 14 years, taking something like that that has been retired and then and bringing it back into service use would be a tremendous investment. An F-14D on display at the boneyard in Tuscon. There are very few Tomcats left in storage. Most were cut up and recycled after retirement, with some going to museums. The fact that Iran still flies the type heavily influenced how the Tomcats and their spare parts were handled following their withdrawal from service. , Clemens Vasters/Wikicommons I just think no one’s been willing to make that investment yet because you gotta be able to sustain it if you were going to… I’m sure Dale, callsign “Snort” Snodgrass would love to take one out on the air show circuit, but it’s not like taking a typical warbird, because it’s such a magnificent weapon system and you’d have to work through all the details on that. TR: Right. It’s still used in Iran too. Do you find it amazing that there are still actually a few of them that are airworthy over there? MR: Not my area of expertise, but I’m not surprised that the airplane is still flying. What I can say is that the airplane itself that Grumman designed, that the Navy procured and we deployed was an amazing platform. An F-14B with a full load of Phoenix missiles takes off the famed NAS Miramar in Southern California. , USN TR: Parting shot: If there’s anything that you’d like the average person to know about the Tomcat, what would it be, after all these years? MR: First of all, and this is going to sound like a little bit of a Navy ad, but every time a pilot and a RIO got into an airplane and got to go do their mission, it was because there was a small army of maintainers behind them working literally 12 hours a day, day-after-day, out on the carrier, 84 hours a week, to make sure that weapon system worked. The dedication of those people really needs to be recognized, too. The pilots and the RIOs got the glory, but we only were able to do what we did because we had dedicated maintenance troops back there, making sure that the airplane was ready, that it had ordnance, and that the weapon system worked day-after-day, night-after-night. I think that’s really important. The other thing, because well, I think you know the why, so I’ll stop there, but I will also say that our nation builds amazing weapon systems, and that the average American may not give it much thought. But they should be very impressed that a company like Northrop Grumman can build something like that, that can be in operation for 30-plus years, defending our nation and doing diplomacy overseas, and position ourselves to be taking the fight overseas instead of here within the United States. People should feel good about that… I think it’s just assumed by a lot of people and it’s good that they have the capability to be comfortable at home and it’d be nice for them to think about why they have the capability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 20, 2023","Israeli, Serbian, And Swedish Self-Propelled Howitzers Are Headed To A U.S. Army Shoot-Off","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Self-propelled howitzer designs from Israel, Serbia, and Sweden, as well as American models, will take part in a U.S. Army shoot-off at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona early next year. The service is looking for new mobile artillery piece for its brigades equipped with Stryker wheeled armored vehicles , which are presently equipped with towed 155mm M777 howitzers . Israel’s Elbit Systems, Serbia’s Yugoimport, and U.K.-headquartered defense giant BAE System’s Bofors division in Sweden have all confirmed that they will be taking part in the event. American automotive company AM General, in cooperation with Mandus Group, will also be participating. The ATMOS Iron Sabre self-propelled howitzer from Israel’s Elbit Systems, one of the designs that will take part in the shoot-off next year., Elbit Systems of America The Army had first announced in July that it was looking for new self-propelled howitzers for its Stryker brigades, expressing interest only in designs that were at least mature enough to go into serial production, if they weren’t already. The service is also looking for increased range, rate of fire, and mobility over the existing M777s. Elbit has submitted the latest iteration of its Autonomous Truck Mounted howitzer System (ATMOS), also known as Iron Sabre, which is a truck-mounted 155mm howitzer with a 52 caliber barrel. In artillery parlance, caliber is a measurement of length in relation to the diameter of the barrel. As such, a 52 caliber 155mm barrel is just under 26 and a half feet long. The M777, by comparison, has a 39 caliber 155mm barrel, which is just around 16.7 feet long. In general, longer barrels on howitzers translate to greater range. Soltam Systems, now a division of Elbit, first began developing ATMOS in the late 1990s. The “autonomous” in its name is more a reflection of its heavily automated nature, rather than its ability to operate completely independently of human control. It is worth noting that Soltam and Elbit have also talked about adding some kind of actual autonomous or at least semi-autonomous capability to the system in the past. The current Iron Sabre version does have an integrated computerized fire control system for automatically aiming the gun at a desired set of coordinates and firing it, though manual backups are provided, as well. It can be fitted with what Elbit describes as an automatic loader, which allows the crew to simply place shells and propellant charges on a tray, which are then rammed into the barrel without the need for a human loader. Using this combination of features, Elbit has demonstrated, as seen in the video below, the ability of a four-man crew to set up an ATMOS Iron Sabre howitzer and fire the first round at the designated target within 30 seconds. An additional five rounds can be fired at that same target and then the crew can pack the vehicle back up to move out to another position all in around 110 seconds in total. This kind of shoot-and-scoot capability makes the system more flexible and also reduces its vulnerability to enemy counter-attacks. A simplified loading system wherein an individual positions shells and propellant charges in line with the barrel, but a mechanical system actually loads them in, is also available for ATMOS. Elbit has also been testing a more fully automated system for its related Autonomous Towed Howitzer System (ATHOS), which loads shells automatically from a tray holding three rounds, though a human operator still has to place propellant charges on the loading tray. It’s not clear what kind of truck Elbit will mount the ATMOS on for the Army. The company has said that the howitzer system is adaptable to various in-production 8×8 and 6×6 chassis, including that of the American-made 8×8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) series. 8×8 and 6×6 versions of the ATMOS self-propelled howitzer., Elbit BAE Systems Bofor’s is offering the Archer , another truck-mounted 52 caliber 155mm howitzer. This weapon, which was also developed in the late 1990s, most notably features a true auto-loader that feeds shells into the gun from a 21-round magazine. It also has a separate magazine loaded with modular propellant charges. https://youtube.com/watch?v=E3QoVvtPqXY A computerized fire control system allows the crew, which can be as small as two people, to set the desired amount of propellant and then fire the gun at the desired target. The crew can emplace the howitzer in just 14 seconds, without having to exit the protection of its armored cab, which also features a remote weapon station for localized self-defense, and fire the first round in 23 seconds. The system can lob four shells at the same target and be on the move again in 74 seconds. This is so fast that, depending on how far the rounds fly, some of them may not have even struck before the vehicle drives away from its firing position. To date, Archer is only in Swedish Army service mounted on a heavily modified 6×6 Volvo A30D articulated dump truck chassis. It’s not clear if the howitzer that BAE Systems Bofors will send to next year’s shoot-off will use this chassis, though it seems unlikely that the Army would be interested in adopting it, regardless. BAE Systems did unveil a version of the Archer system mounted on an 8×8 MAN truck chassis in 2019, suggesting that it can be further adapted to other types to meet customer requirements. An artist’s conception of Archer mounted on an 8×8 MAN truck chassis., BAE Systems Serbia’s Yugoimport, via its American partner Global Military Products (GMP), is sending a variant of its Nora B-52 wheeled self-propelled 52 caliber 155mm howitzer. The former Yugoslav republic’s government-owned Military Technical Institute Belgrade began development of this system in the early 2000s. https://youtube.com/watch?v=r9Mj3KVJ__c As is clearly becoming a trend among such weapons, the latest versions of the complete Nora B-52 system include computerized fire control capabilities. It also has an auto-loader with a 12-round magazine, as well as space to store another 24 shells on the truck. The most recent variant, also known as Aleksander, which was unveiled in 2017, has a completely redesigned turret holding the 155mm howitzer. All of the existing Nora B-52 versions use a modified 8×8 truck chassis from Serbia’s FAP. AM General and Mandus Group are putting forward Brutus, a low-recoil 155mm howitzer design mounted on an Army standard 6×6 Family of Medium Tactical Trucks (FMTV) chassis. The service has already been experimenting with this weapon, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , since at least 2018. The configuration of Brutus that has been seen so far does not include any kind of automated loading system and does not have a 52 caliber-long barrel. The Army has also explored a low-recoil 105mm howitzer from Mandus Group mounted on a Humvee, known as Hawkeye , in the past. Despite Brutus’ entry into the shoot-off, foreign designs look set to dominate the event. Though not yet confirmed to be a participant, France’s Nexter has said it is interested in taking part in the shoot-off with the latest iteration of its Caesar design . There are a number of other wheeled self-propelled howitzers on the market made by other U.S. allies and partners, as well. The lack of American competitors largely stems from the fact that wheeled self-propelled howitzers are something the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, has historically had little interest in. Heavier tracked self-propelled designs, as well as towed guns, have been standard fare for Army artillery units for decades. It is worth noting that the Army did test a mobile 105mm howitzer based on the LAV III wheeled armored vehicle chassis, from which the Stryker is also derived. This vehicle was armed with a 105mm Light Experimental Ordnance (LEO) gun from South Africa’s Denel and was not subsequently adopted. Stryker-equipped brigades do have versions of this vehicle armed with 120mm mortars for indirect fire support and there is a separate program underway to replace those variants with a new version fitted with a turreted mortar system , but these weapons do not have the same range or destructive power as a 155mm howitzer. A wheeled self-propelled 105mm howitzer based on the LAV III armored vehicle chassis., General Dynamics It’s also not clear how the Army’s Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program may factor into this effort for the Stryker brigades. ERCA has been focused on developing longer 155mm barrels for existing M777 towed howitzers and derivatives of its M109 tracked self-propelled howitzers , as well as a host of other associated improvements for those weapon systems, and new kinds of ammunition, including ramjet-powered rounds . Other units may be interested in fielding whatever mobile howitzer design the Army might settle on for its Stryker brigades. In 2018, the service had expressed interest in acquiring a new light-weight, mobile 155mm howitzer that could replace the M777s, as well as 105mm M119s, in Stryker and light infantry brigades. This kind of wheeled self-propelled howitzer could also appeal to the U.S. Marine Corps. That service is in the process of shuttering a number of M777-equipped artillery units as part of a radical force structure redesign focused on highly mobile distributed operations. If nothing else, the upcoming shoot-off could finally set the Army down a path to acquiring a self-propelled howitzer better suited to Stryker brigades than existing towed weapons.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 20, 2020",Watch A Super Hornet Launch Off A “Ski Jump” During Testing Aimed At The Indian Navy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has released a video of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet jet launching from a ground-based “ ski jump ” ramp, in a demonstration for India, which is looking to buy a new carrier-based multirole fighter. The Indian Navy’s current carrier, as well as its next flattop, lack catapults , which means the service requires a jet that can take off from a sloped ramp before returning to the ship using arrestor gear. Boeing has been flying a Super Hornet from the ground-based ramp at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland for some time and you can read more about the program in this previous War Zone article . The same ramp has been used during testing of the short takeoff and vertical (STOVL) landing capable F-35B variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. Boeing The brief video published today on Twitter reportedly dates from the series of trials that were run last August. It shows a single-seat F/A-18E from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23), the “Salty Dogs,” launching from the ground-based ramp, with the jet carrying some type of external stores — apparently inert bombs — under the wings. A ski-jump launch may well impose a penalty in terms of the payload the jet can take off with, but Boeing says it has conducted multiple tests with different, undisclosed, kinds of payloads. ⛷ #SuperHornet hits the slopes! Watch as an F/A-18 takes off from a ski-jump ramp, demonstrating the ability to operate effectively from @IndianNavy aircraft carriers. pic.twitter.com/eBSaYF97sy — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) December 21, 2020 According to the company, these tests “show that the Super Hornet would do well with the Indian Navy’s Short Takeoff but Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) system and validate earlier simulation studies.” Boeing first disclosed that it was doing simulation work on the Super Hornet’s ability to operate from a STOBAR carrier in 2017. The Indian Navy currently operates the STOBAR carrier INS Vikramaditya , which is the adapted Soviet-era Admiral Gorshkov , and the future INS Vikrant , an indigenous carrier, also makes use of the same technology for aircraft launch and recovery. It’s also worth noting that the Super Hornet’s progenitor, the F/A-18A/B Hornet, also undertook ski-jump tests during its initial development, although that wasn’t to satisfy potential Indian Navy requirements. A Hornet undergoing ski-jump testing., USN “The first successful and safe launch of the F/A-18 Super Hornet from a ski jump begins the validation process to operate effectively from Indian Navy aircraft carriers,” said Ankur Kanaglekar, head of India fighter sales at Boeing’s Defense, Space and Security division. “The F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet will not only provide superior warfighting capability to the Indian Navy but also create opportunities for cooperation in naval aviation between the United States and India.” The Block III is the latest and most advanced version of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, offering longer range and reduced drag with conformal fuel tanks, an infrared search and track sensor, Advanced Cockpit System, signature reduction, and a 10,000+ hour life. You can read all about the Block III version here . An infographic showing the basic components of the Block III upgrade package., Boeing Boeing says it expects to deliver Block III-configured Super Hornets to the U.S. Navy in 2021 and, by 2024, one squadron within each carrier air wing should consist of Block III jets, either upgraded or new-build. India, meanwhile, is looking to acquire 57 Multi-Role Carrier Borne Fighters (MRCBF), to serve aboard the Vikramaditya , and the future Vikrant . At the same time, Boeing is in the running to supply the Indian Air Force with another 110 new jets, under the Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA), which could potentially be met by either the Super Hornet or an Indian-specific version of the F-15EX, an aircraft which we have looked at in detail in the past. Meanwhile, there could be a compelling case for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy both to select the Super Hornet, with all the benefits that commonality and scalability would provide. The Indian Navy previously rejected plans for a carrier-based version of the domestically designed Tejas, with complaints that the design was overweight and lacked range, though the development of that aircraft has continued, since then. In January, the prototype landed on and took off from the Vikramaditya for the first time . While there are plenty of other options for the MRFA, the Super Hornet doesn’t face as much competition for the MRCBF, with only the Dassault Rafale and the MiG-29K currently available as off-the-shelf contenders. However, the MiG-29K has faced criticism in local media and three of these aircraft have been lost in high-profile accidents in Indian Navy service. The most recent accident last month resulted in one fatality. The land-based version of the Rafale entered service with the Indian Air Force earlier this year . A French Navy Rafale M during operations from the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower ., U.S. Navy Apparently, with an eye on the potential advantages currently held by the Rafale in the MRCBF, Boeing is now emphasizing the key selling points of the Super Hornet. Boeing maintains that the Super Hornet “will offer the Indian Navy value in the form of advanced warfighter technologies at a low acquisition cost and affordable cost per flight hour because of its ease of maintainability design and durability.” Servicing the jets, should India choose to buy them, will be conducted by the company “in partnership with the Indian Navy as well as India and U.S. based partners throughout the lifecycle of the aircraft.” This is part of a proposed “By India, for India” sustainment program, apparently designed to satisfy Indian requirements for local industrial engagement. Once the formal request for proposals for the MRCBF is presented, that could see a requirement added to build the jets in India, something that Boeing has offered with its Super Hornet in the past . An infographic laying out Boeing’s Super Hornet pitch to the Indian Air Force, which includes significant requirements for industrial cooperation with Indian firms., Boeing Unlike the carrier-based Rafale, the Super Hornet is available as both a single-seater and a two-seater, offering certain advantages especially for more complex or long-duration missions and Boeing has also talked up the jet’s “ability to interface with the P-8I as a force multiplier.” The Indian Navy has already ordered 12 P-8Is — an export version of the P-8A Poseidon , locally named Neptune — and has plans to buy another six. Indian Navy P-8I Neptune., Boeing Whatever choice India makes for its new naval fighter, Boeing’s response to this summer’s Patuxent River tests suggests that the company has every confidence in the Super Hornet’s chances.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 8, 2020",Space Force Troops Finally Have A Name: Guardians,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fledgling U.S. Space Force has announced the name by which its members will be called: Guardians. This is one of the last remaining organizational changes for America’s newest branch to make to give it a distinct from its parent, the U.S. Air Force. The service already has its own unique unit designations , insignias and uniform devices , as well as a new motto, Semper Supra, or Always Above. Vice President Mike Pence announced the Guardians moniker at a gathering at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020, with Space Force head General John Raymond, Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett, and Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller also in attendance. This comes just days before the first anniversary of the service’s founding on Dec. 20 of last year. The Space Force’s Guardians will now join the U.S. Army’s Soldiers, the U.S. Navy’s Sailors, the U.S. Air Force’s Airmen, and, well, the U.S. Marine Corps’ Marines. President Donald Trump, at right, gestures to the Space Force’s official flag during its unveiling at the White House in May 2020., AP “Today, after a yearlong process that produced hundreds of submissions and research involving space professionals and members of the general public, we can finally share with you the name by which we will be known: Guardians,” a subsequent post from the Space Force’s official Twitter account read. “The name Guardians connects our proud heritage and culture to the important mission we execute 24/7, protecting the people and interest of the U.S. and its allies.” “Guardians is a name with a long history in space operations, tracing back to the original command motto of Air Force Space Command in 1983, ‘Guardians of the High Frontier,'” according to the Space Force. Air Force Space Command was transferred to the new service after its creation in 2019. Despite the stated history and heritage behind the name, “guardians,” together with Space Force’s mission, have already led to numerous comparisons to the Guardians of the Galaxy from the Marvel comics universe. The superhero ensemble has had two movies in Marvel’s cinematic universe and a third is on the way, scheduled for release in 2023. Its members have also since appeared in other Marvel films. This is hardly the first time the general public has made references to popular media when talking about the Space Force. As Walter Shaub, former Director of the Office of Government Ethics, noted on Twitter after the name’s announcement, there have already been a number of Star Trek references when it comes to the Space Force, generally related to its heavy use of delta symbols in its official insignias and other devices, which are very visually reminiscent of the Starfleet Command logo from that fictional universe. A new Space Force Space Staff uniform badge with a prominent delta motif that was unveiled earlier in December 2020., Space Force With the Guardian’s name in hand, one of the few remaining decisions Space Force has to make with regards to how to distinguish itself from the Air Force, as well as the other service, is the matter of ranks. A provision had been included in earlier versions of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year that demanded that Space Force use naval ranks. William Shatner, the first actor to play Star Trek’s iconic Captain Kirk, went so far as to write an op-ed for Military Times earlier this year promoting that idea. “There was no Colonel Kirk,” he wrote. However, that provision has since been dropped . If the current version of the Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA becomes law, Space Force will be free to continue its ongoing process to select a rank structure. So, while we still don’t know what the names for their different ranks might look like in the future, we do know now that members of the Space Force have officially become Guardians.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Edward “Ned” Linch III, then a U.S. Air Force Major, was flying his F-16 fighter jet over western Iraq on the night of March 30, 2003, when he and his wingman were diverted to support troops that were in desperate need of air cover. What unfolded was, in Linch’s words, “the most intense mission I’d ever flown in my life.” Thanks to a video interview, you can hear him talk all about the mission that saw him thankful for escaping alive, and later led to him receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross . The film also includes some intense audio and HUD camera sequences from the flight itself. First, a little background. Edward Linch III, now retired, joined the Air Force in 1986 and undertook training on the F-111 strike aircraft at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, followed by an operational posting to RAF Upper Heyford, England. F-16 over Iraq., USAF After attending Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas in 1989, he converted to the F-16 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, and began a 12-year operational career in the Viper, including more than 2,0000 flying hours that took him on tours at different stateside bases and Kunsan Air Base, Korea. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he flew F-16 combat air patrols during Operation Noble Eagle. Linch also flew more than 150 combat hours in his career, including Operations Northern and Southern Watch over Iraq, and Iraqi Freedom. It was a mission during the latter campaign — when he was deployed with the Alabama Air National Guard’s 160th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron — that he describes in the video. The night in question, then-Major Linch was flying as “Honcho 23,” alongside his wingman, Captain Brian Wolf. Their planned mission involved hunting down Iraqi Scud ballistic missiles in western Iraq. It was a grueling mission already, six hours long, but was heading toward its end when the call for support came in. The pilots then diverted to an area 400 miles inside enemy territory where the troops needed assistance. In another video about the mission posted to the same account, the location is described as “North of Al Qiam [sic] and just east of Syria.” This likely implies somewhere near Al-Qa’im, an Iraqi town located around 250 miles northwest of Baghdad, near the Syrian border. Before long, the seriousness of the situation became clear, as frantic radio calls came in on the guard radio frequency, which was reserved for emergencies. “One guy was going hysterical,” reflected Linch subsequently. “These were the most desperate and urgent radio calls I’ve ever heard. The calls were difficult to understand at times since they were in such dire straits under fire.” Watch Linch’s entire account of the events on that day and hear the frantic radio calls from the troops he was trying to protect in the video below: The soldiers in question were Coalition special operations forces surrounded by hostile Iraqi forces that outnumbered them by around 20 to one. The enemy soldiers were only around 300 yards from the Coalition forces and closing in fast. In the other video, it is noted that the Coalition soldiers were from the elite British Special Boat Service , and at least one of the accents heard does seem to be British. As the voices on the guard frequency became ever more frantic, Linch and Wolf pushed their jets to the limits to get on scene as quickly as possible. “We disregarded concern for ourselves and pressed beyond the limits of our jets, its equipment, and our personal limitations,” Linch said later. Now that they were well away from the scene of their previous Scud-hunting mission, the pilots had little idea about the environment below them. They lacked information on the local terrain, lines of communication, and potential threats in the area. The view through the HUD as Linch descends from 23,000 feet., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Although they were kitted out with night-vision goggles , or NVGs, a huge sandstorm the day before meant there was hardly enough illumination for them to actually work properly, as Linch explains in the video. In fact, it needed a combination of NVGs, the onboard radar, and the Situational Awareness Data Link, or SADL, for the two F-16s to just keep tabs on each other. “Despite the extreme risk to himself and his flight, [Major Linch] descended through the hazardous conditions to provide immediate air support for the trapped team,” an Air Combat Command press release explained . “We had to act now or these guys were going to die,” said Linch. “I knew we were their only hope at the time to survive; I was going to try to help them regardless of the conditions or the safety of my flight.” With only an intermittent infrared strobe from the ground troops visible to orientate them, Linch pressed on and led several reconnaissance passes and bomb runs over the position. In the process, he also directed his wingman to drop a single 500-pound bomb. An F-16C deployed from the Alabama Air National Guard taxis at Balad Air Base, Iraq, after an Operation Iraqi Freedom mission., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Tony R. Tolley In some troops-in-contact scenarios, that might have been enough, but not in this case. The enemy troops kept pressing on toward the Coalition special operations elements, leading Linch to reassess the situation. Concerned that dropping more bombs could result in friendly casualties, Linch decided instead to make low-level “show-of-force” passes over the area, with the aim of deterring the enemy. All this, of course, with seriously compromised situational awareness. Linch reckoned it was “one of the worst weather situations I’ve ever flown in,” said Linch. “With poor visibility due to the dust and haze, it is difficult to differentiate the ground from the clouds — you’re basically flying around in a milk bowl. The NVG picture looks like snow on a TV; it’s just all shades of green.” “With no moon and stars to provide illumination for my NVGs and no horizon to reference, it was almost impossible to visually fly the aircraft without referencing the instruments but I had many of my cockpit lights turned off and a few set to a very dim setting in order to assist me in finding their IR strobe. I had to rely on my wingman to call out critical information such as my altitude.” As well as the low-level passes, the two F-16 pilots started punching out infrared decoy flares from their jets, as another distraction to the enemy below. This, however, made their own position even more obvious to the Iraqis, while further reducing the effectiveness of their NVGs. Incredibly, the two pilots continued this effort for another half an hour, all the time with the risk of spatial disorientation, in almost zero visibility, and frequently dropping below the safe altitude limits. “Eventually, the Coalition forces were able to break through the line of enemy troops and proceed to a safer position,” the Air Combat Command report concluded. Linch attributed the combination of the bomb, flares, and the noise as having allowed the friendly troops to escape and, the following day, all were rescued.

Sgt. Kerry Jackson After receiving his Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism, Linch said: “I give a lot of credit to my wingman, Captain Wolf, for his efforts that night, and to God for protecting everyone in a situation that could have claimed many lives.” Editor’s note: A big thanks to Jack Lobo for the heads up on this video.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2019",India To Modify Used Airliners Into Early-Warning Radar Jets To Keep Pace With Its Rivals,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indian Air Force will receive six second-hand A320 airliners outfitted with indigenous radars to serve as airborne early warning and control platforms, keeping watch over vast swaths of airspace and managing the air battle in potential future conflicts. That, at least, is the plan of the Indian Ministry of Defense, according to recent reports in the Indian media. The proposal would plug what’s seen as a widening gap in aerial surveillance capabilities and could end up saving New Delhi a lot of money in the process. Unnamed sources confirmed the plans to the Times of India , claiming that using six A320 airliners provided by the national airline Air India would be more cost-effective than a previous proposal to install the equipment on a pair of new-build A330 jets that would have been provided by Airbus. While Airbus has, in the past, shown concepts of its A320neo aircraft configured for the airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) mission, so far, no air force has actually equipped the aircraft for this role. An Airbus concept for a multi-mission A320neo family, including an AEW&C version with conformal radar arrays. , Airbus The same sources indicated that the project, said to be worth around $1.4 billion, could result in the fully equipped aircraft being delivered to the Indian Air Force (IAF) within four to seven years. At this stage, however, the A320 AEW&C project has yet to be given the formal go-ahead. However, “defense sources” told the Times of India yesterday that the Defense Acquisitions Council, the body that formally approves major arms procurements, could sign off on initial approval “soon.” The cost of AEW&C platforms puts them out of the reach of all but the most-wealthy — or committed — air forces, as well as an even smaller number with the high-tech industries necessary to produce this equipment indigenously, like Sweden . The value of an AEW&C capability has been proven in successive air wars, as well as in peacetime when these radar planes can scan the skies for potential intruders, not just limited to manned aircraft, but also low-flying cruise missiles and drones, as well. Modern radar planes can potentially also keep tabs on the movements of naval vessels and ground forces. The new Indian project would be run as a joint effort between the IAF and the Defense Research and Development Organization, or DRDO, which is the country’s leading R&D establishment. Mounting DRDO’s indigenously developed active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar on an adapted airliner is not a new idea in itself, but switching to the smaller, second-hand A320 option is. The A320s are expected to come in much cheaper than the A330s and, being second-hand, would be available for conversion much quicker than the alternative Airbus platform. A model of the previously proposed A330-based AEW&C aircraft., YouTube Screencap The projected cost of the A320 AEW&C program also compares favorably to the roughly $600 million that is being asked for the two A-50EI aircraft that are also currently being sought. These aircraft are planned to join three examples already in service, and all will be equipped with Israeli-made Phalcon AESA radar. Indian Air Force A-50EI. , Michael Sender/Wikimedia Commons Acquiring more A-50EIs is not necessarily straightforward, however, since they don’t use the preferred indigenous radar and the Il-76 platform on which the A-50EI is based, is no longer in production. The lack of available Il-76 airframes has also led China to look to other aircraft types to meet its own AEW&C requirements. In addition, they are costly, which seems to have been the reason that the Indian government has still not signed off on a deal for the two additional examples. At one point, it might have been expected that the IAF would seek a follow-on purchase of Embraer EMB-145 AEW&C aircraft, two of which currently serve the IAF, where they are known as the Netra. Like the proposed A320 AEW&C, these are outfitted with DRDO radar. However, the Brazilian Embraer company previously faced corruption charges in India, related to alleged kickbacks involved in the original EMB-145 AEW&C deal. This clearly put the company out of the running for the time being. Indian Air Force EMB-145 AEW&C., Venkat Mangudi/Wikimedai Commons Currently, the IAF operates something of high/low-end mix of AEW&C platforms, with the A-50EI providing a reported surveillance range of around 250 miles, and 360-degree coverage, while the EMB-145 radar range extends to around 150 miles, with coverage across a 240-degree sector. While the A320 might be a cheaper airframe option, modifying it with a DRDO radar will not be without challenges, bearing in mind integration on this particular airframe has never been done before. Indian defense media outlet Livefist reports that the ex-commercial A320s will be prepared by Airbus in France before being fitted with a dorsal antenna system, derived from that found on the EMB-145. In contrast, the A330 AEW&C would have used a mast-mounted rotodome, like the A-50. Another downside of the planned A320-based solution is that it introduces a third airframe to the country’s AEW&C fleet, adding yet more challenges to maintaining and operating what is already a highly diverse IAF inventory. On the other hand, the A320 is in widespread service around the globe, meaning that parts are widely available and it could be cheaper to fly in the long run. According to the Times of India , the IAF’s need for additional AEW&C coverage was made more evident during the country’s clashes with Pakistan’s military in the disputed Kashmir region in February 2019. That confrontation culminated in the Indian airstrike in Balakot, as well as the highly publicized loss of an IAF MiG-21 Bison fighter jet , in an incident that you can read more about here . At the same time, tensions between India and China have been increasing, with an ongoing standoff in the eastern Ladakh region that has spilled over into violence. It is notable that both these friction points involve extremely mountainous terrain in which ground-based radar is less effective, typically being unable to detect low-flying aircraft or cruise missiles. In these kinds of environments, an AEW&C aircraft is more or less essential to manage modern tactical air operations and defending one’s airspace. With twin challenges provided by China and Pakistan, Indian defense planners have reportedly identified a requirement for at least 10 AEW&C aircraft, and the A320 AEW&C might be a relatively quick, and affordable way of achieving this target. Pakistan, for its part, has a fleet of eight AEW&C aircraft, divided evenly between platforms based on the turboprop-powered Saab 2000 and Chinese-made ZDK-03 airframes. Pakistan Air Force Saab 2000 AEW&C., Dmitriy Pichugin/Wikimedia Commons China, meanwhile, operates around 30 such aircraft , including a small number of KJ-2000s, which are based on the A-50, as well as the more numerous turboprop-powered KJ-200 and KJ-500. Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force KJ-200., Allen Zhao/Wikimedia Commons Clearly, Indian officials are convinced of the value of AEW&C aircraft, but until now, their cost has prevented them from being fielded in the numbers required. This latest initiative may finally put these much-needed aircraft within reach.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 21, 2020",This Mini Vertical Launch System Can Give Small Ships And Trucks Huge Firepower,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has developed a four-round launcher for its new AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile , or JAGM, that is designed to be readily installed on warships, including relatively small patrol boats, as well as ground vehicles. This opens up entirely new possibilities for JAGM, which was initially developed primarily as an air-launched anti-tank weapon, in the surface-to-surface role. The JAGM Quad Launcher (JQL) leverages technology from Lockheed Martin’s existing Vertical Launch System (VLS) designs, which include the popular Mk 41 VLS found on numerous warships in the U.S. Navy and other navies around the world. It also uses the same Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA) from the M299 launcher , a four-rail design for helicopters most commonly associated with the AH-64 Apache . All of this combined with an open-architecture Launcher Management Assembly (LMA) designed to help speed up the integration of updated hardware and software as time goes on to improve the JQL’s capabilities and add new functionality. Lockheed Martin The JQL comes in two basic configurations, both of which are seen in the rendering above, one designed for installation on ships below deck like a traditional VLS and another one intended to be fitted on top of the decks of ships or on ground vehicles. “JQL’s LEA/LMA launch control system can be integrated with local and remote weapon control systems using wired and wireless interfaces,” a product brochure from Lockheed Martin’s says. Both designs have what might appear at first glance to be a fifth launch tube, but which is actually an exhaust that diverts the blast of the missiles firing upward, keeping the overall height of the launcher to a minimum. The below deck design features a hatch-type lid to help keep water out of the launcher. The other version simply has covers over each launch tube and the exhaust that break away when the missiles are launched. Lockheed Martin The exact physical space and power requirements needed for JQL installation are not clear, but Lockheed Martin’s promotional literature shows a rendering of two of the launchers on the back of a 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) truck. Renderings of two other example installations are shown, as well. One of these depicts four JQLs mounted on top of the pilothouse of one of the Navy’s new Mk VI patrol boats , while the other is has three of the below deck launchers fitted next to an eight-cell Mk 41 VLS array on the bow of a Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), between the forecastle and its main gun. The MMSC is an enlarged derivative of the Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) that Lockheed Martin designed for the Navy, the first customer for which is Saudi Arabia . Lockheed Martin If the JQL is as relatively easy to add to various platforms as it appears from these configurations, it could offer a significant boost in firepower for relatively small ships and vehicles when combined with the capabilities of the JAGM. This missile takes the rear portions of an AGM-114R Hellfire II missile and adds in a new, multi-mode seeker. Most existing Hellfire II missiles use semi-active laser homing to zero in on their targets. This is where an operator in the air, at sea, or on the ground must ‘lase’ a target with a laser in order for the missile to strike it. There is also the AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire variant that uses a millimeter-wave radar seeker. JAGM’s seeker can use both or either method depending on what the crew of the platform firing it feels is best for engaging the target at hand, which may be in motion. The missile can also use both modes at once, finding the target via laser designation and then homing in on it using the millimeter-wave radar, as well. This is especially useful if the laser beam were momentarily obscured by atmospheric conditions or were to otherwise break off during the terminal portion of an attack. Using the MMW seeker, the missile can in most cases still hit its target. A graphic showing a basic breakdown of the components of the AGM-179A JAGM, including the parts taken directly from the AGM-114R design., US Army A JAGM on a launcher on a US Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter during a test. Note that the data plate and a warning label with details about the missile’s weight have been blurred out., US Army Having both options available also gives the weapon an all-weather capability, as clouds, as well as smoke and other obsurants, can make lasing a target impossible. The millimeter-wave radar seeker allows the weapon to be cued to the general target area and use a lock-on-after-launch capability to find it and home in on it. For larger ships, arrays of JQLs could provide an additional layer of close-in defense against swarms of small watercraft or unmanned, explosive-laden suicide boats . The U.S. Navy has been working on integrating the AGM-114L onto some of its LCSs using a vertical launch system for exactly this purpose, an effort that would seem to be somewhat out of date now given the arrival of the more capable JAGM missile. The availability of a JQL variant that can be readily installed above deck means that this kind of protection could be rapidly added to a wide array of naval vessels, including support types that generally have very limited, if any armament, such as fleet oilers and roll-on/roll-off cargo ships. Naval vessels, including smaller patrol boats, such as the Mk VI example in Lockheed Martin’s brochure, could also make good use of these missiles against other small watercraft, amphibious landing craft, and other similarly sized threats. The exact range of the JAGM in a surface-launched configuration is unknown, but if it is anywhere near the missile’s reported maximum range of around five miles when air-launched, it is possible that naval vessels could engage targets on land close to shore, as well. At the same time, it’s interesting to note that the small AGM-176 Griffin missile , which the U.S. Navy’s Cyclone class patrol craft are presently armed with, also has a reported range of five miles when launched from the surface , though they pack a smaller warhead then JAGM. In a ground-launched configuration, JQLs could give lighter units on land an important weapon for engaging heavily armored vehicles, strong points, and other better-protected targets. Like Hellfire, JAGM also has a pop-up flight profile, meaning that it could be used against softer targets hiding behind hard cover, such as high walls or rocky outcroppings, as well. This capability could be particularly valuable during operations in dense urban areas, an environment the U.S. military, among others, sees itself increasingly likely to be fighting in as time goes on. If a single JLTV can carry eight JAGMs loaded in two JQLs. That is a lot of instantly on-demand firepower. Having multiple vehicles in this configuration would give troops the ability to rapidly engage a large number of targets at once. This could make it especially attractive to the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps, both of which operate JLTVs and are acquiring JAGMs already for their helicopters and other aerial platforms . If the launcher is capable of being install on this light tactical vehicle, one would imagine that a larger array of JQLs could fit on the back of standard two-and-a-half-ton and five-ton cargo trucks for even more firepower. In both sea and ground-based applications for the JQL, there is a question of targeting. Larger ships would likely have the organic sensors, such as a radar, to spot and track targets at appreciable ranges, as well as potentially designate them with a laser, when it makes sense, to make the most use of the JAGM’s dual-mode seeker. However, smaller boats and ground vehicles would likely need to be networked together with other assets to provide critical targeting information, such as drones, helicopters, and fixed-wing aircraft, or deploy an elevated sensor themselves. Otherwise, they would be limited to laser-designating targets one at a time, and all within line of sight. There is also the possibility that Lockheed Martin could develop a variant of the JAGM, or an entirely new missile of similar dimensions, that acts more as a kind of loitering munition , with man-in-the-loop targeting capability, such as that found on the Spike Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) missile from Israel’s Rafael. That weapon has the ability to fired at a specific area and then be manually steered onto the target by an operator who is seeing what the missile sees via a feed from an infrared camera in its nose. These weapons can be used to reconnoiter their targets before striking them, as well. Azerbaijan used Spike NLOS in this way to great effect during its recent conflict with Armenia , as seen in the video below. It is worth noting that Lockheed Martin did also demonstrate an imaging infrared seeker capability for JAGM during testing, though the initial AGM-179A variant does not feature that capability. There have also been plans in the past for follow-on versions of the missile with a tri-mode seeker, as well as extended range and other improved capabilities. It’s also interesting to point out that the U.S. Army had actually previously planned to acquire a somewhat similar capability, in the form of the XM501 Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System (NLOS-LS), as part of the abortive Future Combat Systems (FCS) program, which was canceled in 2009. In tests, the XM501, which was made up of Container Launch Units (CLU), each designed to hold 15 small missiles, together with a fire control system, was installed on a 6×6 Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) cargo truck. There were also plans to add the XM501 to the Navy’s LCSs, which has now been superseded by the aforementioned AGM-114L launch system. It is important to note that the missiles intended to go into the NLOS-LS had much greater range than Hellfire or JAGM and included a type capable of operating as a loitering munition similar to Spike-NLOS. A test of the XM501 Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System., US Army The JQL concept is also similar in some ways to work that European missile consortium MBDA is doing to develop a variety of ground, as well as sea-based, launcher options for its Brimstone missile . Brimstone looks very much like Hellfire and JAGM, visually, and also has a dual-mode laser and millimeter-wave radar seeker. All told the JQL seems to make incredible sense as a way to quickly add the JAGM missile to a wide array of new launch platforms at sea and on the ground. As the battlespace becomes increasingly networked, deploying these systems would give even diminutive vehicles brutally destructive capabilities with minimal modifications. Add a loitering munition option, and these mini-VLS modules could really increase lethality of even the lightest mechanized units on the modern battlefield.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2021","New Strategy Says U.S. Naval Forces Will Respond More Assertively To Chinese, Russian Aggression","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard have released a new, overarching tri-service strategy document for how they plan to project maritime power together going forward. The document focuses heavily on how the three services expect to fight on the high seas and adjacent areas on land. However, there is also a very important underlying discussion about adopting a more assertive approach to responding to day-to-day challenges, especially from China , and to a lesser extent, Russia , among other potential adversaries , that are short of a shooting war. The three services unveiled their new “integrated” strategy , titled “Advantage at Sea: Prevailing with Integrated All-Domain Naval Power,” on Dec. 17, 2020. The document includes discussions about of a number of concepts of operation that the trio has been openly discussing, such as a greater focus on distributed operations leveraging a dramatically reorganized Marine Corps riding on smaller amphibious warfare ships , the increased use of unmanned aircraft and naval platforms , and distributed sensor and communications networks. There is also a “renewed emphasis on fighting for and gaining sea control” in light of growing concerns about a potential higher-end future naval fight with a major adversary, such as China or Russia. The US Coast Guard’s Legend class cutter USCGC Stratton , at left, sails alongside the US Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS McCampbell during Exercise Talisman Saber off the coast of Australia in 2019., USN “Significant technological developments and aggressive military modernization by our rivals are eroding our military advantages. The proliferation of long-range precision missiles means the United States can no longer presume unfettered access to the world’s oceans in times of conflict,” the document’s forward, attributed to the top uniformed officers of each service – Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday, Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger, and Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz – reads. “Our integrated Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard must maintain clear-eyed resolve to compete with, deter, and, if necessary, defeat our adversaries while we accelerate development of a modernized, integrated all-domain naval force for the future.” The document, which you can read in full here , is clear cut in laying out a demand for America’s “Naval Service” – defined in the glossary as “The Navy and the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard – to be properly equipped and otherwise prepared to deter, and if need be fight, a high-end opponent. At the same time, it highlights how these services can expect to experience greater aggression and other geopolitical friction that may not rise to the level of an actual conflict, nevertheless hostile actions that will need to be dissuaded. Though it may seem at first glance to be talking about the potential for a future conflict with China and Russia, the second paragraph of the forward from Gilday, Berger, and Schultz lays out this reality up front and in no uncertain terms: Since the beginning of the 21st century, our three Sea Services have watched with alarm the growing naval power of the People’s Republic of China and the increasingly aggressive behavior of the Russian Federation. Our globally deployed naval forces interact with Chinese and Russian warships and aircraft daily. We witness firsthand their increasing sophistication and growing aggressiveness. Optimism that China and Russia might become responsible leaders contributing to global security has given way to recognition that they are determined rivals. The People’s Republic of China represents the most pressing, long-term strategic threat. Just in the past few years, there has been a noticeable uptick in reported near collisions during aggressive encounters between U.S. Navy warships and their Chinese and Russian counterparts . China has also been accused of targeting U.S. military aircraft, as well as those of its allies and partners, in the Pacific Region, as well as the Horn of Africa, with lasers and electronic warfare jamming , non-lethal attacks that nonetheless present very real hazards. In addition, the Chinese military, as well as its paramilitary maritime forces , has increasingly been challenging foreign commercial interests , and very aggressively so in many cases, in areas that the government in Beijing claims as its sovereign territory, including the bulk of the South China Sea . These incidents often impact the citizens of American allies and partners and have drawn rebukes from the U.S. government on multiple occasions. Earlier this year, the Navy sent warships to observe what it said were coercive Chinese activities near where a Malaysian government-chartered drillship was operating in the South China Sea, underscoring how America’s maritime forces may find themselves drawn more and more directly into these kinds of disputes in the future, as well. The US Navy’s Independence class littoral combat ship USS Gabrielle Giffords , in the foreground, sails past the drillship West Capella , operating under contract to the Malaysian government, in the South China Sea on May 12., USN Less than two full pages of “Advantage at Sea” are devoted specifically to what it refers to as “day-to-day competition,” but the introduction to the larger section on “Employing Naval Forces” includes mention of one of the most significant potential changes in the force posture across the three services found anywhere in the document. “Ready, forward-deployed naval forces will accept calculated tactical risks and adopt a more assertive posture in our day-to-day operations,” it says. It’s not entirely clear how this policy will manifest itself in practice, but the clear indication is that the Navy, as well as the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, are preparing to take a more defiant stand when another ship tries to “ run them off the road ” so to speak or an opponent’s forces otherwise accost them with some kind of action, such as laser dazzling , that is just short of outright threatening. When it comes to responding to laser attacks, specifically, there were indications earlier this year of a coming change in tactical ‘attitude’ when the Navy’s official Instagram account made a tongue-in-cheek post aimed at China saying “You don’t want to play laser tag with us.” A screenshot of the Navy’s “laser tag” Instagram post in February 2020., Instagram screencap With that in mind, the new naval strategy document also says that “we will outfit deploying assets with IFCs [intermediate force capabilities] and will factor them into requirements documents for appropriate future platforms,” further defining IFCs as “scalable armaments that can deliver effects short of lethal  force.” These three services already employ a mix of non-lethal capabilities, including laser dazzlers and acoustic hailing devices , the latter of which also can be used to broadcast painful loud noise. The Navy is also in the midst of a major push to integrate various kinds of directed energy weapons across its fleets, some of which are designed to produce non-lethal effects, at least in part. It’s worth noting that this change in posture would likely impact how the Navy reacts to altercations with smaller adversaries, such as Iran or North Korea , as well. A swarm of small Iranian watercraft notably harassed a group of Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Persian Gulf earlier this year, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten to have the Navy respond with lethal force in future altercations. At the time, there was no indication that that either service’s rules of engagement had changed. All of this is immediately significant as it raises questions about how the risk calculus will take into account the potential for greater escalation as a result of these more assertive responses. Compared to a major conflict, which would be a high-impact, if low-probability type event, as this new tri-service document makes clear, these kinds of lower-impact altercations are increasingly routine. “Advantage at Sea” lays out a strategy for operations outside of conflict that is only likely to prompt more of this kind of friction as time goes on, too. “Navy and Coast Guard ships conduct freedom of navigation operations globally , challenging excessive and illegal maritime claims. Coast Guard cutters and law enforcement detachments aboard Navy and allied ships exercise unique authorities to counter terrorism, weapons proliferation, transnational crime , and piracy,” the tri-service strategy says. “All three services enforce sanctions through maritime interdiction operations, often as part of international task forces .” “Together with international and whole-of-government efforts, the Naval Service will detect and document our rivals’ actions that violate international law,  steal resources, and infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations. We will provide evidence of malign activities to U.S. and international officials to expose this behavior and increase the reputational costs for aggressors,” it continues. “Forward naval forces, leveraging our complementary law-enforcement authorities and military capabilities, will stand ready to disrupt malign activities through assertive operations. Our expanded efforts will refute the false narratives of our rivals and demonstrate the United States’ commitment to protecting the rules-based order.” The mention of “unique authorities” and “complementary law-enforcement authorities” when talking about the Coast Guard helps to underscore the value of further integrating that service in day-to-day Navy and the Marine Corps operations. The Coast Guard, while a uniformed military service, has the legal remit to carry out a host of law enforcement activities that other military personnel cannot, by law. Members of an embarked Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET), including one with an M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle, stand next to a US Navy SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopter on the deck of the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate USS Underwood during a counter-narcotics patrol in 2012., USN None of this, of course, is to say that these three services shouldn’t prepare for actual conflicts, including higher-end ones, or that they aren’t. In fact, the strategy document highlights how operations outside of a traditional shooting war can help lay valuable groundwork should such a fight erupt. “Effective competition upholds the rules-based order, denies our rivals’ use of incremental coercion, and creates the space for American diplomatic, political, economic, and technological advantages to prevail over the long term,” it says. “Working alongside our allies and partners, our operations, exercises, and engagements must set the conditions for a future in which our rivals are deterred from malign behaviors and aggression—and, if deterrence fails, a future in which they are defeated.” While preparing for future major conflicts, including in the maritime domain, is certainly prudent, the most visible components of the U.S. military’s new tri-service naval strategy, at least in the near term, may well be how the collective naval service responds going forward to the very real challenges it faces daily.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 31, 2020",Watch This Chinese Z-8 Naval Helicopter Fly Just Feet Off The Ground Along A Highway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Here at The War Zone , we’ve spent a fair amount of time examining scarcely believable videos of helicopters in action, doing spectacular things either remarkable , unfortunate , or, in some cases, just plain dangerous . While a surprising low-level flyby is, by now, something of a staple of military chopper videos , this might be the first example we’ve seen that emanates from the People’s Republic of China. At least two versions of the video, one slightly longer than the other, have been doing the rounds on social media, apparently first being posted to the Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo. Filmed from a car, the footage begins with a People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) Changhe Z-8 helicopter flying alongside a highway, heading in the opposite direction. The video then resumes with the helicopter having descended much lower, swooping just over the heads of the occupants in the car, before continuing to follow the road ahead flying so low its wheels nearly touch the surface. The first view of the Z-8, seen through the driver’s side window., via Twitter When and where the video was shot is not clear, but the real question is exactly what was going on here? While the road seems free of traffic, other than the car from which the clip was filmed, it’s a highly risky maneuver to pull off without some thorough prior planning and safety measures. With that in mind, it remains possible that this was a prearranged stunt of some kind. In the first part of one of the videos, with the Z-8 flying alongside the car at what looks like a much safer level, the highway has three lanes, while the portion with the helicopter hurtling over the roof of the car and then carrying on up the road features a two-lane road. The Z-8 involved is a pretty big helicopter. Its maximum takeoff weight is said to be close to 29,000 pounds, compared to around 22,000 pounds for a U.S. Army UH-60M Black Hawk, and is powered by three engines. The Z-8 was based on the French-designed SA321 Super Frelon , which China acquired in small numbers in the late 1970s. Land-based and maritime versions of the Z-8 have been fielded by various branches of the People’s Liberation Army for many years, with versions including the Z-8J transport, Z-8S for search and rescue, and Z-8JH for medical evacuation. However, the helicopter in the video seems to be the Z-8C, the latest maritime derivative that’s used for search and rescue, utility, and training. The C-model features a nose-mounted weather radar, a forward-looking infrared sensor, searchlights, and a reconfigured, box-like engine compartment atop the fuselage. It is also fitted with a crash position indicator, a kind of detachable radio beacon that helps mark the helicopter’s position if it goes down, which is seen below the tail boom, clearly visible as the orange-colored turret in the video. Andreas Rupprecht, an expert on Chinese military aerospace and friend of The War Zone who tweets as @RupprechtDeino , has suggested that the helicopter’s lack of markings could point to its use by the PLA Navy Marine Corps, which has only relatively begun to receive any kind of rotorcraft. The Marine Corps Z-8Cs are expected to go to sea aboard China’s big new amphibious assault ships, like the Type 075 that you can read more about here . Ultimately, the Z-8 is expected to be replaced by the Z-18, a considerably updated development, with more modern avionics and a redesigned fuselage, first flown in prototype form in 2010. Naval versions of the Z-18 include the Z-18F for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare and the Z-18J airborne early warning (AEW) variant with a multi-mode active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The Z-18J AEW helicopter has been seen in the past operating from the deck of the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning . For now, we simply don’t know whether this highway helicopter stunt was a pre-planned maneuver or some kind of dramatic break from protocol, but we will post any significant updates if and when we receive them.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021","Emails Show Navy’s ‘UFO’ Patents Went Through Significant Internal Review, Resulted In A Demo","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone continues to dig into the bizarre U.S. Navy patents authored by enigmatic inventor Dr. Salvatore Pais and the seemingly unusual circumstances of their approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). As part of our investigation, we recently obtained a tranche of internal emails from Naval Air Systems Command, or NAVAIR, which appear to have been sent between Pais and personnel in different NAVAIR offices. While the Navy’s exotic energy production patents remain as mysterious as ever, these emails add to the backstory surrounding the inventions of Salvatore Pais and suggest that the patents went through a more rigorous internal evaluation process than was previously known. The emails also seem to indicate that the research program that emanated from the patents did in fact result in an experimental demonstration of some sort. Last year, the publication of several unusual patents assigned to the U.S. Navy raised eyebrows due to the seemingly radical and unconventional claims found within them. These patents included bizarre technologies such as a “ high temperature superconductor ,” a “high frequency gravitational wave generator,” a force field-like “electromagnetic field generator,” a “ plasma compression fusion device ,” and a hybrid aerospace/underwater craft featuring an “inertial mass reduction device.” They truly sound like the stuff of science fiction and seem to describe the theoretical building blocks of a craft with UFO-like performance. An image from Pais’s “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device” patent., USPTO Each of the Navy inventions are credited to one Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais, who, at the time the patent applications were submitted, was an aerospace engineer at NAVAIR’s Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) in Patuxent (Pax) River, Maryland. Every one of Pais’ recent inventions depends on what the inventor calls “the Pais Effect,” described in numerous publications by the inventor as the “controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma) via accelerated spin and/or accelerated vibration under rapid (yet smooth) acceleration-deceleration-acceleration transients.” Despite the fact that leadership at NAVAIR went to bat for the patents in appeals with the USPTO, the patents and their underlying concepts have largely been scoffed at by subject matter experts due to the lack of experimental evidence provided for them and their seeming similarity to controversial and highly theoretical concepts such as mass reduction or quantum vacuum engineering. Nevertheless, The War Zone obtained a statement from Dr. Pais in a series of email correspondences in which the inventor claimed his work will be proven correct “one fine day.” Internal NAWCAD And NAVAIR Emails Contain Additional Details The internal NAVAIR emails The War Zone has recently obtained are all related to the creation of the patent application and internal review process for Pais’s seemingly bizarre “ Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device ” patent. All names within this release have been redacted, but it appears possible that many of the emails could have been written by Dr. Salvatore Pais based on portions of email signatures left unredacted, not to mention the fact that they describe Pais’s patents and publications in the first person. Still, it’s ultimately impossible to be 100% certain that these emails were indeed written by Pais himself despite The War Zone referring to the author as Pais throughout this reporting for simplicity. While much remains unknown about these patents and their provenance, these emails offer a few new details about the internal processes Pais and other NAWCAD employees at Pax River undertook in getting some of the patents approved. For one, these emails reveal that Pais made an additional $700 between 2016 and 2018 from two separate incentive awards for the “Craft Using An Inertial Mass Reduction Device” patent. USN via FOIA The emails largely discuss bureaucratic procedures and paperwork related to the invention disclosures and patent application processes. These emails include individuals from NAWCAD, including its Office of Counsel, as well as elsewhere within NAVAIR, such as the Naval Test Wing Atlantic, and at a drafting company in Uniontown, Ohio that was hired to illustrate the patent applications. USN via FOIA The invention disclosure forms contained in these releases show that Pais claims several of his patents – “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device,” “Piezoelectricity-induced High Temperature Superconductor,” “High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator,” and “Ultrahigh Intensity Electromagnetic Field Generator” – are all interrelated. The gravitational wave generator application was cited as a follow-up to both the electromagnetic wave generator application and the inertial mass reduction device application, and is also listed as a closely related patent in the high-temperature superconductor application. Disclosure form for the high-frequency gravitational wave generator., USN via FOIA All three of the invention disclosure forms (“Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device,” “Piezoelectricity-induced High Temperature Superconductor,” and “High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator”) show that these inventions were disclosed to multiple employees at NAVAIR prior to application. The emails also show that Pais’s inventions were reviewed by the Technology Transfer Office (TTO) at Pax River. According to the NAWCAD TTO Director’s LinkedIn profile , the mission of this office is to “strive to advance the mission of NAWCAD and enhance the economic well-being of the nation” and that it “promotes the use of NAWCAD laboratories and test facilities, develops strategic partnerships with external customers and partners, and commercializes intellectual property.” Pais’s inventions underwent “technical and marketing reviews” sometime in late 2015, after which Pais defended his inventions in front of the NAWCAD Invention Evaluation Board throughout 2016 and 2017. The inventions appear to have cleared this review process, as NAWCAD then subsequently submitted them individually to the USPTO for patent approval beginning in April 2016 with the “inertial mass reduction device” patent. USN via FOIA It was during the review period in late 2015 that the NAWCAD Office of Counsel cited U.S. Code of Federal Regulation 37 CFR § 501.6 , which claims the Government has the right to any invention made by an employee during working hours, “with a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information,” or “which bears a direct relation to or is made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.” NAWCAD was interested enough in Pais’s “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device” patent to cite this code and claim the patents for the U.S. Government. USN via FOIA In his invention disclosure form for the inertial mass reduction device patent, Pais signed and dated a form reading “As the invention described herein was made as a direct result of the performance of my assigned duties, I hereby agree to assign the entire right, title and interest in the invention to the government and I understand that I will retain no rights in the invention.” However, underneath Pais wrote that “There is no relationship whatsoever between my assigned duties and the invention. The invention was made independently of any job performance or assigned tasks by the Branch or Section.” He later wrote in the same disclosure form that “The entire Inventive Concept (Invention) and anything that pertains to it, was the inventor’s own work, with no government contribution whatsoever.” USN via FOIA It’s curious that NAWCAD would cite 37 CFR § 501.6 and that Pais would sign and date a form stating the invention was made “made as a direct result of the performance of my assigned duties” yet just lines later also write that there was no relationship between his duties and the invention. The inventions were also evaluated by several internal NAWCAD/NAVAIR review boards and vouched for to the USPTO by NAWCAD leadership, despite apparently having no direct correlation to Pais’s assigned duties. Pais writes in the same form that his duties as an Aerospace Engineer for NAWCAD at the time included working in Fuel Thermal Management Systems design and analysis for aircraft such as the F-18 , F-35 , and P-8A , as well as working on programs such as the Naval Power, Avionics, and Thermal Laboratory (NPATH), Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT), and Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS ). After one of his academic papers describing the patents was accepted for publication in 2016, Pais wrote in an email to several NAVAIR employees that “What is most unique about this paper is that it has already won the approval of Dr. [REDACTED], one of the world’s top authorities in Advanced Power and Propulsion/Quantum Vacuum Engineering, who has given his unreserved approval of this paper, calling it “a very good paper.” [REDACTED] has also forwarded the paper to several of his colleagues, including [REDACTED], another top subject matter expert.” USN via FOIA It’s unknown who the names redacted in this email may be, but there are a few likely candidates based on how small the fields of “Advanced Power and Propulsion” and “Quantum Vacuum Engineering” are. Works by two of the world’s authorities on the intersection of these topics, perennial ‘weird science’ contract stalwart Hal Puthoff and aerospace engineer H. David Froning, were included along with the patent application for Pais’s “craft using an inertial mass reduction device” as “Non-Patent Literature Documents.” USPTO Froning has published extensive USAF-funded studies on hypersonic vehicle design and using directed energy to aid in aircraft propulsion . In addition, the Australian-based Froning has published peer-reviewed studies on “new directions in electromagnetism for propulsion and power ” and using specially-conditioned electromagnetic fields to control nuclear fusion reactions – some of the same technologies patented by Pais on behalf of the U.S. Navy over the last several years. Froning authored the 2016 book The Halcyon Years of Air and Space Flight: And the Continuing Quest , an examination of the “remaining barriers facing our next big steps in air and space” that offers examples of “material and energy systems and propulsion and flight systems that may be needed to overcome them.” Oddly enough, an Amazon user under the title “Salvatore Cezar Pais, Ph.D.” appears to have left the book a glowing five-star Amazon review in mid-2016, and noted that the essence of the book is the development of “advanced field propulsion by the engineering of the quantum vacuum.” It’s impossible to know if this book review was indeed written by Pais himself, although it’s worth noting it was posted years before Pais’s patents were made public, which thrust his name into the public eye. Amazon Ultimately, it’s unknown who the redacted subject matter experts in the email represent. Still, some of the language in the review of Froning’s book echoes the language in some of these internal NAVAIR emails. In the same email sent on April 20, 2016, Pais wrote to numerous NAVAIR employees that “the enablement of extreme craft speeds, and thus the feasibility of intergalactic travel using current engineering materials and methods, is made possible with this publication,” while this book review wrote that Froning’s research “takes us several steps toward our ultimate civilizational goal of Intergalactic Flight” and “can occur with state of the art materials and engineering methods.” Pais closes the April 20, 2016 email by adding “One thing is for sure, the existence of this technical paper and its current acceptance by foremost authorities in the field will greatly facilitate the patent examination process, hopefully culminating in two essential patents for the technologically advanced future of the Navy.” USN via FOIA Nine days later, Pais wrote that the patent application had been filed with the USPTO, writing “[REDACTED] has done an admirable job and produced an exceptional patent application, [REDACTED] work is highly commendable. The inventive concept due to its simplicity and minimalism, despite its advanced quantum vacuum physics, pays homage to Occam’s Razor. Thank you Sir for your recommendation and your continued support.” It may be that Pais is referring Mark Glut, NAWCAD’s patent attorney at the time of the patent application. As noted in our previous reporting , Glut was awarded power of attorney throughout the patent application process for the “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device.” In a May 2017 email, Pais writes that “[Redacted] is a formidable patent lawyer,” adding that “these advanced concepts were not easy to translate into easily understandable and technically admittable patent applications.” In the same email, Pais thanks the recipient for his “vision and leadership,” writing that “our discussions have generated many great ideas” and that Pais is “extremely grateful to you for understanding and backing them.” USN via FOIA In our previous reporting on Pais’s patents, we noted that he has publicly thanked Naval Aviation Enterprise Chief Technology Officer Dr. James Sheehy in academic publications for his “many hours of thought-provoking discussions on the concept at hand.” In the emails related to the high-temperature superconductor patent, an unknown individual from the Naval Aviation Enterprise writes that “the concept has strong theoretical backing” and offers their help in the patent application process. As we have previously reported, Sheehy stepped in to write statements to the USPTO personally attesting to the operability and enablement of the concepts in Pais’s inventions. USN via FOIA After the patent application for “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device” was submitted, an unknown individual from the Naval Aviation Enterprise congratulated Pais, writing “Congratulations!! Now to build a small demo to put the theory into a demo. The sec 219 BAR/TT [Basic Applied Research/Technology Transfer] call is out – could be the genesis of a BAR/TT project.” It could be that this individual was Dr. Sheehy. In his LinkedIn profile , Sheehy writes that “as CTO he oversees and advocates the selection of S&T [Science & Technology] for the NAE,” while the individual in this email includes “ST” in their signature. Ultimately the identity of this individual remains unknown due to the level of redaction in this email. USN via FOIA Funding for the proposed Section 219 BAR/TT project mentioned in this email appears to have ultimately been granted, as Pais cites the funding his work received from it a year later in 2017 in two academic publications for radical new propulsion concepts , and again in 2019 for a “Hybrid Aerospace-Undersea Craft.” SAE Another statement made by NAWCAD leadership appears to suggest that demonstrative experiments were designed to test the “Pais Effect” as a result of this 219 BAR/TT project. In 2017, Dr. Sheehy, the Chief Technology Officer for the Naval Aviation Enterprise, wrote to the USPTO to declare that Pais was “currently funded by NAWCAD to design a test article and instrumentation to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of achieving high electromagnetic (EM) field-energy and flux values.” Sheehy added that Pais was at the time “one year into the project” and had “already begun a series of experiments to design and demonstrate advanced High energy Density/High Power propulsion systems.” According to a U.S. Navy fact sheet , Section 219 of the Fiscal Year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act, which had been amended since then, “established a mechanism whereby a defense laboratory may fund basic and applied research, transition of technologies developed by the defense laboratory into operational use, recruitment and retention of personnel with needed scientific and engineering expertise, and revitalization and recapitalization of the laboratories. Basic research is directed toward greater knowledge of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. Applied research is understanding the means to meet a recognized and specific need. It may be oriented toward the design and development of prototypes.” The same sheet adds that “technology transition moves mature technologies into programs of record.” In the emails related to the high-temperature superconductor patent application (PA), an individual with a “Navy.mil” email address suggests trying to get a phone interview with a primary examiner, noting that “we can defend this PA very well.” USN via FOIA Based on documents found in the USPTO Public Pair website related to the high-temperature superconductor patent application, we know a telephone interview between Pais, NAWCAD patent attorney Mark Glut, the primary patent examiner, and another USPTO examiner took place on June 6, 2019. In that interview, Pais argued that the theoretical basis for the high-temperature superconductor is sound despite a lack of experimental evidence. USN via FOIA The emails concerning the high-temperature superconductor show that Pais was turned down by energy research journal Joule in 2017. Joule editors wrote that “while the topic of room temperature superconductivity is of course very exciting, we would require you to provide some compelling experimental validation of your proposed theoretical pathway before we could reconsider.” However, Pais’ paper “Room Temperature Superconducting System for use on a Hybrid Aerospace-Undersea Craft” was published in the proceedings of the AIAA SciTech forum in 2019. That paper contains no experimental data. USN via FOIA The application for the high-temperature superconductor remains pending at the time of publication. Recent Scientific Breakthroughs And The Pais Patents In recent months, several major developments have made waves throughout the scientific community that reportedly achieve what Pais’s patents claim to. A radical breakthrough marking what researchers call the first room-temperature superconductor was announced in Nature in mid-October, potentially opening the door to new methods and levels of power generation. Despite the excitement, achieving this type of superconductivity requires extreme pressures, the lowest of which was 2.6 million times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. For now, the world’s first room-temperature superconductor will remain in laboratories at minuscule scales. Last month, another radical high-temperature superconductor design was revealed to the world. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and its spin-off firm Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) published seven articles in a special edition the Journal of Plasma Physics detailing a revolutionary new compact fusion reactor design. MIT/CFS claims that the reactor, known as SPARC , could very well be “the first net-energy controlled fusion experiment” in the world. According to MIT’s Martin Greenwald, Deputy Director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center and lead scientist on the SPARC project, one of the key technologies leveraged in the SPARC design is “ a newer electromagnet technology that uses so-called high temperature superconductors (HTS) that can produce a much higher magnetic field” to contain the fusion reaction within. Concept art for the SPARC reactor., MIT/CFS While these recent developments in HTS technology appear unrelated to the physical mechanisms claimed to enable the “Pais Effect,” they certainly show that mysterious inventors working behind closed doors in Department of Defense labs aren’t the only ones pursuing these “Holy Grail” technologies. As Always, Questions Remain While these internal NAVAIR emails may not alleviate the mystery surrounding the peculiar inventions of Dr. Salvatore Pais and the reasons why NAVAIR leadership vouched for their operability to the USPTO, they do add details about the inventor’s patent application process and the internal reviews that the patents underwent. Aside from adding to our understanding that Pais has consistently vouched for the patents being both incredibly revolutionary and possible to engineer with current methods and materials, these emails reveal that numerous employees of NAWCAD and the Pax River Invention Evaluation Board took them seriously enough to clear Pais’s patents for the USPTO application process. We also now know these inventions resulted in the Section 219 Basic Applied Research/Technology Transfer program that was successfully funded and resulted in a physical demonstration and further experimental testing. We also now know the inventions underwent the aforementioned technical and marketing reviews by the award-winning NAWCAD Technology Transfer Office, which, in part, facilitates technology transfer to partners outside the Navy, before the patents were applied for. Despite these new details, we are just as mystified as ever by these bizarre patents and what they might mean for the “technologically advanced future of the Navy.” We have yet to find any experimental validation or subject matter experts who can confirm Pais’s theories. Regardless, The War Zone continues to pursue multiple FOIA requests related to these patents and the research projects that led to them. The FOIA releases can be read in their entirety below.

Boyd for providing The War Zone with this FOIA release. 2020-010055 FINAL VERSION Email.pdf Download 2020-010055 FINAL VERSION RECORD AND DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION_PAIS_05-17-17.pdf Download"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 26, 2022",Qatar Executes An Incredible “Elephant Walk” Showcasing Its Growing Air Combat Might,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Qatar Emiri Air Force, which finds itself in the midst of an extraordinary period of expansion, has staged an impressive “elephant walk,” involving everything from frontline fighter jets to fixed-wing transports and support helicopters. The video also shows, apparently for the first time, an AGM-114 Hellfire missile launch by the service’s recently delivered AH-64E Apache helicopter gunships. The video, which bears all the hallmarks of being an official Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF) production, appeared on YouTube recently, but it’s not clear exactly when it was produced and nor is it immediately obvious where it was filmed. the Qatari “superbase” at Al Udeid — which also houses a significant U.S. military presence — is an obvious candidate. C-17A Globemaster IIIs., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The concept of the elephant walk is by now familiar from various U.S. Air Force readiness drills that involve the generation of a massive number of sorties, and these have included diverse types such as the F-15C/D Eagle , F-22A Raptor , and the F-35A Lightning II . Sometimes, elephant walks involve mixed aircraft types, for example, the one launched by Osan Air Base in South Korea that featured the resident F-16s and A-10s. The U.S. Marine Corps has also got in on the act, with its CH-53s and MV-22s , and foreign air forces , too, are increasingly using these impressive shows of force to practice generating multiple sorties simultaneously, displaying a level of readiness that could be utilized during a full-blown crisis. What’s impressive about this Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF) exercise is not just the sheer number of individual airframes involved, but also the variety of different aircraft types. In the United States, we’ve seen co-located F-22s, KC-135s, and C-17s team up for an elephant walk, as well as an unusual combination of B-52s, KC-135s, and an RQ-4B Global Hawk drone together with a U.S. Navy MH-60S Seahawk helicopter and MQ-4C Triton drone. Meanwhile, the Qatari iteration involves Dassault Rafale multirole fighters, C-17 and C-130J transports, plus AH-64E and AW139 helicopters, drawn from all three of the QEAF’s airbases. You can see the video in its entirety below: https://youtube.com/watch?v=UZEg44__kPk As well as seeing these aircraft taxiing out and lining up on the runway, the footage includes aerial action sequences, including formation flying, delivery of cargo and paratroopers, and the live-fire of the Hellfire missile. The video opens with the Rafale, which is currently the most advanced fighter jet in service with the QEAF, although it’s soon to be joined by the F-15QA , described as the most advanced Eagle to date and an aircraft that you can read all about in detail here . Remarkably, Qatar has three new fighter types on order, with additional Rafales to be joined in the future by Eurofighter Typhoons , on which Qatari pilots are already training , as well. Single-seat Rafale EQ., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The Qatari order for the French-made Rafale dates back to 2015 when an agreement was reached for the QEAF to acquire 24 examples, split between 18 single-seat EQ and six twin-seat DQ variants, together with associated weapons produced by the European missile consortium MBDA , at a total cost of around $7.05 billion. Although not confirmed, reports suggest that the Qatari weapons package includes SCALP-EG conventionally armed cruise missiles, Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs), MICA IR and MICA EM AAMs, and possibly Exocet anti-ship missiles. Unusually, Qatar specified the Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-33 Sniper targeting pod and the Israeli Elbit TARGO II helmet-mounted cueing system for its Rafales. The first five Rafales for the QEAF arrived at the newly established Tamim Air Base on the western coast of the Middle East peninsula in June 2019. In the meantime, Qatar exercised an option to buy 12 more Rafales in 2017, which will bring the Qatari total to 36 aircraft. Combined with the 36 F-15QA and 24 Typhoon jets on order, the QEAF is rapidly heading from being a relatively modest air force to one of the most powerful in the region. Next up is the AH-64E, wearing the QEAF’s unique desert camouflage scheme for the type. The Apache Guardian, as it is also known, is another recent, high-end addition to the QEAF. An order for 24 of these attack helicopters was announced in 2014, together with three Boeing 737 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, although plans to acquire these have since been shelved. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a proposed $3-billion Foreign Military Sale of 24 AH-64Es to Qatar back in 2012. The DSCA stated at the time that the deal would also include up to 576 AGM-114R Hellfire II missiles, 295 FIM-92H Stinger Reprogrammable Micro Processor (RMP) Block I Missiles, and 4,092 2.75-inch Hydra rockets . YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The first Qatari AH-64E was handed over during a formal ceremony at Boeing’s Mesa production plant in Arizona in March 2019 and, at the time, deliveries were scheduled to be completed last summer , although it is not clear whether or not this happened. In its final guise, the Qatari Apache order was valued at $2.44 billion and the country also has options for up to 24 additional examples. These rotorcraft mark a considerable advance over the Aérospatiale SA342L Gazelle that was previously used in a close support role. Another modern type, the Leonardo AW139 is a medium-sized twin-engined helicopter that’s used for a variety of roles within the QEAF, 21 examples being employed for utility, troop transport, search and rescue, border patrol, and special forces operations. The AW139 was also recently adopted by the U.S. Air Force, which is in the process of acquiring 84 examples of the MH-139A Gray Wolf variant, which you can read more about here . AW139., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The QEAF transport arm is represented in the video by C-130Js and at least six C-17s, which serve with the Transport Wing based at Al Udeid. In all, the QEAF has eight C-17s and four C-130Js, which provide an air mobility capability that was previously absent. Uniquely, one of the C-17s is painted in full Qatar Airways livery , rather than military camouflage, but it was apparently not involved in the elephant walk. The civilian-looking C-17 emphasizes the type’s use for humanitarian and disaster-relief missions, on which it has been heavily engaged. The Qatari Globemaster III fleet also includes the very last example to roll out of the Long Beach, California, factory in 2015. C-130J Hercules., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP C-17A Globemaster IIIs., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP After we see Rafales and C-17s taxiing on parallel runways, the perspective of the video switches to a view down the runway, revealing a spectacular line-up of at least 18, and possibly more, Rafales, followed by the C-17s. Further along the runway, ahead of the Rafales, are three AW139s and four AH-64s, which would have departed before the fixed-wing types. YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The aerial sequences include a four-ship formation of Rafales, accompanied by an example of their predecessor, the Mirage 2000 , and the Hellfire launch by the AH-64E, followed by a demonstration of the low-altitude parachute-extraction system (LAPES) airlift delivery method by a C-17, while paratroopers leap out of a C-130J. Rafale four-ship formation., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP AH-64E launches an AGM-114 Hellfire., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP LAPES airlift delivery by a C-17., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Energy-rich and increasingly active on the world stage, Qatar is rapidly reorganizing its armed forces and, in the process, the QEAF is growing from a single fighter squadron, a small transport wing, plus several helicopter units, to one of the most capable air forces in the Middle East. This is all happening despite accusations of Qatar supporting terrorist groups, which led to a diplomatic crisis beginning in 2017, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, among others severed diplomatic relations with the country and instituted a regional blockade against it. Thumbs-up from an AH-64E pilot., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP All in all, the video provides a dramatic indication of the strides toward modernization and expansion that have been made by the QEAF in recent years. What’s even more impressive is the fact that this growth is still underway and with the forthcoming delivery of both F-15QA and Typhoon jets, plus more Rafales, the fighter fleet alone will more than triple in size in the years to come.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 17, 2020",Russia’s Reborn Il-114 Transport Aircraft Eyed For Specialized Military Roles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation today completed a successful first flight of the new Ilyushin Il-114-300 turboprop aircraft. Although billed primarily as a regional passenger transport, it’s anticipated that the platform could eventually serve as the basis for a variety of military special-mission aircraft, superseding a number of Cold War-era types now in service with the Russian military, including aging electronic warfare and maritime patrol platforms. The Il-114-300’s maiden flight took place at Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, with a crew consisting of Ilyushin’s chief pilot Nikolai Kuimov, test pilot Dmitry Komarov, and onboard test engineer Oleg Gryazev. The Il-114-300 demonstrator during its first flight on December 16. , United Aircraft Corporation To long-term observers of Russia’s aerospace industries, the twin-turboprop Il-114-300 may look familiar. In fact, the original Il-114 prototype first flew back in 1990, when there were high hopes that it could be a pioneering, Western-oriented regional airliner tailored for the Perestroika -era market. When it first took to the air, the Soviet Union was still intact, and production of the 64-seat Il-114 airliner was assigned to a factory in Tashkent, in what then the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. A year later, the Soviet Union was disintegrating and only 15 production Il-114s ever came out of the Tashkent plant, between 1992 and 2012. Uptake among airlines was, unsurprisingly, limited. Currently, there is only thought to be one of the original Il-114s flying anywhere in the world. This is the specially adapted Il-114LL “flying laboratory” that’s used by Russia’s Radar MMS company for trials of new radars and other avionics. The Il-114LL testbed operated by the Radar MMS company, which is based in Saint Petersburg., Igor Dvurekov/Wikimedia Commons The basic design of the Il-114 was sound, though, and in 2015 Russia decided that it would itself relaunch production of the aircraft, in a new, updated, and “Russianized” form. This is the Il-114-300 that differs primarily in its choice of powerplant. With a view to selling Il-114s around the globe, the original design featured turboprops from Pratt & Whitney Canada, as well as avionics supplied by American firm Rockwell Collins. In its Il-114-300 form, the aircraft is equipped with Russian-made Klimov TV7-117ST-01 turboprops — each developing 3,100 horsepower — plus Russian avionics. This makes it more suitable for the domestic market, especially in more remote regions, where the support of Western-made equipment is limited and, importantly, could allow it to be more readily adapted for military use. The president of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), Yuri Slyusar has already said that military versions of the Il-114-300 will be developed to replace the “old Ilyushin airplanes with special systems.” Although he didn’t mention any aircraft by name, it’s fairly clear that Slyusar was referring to a range of types that were developed many years ago in the Soviet Union on the basis of another Ilyushin turboprop airliner, the Il-18. The resulting military aircraft were the Il-20 Coot electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft that first flew in 1969, the Il-22 Coot airborne command post and electronic warfare aircraft that was first flown in 1970, and the Il-38 May maritime patrol aircraft that dates back to 1961. The first two of these still serve with the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, while the Il-38 continues to be flown by the Russian Navy. All have been periodically upgraded since entering service. An Il-20M Coot-A ELINT aircraft, the standard operational version of this type., Alan Wilson/Wikimedia Commons An Il-22M Coot-B, with spurious markings suggesting it is an Il-18 transport., Anna Zvereva/Wikimedia Commons An upgraded Russian Navy Il-38 May maritime patrol aircraft., Alex Beltyukov/Wikimedia Commons Back in the late 1990s, Ilyushin had unveiled plans for the Il-114PR and Il-114PRP versions that would have carried various signal intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, together with a maritime patrol derivative of the same platform known variously as the Il-114MP and Il-138. There was also a proposed Il-140 airborne early warning and control version, but this requirement would seem to have vanished now that work is well underway on the larger and more capable A-100, which is a more advanced development of the existing A-50 Mainstay that The War Zone has discussed in detail in the past. Of all the proposed Il-114-300 military derivatives, we currently know most about the Il-114MP. This version is intended to supersede the Il-38 and would be equipped for maritime patrol, including sensors for detection and tracking of both surface vessels and submarines, and weapons for attacking them. A desktop model of the Il-114MP. Note the unusual cruciform antennas on the fuselage, likely part of the electronic support measures array., Piotr Butowski The overall mission system for this aircraft is known as Kasatka, Russian for killer whale, which includes a radar and an electro-optical turret, as well as a sonobuoy system, magnetic anomaly detector , and electronic support measures for detecting radio transmissions. The 360-degree radar would be installed under the fuselage, the electro-optical turret below the nose, the magnetic anomaly detector atop the tail fin, and the six electronic support measures antennas distributed around the fuselage. Trials of the Kasatka system have already taken place using the Il-114LL testbed. Planned armament for the Il-114MP includes a pair of Kh-35 (AS-20 Kayak) subsonic anti-ship missiles, variants of which already serve Russia in ground-launched and ship-based forms. Alternatively, aerial mines could be carried. An export version of the Kh-35 anti-ship missile., Allocer/Wikimedia Commons In August 2019, Russian media outlet Interfax quoted Denis Manturov, the head of the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, as saying that plans were already underway to develop replacements for both the Il-38 and the larger Tu-142 Bear-F maritime patrol aircraft, the latter derived from the Tu-95 Bear bomber and missile-carrier. A Russian Navy Tu-142 Bear-F approaching United Kingdom airspace in March 2020., Crown Copyright “The Ministry of Defense recently set the task for developers to prepare proposals for the creation of a new patrol aircraft based on existing models,” Manturov said, adding that a “fundamental choice” would be made in 2019. It’s not clear whether the Russian Ministry of Defense has already formally selected the Il-114MP and, if so, whether it is intended to replace the Il-38 and the Tu-142. Another option would be to further upgrade the Tu-142, the airframes of which still have many remaining flying hours, the most recent having been completed in the mid-1990s. Furthermore, the Kasatka suite has also been suggested as an upgrade for the Russian Navy Bears. Ilyushin has also pitched a less-sophisticated maritime patrol version of the aircraft, the Il-114P, which would be suitable for patrol of littoral zones including maritime borders and economic zones, or alternatively for ecological monitoring, including aerial pollution reconnaissance . This would be fitted with a pared-down version of the Kasatka suite, with only the radar and electro-optical turret. Other optional stores would include various pods carrying, for example, guns, searchlights, loudspeakers, or rescue equipment. The Il-114P might be attractive to paramilitary operators in Russia, such as the Federal Security Service, better known by its Russian acronym FSB, which currently uses around half a dozen twin-turbofan An-72P aircraft for armed transport and patrol. An An-72P at Vladivostok Airport. Note the gun pod carried under the forward fuselage and the rocket pod under the wing. , Fedor Leukhin/Wikimedia Commons Other military or paramilitary derivatives of the Il-114-300 have been discussed, too. These include the Il-114-300L, the latter equipped with skids for Arctic operations. With Moscow’s increasing focus on the Arctic as a potential theater of military operations , this variant could find a use in supporting the country’s bases in the region . It remains to be seen how realistic all these plans are, especially since the Il-114-300 program itself has suffered some delays. Originally, the Il-114-300 was planned to make its first flight in September 2020. What is more, the prototype is actually a reworked example of the original Il-114, utilizing an airframe that was completed in Tashkent in 1994. Meanwhile, even official industry estimates foresee a demand for only around 30 aircraft to meet the needs of Russian airlines, although Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin has confidently predicted a production run of “at least 150,” plus more for the military. There are no records of firm orders so far. Should the Il-114-300 enter series production, for civil and/or military customers, it will be built at the Lukhovitsy plant near Moscow. Slyusar has said that up to 12 examples could be built there annually. This would be welcome work for the factory, which is otherwise responsible for manufacturing the MiG-29M and MiG-35 multirole fighter jets, orders for which have been limited, especially on the domestic front. There is likely limited potential for follow-on fighter work here, too, with prospects of building a new Russian lightweight fighter seemingly remote, as we have discussed in the recent past . A first fully Russian-made Il-114-300 is not expected to be completed before 2021, with tentative plans for operational service, in passenger configuration, from 2023. Thereafter, time will tell if the aircraft provides a much-needed successor to some of Russia’s military special-mission platforms.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 16, 2022",Dutch Marines Prepare For Arctic Warfare With New Machine Gun-Armed Sleds,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dutch Marine units will soon be armed with machine guns mounted on small sleds, known as pulks. The Netherlands Marine Corps recently acquired these and three other types of pulks to be better prepared to operate with the country’s other NATO allies in the increasingly strategic Arctic region . The Netherlands Marine Corps announced earlier today that its units heading to a training exercise in Norway would be the first to be equipped with these sleds. The four types consist of the version fitted with a 7.62mm FN MAG machine gun , which is just under four feet long, along with ones with lengths that are around four and a half feet, close to five feet, and a little over five and a half feet, for individual use, to carry additional ammunition and other gear for machine gun teams, and for general purpose use, respectively. A pulk fitted with an FN MAG machine gun, which the Netherlands Marine Corps recently adopted, alongside other types that it is also putting into service., Netherlands Marine Corps A post about the pulks on the Netherlands Marine Corps official Facebook page notes that its personnel need to carry significant amounts of additional gear, including “(extra) clothing, fuel and tents,” when operating in Arctic conditions. “As a result, Marines are now carrying a heavy backpack while moving on skis in snowy areas.” The issue, of course, is that even basic movements, on foot or on ski, in these conditions are simply more grueling for Dutch Marines compared to treks across similar distances in more temperate conditions. The large loads that each individual is required to carry take an additional toll. A pulk, which an individual can simply drag behind them, gets all that weight off their shoulders and makes it that much easier to move across terrain covered in deep snow. Snowmobiles , as well as various kinds of animals , can also be used to pull pulks. All four types of pulks units of the Netherlands Marine Corps are now beginning to receive., Netherlands Marine Corps The four-and-a-half-foot-long pulk intended for individual use., Netherlands Marine Corps A Dutch Marine carrying a very large backpack., USN The machine gun-armed example also provides a stable firing platform for that weapon in snowy conditions, where it might be difficult to use the weapon’s own integral bipod or a traditional tripod. The use of pulks and other kinds of sleds to move weapons and other military gear in snowy environments is hardly new, with the practice certainly dating back decades, if not centuries or longer. Major armed forces around the world, including the Russian military , use various kinds of sleds for Arctic operations. These kinds of sleds are also often employed by recreational skiers and campers. The word pulk in English is itself derived from words in various Scandinavian languages referring to these kinds of sleds, which have been in widespread use for generations in that part of the world. Russian paratroopers on skis pull pulks during a training exercise in the Arctic., via @RALee85 Still, the Netherlands Marine Corps’ acquisition of these sleds underscores the increasing significance of the Arctic and surrounding environments in military planning among many countries. This is especially true for many members of the NATO Alliance, including the United States, which are seeking to head off Russia’s growing military presence in these same areas, including an expanding network of bases above the Arctic Circle. With this in mind, the Russian military has also been acquiring various specialized systems, including small snowmobiles and buggies configured for Arctic use, to support operations in extreme cold weather conditions. Russian troops ride in a very large pulk pulled by a snowmobile., Russian MoD The Arctic, in general, is becoming an area of great geopolitical interest as global climate change causes ice in the region’s waterways to recede and the periods during which thick ice is present to shrink. This has opened up the potential for new economic opportunities, including commercial Arctic shipping routes , oil and gas exploitation, and expanded areas for fishing, which, in turn, promises to increase international competition and the risk of conflict . The Netherlands Marine Corps expects to have its two Marine Combat Groups, its main combat units, fully equipped with pulks next year. As such, if conflict does break out between NATO and any potential opponent in the Arctic, Dutch Marines pulling machine gun-armed sleds will now be among the forces ready to respond.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 20, 2020",Artificial Intelligence Takes Control Of A U-2 Spy Plane’s Sensors In Historic Flight Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Artificial intelligence-driven algorithms controlled sensor and navigation systems on a U.S. Air Force U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane in a flight test yesterday. The service says that this is the first time that artificial intelligence has been “safely” put in charge of any U.S. military system and appears to be the first time it has been utilized on a military aircraft anywhere in the world, at least publicly. The test , which took place on Dec. 15, 2020, involved a U-2S from the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in California. The Air Force has dubbed the artificial intelligence (AI) software package as ARTUµ, the latest in a string of references to the iconic droid from the Star Wars universe, who serves as a sort of robotic flight engineer and navigator, in recent Air Force projects having to do with developments in AI and autonomous flight. A U-2S Dragon Lady., Lockheed Martin “ARTUµ’s groundbreaking flight culminates our three-year journey to becoming a digital force,” Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, an outspoken advocate of incorporating this kind of technology across the service, said in a statement. “Putting AI safely in command of a U.S. military system for the first time ushers in a new age of human-machine teaming and algorithmic competition. Failing to realize AI’s full potential will mean ceding decision advantage to our adversaries.” Roper also confirmed the details of the test in a Tweet today. He has been teasing the disclosure of a major Air Force development related in some way to the U-2 since Dec. 6. “Call sign ‘Artuμ,’ we modified world-leading μZero gaming algorithms to operate the U-2’s radar,” Roper wrote in his Tweet about the test. “This first AI copilot even served as mission commander on its seminal training flight!” The μZero algorithm has been used by computers to play chess, Go, and video games in the past, “without prior knowledge of their rules,” Roper further explained in a piece he wrote for Popular Mechanics about this test. The U-2 Federal Laboratory helped integrate the modified ARTUμ version of this software package onto the U-2S aircraft. In Popular Mechanics , Roper described yesterday’s flight test as follows: Our demo flew a reconnaissance mission during a simulated missile strike at Beale Air Force Base on Tuesday. ARTUµ searched for enemy launchers while our pilot searched for threatening aircraft, both sharing the U-2’s radar. With no pilot override, ARTUµ made final calls on devoting the radar to missile hunting versus self-protection. Luke Skywalker certainly never took such orders from his X-Wing sidekick! … Like a breaker box for code, the U-2 gave ARTUµ complete radar control while “switching off” access to other subsystems. Had the scenario been navigating an asteroid field—or more likely field of enemy radars—those “on-off” switches could adjust. The design allows operators to choose what AI won’t do to accept the operational risk of what it will. Creating this software breaker box—instead of Pandora’s—has been an Air Force journey of more than a few parsecs. It’s not clear what radar Roper was referring to, as a traditional air search radar is not among the U-2S’ typical payloads, though versions of the aircraft have carried them in tests in the past. It is possible that the latest iterations of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2 ( ASARS-2 ) radar imaging system, which Dragon Ladies routinely carry and features two sideways-looking electronically-scanned array radar antennas on either side of a specially designed nose module, could be used to search for aerial threats. U-2s also regularly carry powerful signals and electronic intelligence payloads that can detect, categorize, and geolocate various emitters, including those from hostile radars. It’s defensive electronic warfare suite is also among the most capable in the world. It’s also worth noting that the Air Force has been using the U-2S as a platform to test a wide array of advanced software developments in recent months. In October, the service disclosed that it had used a new software package that allowed a Dragon Lady to update its mission systems in flight for the first time ever, something you read about more in this previous War Zone story . At the time, Roper said that this included the addition of new target recognition algorithms onto the aircraft. It’s unclear if that code is in any way related to what was employed in this latest flight test. Dr. Jeannine Abiva, U-2 Federal Laboratory Director of Advanced Mathematics and Algorithm Development (left), and Dr. Jesse Angle, U-2 Federal Laboratory Technical Director, work on a computer Sept. 21, 2020, at Beale Air Force Base, California., USAF In addition, just this week, Lockheed Martin announced that U-2S had established a link with computers on the ground to use that offbroad processing power to help run its sensor systems. You can read more about that distributed computing flight test, in this recent War Zone piece . “[The AI’s] role was very narrow … but, for the tasks the AI was presented with, it performed well,” the pilot of the U-2 in the test yesterday, who the service has only identified by their callsign, Vudu, said, according to The Washington Post . “For the most part I was still very much the pilot in command.” Air Force Major “Vudu” sits in the cockpit of the U-2S Dragon Lady used in the Dec. 15, 2020, flight test., USAF Still, the delegation of these tasks to an artificial intelligence-driven “copilot,” as Roper referred to ARTUµ, even in a test, represents a significant milestone for the Air Force, as well as the U.S. military as a whole. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force highlighted how AI will be critical to helping pilots, as well as the operators of various other systems, manage ever-increasing and more complex workloads , and speed up decision-making cycles. At the same time, the humans in the chain will need to be able to trust in their machines to reliably make the right calls or suggest the best courses of action. There is certainly still much work to be done. Roper says ARTUµ is a “pathfinder” project to help prove out AI’s potential contributions. He added that the development of this initial software package traces its roots back at least three years with the establishment of Detachment 12 of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, nicknamed Kessel Run , another Star Wars reference . Kessel Run, which has the motto “Code. Deploy Win.,” was created to craft novel approaches to the development and acquisition of advanced software within the service. In 2018, the Pentagon set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) to help coordinate and oversee AI-related developments across the U.S. military. Even before this flight test, the U.S. Air Force has already been active in space, most notably in the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Skyborg program , which is seeking to create a suite of AI-driven systems that will be able to fly semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones , as well as fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). AFRL is also running a separate project, dubbed R2-D2, to develop an autonomous drone using AI-driven systems that is expected to square off against a human pilot in a fighter jet by 2024. Earlier this year, an AI algorithm bested a real Air Force pilot in a completely virtual dogfight as part of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s AlphaDogfight Trails. That effort is related to DARPA’s broader Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, which is exploring how AI could offer various kinds of advanced capabilities in the context of future aerial combat. DARPA also developed an entire library of AI algorithms relating to the operation of autonomous unmanned aircraft as part of its Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program, which it subsequently transferred to the U.S. Navy. An “autonomy engine” using software developed for CODE was recently used in a separate flight test involving a stealthy General Atomics Avenger drone conducting a mock aerial search mission. “Like any pilot, Artuμ (even the real R2-D2) has strengths and weaknesses,” Roper wrote on Twitter about this new, historic flight test involving the U-2. “Understanding them to prep both humans and AI for a new era of algorithmic warfare is our next imperative step. We either become sci-fi or become history.” This flight test of a U-2S with this artificial intelligence-driven software package certainly puts the Air Force one step closer to fielding capabilities that were previously only imaginable in the realm of science fiction.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian Navy submarine, firing a wall of water from one of its bow torpedo tubes, gave a handful of onlookers a serious shower in a video that seems to have been taken at a Baltic Fleet base. What we see in the dramatic sequence, which has been slowed down, is what’s known as a “water slug,” when a submarine rapidly empties the water contained within an otherwise unloaded torpedo tube. The process of loading and then firing a torpedo from a submarine is a surprisingly complex one and is something that The War Zone has looked at in detail in the past. Suffice to say, it’s a balancing act between the weight of the torpedo, the water that fills the tube around it, and the pressurized air that’s used to force the weapon out of the tube and then move more water back in. All this is carefully managed with a system of valves, using reserves of water and air that are already on the submarine, to ensure that the boat’s own center of gravity is preserved throughout the firing sequence and that water pressure is the same inside the tube as it is outside the hull. The aftermath of the “water slug,” with a deluge of water pouring back off the harborside., VIA TWITTER It is a convoluted process and it means that, when a submarine and its crew are on exercise or otherwise training, a torpedo often won’t actually be loaded into the tube at all. That appears to be the case for this Russian Navy submarine in the video, seen below, which looks to be one of the Baltic Fleet’s Kilo class diesel-electric boats, although this is hard to confirm. However, in the background is the Russia Navy’s Steregushchiy class corvette Soobrazitelny , also assigned to the Baltic Fleet, which is readily identifiable by its hull number. If the Tweet below does not appear, you can find the video here . With a submarine’s torpedo tubes in an unarmed state, when the call comes for a launch, the water filling the flooded tube will be forced out the muzzle instead. This is the ‘water slug’ and blasting it out fairly well represents an actual torpedo launch, providing training for the crew, as well as for any sonars or acoustic equipment that may be listening in, even though no weapon is actually fired. Since no torpedo is fired from the submarine during a water slug “launch,” this means it’s quite possible to execute with a submarine moored up in the harbor. Provided there’s enough clearance, the worst that should happen is that anyone standing too close is likely to get drenched. It looks as if this is exactly what happened here. Fortunately, the four individuals on the receiving end of the mock torpedo attack seem to have been well prepared, while a passing dog seems to have escaped unscathed entirely. It just goes to show that in this kind of mock dockside standoff between human and submarine, there is only likely to be one winner.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 16, 2021",Ramstein Air Base In Germany Experiences Potential Incoming Missile Scare (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a seemingly odd sequence of events today, The War Zone was made aware that Ramstein Air Base in Germany, America’s massive central European military hub, alerted its personnel of a potential incoming missile strike. After the strike never materialized, the sprawling installation’s command post put out a notice stating that “the missile launch was then assessed to be part of a training exercise” and wasn’t deemed a threat to the base. You can read the entire message below: “Attention Team Ramstein, Today, the Ramstein Air Base Command Post was notified via an alert notification system of a real-world missile launch in the European theater. The Command Post followed proper procedure and provided timely and accurate notifications to personnel in the Kaiserslautern Military Community.  The missile launch was then assessed to be part of a training exercise and not a threat to the KMC area.  The situation is all clear.  We’d like to thank our Command Post members for their quick response to ensure our people stay informed so they can take the proper safety precautions.” Ramstein Air Base in Germany. , Google Earth Details about the strange event remain extremely limited at this time, but the base is considered a prime target for potential foes. Russia, in particular, has ballistic and cruise missiles located nearby in Kaliningrad and throughout the western edge of its border with NATO member countries. This is in addition to sea and air-launched cruise missiles that can be launched from as close to Germany as the Baltic Sea. Of course, Russia’s strategic ballistic missile forces can reach Germany from thousands of miles away , as well. In addition, Iran, with its ever increasingly capable long-range ballistic missiles, has long been a concern for the U.S. and its European allies and was the driving factor in establishing an anti-ballistic missile screen in the form of two Aegis Ashore sites in Eastern Europe . Still, we have no idea what early warning system triggered the alert. America’s infrared early warning space-based sensing layer stares at the earth from many vantage points in orbit day and night. Historically, it provides the initial warning of a ballistic missile launch via detection of the missile’s hot boost-phase plume. These satellites, especially the newer ones, can also detect a greater variety of infrared events, as well, including artillery fire, aircraft crashes, smaller missile shots, and even the launches of cruise missiles. There are also many radars scattered throughout the entire region that support the missile defense ecosystem as part of NATO’s larger integrated air defense network. Furthermore, Ramstein is home to the Alliance’s Headquarters Allied Air Command (HQ AC), which incorporates air and missile defense, and the space-based and radar early-warning information that the air defense network relies upon, into a major command and control nerve center. Joint Force Air Component personnel execute Command and Control of Air Operations from the Situation Center at Ramstein Air Base., Photo by Cynthia Vernat,  HQ Allied Air Command Public Affairs It is worth noting that usually, outright declarations by foreign adversaries or other forms of intelligence give America’s command and control ecosystem early warning of exercises involving ballistic missile launches so that they don’t trigger these types of alerts. It would seem that it is quite possible that there was no prior intelligence, or at least it wasn’t definitive, pointing to such an exercise in this case. You can get an idea of what an undeclared or unexpected launch is like at U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) headquarters in this past piece of ours. While this instance turned out to be an nonthreatening event, it does underscore just how alert U.S. forces in Europe are to a potential sneak missile attack in these turbulent times. So, the system actually worked, at least when it came to initial warning and the base taking the threat seriously. As to how well the denizens of the installation followed instructions, or how effective the individual warning system was, is unknown. But this instance will surely serve as a great case study for evaluating potential shortfalls in those procedures. As to who initiated the ‘training exercise” launch that caused the alarm, and why, we don’t know at this time. It is known that Russia has been executing a massive set of strategic exercises in recent days that are focused on its nuclear deterrent capabilities and readiness. This included four ballistic missile launches from one of its submarines off the far east, in the Sea of Okhotsk, just today. Those missiles would have been heading west, towards Europe, into a target area in Russia’s northwestern Arkhangelsk region. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zEZunVJbvZM The general region where the missile impacted may have caused some confusion and set off the alarm, although we have no confirmation of this., Google Maps While the timing and nature of this test are intriguing, we don’t know if this dramatic four submarine-launched ballistic missile test by Russia, or any other, triggered the event. It is also possible that an allied drill could have also been confused for an unknown launch from within the European theater. We just don’t know at this time. Considering the sensitivities when it comes to the collection of this type of early warning data, we may never know exactly how this began or how serious the situation became. Regardless, we have reached out to U.S. European Command and Ramstein Air Base for more details. We will let you know what we find out as soon as they get back to us. Update: 12/14/2020: The main Public Affairs Office for U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), which is headquartered at Ramstein, responded to our queries asking for additional information about this incident with the following statement: “USAFE-AFAFRICA received an alert via a warning notification system of a real-world missile launch. The control center followed proper procedures and acted in a timely manner to provide rapid and accurate notifications to all required personnel and triggered the AtHoc notification system. The missile launch was determined to be part of a training exercise and within minutes the control center again followed proper procedures and provided updated notifications. We consistently and routinely monitor for any threats to our forces and our allies.” This is effectively identical to the statement that Ramstein Air Base officials posted on Facebook on Dec. 12. U.S. European Command (EUCOM) has also told The War Zone that it “does not have anything to add at this time” and recommended reaching out to the Public Affairs Office at Ramstein “for any additional details.” Additional details have emerged about what some personnel experienced at Ramstein Air Base during the incident. “Aerial attack, aerial attack, seek cover, seek cover,” the public address system blared, after sirens went off, according to a report from Stars and Stripes . “Take immediate action!” a text alert also read, according to We Are The Mighty . “For further information refer to Airman’s manual.” Approximately two minutes after the text went out, an “all clear” message was issued, that story added. “That’s not the kind of thing you joke about,” one service member subsequently told We Are The Mighty . “Hasn’t 2020 been hard enough?” The alert “made my heart skip a beat for a second” one commenter said in response to Ramstein’s official Facebook post. “Me too I ran into the [base exchange] and started yelling at folks to take cover,” another said.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The horn went off at 0330. Groggy, the pilot pulled on his flying suit, stuffed his feet into his boots, and headed down the stairs to Hangar 6. He was not alone. As he clambered up the stairs through the jet’s gaping cargo door, he saw the alert mission crew getting settled into their seats. In the cockpit, he passed the two navigators already at work. The Nav 1 was spinning up the LN-20 stellar-inertial doppler system as the Nav 2 was prepping the SATCOM and her mission materials. He slid into the left seat just as the copilot arrived. Both put on their headsets while strapping in. “Pilot? Ground. Air stairs clear, ready to back.” “Roger, brakes released.” The copilot keyed the radio. “Six weather.” Transmitting in the blind, ground control broadcast the current weather conditions. Now pushed outside of the huge hangar, the pilot began the engine start. An earlier RC-135 outside one of the hangars at Shemya., USAF “Turning three.” The number three engine quickly came to life, followed by four, one, and then two. The crew entry chute closed and the airplane blinked as the copilot switched to internal power while the ground crew disconnected the ground power cart. The jet moved onto the runway, turning left. Illuminated by the taxi lights, the pilot could barely see the edge of the runway in the fog and blowing snow. As the end of the runway disappeared under the nose, the pilot turned the airplane around sharply to align it with the centerline of Runway 28. The copilot turned off the taxi lights and the jet came to a stop. Flaps set, takeoff data reviewed, Before Takeoff Checklist complete. The pilot nodded in the dim red glow of the cockpit and the copilot switched on the landing light. Throttles set, all four engines steady, brakes released. Slowly, 285,000 pounds of airplane, crew, and jet fuel accelerated to 165 knots before rotating and disappearing into the frigid darkness. The Cobra Ball was airborne. The Rock Shemya Air Force Base, Alaska—better known as The Rock—sits on a remote island at the tip of the Aleutian Chain close to what was then the USSR. This location would allow the Cobra Ball and its crew to be in position less than an hour after notification to gather re-entry intelligence on Soviet ballistic missile warheads careening through the atmosphere during their terminal stage of flight. Shemya is one of the most remote installations on earth, situated right at Russia’s back doorstep., Google Maps The duty crew was ready to launch in less than 15 minutes, which occasionally gave them only 15 minutes for a “turn short” and collection of intelligence data once on the scene, that is if there was insufficient warning time from the Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center ( DEFSMAC ), part of the National Security Agency. DEFSMAC determined that a Soviet launch was imminent. Normally, crews had a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes to be on station prior to collection. In many cases, however, the mission was a bust as the Soviets elected not to launch or the indicators at DEFSMAC were ambiguous.

The windswept island is scattered with buildings old and new, but the two biggest features are the massive COBRA DANE radar on a bluff on the northwest of the island and the main ramp at the Air Force Base. While many of the large hangars that once dotted the area around the airstrip have finally been demolished, the main hangars are now modern, having been totally rebuilt in 2016 following damage done by a major storm. , PHOTO © 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The Rock was cold, grey, and blustery, buffeted by wind, snow, rain, and fog. Two crews lived in rooms in the second story of the hangar and cooked their own meals in a common kitchen. Each crew deployed for two weeks at a time, with one-week overlap for continuity. There was comparatively little to do on The Rock, which had one cable TV channel that showed old VHS movies and the Alaska Weather Report. Crews could visit the small base exchange, known as “Macy’s,” for a pizza, work out in the gym in the hangar, jog the length of the 10,006-foot runway, or tour the island. When the weather was bad, the jet was back at Eielson Air Force Base on the Alaskan mainland, there was no tasking, or after a mission, crews were rewarded with a “Beer Light” to raise their spirits. A cold beer or two sometimes led to hijinks like riding the rotating beacon on the top of Hangar 3 or the ritual skinny dip in the frigid Northern Pacific Ocean followed immediately by similar immersion in the Bering Sea. Road To Cobra Ball In 1959, the United States began collecting telemetry intelligence (TELINT) of Soviet ballistic missile launches. These initially involved EB-47E(TT) Tell Twos operating from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey and flying over the Black Sea and Iran. In addition, spooky U.S. Navy aircraft operated from bases in Pakistan, but were soon evicted. Despite their successes in collecting boost-phase TELINT, all of these planes lacked any optical capability. Moreover, they only tracked the missile booster and not any re-entry vehicles (warheads). To mitigate this shortcoming, in 1960, the U.S. modified a four-month-old Boeing KC-135A, serial number 59-1491, with only 142 total hours into a configuration nicknamed Nancy Rae to collect measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). On December 31st, 1961, the airplane and crew arrived at Shemya AFB. Over time, the airplane was redesignated as JKC-135A and later RC-135S, and the program name changed to Wanda Belle, then to Rivet Ball, and finally to Cobra Ball. The Nancy Rae KC-135A, serial number 59-1491., Stephen Miller The sole Lisa Ann RC-135E, serial number 62-4137, later renamed Rivet Amber, joined the Rivet Ball in 1966. This new airplane carried a massive Hughes radar to track incoming re-entry vehicles, which were then filmed by a ballistic streak camera similar to the one on the Rivet Ball. The Lisa Ann RC-135E, serial number 62-4137, with its huge radar embedded in the fuselage between the wing root and the cockpit. , King Hawes Tragedy struck on January 13th, 1969 when the Rivet Ball slid off the runway at Shemya AFB, breaking its spine, but with no loss of life or equipment. Months later, on June 5th, 1969, the Rivet Amber aircraft disappeared over the Bering Sea with the loss of all 19 crewmen onboard. The remains of 59-1491, by then designated as an RC-135S Rivet Ball, on January 13th, 1969., King Hawes To make up for the loss of those aircraft, two former testbed C-135Bs, serial numbers 61-2663 and 61-2664, were hastily converted into RC-135S platforms, entering service in 1969 and 1972, respectively. On the Ides of March 1981, 61-2664 struck the approach lights of Runway 10 during landing at Shemya AFB, killing six of its crew. While in the hospital recovering from an assassination attempt, President Ronald Reagan subsequently approved the emergency conversion of another C-135B, serial number 61-2662, into the fourth Cobra Ball, attesting to the critical national importance placed on these airplanes and their mission. Author’s collection In 1989, as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the lone RC-135X Cobra Eye, serial number 62-4128, arrived at Shemya AFB. The Cobra Eye flew missions on behalf of the U.S. Army and U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense agencies. With the end of the Cold War, it was eventually reconfigured into an RC-135S, one of three that are still in service, at the time of writing, with the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. RC-135S 61-2663 cobra ball I outside Hangar 7 at Shemya., Author’s Photo The most distinctive feature of the Cobra Ball is its black starboard wing and engines. This was initially done to reduce glare on the mission optics, although with newer equipment this became less important, if not altogether unnecessary. Beginning with the conversion of 62-4128, the Cobra Balls have been configured with bilateral digital sensors allowing collection from either side of the aircraft. The black wing has been retained both out of a sense of tradition and as a clear indicator that the airplane is a National Technical Means of verification asset. RC-135S with its iconic black wing. Note that this aircraft was still in the earlier configuration in which only one side of the aircraft could collect data. , USAF Ready To Collect After nearly four hours of tediously drilling holes in the night sky 40 nautical miles off the east coast of the Soviet Union’s Kamchatka Peninsula, the Cobra Ball headed off to air refuel from the strip alert KC-135A on temporary duty with the Alaskan Tanker Task Force at Eielson Air Force Base, also the home base for the Strategic Air Command (SAC) Cobra Ball crews assigned to the 24th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, part of the 6th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, and crews assigned to the 6985th Security Squadron, part of Electronic Security Command, then the Air Force’s component of the Central Security Service . The “Ball” returned to its orbit area just before sunrise. It looked to be another “Tuna Patrol,” with no collection. Suddenly the Tactical Coordinator came over the intercom, “X-Ray! X-Ray! X-Ray! Crew, we have a launch from Plesetsk of an SS-18 Mod 5 . Re-entry objects are the bus and up to 10 warheads, including decoys and other junk. ETA 28 minutes.” The pilot switched off the autopilot altitude hold and began a slow climb to flight level 350. Now fat with gas from the tanker, it would take a big chunk of the next half-hour to climb as high as possible to reduce atmospheric interference with the Real Time Optical System (RTOS) and Multiple Object Discriminator System (MODS) that visually tracked whatever survived re-entry. Author’s Collection The Navs quickly calculated how to position the jet so it would be at the top of its orbit (the northernmost point) exactly two minutes prior to re-entry. At the time, the Cobra Ball had its optical sensors only on the right side of its fuselage, so they needed to head south to view the re-entry at the Kura Test Range to the west. Flight parameters were critical: zero degrees deviation on heading, less than two knots of airspeed and two degrees of bank, with less than a 50-foot variance in altitude. Knowing exactly where the Cobra Ball was in three-dimensional space relative to the re-entry revealed considerable details about the objects it tracked. Some 30 seconds after turn-down, both the copilot and the Photo Technician keyed their interphones. “Gaslight! Gaslight! Gaslight!” The first object became visible, leaving a fiery streak in the Western sky. Each object left a similar long streak from the upper atmosphere, downward to the impact area on Kamchatka, which they struck in the pre-dawn darkness. In the back end of the jet, cameras whirred and telemetry tapes filled up. The copilot used a grease pencil on his side window to trace the re-entry pattern of all the objects which would be transcribed to the mission report for further analysis by the scientists of the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. In less than a minute it was over. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9aJai8loUo8 Each crewmember sat hunched over their stations, filling out forms, copying key data, and summarizing the performance of the equipment. There was only one “window” today, meaning there would be no further launches. It would soon be time to go home. Returning To Base Can Be The Hardest Part Landing at The Rock has always been a challenge. When it was originally built during World War II to support B-24s and P-38s, there were two perpendicular runways to deal with the strong crosswinds that buffeted Shemya, located at the confluence of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. Now there was just one, and the crosswinds were wicked. B-24s at Shemya during World War II., USAAF Storms could last for days with gale-force winds, rain, sleet, snow, and dense fog, often all at once. The hangar doors could only be opened if the winds were less than 50 knots, so more than a few sorties were canceled for bad winds alone. In minutes, the weather at Shemya could change as the front moved through, leaving the island bathed in balmy 40° sunlight and calm winds. Back home at Eielson AFB, it could be -40° with dense ice fog. At the beginning of Nancy Rae operations, the flight crews were all highly experienced Majors or Lieutenant Colonels from Air Force Systems Command. When SAC took over the mission, this level of expertise continued, but, by 1965, copilots with two or three years of experience were assigned to the right seat. An incident in 1966 restricted the copilot upgrade process, reaffirming the need for well-seasoned ‘135 pilots in the left seat. Eventually, these new upgrade limits were relaxed given the assumption that experienced Shemya-qualified copilots could safely transition to become experienced Shemya-qualified aircraft commanders. The crash of RC-135S 61-2664 at Shemya AFB in 1981 by one such pilot permanently ended copilot upgrades. RC-135S 61-2663 passes the memorial to 61-2664 at Shemya., Paul Jeanes photo Subsequently, SAC required each Cobra Ball aircraft commander to have a minimum of 2,500 hours of total time, be qualified as an instructor pilot, and complete a rigorous check-out procedure in order to land at Shemya AFB. This applied to all SAC aircraft, including transient KC-135s. Cobra Ball copilots typically upgraded to aircraft commander en route to their next assignment. With the cessation of operations from The Rock, the unit moved to Offutt AFB in 1995 as part of “Cobra Thaw” and this requirement went away. Recovering On The Rock As the Ball approached 130 nautical miles from Shemya AFB, the Nav 2 updated the weather via the SATCOM. Runway 28 in use, winds two-three-zero at 25 gusting 30 knots, ceiling 800-feet and visibility one nautical mile with intermittent snow. Not bad, and certainly within the limit of 25 knots direct crosswind. The Cobra Ball could not begin its descent to Shemya AFB if the landing conditions were out of limits, and would instead orbit until it reached the minimum fuel level required to divert back to Eielson AFB. “We’re golden,” said the pilot, “Before Descent Checklist.” The copilot prepared the landing data, the Navs completed their charts and paperwork, and the back-end crew finished shutting down their equipment. Passing 10,000-feet, the copilot called the checklist complete. “Shemya, Blind 55 , request vectors to the ILS, Runway 28.” “Roger, Blind 55 , turn left heading zero-four-zero and descend to 2,500.” “Zero-four-zero, 2,500, Blind 55 .” As the Ball slowed below 220 KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) the pilot called for flaps 20° and the Before Landing Checklist. The Detachment Commander—Cobra 01—updated the winds and runway conditions. They were still within limits. “ Blind 55 , turn left three-zero-zero and join the localizer.” “Three-zero-zero, Blind 55 .” Presently the ILS localizer “came off the wall” and the pilot banked left to intercept the inbound course. With the winds this morning it would not be an airliner landing. “Flaps 30°, gear down.” The copilot moved the flap lever and extended the gear. “Three green, good pressure. Before Landing Checklist complete.” Although it was now daylight, the pilots could see nothing but white in the solid overcast. In the back it was already a bumpy ride; a blindfolded roller coaster ride. “Flaps 40°. Gear, flaps, fuel panel set for landing, safety checks complete.” “ Blind 55 is gear down, full stop.” “Roger Blind 55 , cleared to land.” “Cleared to land, Blind 55 .” The Ball broke out of the clouds above the grey water of the Pacific Ocean, but there was nothing ahead of the nose. The copilot looked out his side window and saw the runway cocked off some 45° to the right. “Runway in sight. Love this weathervaning.” “Flaps 50°,” said the pilot, “Crew, continue to land.” The airplane passed over the cove at the approach end of Runway 28. No wind shear this time. Runway 28 at Shemya AFB., Author’s Photo The pilot lowered the left wing and pushed in a boot-full of right rudder to align with the runway. Some 2,000 feet down the runway the airplane landed hard, intentionally dissipating lift and momentum. Up went the speed brakes—putting even more weight on the landing gear—and the pilot pulled the thrust reverser levers into the armed position. Four lights on the instrument panel turned bright orange. “All four! All four!” called the Nav 1. The roar of the thrust reversers signaled the back-end crew that the landing was indeed a full-stop. After 7.1 hours, Mission S032 was over. A successful “take,” an uneventful landing, and a green Beer Light. Shemya’s Cobra Ball Legacy Over the years, details like these of the Cobra Ball’s mission have evolved as the airplane changed, new equipment and personnel were added, and mission requirements shifted. In 1988, the Cobra Ball deployed to Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa to monitor a launch by the People’s Republic of China. Following the 1995 termination of operations from Shemya AFB, the RC-135S fleet was re-engined and upgraded. The three jets and their crews have since monitored missile launches by Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Modern Cobra Ball still wearing the black wing scheme., USAF The legacy of the Cobra Ball mission lies in its ongoing efforts to understand foreign ballistic missile development and the resulting diplomatic processes to limit their threat to the United States and its allies. As one of America’s National Technical Means of verification, the value of the Cobra Ball and its crews remains unequaled.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 9, 2021",The Soviet Union’s Burya Cruise Missile Was A Little-Known Cold War Monster,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s often fascinating when a seemingly forgotten film showing Soviet-era military technology is uncovered, not least because the weapons systems involved are frequently of a seriously impressive scale , or otherwise represent a remarkable approach to the various challenges of the era. Fitting both those descriptions is a 1959-vintage film about the Burya strategic cruise missile. The movie, which Dmitry Stefanovich, who tweets as @KomissarWhipla , brought to our attention, has been uploaded to YouTube in two parts. It was filmed in color and stretches to an impressive 74 minutes’ running time. While the quality of the footage may leave something to be desired, it provides an incredible opportunity to witness a strategic weapon program that was, for most of the Cold War, almost entirely unknown in the Western world. The twin booster rockets ignite moments before the launch of a Burya test missile., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP As a peculiar Cold War-era developmental dead-end, the Lavochkin Burya is, moreover, worth examining in a little more detail. You can see both parts of the film — which includes successful launches as well as some disastrous misfires — below: The Burya — the name means Storm in Russian — began life at a time when the Soviet Union was almost entirely focused on the ballistic missile as a means of delivering a nuclear warhead against its potential enemies. By mid-1956, the Soviet military had introduced into service the R-5M, known to NATO as the SS-3 Shyster, the country’s first nuclear-capable missile. However, even by forward-deploying this weapon in satellite states, the R-5M, with its 750-mile range, was unable to hit many high-value targets, including U.S. Air Force bomber bases in the United Kingdom or in the Pacific. In the meantime, Soviet industry was tasked to develop a follow-on to the R-5M that would offer much greater performance, bringing intercontinental-range targets within reach. As of the early 1950s, this was a serious challenge, hampered above all by the lack of powerful and reliable engines, as well as the difficulty in creating multi-stage ballistic missiles. A column of R-5 series ballistic missiles rolls through Moscow during a 1964 parade., Thomas Taylor Hammond/Wikimedia Commons At this point, the Soviets turned their attention to what was going on in the United States. Here, it was clear that the Americans didn’t fully trust this early ballistic missile technology and instead hedged their bets with the parallel development of manned bombers and strategic cruise missiles. Of the latter, the most potent appeared to be the North American SM-64 Navaho , a ramjet-powered, nuclear-capable, Mach-3 missile that promised to be able to strike Soviet targets after launching from bases in the Continental United States. A big advantage of a cruise missile like the Navaho was that it could fly like a plane and was propelled for most of its flight by an air-breathing ramjet, removing the need for it to carry supplemental oxidizer, and considerably reducing its overall weight. In turn, this meant it needed just a relatively small rocket to launch it initially. The last Navaho missile to be launched lifts off from its pad in November 1958., USAF/Public Domain The Navaho approach was attractive and the Soviet Korolev design bureau had already begun design work on a similar missile as a back-up to its own ballistic missile projects. In 1953, Korolev was ordered to focus on ballistic missiles, and its ramjet cruise missile design was handed over to two competing aviation design bureaus, Lavochkin and Myasishchev. That decision put Sergei Korolev himself in direct competition not only with developments in the United States, but with two rival approaches to strategic missile development in his own country. He redoubled his own efforts on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), accordingly. A Soviet stamp commemorating the life of Sergei Korolev , the country’s pre-eminent designer of rockets and spacecraft., Wikimedia Commons At Lavochkin and Myasishchev, meanwhile, their respective strategic cruise missile projects were running into their own problems – it seems the concept, despite its early promise, was difficult to achieve in practice. In particular, the ramjet propulsion was hard to master, while it was a challenge to produce components that would resist the heat they would be subjected to through friction while flying at high speed. Considerable use was made of titanium in the construction of these weapons. A Burya on the launch pad at a Soviet test facility., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP In fact, the Myasishchev missile, the RSS-40 Buran (no relation to the subsequent Soviet space shuttle ), was canceled without a single missile completed. Over in the United States, the Navaho, too, was abandoned in July 1957, though work involving the missile, an air-launched derivative of which eventually entered service as the AGM-28 Hound Dog , continued into the following year. Over at Lavochkin, work continued on the Burya, which received the in-house designation V-350. Work on this 60-foot-long missile had progressed further than on the Myasishchev rival, and by August 1, 1957, there were several examples completed, one of which conducted a first flight test on this date. It was an ignominious failure, the missile failing soon after takeoff. The Burya’s flight profile began with it being raised to a vertical position, before blasting off its static launch pad under the power of a pair of liquid-fueled booster rockets, before the ramjet engine took over, propelling the vehicle to a maximum speed of around Mach 3.5. Towed by a train, this still provides an idea of the impressive scale of the Burya missile., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Soon things picked up, though, and between 1957 and 1960 there was a total of 19 test launches, 14 of which successful. One test, in March 1960, saw the Burya test missile cover a distance of 4,000 miles before hitting a target with an accuracy of within six miles, thanks to its astronavigation guidance system. This was an acceptable level of accuracy considering the production missile would have been armed with a thermonuclear warhead. After being fueled, a Burya is raised to the vertical position for launch., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP By 1960, however, Soviet ICBMs had become a realistic proposition and the mighty ramjet-powered Burya was beginning to look like an anachronism. For all its technological prowess, it was potentially vulnerable to American air defenses due to its relatively slow terminal velocity. YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Around this time, the Burya was shelved in favor of an ICBM. Fittingly, it was a Korolev design, the R-7, or SS-6 Sapwood , that was selected. In modified form, this missile was used to launch Sputnik 1 , the world’s first artificial satellite, into orbit, and was used for an entire family of Soviet, and later Russian, space launch vehicles. Remarkably, it seems that Western intelligence entirely failed to identify the Burya missile, a point raised by Steven J. Zaloga in his book The Kremlin’s Nuclear Sword . Whether that’s true, or whether it was known about, but not fully understood, it apparently never received a Western reporting name or designation. Clouds of smoke accompany a Burya test launch., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP In some ways, of course, the story of the ground-launched strategic cruise missile has now come full circle in modern-day Russia, with the development of the notorious 9M730 Burevestnik , although this trades supersonic performance for, reportedly, almost unlimited range, on account of its nuclear propulsion. You can read more about recent developments in this project in this previous War Zone article . The mystery that surrounded the Burya makes the appearance of this 1959-vintage film all the more interesting. It is to be hoped that the Russian archives will continue to reveal such insights into more of the Cold War’s hidden military history.

"Joseph Trevithick, Thomas Newdick, Tyler Rogoway","Posted on Apr 30, 2021",Stealthy XQ-58 Drone Busts The Networking Logjam Between F-22 And F-35,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has successfully demonstrated the ability of a new communications and data gateway, designed in part to be installed on a specially configured XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, to allow the service’s F-22 and F-35A stealth fighters, as well as the rest of the Joint Strike Fighter family, to exchange information stealthily. During these tests, the Valkyrie — designed as a lower-cost, stealthy unmanned aerial vehicle — also achieved a semi-autonomous flight alongside the F-22 and F-35s for the first time. The low probability of intercept (LPI) datalinks on the F-22 and the F-35 series cannot “talk” to each other directly, meaning the two types use different waveforms and hardware to communicate among their own kind. Using a gateway, it is possible to receive both data streams, fuse that information, and then broadcast it back to each aircraft within line-of-sight. This gives pilots the whole picture of where everyone else is, what they are doing, and what they are seeing on their sensor systems, while also allowing them to communicate with each other. Using a stealthy drone to do this is a new and a far more attractive and relevant option than using lumbering converted airliners or pods strapped on a non-stealthy combat jet. An XQ-58A Valkyrie launches at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, on December 9., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Joshua King The Air Force-led trial, which the service has billed as a precursor to establishing a military “ Internet of Things ,” was intended to help address the problems previously encountered in exchanging data between different fifth-generation fighter platforms. The new data-sharing and communications relay system on the XQ-58A, as well as this particular configuration of the drone, are being developed under the service’s gatewayONE and attritableONE efforts, respectively. These, among dozens of other projects , are all part of the overarching Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program, which promises to bring open architecture to the battlefield, the implications of which The War Zone has discussed extensively in the past, including here and here . In an Air Force release published yesterday, the service announced details of the experiment, which was run at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, last week, following preliminary tests at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada. The highlight of the multi-faceted event was integrating the gatewayONE payload on the service’s second XQ-58A vehicle, serial number 15-8002. The Air Force had announced the first-ever flight of an XQ-58A last year, which was performed by its initial Valkyrie, serial number 15-8001. That particular unmanned aircraft had been delivered to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) as part of its Laboratory’s Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program, which has served as a stepping stone to the Skyborg project . The Air Force has said that there is close coordination between the Skyborg, which is focused on the development of an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” capable of flying semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones and fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), and attritableONE efforts. Kratos, which makes the XQ-58A, is involved in the Skyborg program and recently received a new contract to build prototype drones to carry those systems. “Testing is all about pushing the limits of what’s possible, finding out where the toughest challenges are, and adapting creative solutions to overcoming difficult problem sets,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Kate Stowe, the gatewayONE program manager at the Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLCMC), said. “The real win of the day was seeing the gatewayONE establish a secure two-way translational data path across multiple platforms and multiple domains. That’s the stuff ABMS is all about.” Lieutenant Colonel Stowe added that out of 18 test objectives, nine were successfully achieved. Despite the breakthrough of integrating the gatewayONE payload with the XQ-58A, it is clear that not all went entirely according to plan. Shortly after takeoff during the milestone December 9 flight, “the communications payloads lost connectivity and those test objectives were unable to be accomplished,” according to the Air Force. With that in mind, it is not clear as to what degree meaningful data-sharing occurred. However, Lieutenant Colonel Stowe’s above statement confirms that the gatewayONE did establish a two-way data link across multiple platforms. A control-room operator observes a test prior to an XQ-58A Valkyrie launch at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Joshua King The major obstacle to having the F-22 and F-35 “talk” to one another is the different digital “languages” and waveforms that their stealthy datalinks use. While the F-22 is equipped with the Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), the F-35 employs the Multifunctional Advanced Data Link (MADL). Traditionally, if pilots of these different aircraft needed to share data with each other inflight, or transmit it to a command and control center, they would have to utilize legacy tactical connections, such as Link 16 , which are non-stealthy. Link 16 broadcasts omnidirectional and they are more easily detectable by enemy forces, giving up the advantage of stealth. The F-22, for instance, still cannot broadcast on Link 16 at all, but it can receive information from it. You can read more about these different stealth fighter data links, how they work, and the challenges of integrating their data in this previous article . Essentially, the job of gatewayONE is to “translate” between these incompatible data-link formats. Instead of transmitting the information first to an operations center or tactical ground node, the Yuma experiment used a payload onboard the XQ-58A to do the translation and to rebroadcast it back to the airborne fighters. Last November, Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics outlined the gatewayONE plan, describing it as part of a “connect-a-thon” rapid experimentation concept. You can read more about the overall thinking behind it here . An XQ-58A Valkyrie maintainer pours fuel into the aircraft on a launchpad at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, December 9, 2020., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Joshua King “Additionally, the test pushed the position data of each platform outside of the aircraft’s close-proximity formation through gatewayONE, which enables battle managers on the ground or in the air to better orchestrate operations,” the Air Force release added. “The gatewayONE payload also passed tracks or cues from ground operators to both fighters and passed a cue from the F-35A to the F-22 for the first time. These bi-directional communications pathways occurred in the platforms’ native digital “languages” and the data was displayed through the aircraft’s organic systems.” Again, this is conclusive on the point that there was data transfer between the jets, enabled by the Valkyrie, but it remains possible that some of this might not have been achieved during the December 9 flight. Instead, aspects of these accomplishments could have been achieved by the gatewayONE package on the ground or in a flying surrogate aircraft. It just isn’t clear at this time. “The gatewayONE payload really showed what’s possible and helped us take a big step towards achieving [Joint All-Domain Command and Control],” added Lieutenant Colonel Eric Wright, an F-35A pilot with the Air Force’s 59th Test and Evaluation Squadron. “This critical capability provides additional connections between our advanced fighters and other forces and battle managers across all domains. The future is promising, and gatewayONE will allow the F-22 and F-35 to connect to and feed data sources they’ve never before accessed. Those future connections will bring additional battlefield awareness into the cockpit and enable integrated fires across U.S. forces.” A remote control operator speaks into a radio at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, during an XQ-58A Valkyrie test flight, December 9., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Joshua King As well as the interactions between manned fighters and the XQ-58A drone, a portion of the testing at Yuma also involved a KC-46A Pegasus tanker setting up a communications pathway to a ground node using commercial internet routing standards via the Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) waveform. The same technology was also used to allow a pilot on board an F-35B to transmit full-motion video to a ground controller. TTNT, which was originally developed for the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler , has also been used in other semi-autonomous flight tests , including one in which an AV-8B Harrier jump jet employed a datalink using this waveform to communicate with a UTAP-22 drone , another Kratos product, acting as a loyal wingman. “If fifth-generation platforms are going to be quarterbacks of a joint-penetrating team, we have to be able to communicate with those quarterbacks in an operationally relevant manner and enable data sharing between them, to them, and from them,” Preston Dunlap, the Department of the Air Force’s “ Chief Architect ,” explained. “For years people said it couldn’t be done. Today the team turned another page toward making the impossible possible. In just 12 months, the team has opened the door to a world where we can put the power of an operations center into the cockpit at the tactical edge.” XQ-58, F-22, F-35 fly alongside each other., USAF Ground tests of gatewayONE began in December 2019. For these trials, information was passed between IFDLs on F-22s and MADLs on F-35s, as a proof of concept. During this phase of experiments, it is understood that the system was installed on a test stand on the ground, while Raptors and Joint Strike Fighters flew above, sending information through it. The War Zone had previously considered what might come after these subsequent flight tests, at least once the gatewayONE technology could be successfully proven, without any connectivity loss. Options for the future could still include integrating this payload onto other platforms, both manned and unmanned. In this way, the technology could play a gateway role similar in some general respects to the existing Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN), which can handle a wide variety of waveforms , including Link 16 and the Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), the latter being another popular U.S. military data transfer system. The Air Force has operated manned Bombardier E-11A and unmanned EQ-4B Global Hawk aircraft equipped with BACN for years now, but that gateway does not have the ability to translate between IFDL and MADL. The service also has a number of roll-on, roll-off communications kits designed to be used on the KC-135 aerial refueling tanker , including a system known as the Roll-On Beyond-line-of-sight Enhancement ( ROBE ), which can create an active net over the battlespace to help relay information sent via various datalinks. The E-11A BACN is based on the Bombardier Global Express business jet platform., PHOTO BY CAPT. KEENAN KUNST The inclusion of a KC-46A using a TTNT datalink in the recent flight tests out at Yuma underscores the Air Force’s interest in expanding the ability of its tanker fleets to also act as communications and data-sharing nodes. Assistant Secretary Roper has said that the first capability developed under ABMS could be releaseONE , a podded system under development for the Pegasus, as well as the KC-135, that could help push updated mission planning data, crafted in part using artificial intelligence-driven algorithms, to combat aircraft mid-mission. Tankers equipped with releaseONE would send that information along to various platforms, such as XQ-58As equipped with gatewayONE, “that are doing the ‘Babel Fish’ translation to F-35s and F-22s that may be too far into the [anti-access, area-denial] bubble,” Roper said in an interview with Air Force Magazine , making a reference to a fictional species of fish capable of translating any language from the universe of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . The Air Force and Lockheed Martin have also been testing the U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane as a communications hub on an experimental basis. In a 2019 test known as Project Riot , a U-2S acted as a transfer node between an F-35 and a ground control station. More recently, a U-2 demonstrated the ability to remotely use computers on the ground to help process data from onboard sensors and other systems in flight. In the future, however, it is planned that the U-2 and other aircraft will be able to receive updates for their mission computers in mid-air, as well as have the ability to establish links to offboard computers on the ground to provide additional processing power, something you can read all about in this recent exclusive War Zone report . A U-2S Dragon Lady fitted with an experimental communications system, identified by the white section underneath the forward fuselage and the gold-colored antenna., Lockheed Martin Even if the gatewayONE technology serves only to allow F-22s and F-35s to rapidly exchange data with each other, while still maintaining their stealthy characteristics, that would be massively significant. Since both these aircraft are equipped already with extremely capable sensor suites, their situational awareness and cooperative lethality would be enhanced dramatically by being able to share that sensor info. Placing this package on a stealthy drone is critical as its presence would not be an outright liability for the F-35s and F-22s operating in contested airspace and it could fly within line-of-sight throughout their cooperative sorties providing this essential data-sharing capability. This was all underscored by the first-ever formation flight of an XQ-58A together with an F-22 and and F-35A as part these recent tests at Yuma. “The Valkyrie met 80% of the overall flight test objectives with 100% of the formation flying objectives being met before safely landing in the Arizona desert,” the Air Force said of that portion of that experiment. “This was the fifth successful launch of the Valkyrie, but the first time the platform has integrated a new warfighting capability payload and flown in formation with an F-22 and F-35,” Michael Wipperman, the XQ-58A Program Manager at AFRL, said in a statement . The recent flight trials are also a boost for the XQ-58A and will likely help inform the kind of communications networks that will be needed to realize longstanding ambitions to field loyal wingman drones, whether based on the Valkyrie, or other platforms. This unmanned aircraft would seem to be an ideal fit as a gatewayONE-equipped data relay operationally. The XQ-58A is intended to be attritable, meaning that it is low-cost enough to be employed in scenarios where there is an increased risk of the drone being lost. As such, Valkyries, in general, would be a very viable option for use as loyal wingmen to work alongside F-22s and F-35s, as well as future penetrating combat aircraft , inside contested airspace. In the same way, XQ-58As carrying gatewayONE datalinks could be a key link between swarms of other drones operating in denied areas and other platforms, including F-35s and F-22s. With this communications and data-sharing gateway available, each of the individual drones in swarm would not have to be equipped with this level of equipment, saving weight and payload space for other systems or weapons. This could also allow a swarm of drones to interact with multiple types of manned assets equipped with disparate datalinks during a single mission, as well. “This was just a first step at demonstrating the potential of the force multiplier effects of attritable aircraft in a manned/unmanned environment,” Air Force Brigadier General Heather Pringle, head of AFRL, said after the tests at Yuma. “The XQ-58A modularity and ability to carry robust payloads enabled the rapid capability integration into an attritable experimentation vehicle,” Wipperman, the XQ-58A Program Manager, added. “We’re thrilled with the seamless integration and demonstration of this flight. We look forward to continued capability enhancement at future demonstrations.” All told, the recent tests involving the XQ-58A and gatewayONE, as well as all the other assets out at Yuma, represent significant milestones in those programs, as well as critical steps forward for the Air Force’s larger future battlespace networking plans now taking shape under ABMS. Above all else, The XQ-58A and gatewayONE pairing could be the best solution yet for giving America’s two stealth fighters a universal translator for which to communicate through, one that can follow them deep inside enemy airspace if called upon to do so.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Sep 7, 2020",Here Is What The Air Force’s New Robot Dogs Are Actually Capable Of,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Semi-autonomous quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicles, or Q-UGV, made by Ghost Robotics, more popularly referred to as “robot dogs,” have been making appearances in USAF exercises throughout 2020. Now, the 325th Security Forces Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida has been named as the first unit within the Department of Defense to adopt the robotic quadrupeds for regular operations. While the idea of robotic dogs patrolling a major Air Force installation seems like a science fiction dream come true, it hasn’t been exactly clear how these mechanized hounds would be put to use. To help us understand their real capabilities and why the U.S. military is interested in them, The War Zone spoke with Jiren Parikh, CEO and founder of Ghost Robotics, the robots’ designer and manufacturer. Here is what we found out. A Q-UGV seen during a previous Air Force test. , USAF The USAF And Man’s Next Best Friend In a USAF press release last month announcing Tyndall’s acquisition of the Ghost Robotics Q-UGVs, Air Force Major Jordan Criss, the 325th Security Forces Squadron’s commander, said that the robot dogs would patrol a predetermined path and would be monitored by a non-commissioned officer throughout their patrol. “These dogs will be an extra set of eyes and ears while computing large amounts of data at strategic locations throughout Tyndall Air Force Base,” Criss said. “They will be a huge enhancement for our defenders and allow flexibility in the posting and response of our personnel.” Criss added that the dogs would be able to patrol areas that “aren’t desirable for human beings and vehicles” and would even be able to be operated by personnel wearing virtual-reality headsets. “We will be able to see exactly what the robot dog is detecting through its mobile camera and sensor platform [and] if desired, we will also be able to issue verbal commands to a person or people through a radio attached to the dogs.” The often moist, swampy, coastal environment at Tyndall won’t stop the Ghost Robotics’ robots as they feature an IP68 rating, meaning they can be submerged in water up to a maximum depth of 1.5 meters, or just under five feet. One of Ghost Robotics units being put to the test at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. , USAF Tyndall sprawls along the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida panhandle in an area prone to hurricanes. The base was damaged heavily in 2018 when hurricane Michael ravaged the coastline, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in destruction to the base. The Air Force is also eyeing the dog-like robots for use in deployed and/or disaster-ravaged environments, making damaged Tyndall Air Force Base a perfect test environment for the robots, as well as an operational one. Making Robots More Efficient Through Imitating Nature Aside from patrolling the marshes around Tyndall, Ghost Robotics Q-UGVs are being eyed for a wide variety of roles both on and off the battlefield. Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh says their robots are incredibly versatile, owing to the stripped-down, nature-inspired approach the company often touts. The engineers at the firm looked at what was already being developed in terms of quadrupedal robots and thought it was all wrong. Instead, Ghost Robotics tried to imitate dogs or other small mammals by enabling the robot to “feel” the terrain underfoot rather than relying on sensors alone. “We want our robots to feel the environment, transfer it through the motors into our computer platform, and quickly adjust,” Parikh says. A Ghost Robotics q-UGV being field-tested., Ghost Robotics Parikh says their robots “actually feel by minute forces that are generated through current changes in the motors.” This active feedback makes it so that no matter what the environment, the robots will be able to intuitively respond to what’s around them, as the Ghost Robotics CEO and founder further explains: When our robots move around and you shove them, these forces are computed at 2,000 calculations per second per leg. We’re adjusting it to make it like a mammal. Our robot, when you see it climbing stairs or walking or running around, we turn off all the sensors. It’s just feeling. It’s completely blind. The reason we do that is because if a warfighter or a mining company, if anybody is using our robot, this robot had better operate 99.99% of the time. It’s like every other machine, every motorcycle, car – the drivetrain has to have some gear reduction. The minute you put gear reduction in, the only way the robot can ‘feel’ the terrain is through vision or putting sensors in the ‘toes.’ The thing is, those sensors aren’t fast enough… These quadrupeds only have three motors per leg, twelve motors in all. How do you move them over unstructured terrain elegantly when you know the force sensors are going to fail, they’re not perfect? Vision doesn’t always work. What do you do in a foot of snow or two feet of grass? That’s not to say that Ghost Robotics’ robots do not have other sensors. The rather straightforward and stripped-down approach to the base design means that many sensors and attachment packages can be added to its frame, even sensors to aid in movement and environment awareness. Still, if or when those sensors fail, the robot’s simple “ reptilian brain ” takes over. “If it fails, if the sensors go, if it doesn’t feel the environment or if it slips on ice or stairs, just like a mammal, it will adjust itself and stay stable,” Parikh says. “And, if it falls over, it will pick itself up and keep going. That is the premise of our robot design that is completely different from a Boston Dynamics or any other robot out there. We made it more like nature.” A Ghost Robotics Q-UGV being tested in Bakersfield, California., Ghost Robotics Ghost Robotics’ robots are algorithmically controlled from a single one-watt microprocessor that runs the whole machine. The entire robot runs on just ten watts of power, compared to a Boston Dynamics robot, whose processors eat up close to 140 watts. That means Ghost Robotics’ Q-UGVs are designed to operate for much longer than competitors’ robots. Parikh says their robot dogs can travel up to six and a half miles on a single charge. The robots are currently powered by lithium-ion batteries, but Ghost Robotics is looking to fuel cell technology for future applications. The company even plans to build “dog houses” into which the robot dogs can enter and recharge wirelessly. Parikh says his company has even considered use cases where one of their government customers might want a robot to walk across the bottom of a lake or other small body of water. “We could potentially use it to sit there, maybe move it, maybe blow something up, or sense something on a riverbed or shoreline. The robot can fill some bladders and get negative, neutral, or positive buoyancy. Battery life is a key issue. Eventually, we’re going to give it gait and motion so it can swim,” Parikh told The War Zone . “We’ve filed some patents. It’s pretty cool.” Further Applications Of “Robotic Dogs” As we’ve seen in previous tests at Nellis Air Force Base and Tyndall, Ghost Robotics’ Q-UGVs are being eyed by the USAF and other U.S. military partners for use in persistent, autonomous perimeter security. There are many situations in which ground platforms are better suited to these tasks than unmanned aircraft, but even pairing these Q-UGVs with UAVs can create a layered, cooperative, more redundant perimeter security architecture. One can imagine a scenario where unmanned platforms, both overhead and on the ground, can work together to detect anomalies along a border and investigate those potential issues. This would drastically increase the coverage area of patrols, bolster the quality of information about potential issues, potentially keep human operators out of initial danger, and provide higher situational awareness to security personal once alerted to any breaches or anomalies. By January 2021, Parikh says, Ghost Robotics Q-UGVs will be able to autonomously map and patrol operating bases. But patrolling installations is far from the only scenario that Ghost Robotics and the Department of Defense envision for the Q-UGVs. Some of the payloads and applications that Ghost Robotics has envisioned include a wide variety of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) roles. Electro-optical, acoustic, and other various surveillance sensors can easily be attached to the robots’ frames, allowing them to be the eyes and ears of forces on the ground. The robots can also serve as mobile mesh communications network nodes, kind of like a mobile, miniaturized cell tower that can be quickly deployed in situations where communications infrastructure is unavailable. The Ghost Robotics Q-UGVs have Wi-Fi and 4G antennas built-in off-the-shelf. “You could operate it with a cell phone 1,000 miles away,” Parikh says. On the battlefield, these small Q-UGVs could be employed in heavy asset reconnaissance roles, meaning they could scout ahead of or follow alongside armored vehicles to scout for mines or IEDs, enemy forces, and other threats, as well as obstacles. In a previous exercise in which the USAF tested its new Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a Ghost Robotics Q-UGVs provided targeting data to assets on the other side of the country. “Our robot was part of the kill chain and provided real-time strike targeting data to USAF operators. It was connected by a Silvus mesh radio to a network that had a battleship off the coast of Pensacola and a Starlink satellite connected to it ,” Parikh told The War Zone . This data included real-time video feeds and geolocation data through the Android Team Awareness Kit, or ATAK, a mobile device-based situation awareness app used by military operators.

A transporter-erector-launcher for the Soviet-era Scud short-range ballistic missile is seen serving as the target., Ghost Robotics “I think this becomes exciting once we get the cost of these systems down to where you could drop hundreds onto a battlefield,” Parikh told us. “We could have this application ready by 2022.” Ghost Robotics has government customers already requesting smaller, more resilient models that could be dropped out of aircraft using parachutes or protective bubbles. Ghost Robotics is also looking to develop smaller, lighter models that are capable of scaling chain link fences or being carried by individual human operators until they are needed. Ghost Robotics says explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) will be one of the most sought-after applications for their Q-UGVs. Ghost Robotics has already teamed with EOD technology manufacturer Zero Point to put disruptors on their robot dogs capable of disabling explosives. The robots’ manufacturer also envisions roles in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) detection, what the company calls a “no-brainer.” Robot dogs could be fitted with sensors able to detect dangerous materials and be sent into suspected CBRN storage sites, taking vulnerable human soldiers or public safety personnel out of the equation entirely. For its next model, Ghost Robotics is aiming at a two-minute rule, meaning every module should be able to detach or attach in under two minutes. This rule, combined with their flexible, modular design, means Ghost Robotics wants its robots to fulfill a huge array of battlefield and support roles that may pop up. Any type of payload, including electronic warfare or electronic support measures, could be attached to one of the robot dogs. Of course, if an EOD disruptor can be attached to one of the robots, small firearms or munitions could hypothetically be as well.

Some models even feature USB ports. “You can plug in any radio, any sensor, any payload you want,” Parikh says. “You never have to come back to Ghost.” Outside of defense applications, Ghost Robotics is marketing their robot dogs to public safety and emergency management agencies around the world for use in a broad range of applications. A Q-UGV could be sent into a burning building or into the rubble of a fallen structure to search for signs of life, leaving human or K-9 first responders out of harm’s way. In less dangerous scenarios, Ghost Robotics Q-UGVs could be employed in asset maintenance or inspection tasks for a huge range of transportation, infrastructure, or logistics tasks such as inspecting runways for foreign objects or surveying long stretches of rail lines. Aside from its extensive list of partners within the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities, Ghost Robotics is also looking to cater to applications within manufacturing, energy and natural resource management, construction, health care, logistics, and “last mile” delivery services . Military Working Dog, Meet Your New Battle Buddy Ghost Robotics is far from the first or only robotics firm that the Department of Defense has partnered with. Boston Dynamics is probably the best-known company in the world for its work in this particular space. We inquired as to how they see the competition in the realm of Q-UGVs, but we have yet to receive a response. Still, Ghost Robotics now holds the mantle as the company that provided the first ‘robo-dog’ for mainstream operational use to the Air Force, which is a huge accomplishment that will give them a leg up on the competition going forward. Historically, the U.S. military has eyed unmanned ground vehicles and robots for ‘pack mule’ roles , although motor technology has for years made these applications impractical due to energy needs and weight constraints . As battery technologies and novel approaches to drivetrains, such as those used by Ghost Robotics, continue to improve, it won’t be too long before warfighters are joined in battle by unmanned ground vehicles of all types. Still, the adaptation of the working dog concept from flesh to mechanized form is maybe the most intriguing. While there is no sign that combat K-9s will be retired for their mechanical counterparts anytime in the foreseeable future, one can imagine a reality in the very near term where military working dogs will operate right alongside their robotic cousins.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Inside The Air Force’s Elite Aggressor Program With One Of Its Top Pilots,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force takes its aggressor forces very seriously indeed. They are considered to be vital training assets that keep operational squadrons sharp, at the tip of the spear, and ready for whatever threats may come their way. One particular pilot has unprecedented experience in this field, and in this exclusive and in-depth interview, he charts the history and the changing fortunes of the fascinating and clandestine aggressor world that is now in a period of dramatic expansion. The aggressor world Fighter aircraft types decked out in exotic paint schemes are becoming a more regular sight on military flight lines. It reflects a renewed emphasis on high-end training for fighter pilots to meet near-peer threats, such as those posed by China and Russia. This has spurred a huge increase in professional aggressor assets that support regular training. Aggressor forces include aircraft, systems, and skilled operators that offer realistic airborne presentations of potential enemy equipment, tactics, and techniques to expose front line aviators to the kind of engagements they could meet in real-world aerial combat. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Stahl flies F-16Cs with the 64th Aggressor Squadron., USAF/SrA Brett Clashman It has become one of the most fascinating sides of modern military aviation, a booming industry for contractors, and a technology battle for in-house specialist squadrons, to be able to provide seamless replication of the wealth of high-end capabilities that are being fielded by possible adversaries. In 2016, the then commander of Air Combat Command General Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle said he wanted to outnumber F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II pilots against an effective aggressor force by a factor of 3:1 or 4:1. Carlisle, a former aggressor pilot himself, said that pilots of fifth-generation aircraft needed to go up against radar-equipped adversaries and for so-called ‘red air’ to be able to hold their own in the visual, close-quarters fight, as well as the beyond-visual-range one. The result is an expansion in aggressor forces like never seen before, combining a mixture of organic and contracted solutions . Aggressor training like this is nothing new — it stems from the U.S. Air Force’s Red Baron studies, which unpacked the air war over North Vietnam in extreme detail. They sought to understand why there had been such a marked change in the outcome of air-to-air engagements in the conflict. In the Korean War, USAF pilots achieved a 10:1 kill ratio over North Korean and Chinese adversaries, but by the Vietnam War, this dwindled. By 1968, the kill ratio was an appalling 2.5:1. The Red Baron reports looked at every significant air-to-air engagement of the war, and what factors led to a win or a loss. A critical component in the performance of American pilots was determined as a deficiency in training against dissimilar types. Pilots almost always flew against their squadron mates, which meant they had little if any experience of fighting aircraft with different performance characteristics. Even fewer pilots had any experience of going up against equipment, tactics, or capabilities that emulated a potential enemy. “The Red Baron study recommended fielding a professional aggressor force in order to make air combat training as realistic as possible,” explains Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jan ‘Kuts’ Stahl , who is currently the deputy commander of the tenant 57th Operations Group at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada. Nellis is known as “The Home of the Fighter Pilot,” and it’s here that the USAF focuses on making its Combat Air Forces squadrons as lethal as possible. As well as being home to the USAF’s elite Weapons School , and the famous Red Flag aerial wargames , it is also the home of the USAF’s aggressor forces. Stahl has been an aggressor pilot for over a decade. He is one of the most experienced aviators with this background in the entire USAF, and a mine of information when it comes to replicating bad guys in the air. “I’ve been in the air force for 21 years now. When I initially entered the Air Force, I was lucky enough to be selected to train at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas, which is also home to the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training scheme, and is really the pinnacle for fighter pilot training here. Instead of going through training with an all-American crowd, I got to fly with our European and coalition partners.” “I stayed at Sheppard as a FAIP [First Assignment Instructor Pilot] and during that time I made a lucky acquaintance with a seasoned German MiG-29 ‘driver’ who was also at Sheppard as an instructor. Unsure of which fighter community I wanted to go to, he said: ‘The F-15Cs kick our butts at Red Flag every time — you want to fly the C model.’ So I took his advice and selected Eagles, and was fortunate to get picked up for that.” “I did two operational tours in the F-15C — with the 58th Fighter Squadron [FS] at Eglin and with the 95th FS at Tyndall — and right at the time I finished that second tour the F-15C footprint in the USAF was drawing down a little. This Limited my options on where I could go. I had the opportunity to join the 65th Aggressor Squadron flying F-15s at Nellis, and so I moved here in 2009.” “Fast forward about three years and I made the transition from flying with the 65th as an active-duty pilot, to join the reserves and continuing to fly with that squadron.” A pair of F-15Cs from the 65th Aggressor Squadron, which was shut down in 2014., Jamie Hunter Genesis of the aggressors In the wake of Red Baron, the USAF immersed a handpicked group of pilots, maintainers, and intelligence experts into a world of Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) to understand the mindset, the tactics, and the capabilities of principal adversaries. Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) was able to secretly acquire and fly a handful of acquired MiG-17s and MiG-21s from the late 1960s in order to fully understand their capabilities. The 64th Fighter Weapons Squadron (FWS) was established at Nellis in 1972, initially equipped with T-38 Talons and quickly becoming a training unit in high demand. The USAF subsequently formed the 527th Aggressor Squadron flying F-5E Tiger IIs at RAF Alconbury, in the United Kingdom, and the 26th Aggressor Squadron at Clark Air Base in the Philippines, as the aggressor mission gained steam. An F-5E from the 26th Aggressor Squadron at Clark Air Base flies with a resident F-4E Phantom II., USAF/SSgt Taninggo In 1977, Tactical Air Command (TAC) was allowed to take ownership of a handful of the MiGs in order to initiate the exposure of squadron pilots to these “assets” under a highly classified program known as “ Constant Peg .” This was designed to take Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) up another notch via the use of actual threat aircraft. You can read more about Constant Peg and the associated 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) “Red Eagles” program here . The initial cadre of aggressor pilots at the 64th FWS had access to the assets which enabled them to build their knowledge base and refine the threat presentations they provided. In addition, TAC squadron aircrews had the chance to experience flying against real Soviet aircraft during detachments or in special slots during Red Flag exercises. “As Constant Peg was being fielded, the aggressors provided an additional layer of operational security for that program in the sense that there were several experienced aggressors that flew here at Nellis for two or three days a week, and who were then very quietly flown to Tonopah for the remainder of their duty periods to fly the MiGs up there,” Stahl confirms. “This provided a cover story to not only keep that program as operationally secure as possible, but it also generated additional credibility and skill level for the aggressors in the sense that those were the exact same guys that were actually operating the threat assets and knew better than anyone else what those airframes could actually do in the air.” By the 1990s, the end of the Cold War and ensuing cutbacks started to severely impact the aggressors. Constant Peg officially wound down in 1988, followed by the 64th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS) in 2000. At one stage, the entire formal USAF red air program consisted of a handful of F-16s that were attached to the 414th Combat Training Squadron at Nellis. However, by 2003, the 64th AGRS was back in business, followed by the 18th AGRS at Eielson AFB, in 2007, to primarily support Red Flag Alaska. Both were equipped with early Block F-16C/Ds. In addition, the USAF was busy reactivating the 65th AGRS with F-15C/Ds, which would raise the bar once more for the USAF aggressors. F-16Cs from the 64th AGRS and F-15Cs from the 65th AGRS, photographed in 2010., Jamie Hunter Becoming an aggressor “The aggressor program has gone through a number of changes over the years,” says Lieutenant Colonel Col Stahl. “At the time I was selected, the bottom line prerequisite to join the aggressors was that you had to be a highly experienced instructor pilot, and not just that, the aggressors had a list of people who were potential candidates and they individually checked them — name by name vetting — to pick people who were not just qualified as instructors, but who also had the right attitude and the ability to not just want to win all the time, but to actually teach the blue air participants — those very subtle and detailed lessons learned against particular threats. I was lucky enough to get selected.” “To become an aggressor — to a certain extent — you need to be a bit of a nerd. Interested and caring not just the airframe that you fly, but also the threat airframes. Part of the process is immersing yourself in that environment and being as smart as you possibly can about a particular topic. The air force picks up a new pilot or ground controller and selects a particular specialisation track for them.” “For example, when I initially joined the aggressors, the chosen topic for me was air-to-air radar-guided missiles. This meant I went to our FME counterparts, saw the actual missiles taken apart and knew what each individual component part did and how it performed. I went to our intelligence counterparts at the CIA and at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center [NASIC] to put my head together with the best minds in the business to try to learn about that topic. They sent me to foreign trade shows in China, Russia, Belarus, you name it, so I could put eyes on these exact assets and try to learn as much about them as I possibly could.” “It was a multi-year process; being as smart as possible on that topic, while also maintaining a baseline knowledge of other threat systems. It takes significant effort and expense to give the aggressors exposure to these systems. When you complete the process of certification you get a Russian Ruble [coin] with your name engraved on it — that’s how you distinguish an experienced aggressor from a newbie.” Aggressor F-15s over the Nevada Test and Training Range in 2010., Jamie Hunter Stahl flew with the 65th AGRS to within six months of its deactivation in early 2014. “When the squadron shut down I could have either moved away to fly F-15s at another base, or if I wanted to stay at Nellis I had the opportunity to cross train to the F-16, either for the local aggressor program with the 64th, or into other Nellis-based activities like operational test with the F-16, which is what I ended up doing.” Stahl then commanded the little-known 706th Fighter Squadron until 2019, which he explains is by far the largest fighter squadron in the entire USAF in terms of people, but doesn’t own any airframes of its own. “It’s also one of the few fighter squadrons that has pilots that fly every fighter MDS [Mission Design Series] in the service.” The 706th is a reserve squadron that loans experienced aviators to the active-duty units at Nellis. “If a highly skilled, highly experienced, instructor pilot decides to leave the active-duty, we offer them the opportunity to switch patches and stay locally so we can continue to draw benefit on their experience and corporate knowledge — that’s what happened to me.” A new era of expansion The 65th AGRS ended up flying F-15C/Ds from 2006 until it closed its doors in 2014. That was a controversial decision ultimately driven by a dire budgetary situation. “It was a complicated story,” says Stahl. “With the international security situation, aggressors are always in high demand. The fact that Nellis wants to continue to field a challenging training environment that simulates those aggressive efforts to challenge the warfighting advantages that we have, means there needs to be a constant development in the quality of the focus we have here to train blue [forces]. Nellis needed aggressors more than ever at that time.” “The F-35 footprint at Nellis was just beginning to get spun up at that point as well. We were going to need more aggressors, not less. The aggressors that we did have needed that next level of capability in order to provide a challenging sparring partner to the fifth-generation guys. It wasn’t a decision made easily — for budgetary reasons there was just no way to keep the unit open at the time. It was a decision that we are now having to deal with the after-effects of.” “The combined, fielded, aggressor forces we have here at Nellis are barely able to fill 70 or so percent of what our optimal demand for adversary forces is. That’s what was leading the USAF to look at alternative courses of action such as contract aggressors, as well as inviting visiting units from elsewhere to come and help us out.” Contracted aggressors help the USAF to provide a suitable mass of red air., USAF/A1C Kimberly Barrera “Because of the demands that you put on the adversaries here at Nellis, it was clear from the get-go that we weren’t going to be able to shut down a unit like the 65th and immediately replace it with something equivalent. The fielding of contract aggressor forces was always intended to be a multi-year process in which initially we put jets on the line to fill more of the demand for quantity as opposed to the demand for quality. We then put measures in place that over a period of multiple years to stimulate the contract adversary industry to put some of these specific requirements and demands that we need in order to meet that quality benchmark, as well.” “At the moment I think we’re still in the early stages of that process, but there’s some really promising signs that — in the near future — we’re going to get some fairly significant capability increases from what the contractors are offering us. That’s going to take some of the strain off some of the USAF aggressors, which I would say are the ultimate low density, high demand assets that we have here.” The USAF is ultimately looking to stimulate the red air contractors to gradually build to a point where they’re financially and operationally able to field airframes of higher and higher capability. “The Air Force was deliberate to not put all the eggs in one basket, and split the contracts up to see which of them was going to be more successful in continuing to ramp up the capabilities that they are able to field,” explains Stahl. “The contracts also break adversaries down into various capability levels, because what you need for a trainee flying their first couple of flights in say an F-16 is not the same as you need for an F-22 Weapons Officer.” A handful of F-15Cs were assigned to the 57th Adversary Tactics Group at Nellis for a short period after the 65th AGRS closed down., Jamie Hunter “The Air Force is offering a lower entry level aggressor, which allows some companies to come in with a fairly low upfront investment to get into the contract and be able to generate revenue. Then they are gradually raising capabilities to levels that the company can progress into. Based on what we’ve heard here, there’s a lot of companies out there that have some really exciting capabilities that they’re working on. They need to get their foot in the door and start making revenue, then starting making the investment.” “The Weapons School is our central coordinating authority here, because they take up most of the aggressor demand at Nellis. They apportion who does what, who does the 64th AGRS support, who does Draken International support, or do we support together. Managing the contracts and ensuring the contractors meet those quality benchmarks is where the aggressors come in. We lead the missions that they are part of, and we also run the post-mission reviews of performance, and ensure they comply with demands and tactical learning points that we required them to provide.” Existing F-16Cs within the 64th AGRS will be complemented by examples being passed across from the 24th TASS., Jamie Hunter Aggressor developments at Nellis As well as leaning on the contractor-furnished solutions, the USAF is pushing up the high-end capabilities of its in-house aggressors. It plans to increase the size of the 64th AGRS, and reform the sister 65th AGRS in 2021. Internal USAF reorganization has resulted in a decision to close down the 24th Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS), which flies Vipers at Nellis. The unit is currently a centralized location for training F-16 Close Air Support (CAS) instructors and for retaining a dedicated close air support knowledge base. Its closure has presented a good opportunity to move its Block 42 F-16C/D Vipers over to the aggressors. “We currently have 19 pre-Block F-16s [Block 25 and 32] and the game plan is to take over an additional 11 Block 42 F-16s,” says Stahl. “Initially, when the 24th TASS shuts down, the 64th AGRS is going to become a very large squadron, but there are efforts underway to reactivate the 65th AGRS — around the summer of 2021 — when we split those assets into two units to make them a bit more manageable,” Stahl explains. The 64th will probably retain the Block 25/32 aircraft, and the aircraft from the 24th TASS will most likely flow over to the 65th AGRS as that unit is reactivated. “That’s when it gets really interesting, because that’s when the early Block F-35s start arriving here at Nellis and move into the 65th AGRS which then becomes a mixed F-35 and F-16 aggressor squadron,” Stahl enthuses. “It’s still in a bit of flux, but I think it’s fair to say that summer 2021 is when we expect to see those first F-35s [here at the aggressors].” “The goal for the aggressors has always been where we are essentially matching the aggressiveness of our global competitors. They are fielding technology at a rapid pace and our goal has always been to match and if possible exceed that level of technological advancement — so the threat we are preparing the warfighter for locally exceeds anything that they’re ever likely to face in battle. Not necessarily just from a technological standpoint but also from the employment standpoint. We’re here to have the technology, then employ it to its highest level so we’re presenting the highest that we can possibly put together.” Early Block F-35As will join the Nellis aggressors in 2021., Jamie Hunter Alongside the F-35s, the introduction of Block 42 F-16 Vipers will bring additional benefits for the aggressors. Their Link 16 data links will be an early boost for the USAF aggressors at Nellis. Some of the current F-16s with the 64th AGRS carry the SADL ( Situational Awareness Data Link ), which serves as an intra-flight link between the aggressors. Link 16 will enable the new 65th AGRS adversaries to make use of a full battlespace picture, and operate more independently as a coordinated team, instead of a more traditional approach of working with Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) controllers. It’s also worth noting that the F-35A has a Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), which interfaces with Link 16 via a gateway , so it can receive information from the Vipers while remaining fully stealthy and it can share information, as well. One of the advantages of MADL is that it is stealthy by design due to its transmission architecture. F-35 also has organic Link 16 broadcast capability, but using it can negate the aircraft’s stealth capabilities. Instead of targeting fleetwide capabilities, the aggressors are able to dip into new areas of technology to add small niche capabilities to help them replicate specific real-world threats. One of the 64th AGRS F-16s flew with a pod very similar to the Legion infrared search and track (IRST) pod in 2013, and Stahl says work has also been undertaken with Litening and Sniper targeting pods to simulate IRST capability . The Block 42 F-16 avionics architecture is also more readily able to support the fielding of new systems, such as the Angry Kitten pod , which was recently adopted by the 64th AGRS. This pod incorporates advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM), which is the highest complexity jamming technology and can counter increasingly sophisticated electronic warfare threats. The Operational Flight Program (OFP) in the later block F-16s is more frequently updated and readily able to accept enhancements that can help keep the aggressors relevant. A 64th AGRS pilot loads a data card into an Angry Kitten jamming pod., Jamie Hunter An Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar is another capability that the aggressor F-16s would benefit from, as increasing numbers of threat aircraft have these advanced sensors. The USAF is already fielding new Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 AESA radars in its F-16 fleet, and Stahl says for the aggressors; “it’s a capability that has to happen sooner or later.” New threats, new ways to replicate So how does a modern day F-16 aggressor pilot learn how to fly in a way that accurately replicates the nuances of a Chinese J-20 Mighty Dragon , for example. Stahl says: “You need to know how the system operates, and how the pilot operates in that particular system. So, when we’re looking at the J-20, for instance, there as much emphasis on trying to look inside the mind of the Chinese pilot. What caliber of person they’re recruiting to fly that asset, the background those pilots are from, what they flew before and experiences they’re likely to have had, where they’ve been based, what operational scenarios they are trained to.” “Every once in a while the stars align and a particular asset that we want to know more about becomes available for us to actually touch. For instance, I was lucky enough to have the once in a lifetime opportunity to fly the Su-30MKI when the Indian Air Force came to Red Flag Alaska in 2016. If you want to get smart about how a Flanker operates, that’s about as good as it gets. Obviously, as aggressors, we position ourselves when opportunities like these become available to ensure we’re ready for it and take advantage of it. We take what we can get. Flying the Su-30 was definitely a pinnacle in my career.” Other methods to bring accurate threat replication to USAF pilots are coming via synthetic training, either in simulators, or in embedded virtual constructive training scenarios. “The biggest emphasis the Air Force is currently trying to get the operators to agree to is that the future lies in Live, Virtual and Constructive [LVC] integration,” explains Stahl. “It’s not so much about which environment and medium in which we do the bulk of our training, but which medium is best suited to train to specific capabilities that we need the operator to have. For instance, threat countries are coming up with next-generation missile capabilities that allows you to take air-to-air shots at ranges that even 10 years ago we would never have even considered.” ‘We want to simulate and train to those capabilities, but we start to running into things like airspace limitations. The Nevada Test and Training Range [NTTR] is literally not long enough to allow us to simulate the full range capability of some of these weapons that we have to train against. Now you get into a situation where other mediums are better suited for training against that specific capability, and the challenge is how you tie all these mediums together.” Lt Col Stahl in the cockpit of an F-16., USAF/SrA Brett Clashman “The live part is what we do in jets. The virtual is where we take actual operators and get them to work their platforms in a simulator. The constructive element is where you have threat entities actually simulated by a computer system — simulated entities inside a simulator system — that’s what we hope to be able to do as we refine LVC, blend them seamlessly with some of the live and virtual. If I take my jet into the NTTR, where I can see some of the virtual and constructive entities simultaneously with the real world elements I’m training against, and now we see these next generation threats.” One of the nodes that will tie together and enable some of this LVC is currently in progress at Nellis. The Virtual Test and Training Center (VTTC) is spearheading this charge. “Initial steps are already in place,” says Stahl. “At higher level exercises like Weapons School Integration and certain Red Flags, virtual and constructive is a significant part of what we do, because of the complexity of the threat we are being asked to simulate. The goal of the VTTC is to afford more simulation infrastructure here. The trick is to tie [the various technologies] together where they talk to each other and become visible to one another in their own architectures, and how they then become relevant to simulate a particular capability or particular threat that we need to train against.” A 64th AGRS F-16C joins F-22 Raptors for a night mission during a Red Flag exercise., Jamie Hunter A constant evolution The use of advanced simulations will undoubtedly be one of the biggest changes in the way the aggressors operate. However, the vast majority of current training is dedicated to live flying. Stahl says the main evolution he has seen in the aggressors has been a focus from pure DACT (dogfighting) towards maximizing the integration of assets, both on the blue and red air sides of the house. “On the blue side, we try to provide a threat that not only challenges individual airframes, but also the ability for those to work together. We have tried to come up with counter-tactics that specifically challenge the 4th and 5th gen integration. Say you have four Raptors and four Eagles trying to employ in the air-to-air environment at the same time, we have to come up with specific counter tactics that challenge the way that they work together, and the tactics they use.” A photograph from 2010 showing Nellis aggressors alongside a 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron F-15E and F-22A., Jamie Hunter “On the red side, it means we have to work very closely together, for example with our surface-to-air-missile shooters on the range, and try to come with tactics that involve both of those elements working in close conjunction. For example, we might put the fighters forward and keep the SAMs quiet, then maybe pull the fighters back and light up every SAM battery — there’s a significant amount of integration and interplay that we can achieve, but it requires that next-gen mindset. Not just in the narrow lane of your own capabilities, but how to best bring them all together into one coherent threat picture that gives blue as big of a challenge as possible.” In addition to the missiles and fighters, this also includes the cyber and space domains, which Stahl says massively increases complexity. “I’d say this is the biggest way in which our mission has evolved in the last couple of years. This is such a fast-moving ballgame, capabilities are being fielded all the time and some quickly become obsolete.” Stahl explains that the aggressors’ knowledge of threat capabilities in these areas are extremely high. Turning back to the aircraft themselves, Stahl says the proliferation of 5th generation stealth fighters has had a big impact on the mission. “This has significantly changed the way we do business, in the sense that there’s really nobody else in the world that’s doing as much training using 5th gen assets as we are. So, we are having to take a bit of a leap of faith and make our own assumptions regarding what an adversary would possibly do when faced with a 5th gen adversary. We are making assumptions in a 5th gen vs 4th gen engagement, and a 5th gen vs 5th gen environment now that we have the F-35s coming online with the aggressors as well.” “There’s a level of guesswork for realistic scenarios as to what could happen, but as Russia comes online with the Su-57 Felon and China with the J-20 , we are watching those developments very carefully so we can make informed decisions on how we can tweak the scenarios locally to make them as relevant to what’s going on in threat countries as we possibly can.” As to the most rewarding missions as an aggressor, Stahl reflects on the time he led a 48-aircraft red air “package” that included 12 different platforms. “Being “MiG-1” for a 48-ship mission in a Red Flag and seeing the game plan come together was amazing. To present a challenging threat, you have to expand your situational awareness as much as you possibly can so that when merges [dogfights] happen, even if you don’t see everybody, you have the awareness of who is in that merge with you. Are they high or low, which way are they heading, how your turn performance will match? It’s like three-dimensional chess at 1,000 mph, and it takes many years to get good at it.” Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Jamie Hunter Contributor Americas Around The Globe History News & Features People U.S. Homeland"

Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division recently demonstrated the ability of a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane to remotely use computers on the ground to help process data from onboard sensors and other systems in flight. The U-2S did this by leveraging a system that Skunk Works and the U.S. Air Force recently used to show how these aircraft, as well as others, will be able to receive updates for their mission computers, including new code to add previously unavailable functionality, in mid-air in the future. This “distributed processing” flight test took place in November, according to Skunk Works. The U-2S involved was able to establish a link to “a ground node” via a computer cloud , through which it was able to better disseminate sensor information. Doing this allowed the aircraft to make use of additional computer processing power offboard the aircraft. A U-2S Dragon Lady., USAF “The U-2 Kubernetes demonstration from mid-November not only advances the deployment pipeline for in-flight software upgrades but also operationally extends the computational resources for mission execution,” Jeff Babione, the Vice President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, said in a statement. “This additional capability makes it possible for the warfighter to quickly adapt to changing threat environments without costly or time-consuming system upgrades.” The cloud computer software on the U-2S was installed via Kubernetes , which is described as an “open-source container-orchestration system” that supports the automated installing, modification, and updating of programs. Skunk Works said that this configuration had been previously used in another demonstration, called OpenAirKube, in August. This appears to be a reference to a first-of-its-kind in-flight software updating test involving a U-2S that the Air Force first publicly disclosed in October and that you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . Skunk Works has also now disclosed that this software has been installed on the aircraft via its Enterprise Open System Architecture Mission Computer (EMC2), also known as the Einstein Box . EMC2 made its public debut in 2017 and is under development as part of an upgrade package for the Air Force’s entire Dragon Lady fleet. A U-2S equipped with the Einstein Box takes off during Exercise Northern Edge in 2017., USAF EMC2 is designed to be compliant with the Air Force’s Open Mission Systems standards, which it first formalized in 2014. The broad goal of this effort has been to develop open-architecture systems that can be rapidly updated to improve their capabilities and add in new functionality. In the past, EMC2 has been primarily described as a communications and datalink gateway for the rapid dissemination of information, which also allows the U-2S to act as a relay for data between other platforms. Previous tests of Dragon Ladies carrying this mission computer have demonstrated how it could provide a link to enable the retasking of missiles from one target to another in flight, as well as providing individuals on the ground a means to remotely reorient sensors on the aircraft in mid-air. This latest test showed how EMC2, using software installed through Kubernetes, could help expand the U-2S’ own capabilities to sift through sensor data it collects in order to provide useful intelligence in a timely manner. The Air Force, among others, has increasingly come to realize that the figurative mountain of information that ever-more-powerful intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems can scoop up is both a blessing and a curse. The Enterprise Open System Architecture Mission Computer (EMC2), or the Einstein Box., Lockheed Martin Just with regards to imagery, “sensors have rapidly increased in fidelity, and are now able to collect vast quantities of data, which must be analyzed promptly to provide mission-critical information,” a 2018 white paper on Agile Condor, a podded targeting computer for drones that SRC, Inc. is developing for the Air Force, explains. “In-mission data transfers … can provide data more quickly, but this method requires more power and available bandwidth to send data.” It is worth noting that Agile Condor, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , also includes artificial intelligence-driven capabilities to parse through imagery or other information quickly initially, automatically discarding data that is “empty” of items of interest best on established parameters. Still, the core issues it is meant to address apply equally to the U-2S and other ISR platforms and aren’t only limited to the processing and transferring of imagery in near-real-time. One option to address the need for extra computing power is to add additional physical hardware, such as Agile Condor, onto the aircraft. What Skunk Works has now demonstrated is a way to provide increased computing capacity, but only as needed and without necessarily requiring the addition of large amounts of additional equipment. Skunk Works told The War Zone that this distributed computing capability wouldn’t necessarily be limited to processing sensor data, either. It could also help with “mission plans” and “other high processing demand activities” in flight. These kinds of processing demands are only likely to grow in the future. At the same time, physical space and total payload weight capacity, as well as the power needed for increasingly more advanced electronic systems and the cooling requirements that go along with them, will be generally at a premium on combat aircraft. This could make this cloud-computing package a very important capability for U.S. military aviation communities, broadly, as time goes on if the required equipment and software can be scaled down sufficiently, both physically and in terms of cost. With all this in mind, one would imagine that this capability might potentially have applications for other platforms on the ground, at sea, or even in space. The Air Force’s previous experimentation around using Kubernetes on the U-2S has already shown an exciting path to adding possibly game-changing capabilities to various kinds of aircraft through dynamic, in-flight software updating. Skunk Works has now shown that those same systems may also offer a gateway to expand on existing functionality without necessarily having to make major additions to any onboard computer software package. All told, it will be very interesting to see where Skunk Works, as well as the Air Force, take this Kubernetes-enabled technology they’re developing for the U-2S next and how the capabilities being demonstrated will find its way onto other platforms in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States has slapped sanctions on the Turkish government’s top defense procurement and military-industrial arm over the country’s purchase of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system . As well as targeting important members of the country’s defense establishment, there are also provisions that could threaten Turkey’s ability to secure future defense-related exports from the United States . A statement from the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier today confirmed that the measures were being implemented under section 231 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. They are all directed against Turkey’s Presidency of Defense Industries, known by its Turkish acronym SSB. Among its duties, the SSB helps coordinate defense-related technology transfers and the delivery of foreign-made military hardware, as well as supporting and promoting the work of Turkish defense companies. Trucks associated with the S-400 air defense system arrive in Turkey in July last year., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE Pompeo said that the sanctions were in response to Turkey “knowingly engaging in a significant transaction with Rosoboronexport, Russia’s main arms export entity, procuring the S-400 surface-to-air missile.” The U.S. government has long criticized this purchase primarily as presenting a security risk to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, asserting that it could provide the Kremlin with an avenue to acquiring sensitive information about that aircraft and its capabilities. This already led to Turkey being ejected from the F-35 program last year . CAASTA, among its many sections, provides an automatic mechanism for placing second-order sanctions on third-party countries that engage with Russia’s defense sector, as a means of deterring them from doing so. It is worth noting that the law outlines certain circumstances under which the President can seek to waive these required sanctions. Pompeo’s statement continues: “The United States made clear to Turkey at the highest levels and on numerous occasions that its purchase of the S-400 system would endanger the security of U.S. military technology and personnel and provide substantial funds to Russia’s defense sector, as well as Russian access to the Turkish armed forces and defense industry. Turkey nevertheless decided to move ahead with the procurement and testing of the S-400, despite the availability of alternative, NATO-interoperable systems to meet its defense requirements. This decision resulted in Turkey’s suspension and pending removal from the global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter partnership.” The first S-400 components began to arrive at Murted Air Base outside the Turkish capital Ankara on July 12, 2019, a process that you can read about here , and a first test-firing campaign for the new missiles reportedly took place last October . What is currently unclear is why it took so long to trigger the CAASTA sanctions, considering the S-400 systems have been in Turkey for almost 18 months now, and this would normally be an automatic process. One explanation might be offered by U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, who released the following statement regarding the sanctions against Turkey, his office noting also that he had “repeatedly pressed the [Trump] administration to put these sanctions into place.” The emphasis in Van Hollen’s statement has been added: “After watching President Trump repeatedly refuse to hold Turkey and President Erdogan accountable, I’m glad to see this administration finally impose these required sanctions — even if it was only under the imminent threat of further congressional action . These measures send a clear message to [Turkish President] Erdoğan: we will not allow him to undermine our national security and that of our faithful NATO allies without consequence. I will continue working to keep the pressure on Turkey to meet its obligations to the security of all members of the NATO Alliance.” Whatever was the reason for the U.S administration dragging its feet, it has now made its move, although it is also worth noting that there were at least some behind-the-scenes efforts by U.S. officials to prevent certain arms transfers to Turkey in the interim. As well as banning all U.S. export licenses to the SSB, the new sanctions also freeze the assets and place visa restrictions on the SSB President, Dr. Ismail Demir, together with selected other SSB officers. Ankara was kicked out of the Joint Strike Fighter program beginning in July 2019, after its refusal to halt plans to acquire the S-400 from Russia. The process began with the removal of Turkish pilots from the F-35 training program in the United States, the barring of the country’s liaisons from the central Joint Program Office, and the first efforts to cut Turkish companies out of the international supply chain for the jets. The official presentation ceremony of the first Turkish F-35A at Fort Worth, Texas, in June 2018., ANADOLU AGENCY Seeking to distance the sanctions from its erstwhile NATO ally and plant the blame firmly on Moscow instead, today’s statement further notes that the United States “will not tolerate significant transactions with Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors,” while Pompeo also calls for Turkey “to resolve the S-400 problem immediately in coordination with the United States.” With that in mind, the statement concludes by declaring that Turkey is a “valued ally and an important regional security partner for the United States,” and that the United States hopes to resume “productive defense-sector cooperation by removing the obstacle of Turkey’s S-400 possession as soon as possible.” Furthermore, the U.S. Department of State says that the sanctions are “not intended to undermine the military capabilities or combat readiness of Turkey or any other U.S. ally or partner, but rather to impose costs on Russia in response to its wide range of malign activities.” Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile transport-erector-launchers in Syria. Moscow’s activities here, and elsewhere, have led to the U.S. State Department descrying its “malign activities.” , RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY PRESS SERVICE VIA AP As well as the problem of a NATO member helping support Moscow’s defense industry, U.S. officials also repeatedly raised their concerns about the threat to security posed by the Turkish S-400 acquisition. In particular, there was a fear that the F-35 — in service with the United States and close allies F-35 — could be compromised if operated by Turkey alongside the S-400s. Above all, it was suggested that sensitive details about the stealthy jet’s radar signature and other capabilities could be passed on to the Kremlin. Specifically directed against Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors, the CAATSA 231 procedure requires the executive branch to implement five sanctions from a menu of 12 outlined in Section 235. In this case, all five of the required sanctions are directed against the SSB. Aside from the prohibition of U.S. export licenses to the SSB and the restrictions placed on SSB officials, the other three sanctions consist of prohibitions on loans, credits, and assistance from U.S. financial institutions, and opposition to loans to the SSB from international financial institutions, as outlined here, in full, by the State Department: The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury, has selected the following sanctions from CAATSA Section 235, as implemented by Executive Order (E.O.) 13849, to impose on SSB: a prohibition on granting specific U.S. export licenses and authorizations for any goods or technology transferred to SSB (Section 235(a)(2)); a prohibition on loans or credits by U.S. financial institutions to SSB totaling more than $10 million in any 12-month period (Section 235(a)(3)); a ban on U.S. Export-Import Bank assistance for exports to SSB (Section 235(a)(1)); a requirement for the United States to oppose loans benefitting SSB by international financial institutions (Section 235(a)(4)); and imposition of full blocking sanctions and visa restrictions (Section 235(a)(7), (8), (9), (11), and (12)) on Dr. Ismail Demir, president of SSB; Faruk Yigit, SSB’s vice president; Serhat Gencoglu, Head of SSB’s Department of Air Defense and Space; and Mustafa Alper Deniz, Program Manager for SSB’s Regional Air Defense Systems Directorate. Exactly how the limitations on specific U.S. export licenses and authorizations will manifest themselves is not yet clear, but these aspects of the sanctions would appear to threaten the future supply of U.S.-made arms to Turkey, potentially including spares for its fleet of F-16 fighter jets , for example. There is also the possibility that the restrictions refer only to potential future arms transfers, rather than any deals that are currently in process, or those that are handled by channels other than the SSB. As it stands, the wording of the statement gives very little away in this regard. A Turkish Air Force F-16 pair heads out on a training mission., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE Back in July 2019, we examined reports of how Turkey was stockpiling spare parts for its F-16s as it waited for potential U.S. sanctions expected to follow the delivery of the first S-400 systems. You can read more about that process in this previous War Zone article . In addition to this, and the new round of sanctions, there have also been calls to remove U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. If U.S. lawmakers feel they need to pressure Ankara still further, then this might be one course of action. Suspending joint U.S.-Turkish military maneuvers might be another course of action. As it is, following up Ankara’s ejection from the F-35 program with the CAATSA measures is a clear signal that the United States is willing to enact additional measures to censure Turkey, and there could still be more to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 25, 2020",Explosive-Laden Boat Strikes Oil Tanker In Saudi Arabian Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabian authorities say an attack on a Singapore-flagged oil tanker BW Rhine , which took place at an oil terminal in the port city of Jeddah in the Red Sea earlier today, was carried out using an explosive-laden boat. This is a tactic that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels based in Yemen have used on multiple occasions . It also follows a string of attacks and attempted attacks targeting tankers and other coastal oil infrastructure in this region, some of which bore certain hallmarks of other past incidents linked to Iran and its regional proxies. The statement from Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry, via the country’s state-run Saudi Press Agency, also described the incident as a “ terrorist attack ,” but did not directly accuse any specific group of carrying it out. No terrorist or militant organization has claimed responsibility so far. The oil tanker BW Rhine ., Hafnia “These acts of terrorism and vandalism, directed against vital installations, go beyond the kingdom and its vital facilities, to the security and stability of energy supplies to the world and the global economy,” the statement added. BW Rhine had been discharging its cargo of gasoline , which it had brought from the Saudi port Yanbu under charter to the oil company Aramco, in Jeddah at the time of the attack. Saudi officials only issued that statement approximately 12 hours after the attack occurred. The BW Rhine came under attack at 12:40 AM local time on Dec. 14, according to an earlier statement from Hafnia, part of the BW Group, which owns and operates the ships. That press release had only blamed the explosion that hit the ship on an “ external source .” “The Master [of the ship] immediately ceased all discharge operations and enacted emergency procedures onboard. The crew have extinguished the fire with assistance from the shore fire brigade and tug boats, and all 22 seafarers have been accounted for with no injuries,” Hafnia’s statement added. “Hull damage has occurred at 5P WBT (water ballast tank 5 on the port side) and 4P COT (cargo tank 4 on the port side). It is possible that some oil has escaped from the vessel, but this has not been confirmed and instrumentation currently indicates that oil levels on board are at the same level as before the incident. “Cooling procedures and inerting of cargo space have been initiated to avoid reignition of fire,” it continued. “Ship stability is being assessed before proceeding with any further operations.” An alert that the U.K. Maritime Trade Operations group subsequently issued said that the attack forced the closure of the port of Jeddah for some amount of time, citing the Jeddah Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Center. At the time of writing, Saudi Arabian authorities had neither confirmed nor denied any such port closure. This is the fourth known attack or attempted attack on a tanker or other coastal oil infrastructure along Saudi Arabia’s southern Red Sea coast since the beginning of November, according to Ambrey, a maritime security firm. On Nov. 11, there was another attempted attack on the oil terminal in Jizan, to the south of Jeddah, involving an explosive-laden boat. On Nov. 25, the Malta-flagged MT Agrari was struck by what may have been a limpet mine , drawing comparisons to attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman last year that were linked to Iran or its regional proxies. In addition, on Nov. 23, a ground-launched cruise missile struck an oil-related facility outside of Jeddah. Houthi rebels in Yemen did claim responsibility for that strike, which also evoked memories of an unprecedented cruise missile and drone attacks on multiple oil infrastructure targets much further to the northwest in Saudi Arabia in 2019. The Houthis initially claimed responsibility for those strikes, but the U.S. government subsequently accused Iran of having carried them out directly. The Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship MV Hasan came under some form of attack while sailing off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden on Dec. 5. The exact circumstances surrounding that incident remain murky , but the vessel and its crew escaped unscathed. Ambrey also noted that there had been reports of a foiled explosive boat attack in the Red Sea on Dec. 9 and that another explosive-laden watercraft had been seized off the coast of Yemen the month before. The Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting the Houthi rebels in Yemen regularly reports having captured or destroyed these kinds of boats, which are remote-controlled or otherwise unmanned, in the region. The Houthis have been employing them for years now, successfully targeting warships and commercial vessels . Still, the attack on BW Rhine does represent a notable uptick in such attacks and attempted attacks in recent weeks and a significant increase in incidents occurring in and around Saudi port cities along the Red Sea, rather than somewhere out in that body of water or in the nearby Gulf of Aden. The Bab Al Mandab Strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden is an immensely strategic waterway for oil and other petroleum exports from the region, as well as other commercial shipping. The Houthis have threatened to effectively blockade the Red Sea in the past, using explosive-laden boats, as well as naval mines and shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles , in response to the actions of the Saudi Arabian-led coalition. The exact combination factors that may be driving this new surge in attacks in the region is unclear, but they did appear to start following the election loss of President Donald Trump to President-Elect Joe Biden in November. The Trump Administration has pursued a hard-line strategy against Iran over the past four years, notably withdrawing from the controversial multi-national deal regarding Tehran’s nuclear program. The incoming Biden Administration, which will take over in January, has expressed interest in rejoining that agreement , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. These attacks could be intended to add further pressure on the U.S. government, as well as its regional allies, to acquiesce to other Iranian demands as part of any such negotiations. The Trump Administration has also been pushing Saudi Arabia to normalize its relations with Israel, as a number of other countries have recently agreed to do through U.S.-brokered deals . A clear goal of this diplomatic push has been to further isolate Iran. In addition, nefarious activities in and around the Red Sea are also now coming in the wake of the assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an operation Iran says that Israel carried out and for which it has threatened to retaliate. Asymmetric attacks, including those carried out by regional proxies, are among the most likely avenues for the regime in Tehran to respond to that attack on its own soil. Just last week, there were reports that the U.S. military forces in the region had gone on heightened alert due to concerns about potential Iranian or Iranian-backed attacks. Whatever the case, the worrisome trend in attacks in the Red Sea region that has been visible for weeks now does not show any signs of decelerating.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has released an incredible image taken from inside the glazed nose of the Il-76 ‘Candid’ cargo jet that looks as if it was a screen capture from inside an imperial fighter or bomber from Star Wars. The timing couldn’t be better for such an image and the fact that the cockpit of the fictional bad-guy starfighters in Star Wars look so similar to the Il-76’s navigator’s compartment isn’t really an accident. Star Wars fans are entering into a dream-like golden era of space dogfighting action. Star Wars: Squadrons is a big hit. The videogame has finally put players right in the cockpit of their own X-Wing or TIE Fighter via virtual reality headsets. At the same time, the House of Mouse has announced the first Star Wars movie following the mess that was the sequel trilogy and it won’t be about the cursed Skywalker family.

So, yeah. If you are into space combat in the Star Wars universe, life is about to go from good, to amazing. The reality is that the similarities between the Il-76’s navigator station and the cockpit of a TIE fighter, interceptor, or bomber aren’t happenstance. George Lucas used a tremendous amount of World War II theming and imagery to construct his one-of-a-kind world—the ships included. The Millenium Falcon’s own cockpit and gunner stations were famously inspired by the B-29 Superfortress and other Allied bombers from the war. B-29 “Fifi” cockpit. , Acroterion/wikicommons Millennium Falcon’s iconic cockpit., Screengrab/Lucas Film The TIE fighters and bombers were also inspired by the glazed nose configuration that became a mainstay of World War II designs, both of Allied and Axis origins. The concept lingered on into the dawn of the jet age that came shortly after the end of the war, and beyond. Nazi-designed Do 17 with its faceted glazed nose., Public Domain Japanese G4M Betty bomber had near-identical glazed sections front and back., Public Domain The giant post-war B-36 Peacemaker had an elaborate glazed cockpit and nose section., Lockheed Martin The Soviet Tu-16 Badger, with its glazed nose, first flew in 1954. , FAS.org It turns out that Lucas may have borrowed beyond just theming and visuals from World War II. He also pulled heavily from the World War II air combat film genre as well. This is especially true in terms of The Dam Busters: While these greenhouse-like nose sections fell out of favor with the West fairly quickly as the jet age roared on, Soviet designs continued to leverage the concept. Fast forward to today, and the Il-76 is maybe the last jet aircraft in production with an elaborate glazed nose. Part of the reason for this is that the role of navigator faded slower in the East, and in many ways, not at all, compared to the West. The incredible view out of the Il-76’s nose. , sulivanmark/wikicommons The reason for this is multi-fold. Russia and its satellite states spanned a massive amount of territory, much of which was incredibly austere. Navigational infrastructure paled in comparison to what was found in the West. Advances in avionics also came slower to the Soviet Union, especially towards the back half of the Cold War. Hence, a navigator with a great view remained an indisposable tool for many air transportation applications. For the Il-76, which has a precision airdrop and even a secondary bombing role , putting a premium on the navigator’s situational awareness has remained an especially high priority. Regardless, for decades of the Cold War, Soviet aircraft types, both civilian and military, flowed off production lines with glazed noses. Tu-134 airliner., Aleksandr Markin/wikicommons Now, two decades into the new Millenium, and 30 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Il-76 in its latest and highly upgraded configuration, still features the glazed nose section.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scaled Composites’ exotic little ARES jet, which started out life as an experimental close air support platform three decades ago and has been used as a highly adaptable test platform ever since, is now flying alongside its namesake successors, the mysterious Model 401 ‘Son of Ares’ jets. You can read all about the Model 401s and their progenitor, and how they are linked together, in these past War Zone exclusives . In addition, ARES has appeared wearing a reflective metallic-like surface coating during its most recent test flights over the Mojave Desert. This fits with prior tests of the Model 401s, which has seen them adorned with other reflective coatings . One of the jets was even covered nearly entirely in a mirror treatment . Uncredited The images in this article were taken last week near the Mojave Air and Space Port, where Scaled Composites is based. The ARES jet is seen with a number of other smaller modifications beyond its metallic coating, including a number of antennas on its lower fuselage, one vertical antenna atop its nose, and what appears to be a Radio Direction Finder (RDF) “football” style antenna on its spine—at least it looks similar to those antennas of yesteryear. That antenna does appear to have a strange ‘barcode’ like scheme. It is unclear exactly why it would be treated that way or what its actual function is. Uncredited Scaled Composites’ high-flying Proteus testbed platform has also been quite active as of late. This aircraft was directly involved with similar flight tests of the Model 401s earlier in the year and it has been carrying a large pod that appears to have some sort of electro-optical system installed. You can read about these past test flights here. Above all else, the appearance of ARES with a metallic test coating is more evidence that these aircraft, which now includes the entire ‘Ares’ family, as well as Proteus, are involved with some ongoing coatings testing related to aircraft signatures against a sensor system or systems. We have also seen F-15s carrying infrared spectrum data-collection test pods involved with this work. We recently profiled these pods in this article . ADSBExchange.com ADSBExchange.com Whether this has to do with ongoing work on infrared search and track systems and the reflectivity of various aerial targets under different conditions, or something else, such as more general signature testing or something to do with trialing a more advanced sensor system, remains unclear. Some sort of low-power laser testing is also possible. But it is notable just how much of Scaled Composites’ flying force has been dedicated to these trials over the last year. As such, it seems somewhat unlikely that this is a private endeavor. One of the Model 401s has even been flying out of Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake for months now. One of the two twin stealthy jets was recently spotted packing its own highly curious-looking pod system , as well. Model 401 ‘Son of Ares’ jet seen on approach to Mojave.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 18, 2020",DARPA’s Gremlins Drones Were “Just Inches” From Successfully Being Recovered In Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has announced that a number of X-61A Gremlins drones failed to link up in flight with a recovery system installed on a C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft in recent tests, but that they were close to success on multiple occasions. The agency and its partners are already working toward another round of capture attempts scheduled to take place next year. The aerial recovery tests, part of the third phase of the Gremlins program, had begun at the U.S. Army’s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah on Oct. 28, 2020, according to a press release from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The broad objective of the Gremlins effort, which began in 2015, has been to demonstrate the ability to launch and recovery a low-cost swarm of cruise missile-like drones in mid-air. An X-61A Gremlins drone., Dynetics A team led by defense contractor Dynetics , now a fully-owned subsidiary of Leidos, and that also includes drone-maker Kratos , developed the X-61A unmanned aircraft and the recovery system, which employs a concept similar in broad strokes to a probe-and-drogue aerial refueling system. You can see how the system is supposed to work in the video below, which includes a clip of an earlier flight test where the drone was connected to the recovery system the entire time. DARPA says that three Gremlins drones made a total of nine attempts to link up with the recovery system during the recent flight tests. Since they are not designed to land on their own, after they ran out of fuel, each one of the unmanned aircraft deployed a parachute and safely descended to the ground, where personnel could retrieve them for refurbishment and reuse. A failure of that parachute recovery system led to the loss of a Gremlins drone during the type’s first flight last year . “Each X-61A Gremlins Air Vehicle (GAV) flew for more than two hours, successfully validating all autonomous formation flying positions and safety features,” the DARPA press release said. “Hours of data were collected over three flights, including aerodynamic interactions between the docking bullet and GAV.” “All of our systems looked good during the ground tests, but the flight test is where you truly find how things work,” Scott Wierzbanowski, the Gremlins Program Manager in DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said in a statement. “We came within inches of connection on each attempt but, ultimately, it just wasn’t close enough to engage the recovery system.” DARPA’s press release said that “relative movement was more dynamic than expected” between the docking bullet and the drones and that this was at the core of the failed recovery attempts. This was something we at The War Zone highlighted as a potential area of difficulty for the Gremlins concept in the past, given what was already known about how difficult it can be for manned aircraft to use the probe-and-drogue refueling method . At the same time, even then, there had been significant work done on stabilizing refueling drogues trailing behind tankers. There had been multiple demonstrations of unmanned aircraft linking up with manned tankers and drone-to-drone refueling using this method. “We made great strides in learning and responding to technological challenges between each of the three test flight deployments to date,” said Wierzbanowski, the Gremlins Program Manager, said. “We were so close this time that I am confident that multiple airborne recoveries will be made in the next deployment. However, as with all flight testing, there are always real world uncertainties and challenges that have to be overcome.” Another round of flight tests is already scheduled to take place at Dugway in the Spring of 2021. DARPA’s standing goal is to be able to eventually demonstrate the ability to recover four X-61As in mid-air in the space of 30 minutes. A successful demonstration of the Gremlins concept could pave the way for exciting new operational capabilities for the U.S. military. Swarms of low-cost drones operating autonomously, or semi-autonomously, networked together could perform a wide array of missions. Individual drones in the swarm could carry various payloads, including various kinds of sensor packages, electronic warfare systems , or even small warheads , giving the entire group added flexibility. Swarms, by their very nature, present significant challenges to defenders, who can easily find themselves overwhelmed and unable to prioritize their response when presented with a large number of threats approaching simultaneously from multiple vectors. A picture showing a Gremlins drone during a previous flight test in which it was attached to the recovery system the entire time., Leidos The ability for aircraft to launch and recover any drones that are not destroyed or otherwise expended in some way during the mission for reuse would help further keep the costs of deploying these swarms low. It could also shorten the time necessary to mount another swarming attack if the unmanned aircraft can be readily serviced and made ready to fly again in the field. You can read much more about the potential benefits of the Gremlins concept in these previous War Zone pieces . DARPA and Dynetics are not the only ones exploring this general concept, either. In September, General Atomics unveiled its air-launched and air-recoverable Sparrowhawk drone, which it said it developed in part from a design it had submitted for the Gremlins program. It’s not clear yet exactly how these unmanned aircraft, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , will be recovered in flight. General Atomics’ Sparrowhawk under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper drone., General Atomics All told, despite the failure of the Gremlins drones to link up with the recovery system in the recent flight tests, it remains a very exciting program. It will be very interesting to see how everything performs in the next round of testing based on the lessons learned so far.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2021","No, Russia Really Doesn’t Need A New Single-Engine Fighter","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is working on the development of a new light-to-medium-weight fighter jet, reports suggest. In a significant change from recent-generation fighters from that country, the new design is apparently a single-engine configuration, rather than a twin-engine one . However, the Russians have explored a number of somewhat similar concepts in the past that did not ultimately enter large-scale production and it’s not clear how many prospective customers there might be for such a jet now. According to Russia’s TASS state-run news agency, Rostec, the Russian state-owned arms conglomerate, is “working on a concept” for the advanced fighter, which is said to be planned in both manned and unmanned versions. The prospective aircraft is described as being in the “light and medium class,” which is fairly vague, but could be indicative of a fighter that’s smaller than the Russian Aerospace Forces’ current Flanker family, and probably smaller even than the MiG-29/35 Fulcrum . The MiG-35 is currently the closest to a “light and medium-class” fighter offered by the Russian industry., United Aircraft Corporation The news agency cites Rostec’s CEO Sergei Chemezov, who also provided the following statement: “Work is underway to develop a combat aviation system of the future in its light and medium classes. Under the design, this may be a universal platform in the manned and unmanned versions. The company is working on the concept and the operational requirements for such a platform. We are doing this on our own initiative so far, without [federal] budget funds.” The concept of a light single-engine new-generation fighter for the Russian Aerospace Forces is a relatively new one, although there have been long-standing efforts, spearheaded by Russian Aircraft Corporation (RAC) MiG, to develop a twin-engine new-generation fighter as a lighter counterpart to the Flanker family and the forthcoming Su-57 Felon . There is no clear interest in such an aircraft from the Russian Ministry of Defense, making the continued focus on a jet in this class appear misplaced. Chemezov, however, told TASS that the new aircraft may be co-developed with one or more foreign partners. “This is an interesting theme from the viewpoint of promoting such a plane for exports,” said Chemezov, but didn’t name any potential foreign customers. In the meantime, Rostec appears to be continuing design studies, at least, using its own funds, the company’s CEO noting further that “the [Russian] Defense Ministry may purchase it for its own needs as well.” Interestingly, Chemezov also indicates that should Moscow decide to buy a new fighter in this class, then “the plane will have to be upgraded to the level required by the [Russian] Defense Ministry.” This suggests that the Rostec proposal could be for a less-sophisticated, and presumably less-expensive, export-optimized fighter, potentially in the same class as the JF-17 Thunder developed by China and Pakistan. A Pakistan Air Force JF-17 Thunder over the Himalayas., Asuspine/Wikimedia Commons Back in 2017, Russia’s Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov announced plans for the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) to develop a fifth-generation light fighter in cooperation with other countries, although a single-engine configuration wasn’t specified. Part of the Rostec enterprise, UAC unites all Russia’s military and civil aviation design bureaus and manufacturers and, in turn, includes both MiG and Sukhoi. The most likely candidate for the development and manufacture of a new light fighter is MiG, which has previously worked on the Lightweight Multifunctional Tactical Aircraft project, known in Russia as the Logkiy Mnogofunktsionalnyi Frontovoi Samolyot , or LMFS. In December 2019, MiG ordered an aerodynamic study from the country’s Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, or TsAGI, which has traditionally played a leading role in the preliminary design work for Russia’s combat aircraft. At that time, however, the study called for a twin-engine layout for the LMFS. It’s unclear whether this new effort and the LMFS project are now being run in parallel, or if the single-engine design has superseded the original LMFS. Apparently dating from 2015, this is a TsAGI wind-tunnel model of a potential LMFS configuration, this time without canard foreplanes., Geektrooper2/Wikimedia Commons The LMFS dates back to the latter days of the Soviet Union and a 1986 call for the development of two complementary new fighter jets from the MiG design bureau. These were the heavyweight Multi-functional Frontline Fighter, or Mnogofunksionalni Frontovoy Istrebitel , abbreviated MFI, which led to a jet called the 1.42, which was flown in the prototype form as the 1.44, as well as the lightweight LMFS. At the time, it was planned for the MFI to replace the Flanker series, while the LMFS would supersede the MiG-29. The Mikoyan 1.44 prototype tested the configuration for the MFI, the heavyweight counterpart to the original LMFS., Artem Katranzhi/Wikimedia Commons The demise of the Soviet Union saw work on the LMFS suspended and, more critically, the renamed Russian Air Force then decided to withdraw all single-engine fighter jets from its inventory. This led to the rapid retirement of all of Russia’s MiG-23, MiG-27, and Su-17 jets. Preserved at the Monino museum, this Su-17M4 is one of the many hundreds of single-engine tactical jet fighters removed from service in the early 1990s., AVIA BavARia/Wikimedia Commons However, the idea of a lightweight fighter didn’t disappear entirely and in the late 1990s the LMFS was resurrected to compete for the Future Air Complex of Tactical Aviation — in Russian, Perspektivnyi Aviatsionnyi Kompleks Frontovoi Aviatsii, or PAK FA — requirement. The MiG design was unsuccessful here, too, losing out to the Sukhoi T-50 project, which was formally selected in 2002 and has since become designated the Su-57. A pair of Su-57 prototypes., MARINA LYSTSEVA/TASS VIA GETTY IMAGES Since then, MiG has continued low-scale, self-funded conceptual work on the LMFS, seeking foreign customers in the process, so far without success. In fact, the company is thought to have considered an alternative, single-engine version of the LMFS, although the twin-engine aircraft remained the focus of attention. As it stands, there is a strong possibility that the fighter alluded to by Chemezov is the single-engine LMFS. If that’s the case, then the new design would likely inherit the same basic configuration: a large delta wing with canard foreplanes close to the wing leading edge. This kind of layout is typically selected by designers seeking to optimize a fighter’s maneuverability. In terms of size and weight, the twin-engine LMFS is broadly similar to the MiG-35, with a length of around 51 feet, a wingspan of approximately 38 feet, and a maximum take-off weight in the region of 54,000 pounds. In a single-engine iteration, these figures may be expected to be somewhat reduced. The original LMFS was always intended to have low-observable features, including at least one internal weapons bay, and these may well be retained on a single-engine version. As for the powerplant, the LMFS was originally planned to use a pair of Klimov turbofans developed from the RD-33MK used in the MiG-35. The TASS report cites UEC-Klimov Company Executive Director Alexander Vatagin as saying the company has the “potential to restart the production of inexpensive single-engine fighter jets whose motor could be developed on the basis of the available RD-33 engine.” A derivative of the Klimov RD-33MK turbofan has been suggested as a possible powerplant for the single-engine lightweight fighter., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons The availability of an existing, advanced avionics suite from the current MiG-35 could provide the new lightweight fighter with the Zhuk-M radar, and other sensors. The opportunity exists, therefore, for off-the-shelf technologies to be integrated into a manned lightweight fighter, although creating an unmanned version would be an altogether more significant challenge. The improved Zhuk-AE active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons However, all this begs the question: who would actually buy a new Russian lightweight fighter? The MiG-35 already on offer has yet to receive any significant orders. While Egypt and, reportedly Algeria, have opted for the MiG-29M/M2 export derivative, Russia has ordered only six MiG-35s, which will likely be used to re-equip an aerobatic display team, rather than being deployed to frontline units. The fate of the MiG-35 is something that The War Zone has discussed in-depth previously . With no single-engine fighters left to replace, the Russian Aerospace Forces appear to have no requirement for an aircraft in this class. Even the twin-engine MiG-35 is struggling to find its niche in Russia since fighter units have been steadily replacing Soviet-era “lightweight” MiG-29s with “heavyweight” jets from the Flanker family. Meanwhile, the basic MiG-29 serves only with a single frontline Russian Aerospace Forces unit, based outside Russia, in Armenia . Erebuni Air Base, in Armenia, is the last bastion of the Soviet-era MiG-29 in frontline Russian Aerospace Forces service., tankasan/Wikimedia Commons Looking further ahead, the emergence of the Su-57, together with the Okhotnik combat drone , would seem to further undermine the chances of Moscow buying yet another fighter type. The Russian Aerospace Forces clearly have a desire to transform the Okhotnik into an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), raising additional questions about what interest there might be to expend additional resources on acquiring a pilot-optional light fighter. The Okhotnik combat drone, which is now reportedly being tested carrying air-to-air missile surrogates for a planned “fighter-interceptor role.”, YouTube Screencap As it stands, foreign collaboration likely represents the best chances for a new Russian lightweight fighter, although most of those countries seeking an advanced jet in the “medium-class” — among them, India, South Korea , Turkey — have already embarked on their own twin-engine designs. There are already a number of light combat jets available on the export market from various countries, including the aforementioned Sino-Pakistani JF-17. Others include types derived from trainers, like Korea’s FA-50 and India is looking to export its long in development Tejas light fighter. With regards to India, a particularly large potential customer for new fighters, it still plans to buy 114 off-the-shelf Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA), with the winning contractor expected to become a strategic partner for the country’s future Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program. However, a Russian lightweight fighter that remains, for now, a “paper project” is unlikely to threaten bids from rivals such as Boeing, Dassault, Eurofighter, Lockheed Martin, Saab, and even Sukhoi, all of which can offer proven aircraft types. Further complicating matters, the MiG-35 is also participating in the MRFA tender and RAC MiG has continued to revise this design, again aiming it squarely at the export market. A new “renewed export configuration” MiG-35 was unveiled at 2019’s MAKS International Aviation and Space Salon in Moscow. This version includes a Zhuk-AE active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and increased-area wing and tail surfaces. The “renewed export configuration” MiG-35 exhibited as a mock-up at the MAKS airshow in 2019., Alexandr Ermakov/Wikimedia Commons There may be a requirement for a single-engine lightweight fighter to replace aging MiG-21 and F-5 fleets around the world. Still, few, if any, of the relevant countries appear to be in a position to afford to buy into a collaborative venture with Rostec, especially considering the small numbers of fighters each of those nations actually requires. It is worth noting that Russia has offered low or no-interest loans to friendly nations on multiple occasions to help secure arms export deals, but typically for the sale of proven designs rather than developmental efforts. All told, for the time being, at least, it seems as if a new Russian single-engine fighter is a remote prospect.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 30, 2020",Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles Are Getting Replacement Wings Ripped Off Saudi F-15S Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagles are now in line to get replacement wings taken from Saudi Arabian F-15S aircraft . The Saudi jets are getting entirely new wings as part of the conversion process into the advanced F-15SA configuration and the old ones had been destined from the scrap heap. The Air Force says buying up these surplus wings will help it save hundreds of millions of dollars while helping to keep at least some of its heavily in demand Strike Eagle fleet flying through 2040. The Air Force revealed the deal with Saudi Arabia, negotiations around which began in 2018, earlier this week. The first eight F-15S wing sets arrived at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia in August 2020, where the service subsequently began refurbishing them for installation on its F-15Es. An F-15E Strike Eagle., USAF How much was spent to buy and prepare the wings to go onto Air Force Strike Eagles is unclear. Officials at Robins said that this process saved the service approximately $80 million compared to buying new wings from Boeing, which would have cost five times more and would have taken five years to be delivered. “My team was in a unique position to help facilitate the F-15 wings purchase initiative through arrangement for temporary storage after the wing removals at the conversion line in Saudi Arabia and to coordinate documentation approvals with the partner nation,” Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Pope, the Deputy Security Assistance Program Manager within the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s (AFLCMC) F-15SA Conversion, Fighters and Advanced Aircraft office, said in a statement. “Recognizing that the Royal Saudi Air Force F-15S to SA conversion includes removal and disposal of wings, the U.S. Air Force F-15 office determined that the potential of obtaining several sets of Royal Saudi Air Force wings in ‘A-Condition’ from F-15SA conversion might offer a massive schedule and cost savings for the aging F-15 fleet.” Personnel at Warner Robins Air Force Base work on a wing taken from an F-15S Eagle., USAF USAF “This wings buy gives the U.S. Air Force the option to install these wings at a significant time and cost savings, while U.S. Air Force legacy wings are waiting for parts or in the event they are found to be non-reparable,” Pope added. Saudi Arabia first received approval to buy a fleet of 84 new-build F-15SA Advanced Eagles , the most advanced version of the F-15 on offer at the time, in 2010 and took delivery of the first of these jets in 2017. In 2012, Boeing received an additional contract through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program to upgrade 68 existing F-15S aircraft to the F-15SA standard. The Air Force announced that it had facilitated the delivery of the last all-new F-15SA to Saudi Arabia on Dec. 10. An F-15SA used for testing as seen in 2018., Christopher McGreevy Given the size of the F-15S to SA conversion program, the Air Force says that it may now buy another 42 “A-Condition” wing sets from the Saudis. The service has projected that doing so would save it another $250 million compared to purchasing all-new wings straight from the manufacturer. “The purchase of the F-15SA wings will open up opportunities to procure other aircraft parts resulting from the F-15 Saudi Aircraft Conversion Program that will benefit the warfighter at a reduced cost,” Eric Wietstruk, the F-15 Product Support Manager in the AFLCMC’s F-15 Program Office at Robins, said in his own statement. “We continue to work with our FMS partners to support and sustain our mutual F-15 legacy and new aircraft fleets.” This is not the first time the Air Force has struck a deal with one of its FMS partners regarding F-15s, either. Just a few years ago, the Israeli Air Force acquired nine ex-Air National Guard F-15Ds that had originally been slated to be parted out. The IAF, which pioneered the use of the Eagle in the long-range strike role, found out about the jets, rushed to buy them, and subsequently put them through a major upgrade program . This highlights how there is a clear value in effectively recycling these aircraft, or portions of them. The ability to acquire significant stocks of newer components, or ones that are at least cheaper to refurbish compared to buying new, via the castoffs from the F-15S to SA conversion program might turn out to be an important factor for the Air Force’s own plans with regards to the F-15E. At present, the service has around 219 Strike Eagles, which are middle-aged at best, or firmly in the back half of their service lives. While the Air Force’s plan is now to replace its even older fleet of F-15C/D Eagle fighters with new-build F-15EX jets , it has yet to make a decision about what to with the Strike Eagles. Cost will be an important point of consideration and there has already been discussion about whether simply buying additional F-15EXs might be the most sensible move price-wise. One of the first two F-15EX jets under construction for the US Air Force., USAF The F-15EX, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces , is derived from the F-15QA Advanced Eagle for Qatar, the most advanced Eagle in production now, and would offer significantly improved capabilities over the existing F-15E. Any larger life-extension program for the Strike Eagles has the potential to be costly and time-consuming, even if the jets are not brought to a similarly advanced standard in the process. Other avenues to keep the F-15E fleet going, coupled with other upgrade programs aimed at keeping the jets combat relevant, might change this calculus, even if only in the near-to-mid term. As already noted, officials at Robins overseeing this wing replacement effort say that this will help ensure the F-15Es remain airworthy through at least 2040. At the same time, it’s not clear what else the Air Force may be looking at doing to keep its Strike Eagles going over the next two decades. A portion of the fleet, especially some of the early examples that the service first began buying in the late 1980s and that have less powerful Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E engines, could still end up being retired during that time frame. No matter what, at least some of the Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagles are now set to keep soaring for at least some amount of time thanks to new-ish wings pulled from their Saudi cousins.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 19, 2020",Here Is What Each Of The Navy’s Ship-Launched Missiles Actually Costs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Many of America’s warships set sail absolutely packed with missiles. A single Ticonderoga class guided-missile cruiser has 122 Mark 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cells, each of which can handle one of a wide array of individual missiles, or four Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs). Even America’s carriers are bristling with missile-based point defenses. While the capabilities the Navy’s array of ship-launched missiles provides are fairly well known, at least conceptually, the staggering cost of each of these weapons is not. Now, just as we did with air-launched weapons and decoy flares , we aim to change that. The War Zone has collected the latest unit costs of these weapons to give readers a sense of just how much it is spending to arm its fleet. It should be stressed that these are the prices for just the individual weapons and the figures do not factor in any future spending on support services, modifications, upgrades, or past spending on the weapons’ development. The guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) launches a Standard Missile-3 as part of a joint ballistic missile defense exercise in the Pacific Ocean on Oct. 25, 2012., USN It’s important to note that individual unit prices can vary from year to year due to a number of factors, including the economies of scale of placing larger or smaller orders. As such, the estimated price point for certain missiles may even be significantly different just between purchases made through the base budget and the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. What is presented below are the unit costs, rounded to the nearest dollar, that the Navy expects to pay for these weapons in the 2021 Fiscal Year as they appear in the official budget documents. Surface -to-Air Missiles: Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) Block IIIAZ – $1,200,000 This is the unit cost of the conversion kit to turn existing SM-2 Block IIIA missiles into to Block IIIAZ variant, which is specifically for the Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers . Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) Block IIIC – $2,349,000 This unit price is the cost of the conversion kit to transform existing SM-2 Block IIIA and Block IIIB missiles into the Block IIIC configuration with active radar homing. Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IB – $11,830,000 Funding for these missiles come through the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) budget. Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IIA – $36,387,000 The funds for these missiles also come through the MDA budget. Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) – $4,318,632 This unit price is an average for the entire projected 2021 Fiscal Year order, which includes SM-6 Block I and Block IA variants . Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) – $1,795,000 This unit cost reflects an average for the entire projected Fiscal Year 2021 purchase, which includes ESSM Block I and Block II versions . Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) – $905,330 This unit price is an average across the full projected Fiscal Year 2021 order, which includes multiple RAM variants, including the Block II and IIA. Sailors load an Evolved Sea Sparrow missile into a Mk 29 box launcher aboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). Many millions of dollars worth of missiles are held in a single eight-round launcher., USN Surface -to-Surface and Land Attack Missiles: Tactical Tomahawk (TACTOM) Block V – $1,537,645 This is the unit price for the base land-attack variant. Funding for conversion kits to transform Block V missiles in Block Va Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) anti-ship missiles or Block Vb missiles with the new Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System (JMEWS), as well to upgrade existing Block IV TACOMs to the Block V standard, is contained in separate portions of the budget. A unit cost, approximately $889,681, is provided for the MST conversion kit. Naval Strike Missile (NSM) – $2,194,000 It’s worth noting that the Navy only requested funds to purchase 15 of these missiles in the 2021 Fiscal Year budget. Harpoon – The Navy did not request any funding for new Harpoon anti-ship missiles or upgrades to existing Block IC air , sea, and submarine-launched variants in the 2021 Fiscal Year. Budget documents for the previous year do not have a unit cost breakdown for conversion kits to bring Block IC missiles up to the new Block II+ standard . Griffin – The service also has not asked for any funding to purchase additional examples of Griffin missile, which its Cyclone class patrol craft are armed with, since the 2019 Fiscal Year, at which time the unit cost for one of those missiles was approximately $127,333. Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (VL-ARSOC) – The Fiscal Year 2021 budget request did not include any funding for new VL-ASROCs, but did funds for refurbishment kits for some of these weapons, each of which cost approximately $490,909. A $1.5M RGM-109 about to make contact with its intended target. , DoD Some may be surprised, or even a bit mortified, at just how expensive some of these weapons are. The truth is that advanced naval warfare is a very costly endeavor, especially when it comes to defending one’s fleet or destroying the enemy’s fleet with guided missiles. Author’s note: The original version of this piece had an older figure for the unit cost for the SM-3 Block IIA, as it had appeared in the budget documents that purchases of these missiles stopped in the 2020 Fiscal Year. As it turns out, funding for these missiles was simply shifted to another portion of the budget. This piece has been updated with the unit cost for this weapon as of the 2021 Fiscal Year.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced that its Boeing MQ-25 Stingray unmanned aerial vehicles, which will provide aerial refueling from its aircraft carriers , will be operated by warrant officer with a new specialty designation — the Aerial Vehicle Operator. This comes as the flight-test program for the drone continues to make progress, with a first sortie recently flown with the refueling pod attached. The establishment of the new Air Vehicle Operator designator for Navy warrant officers was approved by Secretary of the Navy Kenneth J. Braithwaite on Dec. 9, 2020. The service says it plans to train around 450 warrants officers in the new AVO role over the next six to 10 years, across the W-1 through W-5 grades, and send them to the fleet. In the Navy, W-1 is the base Warrant Officer (WO) rank, while W-2 through W-5 are Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) ranks. The MQ-25 Stingray during its first flight with a Cobham refueling pod under the wing., Boeing “AVOs will start out operating the MQ-25 Stingray, the Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle, which is expected to join the fleet with an initial operating capability in 2024,” explained Captain Christopher Wood, aviation officer community manager at the Bureau of Naval Personnel in Millington, Tennessee, in a Navy press release. “Unlike traditional Navy Chief Warrant Officers, the majority of these officers will be accessed much younger and trained along the lines of current Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers in the unrestricted designators,” Wood continued. “However, Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers require assignments that progress in tactical and leadership scope to be competitive for promotion, while warrant officer AVOs will be technical specialists and spend their careers as operators.” The move to designate drone operators as warrant officers was prompted by the fact that, as they progress along their career path, and move up the ranks, they will nevertheless remain technical specialists, undertaking continuous tours. The designator “fits the Navy’s model on how warrant grades are utilized,” the service confirmed. The warrant officer designator is normally used for highly skilled, single-track specialty officers. Over the next four to five years of this new training program, at least some MQ-25-qualified AVOs will be transferred from other air vehicle types, helping to build up the required knowledge base. Wood confirmed that the “first three to four deployments [will have] a mix of existing unrestricted line and new warrants making up the ready room.” USN The path for individuals to operating a Stingray from one of the Navy’s flattops will begin with Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island, where successful candidates will graduate as Warrant Officer Ones. At that point, they start basic flight training followed by advanced training on the MQ-25. They will receive the Navy’s prized “wings of gold” and the 737X designator after they complete basic training. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2022, the new AVO career will be open to “street-to-fleet” applicants as well as enlisted Sailors, who will then go through the selection process for Officer Candidate School. While AVOs will be responsible for the day-to-day flying operations of the Stingray fleet, their squadron bosses — commanding and executive officers, as well as department heads of MQ-25 squadrons — will consist of aviators and flight officers. Navy Lieutenant Venus Savage conducts simulated MQ-25 operations at Boeing’s offices in St. Louis., USN The creation of the AVO also opens the way to a reconfiguring of other Navy drone-operating communities. The Navy has stated that, in the future, warrant officer AVOs may also operate the MQ-4C Triton drones from shore bases after an initial sea tour with the Stingray. “As the Navy’s footprint in unmanned aerial vehicles increases, so could the scope of the AVO community,” the service says. It is noteworthy that the initial MQ-25 squadron will be based alongside a detachment of Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19 (VUP-19), the Navy’s first MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drone unit, at Naval Base Ventura County in California, which includes Naval Air Station Point Mugu. Last summer, the Navy began the formal process of standing up Unmanned Carrier Launched Multi-Role Squadron 10 (VUQ-10), which will be the first MQ-25 squadron. Plans call for its official establishment date to be October 2021, and that the unit will be located at Naval Base Ventura County. You can read more about these developments here . There are also tentative Navy plans for MQ-25s to be attached to squadrons flying the E-2C/D Hawkeye airborne command and control aircraft, once integrated within the Carrier Air Wing. It’s not presently clear if, or how, the new AVO designator might affect that. On the hardware side, too, the MQ-25 is making progress. The existing Stingray demonstrator drone, also known as T1, now looks a whole lot more like the Navy’s future carrier-based tanker after it began land-based trials with an aerial refueling pod carried under its wing . T1’s 2.5-hour first flight with the aerial refueling store (ARS) installed was conducted on December 9 by Boeing test pilots that operated the drone from a ground control station at MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, where it performed its maiden flight in September 2019. The MQ-25 demonstrator had already completed around 30 hours in the air before it was outfitted with the refueling pod. The ARS, developed and produced by Cobham, is the same store that’s carried by U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets that presently fulfill the carrier-based tanker mission. “Having a test asset flying with an ARS gets us one big step closer in our evaluation of how [the] MQ-25 will fulfill its primary mission in the fleet — aerial refueling,” said Captain Chad Reed, the U.S. Navy’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation program manager. “T1 will continue to yield valuable early insights as we begin flying with F/A-18s and conduct deck-handling testing aboard a carrier.” The MQ-25’s first flight in tanker configuration is intended to test the drone’s aerodynamics with the ARS under the wing. It’s the first step towards validating the Stingray as an airborne tanker, which will involve further aerodynamics tests throughout its flight envelope, as well as extension and retraction of the hose and drogue assembly to which the receiver aircraft “plugs in” to take on fuel. Boeing employees attach a refueling pod to T1 during a ground test., Boeing “To see T1 fly with the hardware and software that makes MQ-25 an aerial refueler this early in the program is a visible reminder of the capability we’re bringing to the carrier deck,” explained Dave Bujold, Boeing’s MQ-25 program director. “We’re ensuring the ARS and the software operating it will be ready to help MQ-25 extend the range of the carrier air wing.” Owned by Boeing, T1 was first flown last year and is intended for preliminary test work. It will be followed by full engineering development prototypes that are being completed under a 2018 contract award. Earlier this year, the U.S. Navy awarded Boeing a contract modification for three additional MQ-25s, bringing the total number of aircraft on order to seven. Ultimately, however, the Navy intends to procure more than 70 Stingrays, to take on the tanking role from the F/A-18s and more. If all goes to plan, these drones will start to deploy with the fleet in 2024, flown by a new class of Aerial Vehicle Operators.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 30, 2020",Navy’s New Controversial Shipbuilding Plan Raids Air Force And Army’s Piggy Banks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In its latest 30-year shipbuilding plan, the Navy is looking to halt its purchases of future Ford class aircraft carriers and begin development of a new type of flattop, step up the acquisition of new Constellation class frigates , and acquire more unmanned surface and underwater vessels, among other things. Criticism has already been leveled at the proposal, which would see a major Navy budget increase fueled, in part, by cuts to the Army and the Air Force. On Dec. 10, 2020, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget released a Fiscal Planning Framework (FPF) to go along with the Navy’s newest 30-years shipbuilding plan, a public version of which has not been made available at the time of writing. The Wall Street Journal also published an accompanying op-ed from OMB head Russell Vought and President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, titled “The Navy Stops Taking On Water.” USN “The seminal document is the result of an unprecedented nine-month study of naval force structure by the Pentagon,” Vought and O’Brien wrote. “It provides a detailed blueprint to lawmakers and industry partners, reinforcing the American commitment to maintaining maritime supremacy.” The key elements of the 30-year shipbuilding plan as found in the FPF are seen below. OMB Far and away the most notable item is the plan to stop buying any more Ford class aircraft carriers – four are under construction or on order now – and begin crafting a new type of carrier. The FPF does not say what kind of carrier the Navy would be looking to develop, but the service has indicated an interest in acquiring new light aircraft carriers as part of its most recent force structure proposal, known as Battle Force 2045. It’s interesting to note that, in March, there were reports that the Navy was considering only buying four Ford class aircraft carriers and then pursuing a new class of light aircraft carriers. In May, the service had said it had indefinitely shelved those plans . OMB’s document says that under this current 30-year shipbuilding plan, the Navy would buy no additional aircraft carriers of any kind between the 2022 and 2026 Fiscal Years. The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , in front, sails alongside the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman ., USN The plan also includes a notable increase in purchases of Constellation class frigates . Under this proposal, the Navy would buy 15 of these ships, up from 10, between Fiscal Years 2022 and 2026. In addition, the service would hire a second shipyard to help meet this increased demand, something that had been reported to be under consideration earlier this year. Under this proposal, the Navy would buy slightly more Virginia class attack submarines and Arleigh Burke class destroyers in the Fiscal Year 2022 to 2026 time frame than previously planned, as well. It would also begin purchasing a new class of Light Amphibious Warship, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , to support the U.S. Marine Corps’ new force structure plans and concepts of operation . In addition, the plan underscores the Navy’s growing interest in unmanned platforms . The FPF shows an acceleration in the planned purchases of Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSV) starting in Fiscal Year 2024 and adding an additional LUSV to the total number to be ordered by Fiscal Year 2026. OMB’s FPF says that the plan would see continued investment in the development and acquisition of both Columbia class ballistic missile submarines and a future attack submarine, presently known as SSN(X) . The document says that the goal would be to buy the first SSN(X) by Fiscal Year 2034 and take delivery of that boat in Fiscal Year 2040. Overall, the FPF shows the Navy buying 82 new ships between Fiscal Years 2022 and 2026, almost double its planned acquisitions as laid out in its budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year. A full breakdown of planned naval ship acquisitions under this proposal, by cost and the total number of hulls, as well as comparisons to the multi-year outlays in the Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal, are seen below. OMB OMB This 30-year shipbuilding plan also includes extending the service life of five Ticonderoga class cruisers and nine Los Angeles class attack submarines previously slated for retirement in order to support operational demands in the meantime. Discussions about the retirement of any Ticonderogas have typically turned into major political battles for the Navy in the past. “The Chief of Naval Operations has emphasized that an increase in shipbuilding and the fleet size must be accompanied by investments in the ship-building industry, ship repair capabilities, and the resources needed to operate, train, and equip the fleet,” OMB’s document adds. “Therefore, the FPF proposes robust industrial base investments over the next 5 years, including:  $2.8 billion within the shipbuilding account for shipbuilding and supplier base facilities to increase capacity; and $4.3 billion for the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan to ensure the Navy’s nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines are available to meet the Nation’s needs.” This 30-year shipbuilding plan was also crafted in order to help the Navy achieve the long-standing, Congressionally-mandated goal of having a total fleet size of 355 ships and submarines by 2031. The service’s previously unveiled Battle Force 2045 proposal, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , hopes to further increase that to 500 ships or more by 2045. “By the Obama administration’s last year, after decades of cuts to shipbuilding and maintenance, the Navy had been stripped down to a fleet barely larger than it was 100 years ago,” OMB Director Vought and National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien wrote in The Wall Street Journal . “These 275 ships struggled to meet America’s national-security needs, leaving crews stressed, basic maintenance deferred, and the country at risk. The shipbuilding industrial base shrank to a fraction of the manufacturing might that won the Cold War.” “Although less capable than ours, China’s navy already stands at more than 350 vessels and is growing rapidly,” the op-ed added, underscoring the significance of concerns about the continued growth of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, as well as the rest of the Chinese military , in current U.S. defense planning. “Beijing is building islands in the South China Sea, threatening trade routes, and menacing allies. U.S. maritime dominance is necessary to meet this great challenge.” For this plan to work, the FPF says that the shipbuilding portion of the defense budget will have to increase by 85 percent between Fiscal Years 2022 and 2026, even as the total amount of defense spending is not expected to increase beyond around 15 percent in that same period. OMB OMB says that planned drawdowns in U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq , and elsewhere around the world will free up approximately $35 billion in the next six years. Another $7.7 billion would come from various reforms, “including the reduction of management and overhead costs,” according to the FPF. The Pentagon expects to find $6.6 billion in additional funds that it could redirect toward shipbuilding or other higher priorities through the retirement of various obsolete systems, including aging U.S. Air Force aircraft . Most notably, though, the U.S. Army would see a significant cut to its overall end strength to help fund this new plan. The authorized end strength of the Army’s active-duty component would drop from around 492,000 to 485,000, while the Army Reserve would be capped at 189,500, ending previous plans to increase its size to 200,000. The approved size of the Army National Guard would shrink down to 336,000 from a past force structure cap of around 343,000. It is worth noting that the Army has had trouble meeting its recruiting goals to actually reach these force structure targets in recent years. “Military compensation costs, which include pay and a wide range of healthcare, retirement, and other benefits, constitute roughly one-third of DOD’s total budget. These costs per person have grown at a much higher rate than the overall DOD budget,” OMB’s FPF argues. “Constraining end strength is one means of protecting the rest of the DOD’s budget to ensure America’s servicemembers have the modernized equipment and weapon systems to defend the Nation and prevail on the battlefield.” However, this shipbuilding plan, some details of which had already leaked out to the press this week, has already drawn criticism, especially over the cuts to other services to pay for it. “These reductions [to the Army and Air Force] are completely unsustainable for any service, and will result in a hollow force if they remain,” one U.S. defense official told Defense One for a story published yesterday. Navy leadership has reportedly objected to many of the components of the proposal, as well, especially the plan to not purchase a fifth Ford class aircraft carrier. The concern here is that the service could be left with just nine carriers by 2040, depending on how the work on a follow-on class of flattop goes. This would be toward the lower end of how many carriers the service determined it needed in a force structure study it concluded earlier this year and would be well short of the long-standing Congressional mandate to have at least 12 carriers in service. It very much remains to be seen how much, if any, of this 30-years shipbuilding plan, as well as the Battle Force 2045 proposal , might actually get implemented in the coming years. There has been talk about potential defense spending cuts after President-Elect Joe Biden takes office in January, though its unclear how steep they may turn out to be. Biden himself downplayed the idea of curtailed defense budgets while on the campaign trail . The decision to release details about shipbuilding priorities now is already highly irregular , as this usually goes to Congress along with the annual defense budget proposal in the Spring. There have been suggestions that this is, at least in part , a political move on the part of the Trump Administration to try to exert its influence on the process ahead of the hand off the incoming Biden Administration. Vought and O’Brien’s The Wall Street Journal op-ed includes considerable plaudits for Trump personally in regards to the shipbuilding proposal, though it’s unclear how much involvement the President had in its development. Even in its final weeks, the Trump Administration is at odds with Congress over defense priorities and spending, broadly, with the President threatening to veto a current version of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for Fiscal Year 2021. Trump and his Administration have objected to multiple provisions in the legislation, especially a requirement for the Army to develop a plan to rename bases currently named after generals who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. With objections to the shipbuilding plan already coming from inside the U.S. military, it seems very likely that the proposal will see at least some changes after the Biden Administration takes over next year.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 12, 2020",Russia Is Using Augmented Reality To Produce Its Su-57 Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has recently emerged showing workers on the production line for Russia’s Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter using augmented reality to assist with the assembly of the aircraft. While it is unclear whether the technology is already in use, or whether it’s still in development, it shows a hitherto unseen level of sophistication in the manufacturing process for the Felon. The two videos are dated March 24, 2020, but were posted to YouTube today and brought to our attention by The Dead District blog . They reveal how the Su-57 fighter jet assembly line at the United Aircraft Corporation’s Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aviation Plant, or KnAAZ, in Russia’s Far East region looks when viewed through an augmented reality (AR) compliant headset. AR technology provides an interactive experience of a real-world environment, with computer-generated perceptual information overlaid, providing the user with a combination of virtual and real objects. The ill-fated first pre-production Su-57 crashed on December 24, 2019., Marina Lystseva/TASS via Getty Images In this scenario, the AR appears to work using QR codes attached to various major Su-57 assemblies that are then scanned by the technician. This in turn calls up the appropriate AR algorithm that overlays digitally generated imagery of the various subassemblies and components, showing the worker where the different parts go. Employing QR codes in this way is not new — indeed, they were first used to facilitate the production process in the automotive industry in Japan , back in the mid-1990s. In the video seen directly below, for instance, we see an AR version of the Su-57’s main undercarriage overlaid on the appropriate real-world section of the center fuselage “barrel”. Also included are virtual cables and connectors, and the various internal rivets and attachment points, indicating where each item needs to be installed. An AR-created touchscreen menu allows the user to select different options, presumably to guide them through different stages of the complex production process, well as safety advice and other pertinent information. A similar, albeit non-AR approach is used in the production of the U.S.-made F-35 Lightning II , in which an array of projectors shows technicians where to place screws and other fittings, in a process that you can watch here . Ultimately, both Russian and U.S. methods help ensure that the stealthy jets being built are finished to the highest possible standards. While it might not be such a big deal for a more conventional plane, mis-tapping a hole for a screw, or installing a screw or other fitting in the wrong hole, or slightly off-center, threatens to leave the surface of the aircraft not perfectly flush, in the process diminishing its low-observable characteristics. The War Zone has talked previously about these vital aspects of quality control, and the related assembly-line infrastructure, in this article . The second pre-production Su-57 takes shape on the production line at the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aviation Plant., Russian Ministry of Defense In one part of the video, we also see the user interface, in the form of a visor-style headset, rather than the truly lightweight eyewear that is also now available in the AR realm. However, since production-line workers are often used to wearing some kind of goggles or safety glasses, then adding another layer of eyewear of this kind should not be a major inconvenience. The result should also bring the production line closer to a paperless working environment, with a reduced requirement for traditional instruction manuals and blueprints. While the video shows the visual aspect of this AR system, there is no reason why it couldn’t also provide the user synchronized auditory inputs, too. The visor-style headset used to present augmented reality imagery., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP It’s also worth noting that the way the videos have been made has resulted in some loss of accuracy in the way the virtual imagery is superimposed over the real-world environment. According to this explanation , this is due to the mismatch in calibration between the video camera relative to the projection display of the glasses. This is apparent, for example, in the sequence showing virtual rivets misaligned compared to their real-world locations. The same source contends that the videos likely show part of the “debugging of the assembly line” for the Su-57, noting that it was reported earlier this year that the line had been optimized to improve efficiency, “including the transfer of the alignment and delivery area from another workshop to the assembly workshop.” This suggests that the AR technologies seen here were perhaps used during this reconfiguration of the production line and are not necessarily a routine part of the assembly process. A still from the video showing the purported mismatch in calibration, leaving the virtual rivets wrongly aligned., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Nevertheless, the videos show the potential for using AR as a fundamental part of the assembly process. This would potentially result in more efficiency and greater productivity, helping to highlight any potential material defects, and streamline handling, for example. It would also be a valuable tool for teaching new employees. Returning to the F-35 program, it’s a telling fact that a lot of the early production work had to be done by hand , in the absence of robotic systems that provided the required level of precision. Lockheed Martin and its partners have since developed all-new robotic manufacturing systems to help speed up F-35 production , and the Russian AR technology may have similar goals as the United Aircraft Corporation works towards an increased production tempo for the Felon. Production of the Su-57 at the KnAAZ plant dates back a long time, with Sukhoi receiving a contract from the Russian Ministry of Defense for construction and tests of the original T-50 prototypes back in 2003. T-50-5 was the last of the first batch of Su-57 prototypes, prior to the redesign. After a fire in June 2014, it was rebuilt as the T-50-5R and returned to the air in October 2015., RUSSIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT After the first five prototypes, the airframe design was reworked to increase its strength, and another batch of five was then completed to a modified design, the first of these, T-50-6-2, flying for the first time in 2016. The first pre-production Su-57 was not completed until December 2019 and, but crashed later that month, on delivery to the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, an event you can read about in this previous article. The second pre-production aircraft was completed in October 2020 and will become the first example handed over to the Russian military. As it stands, only 76 Su-57s are under contract for the VKS, under an order announced by President Vladimir Putin in May 2019. These aircraft are in addition to the pre-production airframes and are expected to be handed over from 2021. After an earlier proposal to co-produce the Su-57 with India fell through, there have been some efforts to pitch the fighter to other potential export customers, including Turkey . Other nations that have been suggested as possible future Felon operators include Algeria, Egypt , and Vietnam, all traditional purchasers of Russian defense equipment, although, to date, there have been no further orders. Beyond that, work is underway on an improved Felon, likely to be designated Su-57M, which will feature the definitive Izdeliye 30 engines that will offer more power and increased reliability. Orders beyond the initial 76 jets for the VKS are likely to encompass this version, which could enter series production around 2024. Despite currently just a fairly token quantity of Su-57s under contract, there seems to be no reason why the same AR technology couldn’t be adapted to aid Russia’s manufacturing process of other aircraft, whether military or civilian.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 23, 2020",One Of The Navy’s First Female Submarine Officers May Be Headed To The Moon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kayla Barron, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander who was among the first female officers to serve onboard one of that service’s submarines, is among a group of NASA astronauts who could be headed to the Moon as early as 2024. Of the other 17 astronauts who now make up what NASA is calling the Artemis Team , around half are or have served in the military. NASA announced the names of the astronauts selected for the Artemis Team on Dec. 9, 2020, on the occasion of the eighth National Space Council meeting, which took place at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA had first unveiled the overarching Artemis program , which is its new lunar exploration effort, in September. Kayla Barron wearing a spacesuit., NASA The goal is to send American astronauts to the Moon on the Artemis III mission in 2024, which will be the first time anyone has set foot on the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in 1972. Artemis I will be an uncrewed flight test of the Orion space capsule launched using the Space Launch System rocket, scheduled for 2021, while Artemis II will be a crewed flight test without a lunar landing, set to take place in 2022. “I give you the heroes who will carry us to the Moon and beyond – the Artemis Generation,” Vice President Mike Pence said in announcing the individuals who make the Artemis Team. “It is amazing to think that the next man and first woman on the Moon are among the names that we just read. The Artemis Team astronauts are the future of American space exploration – and that future is bright.” One of the names Pence read was that of Kayla Barron, who graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2010, was commissioned in the service and immediately attended graduate school at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England as a Gates Cambridge Scholar. There she earned a master’s degree in nuclear engineering, with her research focusing “on modeling the fuel cycle for a next-generation, thorium-fueled nuclear reactor concept,” according to NASA . She subsequently joined the first cadre of U.S. Navy female officers to serve aboard the Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet. In 2009, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and then-Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead had first begun working to eliminate the long-standing prohibition on women serving on submarines. Barron is also a graduate of Nuclear Power School, also known as Nuke School. In 2011, Barron reported to the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Maine . She subsequently qualified as a Submarine Warfare Officer and served onboard Maine for three deterrent patrols. In 2017, she was selected for astronaut training, at which time she had moved on to become the Flag Aide to the Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy. Her astronaut training included flights in NASA’s T-38 supersonic jet trainers and mock spacewalks in deep pools. There were also lessons in Russian to help converse with Russian cosmonauts during any potential trips to the International Space Station . She described herself as a “struggling conversationalist” in the language in an interview with The Spokesman-Review newspaper in Washington State published earlier this year. Kayla Barron dons a spacesuit ahead of a mock spacewalk in a pool in 2017., NASA No woman has ever set foot on the Moon, which puts Barron, as well as the other eight women in the Artemis Team, in a position to make a different kind of history. As for submariners in space, it makes a lot of sense and Barron won’t be the first. Often times we hear that spaceflight is more like operating on a submarine than flying in a cockpit. Of course, nuclear know-how will likely be a critical element of future excursions to the moon, as well. Eight other members of the Artemis Team also have their own ties to the U.S. armed services. This includes absolute rock star Jonny Kim, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who also graduated from the University of San Diego with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in just three years and then went on to get an M.D. at Harvard Medical School. You can read more about Kim’s amazing story in this past War Zone piece . Not surprisingly, military pilots are heavily represented among the rest of the Artemis Team. There’s U.S. Air Force Colonel Raja Chari , a graduate of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, whose stick time, including some in combat, is in the F-15E Strike Eagle , F-16 Viper , and F/A-18 Hornet , as well as the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter . He also served as the head of the Air Force’s 461st Flight Test Squadron and the Director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force . Navy Lieutenant Commander Matthew Dominick, another graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School, flew F/A-18E Super Hornets with multiple Navy squadrons, including in combat, before moving over to his service’s test and evaluation community. As part of Air Test Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23), he flew F/A-18 Hornets, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , and EA-18G Growlers , among many other types, and contributed to the testing of a wider array of aircraft and systems. Victor Glover, a Navy Commander, has a similar flying resume, with time in combat-coded squadrons equipped with the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as an assignment with VX-21, where he flew those aircraft, as well as EA-18G Growlers. He subsequently moved on to the Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs and was a Legislative Fellow working at the U.S. Senate when he was picked for astronaut training. U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Nicole Mann flew F/A-18 Hornets with Navy and Marine combat-coded squadrons and spent time assigned to VX-23. She was the Joint Mission Planning System-Expeditionary (JMPS-E) Integrated Product Team (IPT) Lead within the Naval Air Systems Command’s (NAVAIR) Strike Planning and Execution Systems officer, or PMA-281, when NASA selected her for astronaut training. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Anne McClain, who has already spent than 204 days in space on the International Space Station , first flew the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior in combat for that service. She is also a rated pilot in the UH-60 Black Hawk and UH-72 Lakota helicopters, as well as the C-12 Huron fixed-wing aircraft. Marine Corps Major Jasmin Moghbeli flew AH-1W Super Cobras for that service, including Afghanistan, as well as spent time assigned to VX-31, VMX-1, and VMX-31, where she flew UH-1Y Venom and AH-1Z Viper helicopters in test and evaluation roles. In 2017, when NASA picked her for astronaut training, she was a quality assurance and avionics officer testing UH-1Ys and AH-1Zs with VMX-1. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Rubio flew UH-60 Black Hawks, including during combat deployments to Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. He also has an M.D. from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, and was serving as the battalion surgeon for 3rd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) when NASA picked him to start astronaut training in 2017. Navy Captain Scott Tingle, the last of the military personnel in the Artemis Team, flew F/A-18 Hornets and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets will with combat-coded squadrons, as well VX-9 and VX-23. He was the Assistant Program Manager/Systems Engineer for the Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) and Harpoon weapon systems within NAVAIR’s Precision Strike Weapons Program Office, or PMA-201, when he was picked for astronaut training. It’s also worth noting that another member of the Artemis Team, Kjell Lindgren, attended the U.S. Air Force Academy with the intention of becoming a pilot. Unfortunately, a medical condition prevented this from happening and he never took up a commission in that service. He subsequently went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in biology from the Air Force Academy, as well as a master’s degree in cardiovascular physiology and an M.D., both from Colorado State University. He has already logged 141 days in space across two expeditions to the International Space Station. You can read much more about all of the members of the Artemis Team, who all have impressive resumes, here . NASA still has yet to announce the designated crews, as well as alternate astronauts, which will also include international partners, for either the Artemis II or III missions, or any subsequent trips to the Moon or beyond. With Kayla Barron and the other U.S. military officers making up 50 percent of Team Artemis, if nothing else, it seems very likely that the armed services will be well-represented in these future space missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Two Navy Carriers Are About To Head Out On Grueling “Double Pump” Deployments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt has left port ahead of its second operational deployment this year. The crew of its sister ship USS Dwight D. Eisenhower is also now preparing to head out again for the second time in the space of 12 months. These so-called “double pump” deployments come amid a surge in demand for aircraft carriers to support U.S. military operations around the world, but at a time when a significant number of America’s flattops are tied up undergoing maintenance and major overhauls. Ship spotters caught Theodore Roosevelt , as well as some of her escorts, leaving San Diego on Dec. 7, 2020. The carrier only returned to its homeport from its last deployment in July. While this may seem like a relatively long span between deployments, it is short enough that the ship’s crew remains largely certified to operate from its last cruise and will be able to skip a slate of exercises typically required before a carrier can head out again. Personnel entered a two-week quarantine period in November, a step to prevent potential outbreaks of COVID-19 on the ship, as happened aboard Theodore Roosevelt earlier this year, and are now set to conduct a sustainment exercise before beginning their next operational cruise, according to USNI News . “The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group [TRCSG] is currently underway conducting operations in U.S. Third Fleet [area of responsibility],” Navy Commander Sean Robertson said in a statement to USNI News . “The strike group is a combat-ready national asset capable of both deterrence and offensive strike that provides our national command authority with flexible options, all domain access, and a visible forward presence.” “TRCSG has maintained its readiness since it returned from deployment in July,” he added. “It continues to train and perform together as a unit in order to be ready for any, and all, challenges.” A view from the deck of USS Theodore Roosevelt in October 2020., USN Theodore Roosevelt ‘s first deployment this year, which began in January, was hardly uneventful. As already noted, the ship was stricken by a major outbreak of COVID-19 among its crew, which killed one sailor and sickened hundreds more, forcing it to spend approximately two months in port in Guam. The situation eventually morphed into a major scandal, starting with the controversial decision to fire the ship’s then-commanding officer, Captain Brett Crozier, who’s warnings about the risks the outbreak posed to his crew had leaked to the press , and ultimately leading to the resignation of Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly. The crew of Eisenhower , which is homeported in Norfolk, Virginia, on the other side of the country and is presently sailing in the Atlantic, is also preparing for another deployment in the space of 12 months. That carrier left for its last cruise in January and returned home in August after primarily operating in the Middle East. The COVID-19 pandemic meant that the crew had spent seven months at sea without a port visit. Activity on the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower , which is presently sailing in the Atlantic ahead of an operational deployment., USN The Navy has, so far, declined to say where either carrier, and their associated strikes groups, might be headed for their next deployments. However, it seems very likely that Theodore Roosevelt will return to the Pacific region, where the Navy, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, has been stepping up exercises and other activities as a challenge to expanding Chinese movements. There has been a noticeably public uptick in the U.S. military presence around Taiwan , as well as on the island , in recent months as friction has grown between the government in Beijing and authorities in Taipei. There has also been an increase in American military activities in and around the disputed South China Sea . In July, the Navy notably sent two aircraft carrier strike groups together into that body of water for the first time in six years. The first-in-class USS Nimitz and the USS Ronald Reagan , along with various escorts and elements of their air wings, sail together in the South China Sea in July 2020., USN The first-in-class USS Nimitz had relieved Eisenhower in the Middle East in August and their two may be about to swap places again in the near future. As of Dec. 6, that carrier was operating in the North Arabian Sea. The flattop and other elements of its carrier strike group had sailed to the Indian Ocean in November for the latest iteration of the Malabar naval exercise with India, Australia, and Japan, but had returned to the Middle East on Nov. 25, ostensibly to be in a position to better support planned drawdowns of U.S. forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan , redeployments that are still in progress. That movement also came just days before the assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh . Since returning to the region, Nimitz has remained outside of the Persian Gulf, as U.S. carriers typically do due to the increased threats that they face from Iran in the tight confines of that body of water. Warships can only sail in and out of the area via the narrow Strait of Hormuz , which carries its own risks . Iranian forces have also outright attacked American unmanned aircraft flying over the Gulf of Oman, which lies on the other side of the Strait, on more than one occasion in 2019, succeeding in shooting down a Navy RQ-4A , as well. “We have achieved an uneasy deterrence [with Iran]. That uneasy deterrence is exacerbated by world events and by events along the way,” Navy Vice Admiral Sam Paparo, head of U.S. 5th Fleet, which is based in Bahrain and oversees Navy activities in the Middle East, said during a talk on Dec. 6. “But I have found Iranian activity at sea to be cautious and circumspect and respectful, to not risk unnecessary miscalculation or escalation at sea.” “We are happy that the other party has got the message and made its behavior more respectful,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh told reporters in response to Paparo’s remarks the next day. Wherever the two carriers may be headed, their deployments so soon after their last cruises underscores the demand for American aircraft carriers and the current limited availability of Navy flattops. The USS Carl Vinson is in the process of working up for its own 2021 cruise, which is set to be the first where the embarked air wing will be equipped with F-35C Joint Strike Fighters and CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors . Of the Navy’s remaining six Nimitz class aircraft carriers, four – USS Abraham Lincoln , USS George H.W. Bush , USS Harry S. Truman , and USS Ronald Reagan – are undergoing scheduled maintenance. It’s also worth noting that Reagan is forward-deployed in Japan and has its own distinct schedule of deployments and maintenance. The work on Truman follows that carrier’s own double-pump deployment period. In 2019, the Pentagon had briefly considered retiring that ship early , as well. The USS George Washington is in the middle of a four-year-long Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), which involves changing out the nuclear fuel in the ship’s reactors, as well as performing other substantial maintenance and upgrade work. The USS John C. Stennis is in preparing for the start of its RCOH next year. The Navy’s last carrier, the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , remains effectively unsuitable for operational deployments as work continues to make key systems on that ship fully functional . It has been largely relegated to training duties in the meantime. Even as the number of available carriers has dropped, the total amount of time the remaining flattops have been spending at sea has increased. USNI News calculated that the service’s carriers had spent 855 days at sea, collectively, between January and October of this year. This was already 258 days more than the collective at-sea time for the service’s carrier fleets in all of 2019, representing a 40 percent year-on-year increase. All of this, together with the COVID-19 pandemic, has put immense strain on the four currently available Nimitz class carriers. As a result, double-pump deployments, which Defense News ‘ David Larter described back in September as “a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency maneuver that puts enormous strain on the crew and the equipment,” have become increasingly the norm. This also notably comes two years after then-Secretary of Defense Mattis announced plans to shake up carrier deployments to both make them less predictable, and therefore more difficult for potential adversaries to plan around, and shorter overall. “They’ll be home at the end of a 90-day deployment. They will not have spent eight months at sea, and we are going to have a force more ready to surge and deal with the high-end warfare as a result, without breaking the families, the maintenance cycles – we’ll actually enhance the training time,” he declared to members of Congress in 2018. This, of course, has not come to pass. The Navy’s fleets, overall, have already been under increasing operational strain in the past two decades , due to a number of factors, including significant maintenance backlogs , which have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The threat of outbreaks has also forced ships and their crews to stay at sea longer, with very visible impacts in the form of often rusty vessels returning home after protracted deployments . Multiple news reports have made clear that morale is suffering , too. We at The War Zone have already explored in depth in the past how, even before COVID-19 further complicated the situation, the Navy’s fleets, along with their crews, were being progressively worn down and that it was being faced with ever-diminishing returns that would have cascading impacts across the service. The additional strains from double-pump deployments only add to the figurative and literal bills that the Navy will have to pay down the road in order to get out of this increasingly worrisome cycle. The USS George H.W. Bush in dry dock in 2019., USN As it stands now, the Navy is also trying to balance its current operational needs with a desire to significantly grow the overall size of its fleets, to a total of 500 ships or more, in the next 25 years. This includes calls for light aircraft carriers, an idea the service has explored , but passed on in the past . There has also been talk of repurposing amphibious assault ships for a similar role, to help provide additional carrier capacity, something the Navy, together with the U.S. Marine Corps , is already experimenting with . Formal approval of this force structure plan, presently known as Battle Force 2045, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , had already been pushed back and now appears to be on hold until President-Elect Joe Biden and his new administration takes office next year. How the Biden Administration may seek to tackle the existing strains on the Navy’s fleets, including on its carriers, remains to be seen. In the meantime, with the demand for these ships showing no signs of slowing down, the flattops the service does have available look set to continue pulling multiple deployments in relatively short time spans.

James Deboer,"Updated on Jan 6, 2022",Marine Corps F-35Cs Make First Arrested Landings At An Expeditionary Airfield,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While much has been written about the expeditionary capabilities of the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing , or STOVL, version of the Joint Strike Fighter, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314, or VMFA-314, is adding short field and austere operations capabilities to its brand-new F-35C carrier-capable variants. Our correspondent James Deboer ventured out to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms to see the historic demonstration—which could have major impacts on USMC strategy and procurement—for himself. Here is this full report. The squadron, known as the “Black Knights,” is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , California, and is the first in the USMC to receive the F-35C. F-35C from VMFA-314 about to make history by catching a mobile arresting gear on an expeditionary runway at 29 Palms. , James Deboer The “Black Knights” are used to making history. This was the first USMC squadron to receive the F-4B Phantom II back in 1961, and in 1982 it was the first operational squadron anywhere in the U.S. military to fly the F/A-18A/B “legacy” Hornet . While the IOC milestone enables VMFA-314 to deploy its F-35Cs onto aircraft carriers, where they will be able to support combat operations as part of Carrier Air Wing 9, the unit hasn’t stopped there. The ability to operate as part of a Carrier Air Wing is a very important one and continues the long tradition of Marine squadrons operating from U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. VMFA-314’s sister squadron in MAG-11, VMFA-323, is currently deployed with Carrier Air Wing 17, making history with the last F/A-18C carrier deployment. Meanwhile, the “Black Knights” have been working toward operating the new aircraft in an expeditionary manner. A pair of VMFA-314 F-35C jets cruising over the Californian desert., James Deboer James Deboer James Deboer James Deboer For the last several months the squadron has trained for Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO).  The 2019 USMC Aviation Plan describes the EABO concept as follows: “EABO is a future naval operational concept that mitigates peer competitors’ anti-access/area-denial capability by creating a more survivable, resilient, and persistent forward-postured force. The EABO concept is designed to re-establish the force credibility required to have a deterrent effect. Using key maritime terrain in the vicinity of close and confined seas, EABO provides decision-makers with sea denial options that are coercive, but not escalatory. Nested within other naval and joint concepts such as Joint Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC) and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE), EABO sustains and advances the inside force’s ability to leverage the lethality of the outside force. The EABO concept is comprised of low-signature, mobile, relatively low-cost capabilities operating in expeditionary and temporary locations. These capabilities provide the joint force commander with the ability to target and strike the adversary while also making up the backbone of an active maritime defense-in-depth. EABO provides the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC) with sea denial options by using advanced bases to position and operate joint aircraft. All six functions of Marine aviation can be executed through the use of mobile and expeditionary EABs. By using all available basing options, Marine aviation can expand the reach and lethality of the joint force commander.” To better prepare for real-world EABO scenarios, a great deal of planning culminating in a unique training event at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palms in the Californian desert last week. Two of the squadron’s jets landed for the first time using the M-31 expeditionary arresting gear, which acts much like the arresting cable on an aircraft carrier. It enables Marine F-35Cs and F/A-18s to land on much smaller runways, which is especially important as the Marines continue to “pivot” to the Pacific theater. After nearly two decades of fighting insurgents in the Middle East, the Marine Corps is refocusing itself on fighting higher-end peer-state conflicts. This could demand the ability to hop from island to island in the western Pacific, where Marine Corps airpower and other forces would be able to disrupt the Chinese military’s ability to defend their own territorial claims and to defeat U.S. forces by destroying well-established infrastructure that traditionally supports them in the region. A VMFA-314 F-35C trails the cable from its tailhook after recovering using the M-31 expeditionary arresting gear. , James Deboer VMFA-314 is part of Marine Air Group 11, or MAG-11, which comprises all of the non-F-35B fixed-wing aircraft that the Marines operate on the west coast. Alongside several F/A-18 squadrons, the group operates a KC-130J squadron which is vital to the EABO concept. The KC-130Js of VMGR-352 “Raiders” give the other squadrons the ability to refuel and rearm on the ground, as well as providing the aerial refueling to give aircraft the extended range needed to operate over the vast Pacific Ocean. An F-35C maneuvers into position before plugging into a KC-130J tanker of VMGR-352 “Raiders.”, James Deboer MAG-11 also includes the often-overlooked squadron known as MWSS-373. Marine Wing Support Squadrons like 373 are essential for expeditionary advanced base operations , as they provide all the ground equipment and personnel needed to make it all happen. MAG-11, and all the other Marine aircraft on the west coast, fall under the 3rd Marine Air Wing (3rd MAW), which is commanded by Major General Christopher J. Mahoney. Mahoney has over 5,000 hours of flight time in the A-6 , F-5 , F/A-18, and the F-35 and knows a thing or two about operating in the Pacific theater. He has deployed there several times and recently served as the Deputy Commander of Marine Forces Pacific as well as the Deputy Commander, United States Forces Japan. Major General Christopher J. Mahoney., USMC “We had a sanctuary up there [in the Middle East], Mahoney told The War Zone when asked about the shift to the Pacific from the Middle East. “They may be shooting at you but, you know, they weren’t getting me — at 1,000 feet per second, they’re not going there. We had to deliver ordnance very, very close to the guys on the ground. First, we had to make sure we did no harm and then we would start killing the people after that.” “But now we’re in a different game, of once again penetrating a very formidable array of defensive threats and offensive threats, and then exploiting that penetration by either penetrating further or picking out the systems that we want to try and destroy, either destroying them kinetically or destroying them some other way with a third system or by other means.” “So, here in the wing, we have grabbed on to the Commandant’s vision of force design into being able to move to first of all work inside that threat ring or bubble. We’re very close to threat systems, inside their kinematic range, inside their sensing range, inside their data range, and getting comfortable doing that, which means that you have to be able to sense them, then you have to be able to move if they have the ability to target you, and you have to be able to counter-punch or punch preemptively.” “So, the EABO concept as part of that is about moving around, establishing a capability, sustaining that capability, and then moving again before you become a seductive target to somebody. That is what we’re moving toward with EABO.” James Deboer “In the Marine Corps, if I want a new idea, I read an old book,” Major General Mahoney continued. “If you look at Operation Cartwheel in World War II, up in the Solomon Islands, and how we executed particularly aviation operations in Korea, that’s what we did. MAG-12 moved across several airfields and moved around depending on where the fight was, picked up their trash, moved around, got in battery, and started generating combat power or moved back onto the ship and then moved back ashore. The MAG didn’t but individual squadrons did. So, those ideas and those capabilities are things we’ve got historical experience with. Now it’s a matter of reintroducing them intellectually and then making the structure follow the concept and thoughts and then training to the functions that we want to perform.” “We are integrating in a larger sense like we’ve been doing for the last 20 years with the United States Navy with fleet action. Because if you look at where we’re going to fight, there’s a lot of water out there. And the water to me is like a big highway. You either are the cop that controls it, or you are the guy who’s trying to speed through there and not get caught. You’ve got to be able to exploit that maneuver space and everything up there is littoral space that is influenced either directly or indirectly from maritime space, so you’ve got to be able to operate in that space, and who does it better than the United States Navy? You know, that’s where I think the real strength of the concepts come from.” Preparing the F-35C for EABO was no easy task. Under the leadership of its commanding officer, Lt Col Brendan Walsh, VMFA-314 chose Major Robert ‘Murphy’ Ahern to get the job done. Major Ahern began planning the event several months ago and had to get all the right parties involved. First, the squadron was certified to do the “hot” reload while operating out of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma during Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course 1-21 in Arizona in October. Next, it had to get the clearance to use the M-31 arresting gear for the F-35C. This involved getting approval from Lockheed Martin and the Joint Program Office (JPO) to land within a certain envelope. Sparks fly as an F-35C catches the wire., James Deboer James Deboer “This is the first time we have combined a hot reload with an arresting gear landing in the F-35C,” Major Ahern explained. “The whole point was to show that while, yes, the F-35B can hover and land on a prepared surface, for us operating with a larger wing area and more weapons capability added to a much longer range than the F-35B, we can do the expeditionary mission much in the same way the F/A-18 Hornet would, where you have a runway of about 3,000 feet and an MWSS that has the ability to set up the arresting gear . Depending on how heavy the aircraft are on takeoff, they usually need between 2,000 and 3,000 feet of runway. Now they have weapons, fuel, and way better range than the F-35B and can stay in the fight longer.” “Lockheed Martin and the JPO approved the envelope and were all very responsive to make it happen. We are about four years ahead of schedule from when they thought they would test these concepts. They kept it very similar to max trap weight that is seen on the ship , so the risk was small, so all of the engineers did their behind-the-scenes numbers very quickly. We came in at 150 knots at roughly 45,000 pounds.” An F-35C on approach to the Forward Arming and Refueling Point., James Deboer Having all of the squadrons needed for the EABO concept in MAG-11 made it much easier to plan and execute. On December 3, a MAG-11 KC-130J from VMGR-352 took off from MCAS Miramar. Onboard the fuel-laden Hercules were two ordnance teams from VMFA-314 and four inert GBU-32s. The GBU-32 is a 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) that uses a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, into all-weather precision-guided munitions. Also on board were other Marines that would quickly help set up the Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP). An inert GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munition,, James Deboer The KC-130 touched down at the Strategic Expeditionary Landing Field (SELF) at MCAGCC Twentynine Palms. The airfield is made up of an aluminum-matted surface that is designed for sustained operations in an amphibious objective area. SELF at 29 Palms., Google Earth The runway, which is 8,000 feet long, as well as the taxiways and aircraft parking areas, are all constructed entirely of resilient and transportable AM-2 aluminum matting which is key to EABO and FARP operations. Refueling hoses are rolled out from the KC-130J after arriving at Twentynine Palms., James Deboer Before the KC-130 finished taxiing, loadmasters were quickly unstrapping the GBU-32s so they could quickly be offloaded from the rear ramp. With the ramp down, things happened quickly at the SELF as the Marines quickly unloaded the bombs and refueling hoses and other equipment needed for the mission. Loadmasters hurry to unload the GBU-32s from the Hercules., James Deboer James Deboer Soon after, the first of the two F-35Cs were flying overhead getting set to make history as the first example of this variant to use the M-31 arresting gear. Flying the first F-35C was Major Ahern, who made a hard break over the airfield much like an approach to an aircraft carrier. Lining up for the arresting gear, Major Ahern touched down a few hundred feet before the gear before catching the sole wire. Unlike aircraft carriers that use three or four wires, the M-31 gear has just one. With the landing perfectly executed, Ahern raised the tailhook and let go of the wire, while members of the MWSS quickly checked over the gear before the second pilot touched down. The M-31 does its job, as the F-35C rolls to the end of the airstrip., James Deboer Over to the taxiway, the first F-35 made its way to the awaiting KC-130 for fuel and bombs. The fueling and loading normally each take about 10 minutes, but were both done simultaneously, making for a very quick turnaround time. Each ordnance crew loaded a single GBU-32 in each of the two bomb bays before heading back over to the rear of the KC-130. With the second aircraft loaded and fueled, both jets then took off from the matted runway before heading to a bombing range near Yuma, Arizona, where they dropped their ordnance. The marriage of EABO with the F-35Cs may force Marine leadership to rethink the numbers of F-35Bs and Cs that they plan to purchase. According to the 2019 USMC Aviation Plan, the service intends to purchase 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs, but this number already seems to be up for debate. James Deboer Both the F-35B and F-35C will provide the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders with operational flexibility and tactical supremacy under many scenarios. But the roughly 7,000 pounds of additional fuel that the F-35C carries, as well as the ability to carry two 2,000-pound bombs compared to two 1,000-pound bombs in the F-35B, and now the F-35C’s proven ability for short field austere operations thanks to VMFA-314’s exploits, will make for some tough procurement decisions as the Pentagon looks increasingly at distributed operations in the Pacific.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 4, 2020",How The Once Elusive Dream Of Laser Weapons Suddenly Became A Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After decades of toiling and dead-ends, the dream of operational laser weaponry is about to become a reality. So, what changed that made what had been bulky systems go from clumsy pipe dreams to hardened, miniaturized, and reliable weapons that will be able to be deployed even in the harshest of conditions? We recently had an in-depth interview with Dr. Rob Afzal, Lockheed Martin Senior Fellow, Laser and Sensor Systems, where I pressed him on everything related to laser weaponry and the emerging military applications that go along with it. In the course of answering my maelstrom of queries, Dr. Afzal eloquently conveyed how we have suddenly arrived in an era where laser weapons will become widespread across the battlefield. In this first piece in our two-part series with Lockheed’s directed energy guru, I wanted to share his explanation with you, as it is fascinating in its own right. Here, as it was conveyed to me directly, is what technological developments have made the dawn of laser warfare possible according to Dr. Afzal: “If you think back, that the laser is actually invented in roughly 1960. So, it begs the question, that’s 50 years—why aren’t there laser weapons all over the place today? There are really two reasons for that. The first reason is that the initial application they envisioned for the laser weapons is for strategic defense mission; really, the hardest—most difficult technologically—mission that there is, defending the homeland against incoming ballistic missiles. So, first of all, that was extraordinarily difficult, but it did develop a lot of core fundamental technologies and demonstrations that showed that a laser weapon system can be put together, you can do acquisition, tracking, pointing a laser beam, as well as delivering a lethal laser beam to a target, like a boost-phase ballistic missile on the Airborne Laser program . The issue, though, was that those systems were basically just too big, literally. They were physically too big to really be deployed in the tactical environment, on a truck or on an airplane, even on a ship, without taking up large portions of the ship. The abortive YAL-1 Airborne Laser filled-up an entire 747 with its chemical laser components. The program was canceled a decade ago after huge sums of money spent and lack of meeting operationally relevant requirements.  , USAF Even though the systems were possible, the irony was that the laser technology wasn’t there yet, to make a small enough, powerful enough laser, to be tactically relevant. Now, the threat landscape also started to change, and we went from a strategic defense to a tactical defense. The threats today are really evolving. We’re talking now about swarms of low-cost, low capability threats, like armed UAVs or large quantities of mortars or rocket barrages. Those systems are shorter range, and many of the systems are… not sophisticated; meaning traditionally sophisticated countermeasures, like jamming and redirecting and things like that, don’t work. Like, for instance, a mortar does not have a guidance system on it. So, there’s not something you can easily do to defend against a mortar. And the timeline of a mortar shot is very short, so you need to react extraordinarily quickly and be able to defend in a very short period of time. So, the threat landscape is evolved. And then in the technology space, there were two revolutions that really started to take place. The first was fiber-optic telecommunication, so I’ll get to why that’s relevant to directed energy. All of a sudden, in the ’90s, billions and billions of dollars started to pour into the development of fiber-optic communications equipment—how to make the optical fiber, how to pull kilometers and kilometers of it with high purity, how to make high-speed electronics to be able to do communications, semiconductor diode lasers to send the data down the fibers. The whole industrial infrastructure for that capability started to really be built out. Then the bubble burst in the early 2000s and a number of the companies that were in that space began looking for new markets that this fiber-optic, fiber-laser technology actually could scale in power to hundreds of watts to kilowatts of optical power. What we found—we, meaning the community—was that that you could do a whole bunch of industrial applications using fiber-laser technology and very cost-effectively. What I mean by that is mainly cutting, welding, and drilling. So, all of a sudden, all sheet metal that’s cut for home appliances and so forth, was starting to be cut by high-power fiber-lasers of the kilowatt-type power levels. Cutaway of a fiber-optic cable and fiber-optic cabling being installed in a city. , Bidgee/Wikicommons and Srleffler/Wikicommons All the microelectronics and iPhones and so forth, were starting to be drilled and the touch screens were being scribed, and all this whole industrial space opened up, and the reason was that these fiber lasers were very efficient at converting electrical power to optical power. The beam quality that came out of the fiber-laser, meaning the ability for that beam to be focusable, to provide a high-intensity spot to do things, like melt metal and drill holes, the beam quality was very high. So, all of a sudden, the industrial space really opened up and the development of high-power fiber-lasers really, really took off. That was particularly interesting, except for the fact that the power out of a fiber-laser doesn’t scale to a weapons class, right? It’s one thing to cut metal that’s centimeters away, it’s another thing to take out a mortar at two kilometers. So, the innovation that changed the game in the last five years or so, Lockheed Martin was a real leader or the leader in this innovation, and the innovation involved bringing together the technologies from fiber-optic communications and the technologies of high-power lasers for industrial applications to figure out a way to scale fiber-lasers to weapons class power. The way that’s done is, instead of just building a single laser at 50 kilowatts or 100 kilowatts or something like that, we are actually taking individual fiber-lasers and combining the outputs of the beams into a single high-power beam, and we do that using a technique we call Spectral Beam Combination… Fundamentally, what we did was we took something, if you’re familiar with wavelength division multiplexing in telecommunication—how to break up the spectrum that’s available to you into many different laser-lines and send all that light down a fiber to increase your communications bandwidth. So, all of a sudden, we took a large number of fiber-laser channels, all closely spaced in wavelength or in frequency, and then by reflecting those beams off an object. We could call it a grating, or you can think in your mind of it like a prism, the beams all combine into a single output beam. Patty always loves this analogy I use, which is Pink Floyd’s Dark Side Of The Moon record cover. The iconic Dark Side Of The Moon cover. , Harvest Records/Pink Floyd So, if you look at that prism, there’s a white light beam that comes into the prism and it breaks up into the colors of the rainbow, you could run that in reverse, you could have a whole bunch of beams that cover the different spectrums, and if you put it through the prism, they all combine and output a single beam. We call it kinda the ‘reverse prism effect.’ So what all of a sudden we were able to do was to scale laser power in a modular way. Instead of just trying to build a bigger and bigger laser, we’re actually scaling by adding lasers up . Think of it as a mainframe computer breaking up into a supercomputing cluster. So, instead of just building a bigger device, we’re combining in parallel. And so, what that enabled us to do is build a high-power laser that’s scalable by adding modules that delivered a weapons class beam, but with very high beam qualities. Lockheed Indirect Fire Protection Capability-High Energy Laser (IFPC-HEL) , which is now aiming for a 300kW class rating, will provide an all-new countermeasure against rockets, drones, and artillery. , Lockheed Martin I’ll get to this from a laser weapon system perspective, it’s more than just laser power that’s important, it’s the ability to focus that beam, for that beam to be able to propagate over a long distance, stay tightly focused. And of course, in the weapon system, it’s important that you’re able to do acquisition tracking and line of sight stabilization to keep the spot on the soft zone of the target. The fiber-laser technology is also, as I mentioned, the most efficient at converting electric power to laser light. So, all of a sudden that meant that the platform demands, whether you’re on a ship, a truck, or an airplane, of being able to provide power and then cooling is minimized; it’s certainly not zero, and we’re talking about 30% to 35% efficiency at converting electric power into a usable laser beam. That may not sound that great to you, but compared to old solid-state laser technology, it was more like 10%. It’s a big, big deal. Lockheed’s ATHENA laser punches a hole in a target vehicle. , Lockheed Martin What that meant was that the system demands, the platform demands were greatly reduced, and it meant that the laser weapon, not just the laser, the whole laser weapon, could now start being made small enough, powerful enough, to now be deployed on Army vehicles, Navy ships, and even on aircraft. So, that’s really what changed the game. And as you can see, there’s a lot of activity in this domain from our customers, all the services are now advancing capability in laser weapon systems for land, sea, and air. Lockheed Martin is a premier provider of this technology in all these domains, and we are working in all these domains. So, the kind of the key message is the final piece of the puzzle to enable the fielding of laser weapons was solved using the fiber, the beam combined—spectrally beam combined fiber laser technology. Now what we’re looking at is we’re moving beyond S&T, Science and Technology demos… Is this even possible? We are now seeing those initial systems being built and ready to be deployed on platforms. For example, we have the program, the HELIOS [High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance] program, which is to build, integrate, and install a laser weapon system on a DDG Arleigh Burke class destroyer. HELIOS concept art. , Lockheed Martin What’s fundamental about that is it goes beyond the technology of the laser and the acquisition tracking and pointing, it’s tying the laser weapon into the combat system that is on the ship. That’s another area where, of course, we take great pride in being a leader in that domain. It’s really that ability when you’re in at the console and looking at the battlespace, being able to make decisions on what the threats are, and what’s the best counter for that threat, whether it’s a directed energy counter or a kinetic energy counter, and we see those capabilities operating… I don’t know what’s the right word… Synergistically? symbiotically? They’re going to work together and provide choices and using the best option for the combatant commanders. One would imagine that if you have a large number of low-cost threats, you don’t want to use high-cost, highly capable kinetic missiles against low-cost UAVs, right? You want to use your laser that has a low operating cost after the install and then you can hold your kinetics for more hardened threats that maybe the laser is inappropriate for. So, being able to provide choices, capabilities, to take on the evolving threat landscape, I think really is the value proposition that we are trying to provide our customers. So, that’s kind of it in a nutshell. Lockheed Martin, we’ve been in this business for about 40 years, really starting with the Airborne Laser program, where Lockheed Martin was the lead on the beam control system, and it’s evolved over time, where we have built capabilities in beam control, tracking, line of sight stabilization, and then platform system integration, which is really a key core competency of Lockheed Martin, right? We also build a lot of the platforms, so how you install and interface these systems with the combat systems or the control stations, and providing that interface to the user is really important.” Make sure to check out the Q&A portion of the interview linked here . We get into some unique topic areas where Dr. Afzal was really able to clear up a lot of misconceptions and get to the reality of what is feasible and what isn’t in the near term when it comes to directed energy applications.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Revolutionary spaceflight firm SpaceX once again proved to the world they’re capable of putting on a good show today with the launch of one of their Starship prototypes, Serial Number 8, or SN8. The test was by some measures a success, as the craft was able to reach high altitude and terminate its flight at a particular location, although the landing resulted in a fireball seemingly ripped straight from Looney Tunes . Starship SN8 exploding upon landing., SpaceX Today’s flight in Cameron County, Texas was intended to test many of the systems and subsystems on Starship and comes on the heels of an aborted test yesterday. “This suborbital flight is designed to test a number of objectives, from how the vehicle’s three Raptor engines perform to the overall aerodynamic entry capabilities of the vehicle (including its body flaps) to how the vehicle manages propellant transition. SN8 will also attempt to perform a landing flip maneuver, which would be a first for a vehicle of this size,” SpaceX said in a statement on its website . The SN8 prototype flew for six minutes and 40 seconds in its test flight today. SN8 was supposed to reach an altitude of over 40,000 feet, but SpaceX has yet to state the official apogee for its flight. At roughly 1:44 into the flight, it appears as if one of the Starship’s engines fails or is shut down on purpose, while another goes out at 3:15. At 4:42 into the flight, the Starship executes what SpaceX calls a “belly flop,” turning horizontal to cruise back down to a lower altitude before righting itself upright once more for landing. At 6:32, one of the Starship’s engines reignites bringing the total working engines upon landing to two, but not long after, the prototype rocket is back down to one engine during the very end of its descent phase. At 6:40, the ship crashes into the designated landing area, exploding in a magnificent fireball worthy of a Michael Bay film. Starship SN8 in flight., SpaceX Watching these epic SpaceX failures has been at least some small part of the appeal of their highly-publicized tests and launches, and hearkens back to the early days of the Space Race. SpaceX prefers what’s known as an iterative design model, meaning the company tests and flies new vehicle designs, and test articles based on those designs, as quickly as they can, with a high risk of failure being factored into the development and learning process. A Starship prototype., Daniel Etherington/TechCrunch This has resulted in quicker R&D timelines for SpaceX’s projects and has led to some major leaps in technological capabilities. It also results in a lot of spectacular, explosive failures . The company has even put out “ greatest hits ” reels of many of its explosive failures. Space X CEO Elon Musk actually has his own euphemism for these types of failures: RUD, or “Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly.” Thus, even though SN8 suffered a cinematic RUD upon landing, SpaceX will likely still consider the test a success, based on Musk’s post-explosion tweet. The 160-foot-tall, stainless steel SpaceX Starship is designed to be a reusable two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) platform which SpaceX hopes could reach orbital space, the Moon, Mars, or any point on Earth. Already, the idea of a reusable TSTO craft for cargo or personnel transportation has piqued the interest of the Department of Defense. U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) has already forged a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with SpaceX to explore options for point-to-point launches capable of reaching any point on Earth in an hour . Of course, if you can deliver cargo to anywhere on the planet in an hour, you can deliver weapon systems or munitions just as fast.

Musk’s goals are extremely ambitious, but realizing an operational Starship in any capacity would represent a massive leap in spaceflight capability. Regardless of the uncertainty surrounding such a high-risk program, we can be sure that this won’t be the last spectacular ‘kaboom!’ team SpaceX offers up to all mankind.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 10, 2021",Israeli Offering Could Meet U.S. Navy’s Requirements For A New Submarine Launched Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy recently announced that it was interested in acquiring unmanned aircraft that its submarines could launch from the three-inch launchers they all have for deploying signal flares and marine markers. At the same time, earlier this year, an Israeli firm unveiled a line of encapsulated drones that can be deployed from 40mm infantry grenade launchers , 66mm grenade launchers on vehicles, as well as underwater launch systems. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) first posted a contracting notice for what it referred to as a Submarine-Launched Unmanned Aerial System (SLUAS) online on Oct. 30, 2020. NAVSEA made clear that it is only seeking proposals for potential SLUAS designs at present and that it has no firm plans to buy any such drones right now. All Navy submarines, including the Virginia class USS Mississippi seen here, have a three-inch signal launcher., USN “The Navy requires the capability of a SLUAS with a 3-inch diameter form-factor to provide enhanced sensor, communication and cyber-security capabilities,” the contracting notice reads. “The integrated system should be capable of launch from the US submarine fleet’s 3-inch Signal System Ejector (SSE) equipment.” “Threshold performance of the air vehicle should include electro-optic capability with reliable target solution analysis,” it continued. “The vehicle should remain airborne for at least one hour, operate at ranges out to the line-of-sight radio horizon, and use a variable bandwidth encrypted datalink with at least 256-bit encryption strength.” In August, Israeli company Spear debuted its Ninox product line of drones designed to be fired from various launchers. The smallest of these is the Ninox 40, which is intended to be fired from standard 40mm infantry grenade launchers , including those capable of being attached to an individual’s rifle . After launch, four arms pop up laterally on this tube-shaped drone, which weighs less than a pound, morphing it into a small quad-copter. https://youtube.com/watch?v=yufCQdD8Z-E A second individual controls the UAS via a tablet-like device, which also provides a feed from the drone’s electro-optical and infrared cameras. As such, troops can use the Ninox 40 during the day or at night to scout ahead for potential threats or attempt to find and fix the location enemy during an actual firefight. Spear also says that this drone has automated target recognition and tracking capabilities. The larger Ninox 66 is similar in function and is intended to be fired from 66mm launchers on vehicles , which are typically used to fire smoke grenades or other obscurants for concealment. Unlike on the Ninox 40, the four arms on this quad-copter-type drone flip up from the base after launch. Spear says this UAS can carry various payloads weighing up to 1.5 pounds and has the ability to be networked together with others to operate as an autonomous swarm. The biggest drone in the Ninox family is the Ninox 103, which is a scaled-up derivative of the Ninox 66 and carry payloads weighing just over three pounds. “The Ninox 103 is intuitive and easy to use with up to 60 minutes flight time, and the most advanced capabilities, including swarm, mesh [network], computer vision, target tracking, homing algorithms and more,” according to Spear’s website, which says that this quad-copter can remain stable in winds up to 20 knots and fly through other adverse weather conditions. Much of this would seem to meet the Navy’s basic capability requirements for the SLUAS. It’s unclear exactly what type of launchers Spear has designed this system to be fired from. The drone’s manufacturer says that it is suitable for launch from ships at sea, as well as vehicles and even other aircraft , but interestingly the only marketing video it has released for the Ninox 103, so far, seen below, shows it being deployed from an underwater platform. This is exactly how it would function if fired from a submarine. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uuinc2NzrdU It’s not clear what the diameter of the Ninox 103 is, but if the company’s naming conventions hold true, then it should be around 103mm, or 4 inches, which would be too wide to fit inside a Navy three-inch signal launcher. A version of the Ninox 66 that could be submarine launched would fit, as 66mm is around 2.6 inches. The ability for a submarine to launch a small quad-copter that only has 60 minutes of flying time might not seem like much, but it could provide valuable additional situational awareness for the boat’s crew without having to surface and expose themselves. Additional drones acting as communications relays could help extend how far this surveillance coverage might be able to reach while still using line-of-sight links. Between the relatively covert nature of deploying such a system, especially at night, combined with the unmanned aircraft’s small size, it could also be difficult for an opponent to quickly detect that they are under surveillance or determine the drone’s point of origin. For a submarine, the drone could also provide a way to help verify surface targets and their position before engaging them with a torpedo. Determining a firing solution for launching a torpedo is a complex process that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . In fact, in November, the Navy disclosed that it had conducted just such an experiment in 2019 with an existing, unspecified submarine-launched drone. The Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Annapolis was used in the demonstration and launched the unmanned aircraft from periscope depth and was able to control it “out to tactically significant ranges — well beyond the line of sight,” according to a presentation that Rear Admiral Dave Goggins, the Navy’s Program Executive Officer for Submarines, gave during the annual symposium of the Naval Submarine League, which was held online this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “By doing so she [USS Annapolis ] was able to target and conduct a rapid simulated torpedo attack against a participating surface ship, in case the [Independence class Littoral Combat Ship] USS Charleston , pretty much at near-maximum effective range of that torpedo, by flying that UAV to obtain a fire-point solution after gaining that initial sonar gain,” Goggins continued. “Consider a submarine-deployed unmanned aircraft as a flying periscope able to dramatically extend our submarines’ organic sensor range, provide target-quality sensor data back to the submarine, or to a joint force capability, and enable Harpoon and Maritime Strike Tomahawk missile engagements,” Navy Rear Admiral Blake Converse, Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in a separate online talk as part of the Naval Submarine League symposium. “We are always working on tactic development exercises to enhance the performance of our existing submarine sensors and identify areas for improvement so that we can detect the adversary well before he sees us and we can shoot him first.” The potential to network submarine-launched drones together into swarms, something, as noted, that Spear says Ninox 103 can do, would offer additional capabilities to submarine commanders. A swarm of unmanned aircraft could search for targets or other objects of interest across a broader area at once. Individual drones could carry a mix of payloads, including electronic warfare jammers and even potentially small munitions , allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, including launching kinetic or non-kinetic attacks themselves. They can also be used as ‘daisy chain’ relays to extend line-of-sight connectivity. A swarm also simply has the inherent ability to present an opponent with a large number of targets approaching from multiple vectors at once. This can overwhelm, confuse, or otherwise disrupt the decision-making processes of an enemy, making it hard for them to effectively respond. It is, of course, important to note that Ninox 103 isn’t the only submarine-launched drone that the Navy might be interested in for this new SLUAS requirement. The service has been exploring this kind of capability for decades now, as you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . In 2013, the Navy said it has been actively testing AeroVironment’s Blackwing , a derivative of that company’s Switchblade loitering munition , or “suicide drone,” that is capable of being fired from three-inch countermeasures launchers on submarines. In November, Rear Admiral Goggins said that 21 SLUASs had been employed in demonstrations, though it’s not clear how many individual types the Navy has actually experimented with. The service had notably completed a series of fly offs in July in cooperation with the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), which has the stated mission of “accelerating the adoption of leading commercial technology throughout the military.” A 2013 Naval Sea Systems Command briefing slide describing testing using the submarine-launched Blackwing drone., NAVSEA “I have five SLUAS shipsets in the fleet today and we will continue to deliver this capability,” Goggins added. “We’re really working on the evolution of that capability going forward.” Hopefully, we will learn more as time goes on about new submarine-launched drone designs that the Navy might be considering acquiring in the future. What is clear is that this is a capability that is already in use to some degree and submarines deploying unmanned aircraft look set to become increasingly the norm as time goes on. Correction: The original version of this piece incorrectly stated that 103mm was around 2.6 inches. 103mm is around 4 inches. 66mm is around 2.6 inches.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 27, 2020",Nigeria’s MiG-21 Fighter Jet Force Is Up For Sale,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Twenty Soviet-made MiG-21 Fishbed jet fighters are being advertised for sale online. The jets, which apparently comprise the Nigerian Air Force’s entire remaining Fishbed fleet, are described as being in a “used” condition and are offered together with 15 “new” engines, as well as spares. The offer, posted on the trade-a-plane.com website, is being made by the Inter Avia Group, which is based in Nevada. No prices are listed for the jets, the vendor instead requesting that any interested customers contact them directly for more information. An accompanying photograph, seen at the top of this story and below, shows a line of out-of-service MiG-21s that clearly display the colors and insignia of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF). TRADE-A-PLANE Up for grabs are 11 MiG-21bis single-seat fighters, five of the earlier-model MiG-21MF single-seat fighters, and four MiG-21UM Mongol two-seat trainers. While no claims are made about the airworthiness of these antique jets, they have now been grounded for many years. The various jets have apparently seen relatively little use, with the MiG-21bis having between 34 and 169 flying hours on each airframe, while the MiG-21MFs have between 250 and 469, according to the listing. Finally, the two-seat models have accumulated between 199 and 547 hours each. The performance specifications, as provided by the vendor, are, it must be said, a mixed bag. While the stated 1,385 miles per hour maximum speed of the MiG is undoubtedly pretty spectacular, the combat radius figure of 310 miles is less than impressive. Nigeria ordered its Fishbeds from the then-Soviet Union back in the mid-1970s, to replace its aging MiG-17 Fresco fighter jets. The Soviets delivered 24 MiG-21MFs and six MiG-21UMs in 1975. However, peacetime attrition was apparently heavy, leaving only 12 MiG-21MFs and five MiG-21UMs operational by October 1984, according to figures published in African MiGs — MiGs and Sukhois in Service in Sub-Saharan Africa . At that time, Nigeria ordered another 13 of the more advanced MiG-21bis, plus two more MiG-21UM jets to make up for these losses. The Nigerian Air Force strike fleet 1986. 22 MiG-21 Fishbeds, 18 Sepecat Jaguars and 24 Alpha jet trainer/light attack pic.twitter.com/4JGSJ6HD4G — Defense News Nigeria (@DefenseNigeria) April 29, 2020 The MiG-21’s operational service with the NAF included participation in a deployment to the northeast of the country in the early 1980s, to support an Organization of African Unity (OAU) peacekeeping mission in neighboring Chad. Flying from Maiduguri, the MiG-21s apparently flew several reconnaissance sorties over Chad, and reportedly, on occasion, even landed on various dirt strips in that country. After a dispute about fishing rights on Lake Chad in April 1983, Nigerian MiG-21s are said to have attacked several lakeside villages, leaving as many as 90 dead and many more wounded, according to an account in Vic Fintham’s Air Wars and Aircraft . Eventually, most of the Nigerian MiGs were withdrawn from service and put into storage during the early 1990s. Since then, they have been left in the open at Makurdi, in eastern Nigeria. At least one single-seat example has been preserved, now serving as the gate guard at Abuja Air Base, as seen below: MiG-21 Fished, formed between two to three fighter squadrons for the Nigerian air force.

A similar upgrade has also been undertaken on Mozambique’s MiG-21 fleet and the same two companies collaborated in the LanceR upgrade for the Romanian Air Force MiG-21 fleet. The Nigerian deal was shelved after the government apparently failed to secure the required funds. Ultimately, Nigeria turned to China to fulfill its fighter jet requirements, introducing in 2010 the Chengdu F-7 , which is a much-modernized Chinese development of the MiG-21. More recently, the NAF has ordered three JF-17 Thunder aircraft that are scheduled to be delivered in 2021 . A flypast by a pair of F-7s — the type that replaced the MiG-21 with the Nigerian Air Force., Kenneth Iwelumo/Wikimedia Commons As for the 20 MiG-21s, their limited flying hours means they could theoretically still offer many more years of service. However, their storage in the open for upward of 30 years suggests that bringing them back to airworthiness could be a significant undertaking — provided it’s even possible. With MiG-21s still active with multiple operators around the world, there may well be interest in acquiring these jets as a spare parts source, especially as they are being offered with 15 apparently unused engines. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, seven nations still fly or have recently flown, MiG-21s, and some of those aircraft have been upgraded to extend their service life further. There is a remote possibility that the MiG-21s might interest a civilian contractor, for potential adversary services or other military support work. However, although the basic Fishbed still offers supersonic performance, its lack of any modern avionics and sensors means that it provides very limited capabilities for Red Air aggressor work. The level of safety the type offers may also be an issue. Indeed, while Draken International has a fleet of 25 MiG-21bis and MiG-21UM aircraft, these have apparently not seen any meaningful use, despite the company’s offers to equip them with electronic warfare pods and modern radar. Still, should there be any customers eager to acquire a ready-made, but currently non-functional air force, then the Inter Avia Group is also offering for sale three former Nigerian Air Force C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, with the proviso that these “have been stored for many years and have many parts removed.” All three of the airlifters are for sale at $2.5 million, but their transfer would require approval under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the U.S. guidelines controlling the manufacture, sale, and distribution of defense equipment and services. The flight deck of this Nigerian Air Force C-130H has clearly seen better days., trade-a-plane.com While it remains unclear what future awaits the little-used Cold War-era MiG-21s, if a buyer does emerge, we will watch with keen interest to see where they end up next.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2020",Here’s France’s Plan For Its New Nuclear Powered Supercarrier (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. French President Emmanuel Macron has officially announced that a program is underway to develop a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace the country’s existing flattop, Charles de Gaulle . French shipbuilder Naval Group, which is partially state-owned, subsequently released new concept art of what is presently known as the Porte Avion Nouvelle Generation , or PANG, which translates to New Generation Aircraft Carrier. Macron made the announcement on Dec. 8, 2020, during a visit to Framatome, a French company that builds nuclear reactors, and associated equipment, and is set to provide the powerplants for the PANG. The French government also has a controlling stake in this firm, which built the reactor plants for the Charles de Gaulle , via the electric utility company Électricité de France. “ Charles de Gaulle , as you know, will come to the end of its life in 2038. This is why I have decided that the future aircraft carrier that will equip our country and our navy will be nuclear-powered like the Charles de Gaulle ,” Macron said . “Your plant in Le Creusot, which has been producing parts essential to our navy for a long time, will produce, among others, several major parts of the nuclear boiler [reactor] of the future aircraft carrier by forging and machining them right here. … By these choices, we confirm France’s desire to preserve its strategic autonomy.” The concept art that Naval Group and the French Ministry of Armed Forces have now released online shows a Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) type design with an angled deck and a relatively small main island toward the rear right end of the flight deck. The Charles de Gaulle is also has a CATOBAR configuration and, at present, France is only just two countries to operate aircraft carriers of this type, the other being the United States. China is now in the process of building a CATOBAR-configured carrier and India has expressed interest in acquiring a ship of this type , as well. Naval Group French Ministry of Armed Forces French Ministry of Armed Forces French Ministry of Armed Forces French Ministry of Armed Forces On Twitter, Florence Parly, France’s Minister for the Armed Forces, provided some detail about the planned specifications and capabilities of the PANG. The future aircraft carrier will be just over 984 feet long and displace approximately 75,000 metric tons. The Charles de Gaulle is around 858 feet long and displaces just 42,500 metric tons. “The expression ‘42,000 tonnes of diplomacy’ will therefore have to change to ‘75,000 tonnes…,'” Parly wrote on Twitter. France’s existing aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle ., USN Parly also said that the decision to again go with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was twofold. Firstly, it will give the ship virtually unlimited range and, secondly, it will help France maintain its nuclear industrial base. She did note that fuel would still be required for the carrier’s air wing. The ship will still need to maintain stocks of food and water for the personnel on board, as well. Two K22 nuclear reactors will drive the ship’s propulsion system and propel the vessel to speeds of up to 27 knots, as well as supply electrical power for the ship’s various systems. This will include electromagnetic catapults from General Atomics , the same company that designed and built the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class carriers. It’s not clear whether the PANG will also have an electronically-controlled arresting system, such as the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) found on the Fords , another General Atomics product. An earlier artist’s rendering of a Rafale-M fighter jet launching from a future French aircraft carrier via an electromagnetic catapult., General Atomics via Naval News In principle, electromagnetic aircraft launching and electronically-controlled recovery systems can also be more finely tuned to specific aircraft and loadouts , ranging from very heavy to very light types. This would help reduce the physical strain on their airframes as they go flying off the deck and when they come back to land, reducing maintenance and logistics demands. The U.S. Navy has also said that its EMALS, when it is working as intended , will help increase sortie generation rates. Parly said that the PANG is expected to have a crew of 2,000, but it’s not clear if that includes aviators that will be assigned to the ship’s air wing. Given that the typical combined size of Charles de Gaulle ‘s crew plus its air wing is around 2,000 personnel , it could indicate that the French Minister’s estimated PANG crew size accounts for both elements. If true, it’s interesting that the PANG would have an identical crew size to the Charles de Gaulle given how much larger the proposed ship is, which could point to plans for the design to incorporate features and technology to reduce various workloads. The carrier will be able to accommodate around 30 fighter jets, according to Parly. These could initially be Dassault Rafale-M fighters, but the ultimate goal is for the ship to carry a version of the stealthy New Generation Fighter (NGF) that now in development as part of the Future Air Combat System (FCAS) program. France and Germany initiated the FCAS program together in 2017 and Spain announced its intention to join the effort the following year. Dassault is set to be the primary contractor for the NGF. European aviation consortium Airbus is leading the development of “loyal wingman” type drones, also known as “ remote carriers ,” for the FCAS program. An artist’s conception of a stealthy New Generation Fighter flying together with three remote carrier drones., Airbus Naval Group’s concept art, as seen below, shows NGFs on the flight deck. It also shows E-2 Hawkeye carrier-borne airborne warning and control aircraft and an NH90 helicopter , both of which the French Navy operates now. Naval Group Remote carriers, or a fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), such as a derivative of the Dassault nEUROn , which took part in a demonstration together with Charles de Gaulle in 2016, could also be added to the PANG’s air wing in the future. The ship’s electromagnetic catapults would be a major boon for any future carrier-borne drones, as they are much better suited to launching smaller, lighter aircraft than traditional steam catapults. Concept art that Naval Group and Dassault previously released showing a New Generation Fighter and a flying-wing-type unmanned combat air vehicle, similar in general size and shape to nEUROn, flying from the deck of an aircraft carrier., Naval Group/Dassault nEUROn flies past Charles de Gaulle in formation with a French Navy Rafale-M fighter jet in 2016., Dassault Of course, it’s important to remember that the PANG project is still very clearly in the early stages of development. Much about the ship, including what sensors, such as radars and defensive systems, it will have, still appears to need to be finalized. With the key schedule requirement being the need to have the ship in service by 2038, when the French Navy expects to decommission Charles de Gaulle , there is significant time for the exact design and expected capabilities of the ship to further evolve. It’s also worth noting that France has been exploring possible new carrier concepts since the early 2000s, shortly after Charles de Gaulle entered service. The initial construction of that carrier was finished in 1994, but it required significant additional work, including the need to lengthen the flight deck, and was only commissioned in 2001. Various designs were considered for a potential Porte Avions 2 (PA2), or Aircraft Carrier 2, including a CATOBAR design derived from the U.K. Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class hullform from DCNS, which was subsequently renamed Naval Group, and Thales Naval France. In 2013, a French Armed Forces white paper was published that included an announcement that the PA2 project had been canceled.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two Royal Australian Air Force aviators ejected safely from their F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet after an aborted takeoff at RAAF Base Amberley today. Video and photos of the incident show that the jet came off the runway and seemed to have ended up with some damage to its nose gear. The Super Hornet, which some sources have identified as serial number A44-223, was preparing to depart Amberley on a north-south axis on the afternoon of December 8, local time, when the accident occurred. It was reportedly the third aircraft within a group of around seven jets that were leaving for a training exercise. The Australian Department of Defense confirmed that both of the crew members are safe and that no other personnel were involved in the incident. “Defence [the Australian Department of Defence] will provide more information once the immediate actions associated with the incident are completed,” a spokesperson for the Department told Australia’s ABC . “The cause of the incident is not known at this time and will be subject to investigation.” One eyewitness told the Sydney Morning Herald that, as it got close to the end of the runway, the jet involved in the mishap “appeared to suffer some kind of engine failure,” but this cannot currently be confirmed. Onlookers said they saw the crew eject from the Super Hornet as it was about to take off and two parachutes can be seen deployed in a video, seen below, that subsequently emerged online. The video also shows that the Super Hornet, which wears the markings of the Royal Australian Air Force’s No. 6 Squadron on its tail, carrying an AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile under each wing, as well as a single AIM-9X and air combat maneuvering instrumentation pod in addition to two external fuel tanks. It’s not clear from the footage if the missiles were live. An additional image that appeared on social media of the aftermath of the accident shows scorch marks from the ejection seats on the sides of the forward fuselage of the Super Hornet, while the nose gear has either collapsed or sunk into the ground, with the jet ending up in a nose-down attitude on the side of the runway. Crash tenders are also seen on the scene, which is standard procedure, and there are no indications that there was any fire. #breaking An ⁦ @AusAirForce ⁩ Super Hornet has crashed before takeoff at RAAF Base Amberley – Defence says “aircrew of that aircraft are safe” but cause of the incident is still unknown pic.twitter.com/kNj1WOyXc0 — Andrew Greene (@AndrewBGreene) December 8, 2020 Australia has a fleet of 24 F/A-18Fs, all based at Amberley.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Chuck Yeager’s Amazing Life Told Through The Airplanes He Flew,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Brigadier General Charles E. “Chuck” Yeager , arguably the world’s most famous test pilot, has died at the age of 97. Tributes from far and wide have been paid to this World War II fighter ace and the first human to break the sound barrier, a feat that he achieved on October 14, 1947, at the controls of a Bell X-1 rocket plane. Yeager died yesterday in Los Angeles, California. His wife, Victoria Yeager, provided the following statement on Twitter: While mankind’s first supersonic flight will forever link Yeager with the X-1 in the public’s collective imagination, The War Zone pays tribute to the legendary pilot by looking at some of the other defining aircraft that he flew during his unmatched flying career and uniquely colorful life. Yeager in the world-changing Bell X-1 “Glamorous Glennis.”, USAF Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan Aged 18, Yeager enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps — the precursor of the Air Force — in September 1941. Before being selected for pilot training, he served as a crew chief on the AT-11 Kansan, working as a technician on the aircrew trainer that was based on the popular civilian Beechcraft Model 18. It was onboard an AT-11 that Yeager got his first taste of flying and the airsickness he experienced sitting alongside the pilot made him, briefly, have second thoughts about a future career in the air. The AT-11 Kansan was the standard U.S. Army bombing trainer in World War II., San Diego Air and Space Museum Vultee BT-13 Valiant In July 1942, Yeager was selected for pilot training under the Flying Sergeant program, a wartime initiative to train more pilots more rapidly. After completing primary pilot training at Hemet, California, he began the basic syllabus in the BT-13 Valiant at Gardner Field in Taft, California. Advanced training followed at Luke Field, Arizona, where he earned his wings as an enlisted pilot as part of Class 43-C on March 10, 1943. A BT-13 similar to those on which Yeager completed his basic pilot training., U.S. Air Force Bell P-39 Airacobra Yeager’s first operational posting, as a non-commissioned flight officer, was to the 363rd Fighter Squadron at Tonopah Bombing and Gunnery Range, Nevada, in March 1943, flying the P-39 Airacobra, a tricky single-engine fighter that was generally unloved by the U.S. military. Yeager himself had a close call when his P-39 caught fire during a training flight, forcing him to bail out and fracturing his back in the process. When the 363rd moved to England in late 1943, the unit left its P-39s behind. A P-39Q at Hamilton Army Airfield, California, in July 1943. This aircraft was assigned to the 357th Fighter Group, to which Yeager’s 363rd Fighter Squadron was attached., U.S. Air Force North American P-51 Mustang Alongside the experimental X-1, the P-51 is probably the aircraft type best associated with Yeager — his P-51B was the first of a long line of aircraft he named Glamorous Glen(nis), after his future wife, Glennis Faye Dickhouse. Flying from Leiston, eastern England, Yeager experienced his first combat in the P-51B in February 1944 and he had claimed one Messerschmitt Bf 109 destroyed before being shot down himself on his eighth combat mission, on March 5, 1944. The story of Yeager evading capture and, with the aid of the French Resistance, joining up again with his unit in England is an epic one, that’s been described many times before . Yeager back in the cockpit of a P-51 for an airshow appearance in 1986., U.S. National Archives Yeager returned to combat in the improved P-51C that featured a “Malcolm Hood” — a bubble-type canopy that provided a much better all-round vision. However, the D-model Mustang was the classic Mustang model in World War II and it was on the P-51D that Yeager scored most of his kills — 12.5 in the air, including five Bf 109s that were downed on a single day, October 12, 1944, followed by four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s on November 27 the same year. He also shot down an example of the first operational jet fighter, a Messerschmitt Me 262 , and damaged two more, in a single mission. Yeager flew his final combat mission in the European theater on January 15, 1945, for a total of 64 combat sorties. Glamorous Glen III, Chuck Yeager’s P-51D during World War II., U.S. Air Force Lockheed P-80A Shooting Star Back in the United States, Yeager became assistant maintenance officer in the Fighter Section of the Flight Test Division at Wright Field, Ohio, where his job was to conduct post-maintenance check flights, meaning he got to fly most of the fighters of the day. Yeager had his first chance to experience the performance of a jet aircraft for himself when he took to the air in a P-80A Shooting Star during service trials for America’s first operational jet fighter at California’s Muroc Army Air Field (the future Edwards Air Force Base ), in September 1945. A P-80A was the first jet-powered type that Yeager flew., U.S. Air Force Bell XS-1 (X-1) The instinctive flying skills that Yeager had demonstrated at Wright Field saw him selected in June 1947 as the test pilot for the rocket-powered Bell XS-1, in America’s bid to break the sound barrier. Yeager joined the team at Muroc in July 1947, and, after three unpowered flights, he was at the controls of the XS-1, named Glamorous Glennis, for its first powered flight on August 29, hitting Mach 0.85 after being dropped from the belly of an adapted B-29 bomber. After battling with the little-known effects of turbulence and buffeting from shock-wave compression , Yeager’s eighth flight, on October 10, nearly ended in disaster, after he lost pitch control at Mach 0.997. Following modifications to the tailplane, Yeager was back in the cockpit for his historic supersonic flight of October 14, becoming “The Fastest Man Alive.” Yeager next to the Bell XS-1 that would make him one of the most famed aviators in history. , USAF Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 As an experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, Yeager was at the forefront of a golden age in flight testing and flew nearly all the experimental “X-planes” of the era, including the X-1A, X-3 , X-4 , and X-5 . Just as exotic, however, was a MiG-15 , the preeminent communist-bloc fighter jet of the period, an example of which had been provided by a North Korean defector. Between September and October 1953, Yeager was posted to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, where he and Major Harold Collins completed a thorough evaluation of the Soviet jet, including taking it up to a height of more than 55,000 feet and diving it at its maximum speed of Mach 0.98. The North Korean MiG-15 under armed guard at Kimpo, South Korea, before being transported to Okinawa for testing., U.S. Air Force Bell X-1A As the follow-on to the pioneering X-1, the X-1A pushed the boundaries of speed further still, but test pilot Yeager met some major obstacles on the way. On December 12, 1953, Yeager took the rocket-powered X-1A to a speed of Mach 2.44, before cutting the engine. What Yeager experienced next was the phenomenon known as inertia coupling , which left the X-1A “snapping and rolling and spinning” around all three axes. Yeager was thrown around in the cockpit as the rocket plane dropped more than 50,000 feet but he managed to safely recover at 25,000 feet. Yeager in the X-1A., Public Domain North American F-86H Sabre Yeager was back flying in a frontline capacity when he took command of the 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron in 1954, operating the “Sabre Hog” from Hahn Air Base, in Germany, and then Toul-Rosières Air Base, in France. While Yeager was commander, the squadron switched from an air defense mission to a tactical nuclear tasking. Yeager led the unit to victories in the U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) championships in 1955 and 1956, the squadron being recognized as the best in the command. A rare color photo of F-86Fs of the 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, our of Hahn Air Base, before converting to the more capable “Sabre Hog”., U.S. Air Force North American F-100 Super Sabre Returning to California in 1957, Yeager took command of the 1st Fighter-Day Squadron, flying supersonic F-100 jet fighters at George Air Force Base. This was one of the leading Tactical Air Command (TAC) units and, under Yeager’s command, it pioneered the use of inflight refueling during long-range deployments. In support of this work, Yeager led the squadron on TAC’s first transatlantic jet fighter deployment, bringing its F-100s to Morón Air Base, Spain, in 1958. Yeager in the front seat of a 1st Fighter-Day Squadron F-100F., U.S. Air Force Lockheed NF-104 Starfighter Back at Edwards in 1961, Yeager was appointed deputy director of flight test and soon took over as commander of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School that was focused on preparing U.S. military test pilots for spaceflight. One of the aircraft prepared for the ARPS curriculum was the NF-104 , a Starfighter modified with a 6,000-pound thrust rocket booster and reaction controls and intended to fly in a ballistic arc and provide pilots with experience operating in zero-G conditions. At the controls of the jet on December 10, 1963, Yeager’s NF-104 pitched up at 104,000 feet, before entering a potentially lethal flat spin. After 13 revolutions, spinning “like a record on a turntable,” and after losing more than 90,000 feet, he finally ejected, sustaining serious injuries, but miraculously returning to flight status just six weeks later. Clad in a spacesuit, Yeager signals from the cockpit of an NF-104 in December 1963., U.S. Air Force NASA M2-F1 Yeager became the first USAF pilot, and the third pilot overall, to fly a lifting body, when he took to the air in the bizarre M2-F1, or “Flying Bathtub,” on December 3, 1963. He wanted to see whether the M2-F1 was suitable as a lifting-body trainer for the Aerospace Research Pilots School. In contrast to most of the other experimental planes he flew, the wooden-built M2-F1 was unpowered and intended to research the properties of the wingless lifting-body concept. Later, powered versions would help gather data on re-entry vehicles for future manned spacecraft. Yeager in the pilot’s seat of the M2-F1, together with fellow lifting-body pilots Bruce Peterson, Milt Thompson, and Don Mallick., NASA Martin B-57 In 1966, Yeager returned to a combat theater when he took command of the 405th Fighter Wing headquartered at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. He was responsible for five squadrons and multiple detachments across Southeast Asia, including two tactical bomber squadrons flying B-57s in South Vietnam; a squadron of F-100 fighter-bombers based in Taiwan; a pair of F-102 air defense squadrons at Da Nang, South Vietnam; plus detachments of other types, including F-4s. Yeager’s flying time was mostly dedicated to the B-57 and he eventually logged 127 combat sorties in the type, mainly flying close air support and interdiction missions.

Later that year, Yeager led the unit’s redeployment back to its home base at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, where it achieved its first “Outstanding Unit” award. The scene of so many of his achievements, Edwards was the location of Yeager’s last official active-duty flight with the USAF, when he flew a YF-4E on February 25, 1975 . At the end of this flight, Yeager had recorded 10,131.6 hours in no fewer than 361 different types and models of military aircraft. YF-4E serial number 65-0713 was the aircraft in which Yeager made his final official active-duty Air Force flight., U.S. Air Force Northrop F-20 Tigershark With Northrop aiming to secure customers for its F-20 light-weight multi-role fighter, the company hired Yeager to become a spokesperson for the program, which included him flying and personally endorsing the jet. The legendary pilot was on hand to provide an important public-relations boost on October 14, 1982, when he flew the jet to a speed of Mach 1.45, on the 35th anniversary of his historic first supersonic flight.

Yeager in front of the F-20 Tigershark. , Chuckyeager.org McDonnell Douglas F-15D Eagle The 50th anniversary of Yeager’s milestone flight was marked on October 14, 1997, when the famed aviator returned to Edwards AFB for a supersonic flight in an F-15 Eagle , appropriately named Glamorous Glennis for the occasion. Fifteen years later, Yeager celebrated the 65th anniversary in another Eagle, this flying as a passenger in an F-15D of the 65th Aggressor Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada. Yeager in front of the F-15D that he flew in to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his monumental achievement. , USAF North American AT-6 Texan Yeager’s passion for flying never diminished and he inspired countless young aviators to follow his path. He took an active role in promoting military flying, too, and is seen here at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 2003, providing a flight experience to 12-year-old Danielle Orcutt, an elementary school student who had won an essay-writing competition. The aircraft is a World War II-era AT-6 Texan, of the type that many of Yeager’s contemporaries would have learned to fly on. U.S. Air Force/Carl Bergquist In a field in which there was no shortage of colorful, robust individuals, Yeager was in a different category to most of his pilot counterparts on account of his record-breaking exploits, which made him a household name. It’s hard to imagine a time when a test pilot might again win such fame and admiration from the public at large but, if they do, they will be following in the trailblazing spirit of the one-of-a-kind Chuck Yeager.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Apr 21, 2021",Here’s What’s In New Guidelines For Defending Infrastructure Against Drone Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, recently published a report titled “Protecting Against the Threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).” The report comes nearly a year after a string of bizarre “mystery drone” sightings across the American Midwest which remain unexplained to this day. While it does not mention any specific incidents, this new CISA report provides an overview of the growing UAS threat and offers vulnerability assessments and recommendations on how critical infrastructure can be defended against unmanned threats from above. Unlike many discussions of counter-UAS (C-UAS) approaches, the document does not describe any technologies or methods for jamming or disabling drones, but instead focuses on ways to mitigate the risk of drone attacks without specialized equipment. Recent incidents, such as last year’s mysterious drone incursions over the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona, underscore just how serious this threat can be and why security forces at sensitive sites need to take heed. Aside from identifying and protecting against cybersecurity threats, CISA is tasked with “security and resilience efforts using trusted partnerships across the private and public sectors,” and delivers “technical assistance and assessments to federal stakeholders as well as to infrastructure owners and operators nationwide.” One of CISA’s duties is to assess threat capabilities and security gaps through examining emerging technologies both in the near term and long term. In the document’s introduction, Daryle Hernandez, Director the CISA-led Interagency Security Committee , writes that “Although most agencies do not have the authority to disable, disrupt, or seize control of an unmanned aircraft, there are other effective risk reduction measures they may implement.” Aside from offering a list of potential counter-UAS technologies that could be used to defend against UAS threats, the document provides guidance to security professionals responsible for “facilities in the United States occupied by federal employees for non-military activities.” An image from the CISA report outlining common drone configurations., CISA While the report notes that many UAS threat events are accidental, it also states that potential adversaries can employ UAS for hostile surveillance, smuggling operations, disrupting governmental operations, or even weaponization. Small munitions or explosives have been employed in drone attacks in recent years, as have suicide drones , and the chance that a UAV attack could include the deployment of biological or chemical agents, even on a small scale, remains a terrifying possibility. One sign of the changing realities in regards to the threat posed by drones occurred in October 2020, when the U.S. State Department issued a warning and reactionary guidance to U.S. personnel in Riyadh about potentially imminent drone attacks. “When considering the likelihood of an adversary using UAS, it is important to consider both the intent and the capability of the adversary, including their desired effect,” the report notes. To that end, CISA recommends facilities conduct site-specific UAS vulnerability assessments to identify what likely target points may be, which critical assets might be targeted first, and how geographical boundaries or terrain features might be used for likely launch or operating points. The report even recommends that facilities become familiar with “nearby UAS clubs” and their associated Launch, Land, and Operate (LLO) sites. CISA The document addresses the need for sites to be aware that VIPs or crowds can be specific targets of drone attacks, a concern illustrated by last year’s apparent attempted drone assassination of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. The report also identifies specific infrastructure that could be targeted specifically by UAS such as HVAC systems, antennas, and cyber infrastructure. CISA even writes that “sensitive proceedings such as federal trials” could be likely targets of UAS attacks, as could any other special events where people are gathered. CISA In addition, the report recommends assessing threats based on historical reports of UAV flights near facilities and how the capabilities of existing UAS platforms (such as payload capacities, flight times, speeds, and ranges) should be considered when planning a UAS protection plan. A wide variety of scenarios using various types of UAS are presented along with the capability level various “threat actors” would require to obtain to carry out those scenarios. Off-the-shelf, small multi-copters with first-person view are among the lowest capability levels presented, but these small, inexpensive drones could still be used in surveillance roles and even attacks. This mirrors what we have seen on overseas battlefields and even with the adaptation of specific types of drones that are now being produced formally as weapons . CISA Once assessments are completed, the CISA report offers a variety of strategies that facilities can employ in an attempt to mitigate the UAS threat. As the report notes, “many protective measures designed to mitigate the risks from other threat vectors can also help mitigate the UAS risk. For instance, measures designed to mitigate hostile surveillance, unauthorized access, ballistic attack, and explosive attack will also help to mitigate UAS-specific threats.” These can be as simple as placing signs near sensitive sites, or as complicated as installing specialized netting over sensitive areas. Some of the strategies the UAS report mentions include: Posting “No Drone” signage at facilities and potential LLO sites Publishing “deterrent communications” on social media and public websites Implementing Temporary Flight Restrictions or Special Security Instructions Increasing workforce awareness of UAS Checking facilities for UAS or items delivered by a UAS Concealing or disguising assets including using non-transparent screens, exterior foliage, and covering any exterior screens Using privacy films and blinds at a minimum 45-degree angle Reconfiguring rooms to reduce surveillance vulnerabilities Relocating important assets as far away from perimeters as possible Using nets or grilles as physical barriers around important assets CISA CISA included an infographic in their guidelines that instructs personnel on how to recognize if a drone may have been specifically modified or tampered with for use in attacks. The authors write that visible wiring, concealed or missing lights, or the presence of tape or additional batteries are all warning signs of suspicious UAS activity, as are repeated incursions or prolonged low-altitude hovering. CISA Finally, the report recommends that federal agencies coordinate with local law enforcement to request counter-UAS capabilities through the DHS interagency Request for Assistance Process, and ensure that personnel develop and exercise UAS response plans. In the event there is a UAS incident, CISA offers an infographic on what personnel can do in the aftermath to ensure they do not destroy evidence or harm themselves. CISA The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. has previously published UAS fact sheets for local law enforcement agencies and critical infrastructure sites, but the depth and breadth of recommendations in the new report underscore just how pressing the UAS threat is becoming. “The ISC details the threat of adversarial use of UAS as an increasing concern in The Design-Basis Threat (DBT) Report,” the document also says. This latter point about drones being a growing concern with regards to the assessment of Design-Basis Threats , which are “a profile of the type, composition, and capabilities of an adversary” and are “a basis for designing safeguards systems,” is particularly notable. In 2019, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, another agency that is part of the ISC, issued a controversial decision not to require owners of nuclear power plants, such as Palo Verde, and waste storage facilities to defend against drones. This was based in part on the fact that “[NRC] staff has determined that information gained from UAV video surveillance of an NRC-licensed facility is bounded by the type of information that could be provided by the knowledgeable insider currently permitted in the DBTs.” This new CISA report takes a distinctly opposing viewpoint to the potential threat posed to critical infrastructure by drones. As unmanned aerial systems become more capable and available, the possibility of rogue operators, terrorist groups, or criminal actors causing immense damage or disruption is growing. Assassination by drone is already a major issue in some areas of the world, and 2019’s drone attacks on Saudi oil fields show just how dangerous and disruptive these types of attacks can be. Even some of America’s most sensitive and critical defensive sites like the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) installations in Guam have had their share of drone incursions in recent years, but luckily, none has resulted in damage. So far, neither UAS defenses nor law enforcement protocols have caught up with the rapid expansion in drone availability and capability. As our investigation into the “mystery drones” of Colorado and Nebraska showed, even the highest federal government agencies tasked with regulating America’s skies have a difficult time investigating, and even quantifying, let alone responding to reported drone activity . Hopefully, it won’t take a major drone attack on U.S. soil for policymakers to recognize and respond to the rapidly evolving threat accordingly.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 22, 2020",These Bizarre Infrared Pods Put Missile Seekers And Countermeasures To The Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to military aviation, infrared signatures , and being able to accurately measure them, are extremely important. This is especially true when it comes to developing new infrared seekers for missiles and other infrared sensors , as well as countermeasures to those threats. While a certain amount of testing can be done to support these kinds of efforts using ground-based signature measurement systems and development installations, some of which are incredibly complex , there is also a major need to be able to perform this kind of work in the air. For this purpose, the branches of the U.S. military employ a variety of very unusual-looking, obscure, and highly-specialized pods that carry mixtures of infrared seekers, cameras, and other sensors. These systems can look as much like a mechanized bug’s eye as a piece of high-end test equipment. At the time of writing, U.S. Navy’s Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) maintains two podded systems, the Airborne Turret Infrared Measurement System III (ATIMS III) and the Threat Infrared Generic Emulation Radiometer (TIGER). The U.S. Air Force’s 96th Test Wing has at least four more podded systems that support aerial infrared testing, the Beam Approach Seeker Evaluation System (BASES), the Calibrated IR/visible/UV Ground and Airborne Radiometric Spectrometer (CIGARS), the Supersonic Airborne Tri-Gimbal Infrared System (SATIRS), and the Spectral/Spatial Airborne Radiometric Infrared System (SARIS). All three of these are primarily intended for use on high-performance tactical aircraft, such as Navy F/A-18 Hornets and Air Force F-15 Eagles . The U.S. Army also employs additional systems designed to be mounted on helicopters for this kind of aerial infrared signature measurement work. ATMIS III is the latest generation of a system that dates back to at least the 1970s. At that time, the main platform configured to carry it was the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior , which was originally designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a carrier-based bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Variants subsequently went on to serve as tankers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, as well as in various test and evaluation roles. An NRA-3B Skywarrior, a heavily modified RA-3B reconnaissance variant reconfigured to support test and evaluation activities, at Point Mugu Naval Air Station in California in 1982., USN In a 1975 master’s thesis from the California State University at Northridge, Michael Edward Laub, then also an employee at the Navy’s Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC), explained the procedure for a typical sortie involving an ATIMS-equipped A-3 in the context of a test he had participated in involving an F-4 Phantom fighter jet fitted with a Countermeasures Airborne Infrared III (CAIR III) infrared jammer: The ATIMS system requires two operators (See Figure 5). Initially the acquisition operator locates the target. In this case the target was the CAIR III configured aircraft. The acquisition operator follows the target until the tracking operators [sic] takes over. The tracking operator follows the target with much more precision than the acquisition operator. This precision is required in order to make the IR measurements. The acquisition and tracking operators both view the IR target from their own video monitor. When the tracking mirror is aligned properly, the image of the target is reflected onto a beam splitter. A visible signal is directed to a TV camera and the output from this camera supplies the video required by the acquisition and tracking operators. Visible information is also directed to the lens of a film camera. The IR signal is directed to a radiometer spectrometer. To collect data, the IR target is acquired and tracked by the two operators. When IR recordings are desired, the film camera and 14-track recorder are simultaneously activated. Timing information is fed to and recorded by the film camera and 14-track recorder. This is so that the visible IR records can be correlated during data reduction. CSU Northridge This certainly got the job done, but it was also a relatively large and cumbersome arrangement, as evidenced by the need for two separate operators. The individuals tasked with analyzing the information it gathered also had to manually match the infrared data with the processed images from the wet film cameras. In addition, Laub’s thesis notes that a different plane had to carry a Special Instrumentation Pod (SIP) with more cameras and recording equipment, as well as an infrared seeker, to collect additional data regarding how the output from the CAIR III jammer might directly impact the guidance system in a heat-seeking missile. CSU Northridge CSU Northridge As such, the Navy subsequently acquired a podded system, the ATIMS II, that a tactical jet, such as an F-4 Phantom, could carry. The ATIMS II pod had an articulating turret with the various cameras and sensors installed that a single operator could point at the desired target. In addition, the system offered greater overall flexibility, as it could be installed and removed from an aircraft much more readily than the original ATIMS equipment on an A-3. A low-quality scan of a picture showing an F-4J Phantom belonging to the Pacific Missile Test Center carrying the ATIMS II pod., USN via eBay In the 1980s, the Navy acquired ATIMS III. The actual pod for this generation of the system has also been referred to as the Airborne Infrared Countermeasure Evaluation System (AICES). This system is still in use and is much more capable than its predecessors. The sensor turret that the pod carries can hold up to four different infrared seeker types at once. It’s also equipped with one middle wavelength infrared (MWIR) imager and three visual spectrum video cameras, as well as a laser rangefinder. An annotated composite image providing a breakdown of the different systems in the ATIMS III pod’s turret. The larger image shows a US Air Force F-15D carrying the pod and flying alongside a Navy F/A-18 Hornet firing decoy flares., USN ATIMS III can be carried on a pylon with the turret facing forward or backward, allowing it to best cover the desired aspect range on a target aircraft during a particular test. It is also a highly modular and adaptable design that can gather much more extensive data on a target’s infrared signature and how countermeasures, such as infrared jammers or decoy flares, might affect different seeker types. It can be used to test how well new kinds of infrared seekers or sensors spot and track potential targets and how they are impacted by different atmospheric conditions, as well. It’s unclear what the exact data recording system was on the original ATIMS III design, but by this point, it is entirely digital. In 2010, Ampex Data Systems Corporation announced it would “provide a set of four miniR 700 solid-state recorder systems to capture the full spectrum of infrared data measured by the pod” as part of an upgrade program for AICES. The company’s press release at the time also indicated that ATIMS III could push at least some of the collected data straight to individuals on the ground via data-link. Though ATIMS III remains a Navy program, it is most often seen mounted on Air Force F-15D aircraft. Though we don’t know for sure, this likely has to do with the size and weight of the pod. Eagles have been routinely employed over the years to carry out-sized payloads, both operationally and in support of various tests. It’s worth noting that NASA also maintains a small fleet of F-15s that often carry large test pods , including some of the pods mentioned in this piece, as well as other large or unusually shaped test fixtures. When it comes to ATIMS III, the Navy and the Air Force also utilize this pod in support of U.S. allies, including members of NATO, to help with their test and evaluation requirements regarding infrared countermeasures. The other pod that the Navy maintains for aerial infrared testing purposes is TIGER. Unlike ATIMS III, this system is designed for more general aerial infrared signature measurement of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as decoy flares. An annotated composite image providing a breakdown of the different systems in the TIGER pod’s turret. The background image shows it under the wing of a US Navy F/A-18 Hornet., USN While ATIMS III only has one MWIR imager, TIGER carries three MWIR cameras, as well as a long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) one. It also has a separate infrared tracking camera and an MWIR spectrometer, along with three visual spectrum video cameras and a laser rangefinder. The addition of the spectrometer means that TIGER can not only gather data about the infrared signiture of the aircraft or flare being recorded, but also how the infrared radiation from those test subjects interacts with the surrounding environment. This enables the pod to gather data on how hot an object is, temperature-wise, as well information about how that heat is distributed across it and how the resulting infrared signature might fluctuate under different environmental conditions and at extended distances. TIGER is most commonly seen carried by Navy F/A-18 Hornets, but there are also pictures of Air Force and NASA F-15Ds carrying it. As with ATIMS III, this pod can also be carried with the turret end forward or backward, providing the best possible coverage during the test sortie at hand. An F/A-18 Hornet belonging to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30) carrying a TIGER pod., USN In 2003, photographer Brian Lockett, who runs a website called the Goleta Air And Space Museum , caught one Air Force F-15D flying out of Edwards Air Force Base in California carrying both the TIGER and ATIMS III pods simultaneously. He was kind enough to share some of these pictures with us for this piece. An aircraft hauling both of these pods at once would be able to gather a wide array of infrared data in a single sortie. The F-15D seen in 2003 carrying TIGER under its right wing and ATIMS III under its left wing. Another tubular test fixture, likely housing an infrared seeker, is also seen attached to one of the missile rails on the side of the pylon holding the ATIMS III pod. , Brian Lockett/Goleta Air And Space Museum Brian Lockett/Goleta Air And Space Museum Readily available details about the Air Force’s BASES, CIGARS, and SATIRS are limited, but their general capabilities sound very similar to those of ATIMS III and TIGER. A company called Southern Research developed both BASES and SATIRS and its website says that it “has a well-established history in the development of airborne pods that began with a development effort for an Infrared (IR) signature measurement pod for the U.S. Air Force at Eglin Air Force Base in 1972.” This would have been the same general era as the original ATIMS system. “Originally designed as a fixed-pointing pod to carry Infrared seekers being tested, this pod evolved into a significantly more complex system featuring multiple imaging sensors and a steerable turret,” Southern Research’s site continues. “As seeker and sensor technology improved, SR worked in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force in developing several variants of this pod with upgraded sensors and improved multi-axis turrets.” An infrared image of an F-16 as viewed through SATIRS, via DSIAC In 2012, the Air Force announced plans to upgrade SATIRS, and the FLIR SC6000 infrared cameras within, “to provide improved resolution for imaging targets.”  This would be done “by developing custom lenses that are compatible with the SC6000 and the SATIRS,” according to the contracting notice . More is known about the SARIS pod, which is similar in some respects to TIGER, but is focused much more on infrared spectroscopy. “The core of SARIS is its imaging spectrometer,” a 2006 article in ABB Review explains. “An imaging spectrometer is an optical instrument that captures the radiation from the target and constructs images of that target at different wavelengths. The information is gathered in the form of a ‘cube’ of data.” An F-15D carrying the SARIS pod., via ABB a closer look at the turret on the SARIS pod., via ABB A schematic of the internal layout of the SARIS pod., ABB “The data from the imaging spectrometer allows scientists to determine the distribution of various chemicals over the target,” the article adds. “Combined with imaging capability, the technology makes rapid temperature mapping possible. Military applications of this include the automated recognition and tracking of heat-emitting objects such as aircraft, missiles, decoys, and even ground targets.” ABB SARIS is also primarily carried by Air Force F-15Ds, but the service can also mount it on its UH-1N helicopters to support lower-speed subjects. The ABB Review piece states that the system can be mounted on ground-based test fixtures, too. The composite image below shows various testing systems available through the Air Force’s Portable Seeker/Sensor/Signature Evaluation Facility (PSSSEF). The SARIS pod is seen at the upper right corner on an F-15D, as well as mounted in the main cabin of a UH-1N helicopter at the bottom right. The shots in the center interestingly show infrared images taken of a Soviet-era Scud ballistic missile transporter-erector-launcher and a fighter jet of some kind. USAF UH-1Ns assigned to the US Air Force’s 413th Flight Test Squadron, part of the 96th Test Wing., USAF That same need to gather various kinds of data during lower-speed test and evaluation activities is why the Army has a number of other turreted systems that can be installed on its helicopters, including variants of the UH-60 Black Hawk . This includes the Airborne Radiometric Measurement System (ARMS), which Southern Research , in cooperation with Dynetics, delivered to the U.S. Army’s Aviation Applied Technical Directorate. The Airborne Radiometric Measurement System installed on a UH-60 helicopter., Southern Research The company’s website says that the initial payload for this turreted system was six different unspecified sensors. However, it is a modular design intended “to carry multiple payloads” and be “easily reconfigurable.” This could certainly include various kinds of infrared seekers and sensors to help gather data similar to the kinds that the ATIMS III, TIGER, and SARIS pods collect. Southern Research had previously supplied the Army with the Stabilized Electro-optical Airborne Instrumentation Platform (SEAIP), another turret capable of being mounted on UH-1 and UH-60 helicopters and fitted with various instruments and sensors for test and evaluation purposes. The stabilized turret “allows for testing of state-of-the-art active and passive sensors. (i.e. scanners, focal plane arrays, spectrometers, radar, etc.),” according to the company’s website . The Stabilized Electro-optical Airborne Instrumentation Platform turret installed on a UH-1 helicopter., Southern Research The importance of these systems, and the infrared data they collect, is only likely to grow in the near future. Most notably, the proliferation of low observable (stealthy) aircraft and cruise missiles has expanded abroad and the development of these systems has ramped-up considerably in the United States, as well. Fully understanding the infrared signatures of these systems is absolutely critical. The introduction of next-generation infrared search and track (IRST) capabilities as an alternative and supplemented means to radar for detecting aerial targets, especially stealthy ones, at extended ranges has also become a reality for U.S. fighter aircraft. This is a topic that The War Zone has been following closely . Foreign fighters have had this capability for decades. Without knowing the infrared signature of your own aircraft you can’t understand what threat these sensors pose or how to evaluate your own IRST systems properly. Su-27UB with its infrared search and track system mounted in front of the windscreen., Boevaya Mashina/Wikicommons In a similar vein, multi-mode seekers with imaging infrared capabilities are increasingly becoming an attractive option for air-to-air weapons , as well as air-to-surface/ground types . These require testing and evaluation work to develop, understand, and counter. Presumably, pods like ATIMS III are capable of carrying seekers that mimic those found on enemy missiles, or even real seekers that have been captured or obtained via other means, providing extremely high-value intelligence on the performance and vulnerabilities of those systems. For instance, it would be critical to test infrared seekers from weapons like Russia’s R-73 and R-27 air-to-air missiles against friendly aircraft and their existing countermeasures in a real-world airborne environment. Evaluating China’s rapidly growing missile inventory in a similar manner is perhaps an even more pressing priority. Understanding the unique threat these missiles pose to allied aircraft from all directions and under all conditions is absolutely essential and will spur new countermeasures that might be able to blind, confuse, or otherwise disrupt modern infrared or even multi-mode seeker-equipped guided weapons. Conversely, testing your own missile seekers against various countermeasures and in every possible combat condition is also absolutely critical. Some of these pods, especially ATIMS III, would allow that to happen more reliably and in fewer flight testing hours. Some of the technology employed in these podded test systems may also have potential operational applications. As the 2006 ABB Review article noted, SARIS is capable of “automated recognition and tracking” of targets based on their infrared signature. This highlights how, with a suitable library of known signatures, advanced IRST and other infrared systems can passively scan for threats and then spot and categorize them automatically. It could then quickly pass that information along to an aircraft’s pilot or to other nodes in an integrated sensor network, in the air, at sea, or on the ground. This capability is an operational reality today and autonomous target recognition is the driving force behind missiles that use imaging infrared seekers to identify and strike their targets. Above all else, this obscure family of pods is part of an expansive, but shy weapons development and testing ecosystem that is dedicated to signature management and evaluation. While the radar side of this enterprise is far better known , the infrared component is quite expansive, as well. From massive sound-stage like laboratories to ranges where aircraft slide across high-wires to flying radar cross-section and infrared signature evaluation aircraft , this mass of unique testing capabilities is critical to not only understanding and developing America’s own aircraft and weapons, but to defeat those of the enemy. A CV-22 Osprey dumps flares during a test flight from Edwards AFB. The type has one of the most advanced infrared countermeasures suites in the world. , USAF Data collected during these efforts is used for everything from programming an AIM-9X Sidewinder where to hit a specific target at its most vulnerable point to creating combat aircraft with extremely low infrared signatures to better understanding what the risk of detection from various threat systems is when viewing a target from virtually every aspect. These pods, in particular, allow for this testing in real-world conditions across any atmospheric situation, a function that can’t really be replicated in a laboratory. For instance, maybe a certain missile seeker type is prone to a certain type of decoy under certain environmental and backdrop conditions, but not others. Or maybe an infrared attenuating coating on a stealthy aircraft makes it harder to detect at certain wavelengths from below, but not above during different times of the day. Then again, understanding how thermal loads propagate on an airframe flying at high speed may be another test goal. Even understanding the basic infrared signature of an aircraft across multiple infrared wavelengths may be important for creating a database of signatures for infrared search and track systems to pull from. These pods help solve these problems and questions and more. In the end, it is hard to protect an aircraft from hostile sensors without knowing exactly what their vulnerabilities are. It’s also hard to develop a missile seeker and its command logic without flying it and testing it while collecting a number of other supporting data points via multiple sensors all staring at the same thing. And being able to do all this and more while flying through the air in virtually any conditions is the testing magic these pods truly offer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 5, 2021",These Three Companies Will Build Drones To Carry The Air Force’s “Skyborg” AI Computer Brain,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force says it has hired Boeing, General Atomics, and Kratos to build prototype “loyal wingman” type drones to carry systems developed under the Skyborg program . Through Skyborg, which you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s previous reporting on this topic , the service is seeking to acquire a suite of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities that will able to control loyal wingmen, as well as fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles, or UCAVs. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) announced it had awarded the trio of contracts on Dec. 7, 2020.  The deals for Boeing, General Atomics, and Kratos are valued at $25,748,180, $14,317,933, and $37,771,577, respectively. Each one covers a 24-month-long period of performance. All three companies were among the more than a dozen firms that have already received contracts to develop other components for Skyborg. “This award is a major step forward for our game-changing Skyborg capability – this award supporting our operational experimentation is truly where concepts become realities,” Air Force Brigadier General Dale White, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Fighters and Advanced Aircraft, said in a statement. “We will experiment to prove out this technology and to do that we will aggressively test and fly to get this capability into the hands of our warfighters.” “The value in this close partnership between AFRL and AFLCMC is becoming clear,” Air Force Brigadier General Heather Pringle, head of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), added. “When we field proven technology faster it gives our warfighters the edge they need to win the day.” Generals White and Pringle together serve as the program leadership for Skyborg. No details have been provided so far about the unmanned aircraft designs the three companies are now set to deliver to the Air Force to support the Skyborg tests. AFLCMC did describe them as “missionized prototypes with the ability to fly in experimentation events while teaming with manned aircraft.” Boeing’s offering may well be related in some way to the loyal wingman-type design its Australian division is developing for the Royal Australian Air Force as part of that country’s Airpower Teaming System (ATS) program. You can read more about that drone, a prototype of which is getting close to taking its first flight, in this past War Zone piece . Boeing’s Airpower Teaming System (ATS) drone., Boeing Just last week, Boeing also announced that it had conducted a semi-autonomous test involving five small jet-powered drones flying networked together in support of the ATS program. Boeing has been using these lower-end surrogates to help develop and mature technologies for ATS since 2019. Last week, General Atomics also revealed that it had conducted a semi-autonomous test involving one of its stealthy Avenger drones conducting a mock air-to-air mission together with five other simulated drones. In its press release, the company said that in this test the Avenger acted as “the flight surrogate for the Skyborg capability set.” It’s not clear if this means the firm submitted a version of this unmanned aircraft, also known as Predator C, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , as its proposed platform for the future Skyborg tests. A clean sheet design may be more likely considering the competition. A General Atomics Avenger., GA-ASI It seems very likely that Kratos will supply examples of its XQ-58 Valkyrie drone , or variants or derivatives thereof, to the Air Force under this new contract. The Air Force has already been using its existing XQ-58 in various tests to lay the groundwork for future loyal wingmen and other advanced drone developments, including the Skyborg program. The Air Force says it expects all three companies to deliver an initial batch of prototypes no later than May 2021. The first round of flight testing is scheduled to begin in July of next year. The service’s stated plan has been to have an operational loyal wingman-type drone using the Skyborg systems flying by 2023. No matter what designs end up taking part in those tests and subsequent experimentation, that the Air Force is moving ahead with acquiring physical prototypes to test the Skyborg systems is an exciting development for this program, which already promises to have a significant impact on the future of aerial combat.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2020",The Air Force’s Brand New HH-60W Rescue Helicopters Already Need Major Upgrades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force only received its first two HH-60W Jolly Green IIs in November, but the service is already looking to upgrade its newest combat rescue helicopters. Many of the proposed additions are already found on helicopters and other platforms across the U.S. military and the service says that the Jolly Green IIs need at least one of the desired improvements to be able to effectively carry out their core combat search and rescue mission set at all. A major reason that these helicopters lack this and many of the other desired capabilities is that they are being built to requirements the Air Force laid out nearly a decade ago. The Combat Rescue Helicopter Division of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Helicopter Program Office first announced on Oct. 1, 2020, that it was looking for companies to make various improvements to the HH-60W, as well as provide other upgrades, including to training simulators, and services in support of those helicopters. The Air Force’s 347th Rescue Group, part of the 23rd Wing at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, took delivery of the first two HH-60Ws, out of a planned order of 113, on Nov. 5. The Jolly Green IIs are set to replace the service’s existing HH-60G Pave Hawks , which first entered service in the 1980s and are becoming increasingly more difficult to operate and maintain . “This SSS [sources sought solicitation] will gather information on the current experience and capabilities of prospective industry sources to address CRH capability upgrades,” the contracting notices explained. Though the Air Force has no firm plans to pursue any specific upgrades, proposals it receives “could be addressed under a five-to-ten year capability upgrade contract” in the future. The notice includes 17 prospective “candidates” for upgrades to the HH-60W and associated items, which are seen below. USAF The very first item noted is a desire to add a Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure System, or DAIRCM, developed for the Navy to the HH-60W. This is most likely the AN/AAQ-45 , which uses multiple electro-optical and infrared sensors positioned around a helicopter to spot and track incoming missiles, and then uses a laser to blind and confuse infrared-guided seekers on many of those weapons, throwing them off course. The system also has the ability to detect other kinds of incoming missiles from the heat signature of their rocket motors, as well as alert the crew that their helicopter is being painted by an enemy laser or targeted by small arms, larger automatic cannons, or other fire from the ground . A breakdown of the components of the AN/AAQ-45 Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure System., DOD Leonardo DRS Inc., the American subsidiary of Italian defense contractor Leonardo, has been working on this system for the Navy since at least 2016 and it has already been fielded on some of that service’s helicopters, as well as others belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, and Army, on a limited basis in response to an earlier Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS). In July, Naval Air Systems Command awarded Leonardo DRS a contract worth up to $120 million to continue developing this system and making improvements. It’s worth noting that, while the AN/AAQ-45, is a relatively recent development for the U.S. military, other such directional infrared countermeasures systems have been in service for decades now, including on helicopters across the services. Marine VH-60Ns have long had this capability and the Army , as well as the Navy, have been working to add similar countermeasures to various H-60 variants , as well as other helicopters , for years now. Some HH-60Gs, which the HH-60W will supplant, are now among those already flying with the AN/AAQ-45 installed, as well. This contracting notice from October also indicates that the HH-60Ws lack an electronic warfare jammer that could be used against enemy radars. This, together with the absence of the AN/AAQ-45, seems particularly notable for a helicopter that is ostensibly intended to operate in contested environments. The desired ability to overlay tactical symbology on the electro-optical and infrared video feeds from the Jolly Green IIs nose-mounted sensor turret is another capability that the existing Pave Hawks have now, according to this contracting notice. It is a “functionality required for effective HH-60W Combat Search and Rescue operations,” according to the service, as well. Other capabilities the Air Force says it wants to add to the HH-60W are already found on platforms across the U.S. military, including other helicopters, some of which are also variants of the H-60 family, as well. The Army, which manages the Blue Force Tracker (BFT) program, was well in the process of fielding the improved BFT 2 system in 2011. BFT 2, like its predecessor, is a networked system that allows equipped units to rapidly discern each other’s positions, as well as mark objectives, possible locations of enemy units or other hazards, and objects of interest on a common map, greatly improving overall situational awareness. A sample of the kind of interactive map display showing the positions of friendly and hostile forces, as well as neutral objects of interest and waypoints, that BFT 2 provides., USAF It’s not clear what level of Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) capability the Air Force might want for the HH-60W, but again, this is a capability that the Army, in particular, has already been working on for various helicopters , including H-60 variants, for some time now. It is worth mentioning, of course, that the systems that exist now, generally offer a relatively limited “soda straw” view in only one direction at a time and there are projects in development now that will offer significantly improved visibility in various environmental conditions and at night. Still, having some DVE capability now would be better than none for HH-60W crews, who will be expected to regularly fly after dark where the dangers from overhead power lines and other hazards are even more pronounced. Such a system would also help improve situational awareness in conditions where a landing zone, or parts of the route there, may be obscured by smoke, dust, or other clouds of debris, including those kicked up by the helicopter’s own rotor wash. It’s also interesting to note that the HH-60W apparently lacks the ability to receive video feeds from off-board platforms or transmit the streams from its sensor turrets to personnel on the ground. The ability to exchange this kind of information can be immensely valuable for coordinating with teams down below during missions. In terms of pushing video to ground units, at least, this is a capability that has been available to at least some degree for nearly two decades now through successive versions of the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) system. The Air Force says that the absence of these and other capabilities on the HH-60W are in large part due to the fact that the requirements for the Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) program were firmed up in 2012. “The CRH requirements were baselined in 2012 prior to contract award of its Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase,” the October contracting notice noted. “The current system specification reflects the 2012 requirements baseline,” it continued. “During EMD execution, this requirements baseline has continued to evolve—driving the need for planning in support of a new contract vehicle to address a broad spectrum of known and undefined operational capabilities.” An HH-60W seen through holes in a target during ground-based testing of its machine gun armament., USAF It’s certainly fair to say that at a certain point in the development of any aircraft or other piece of military hardware, requirements have to get nailed down, just as a matter of practicality. Otherwise, constantly evolving realities could easily prompt new requirements that would in turn force design changes that would most likely lead to schedule delays and cost growth. The Air Force was clearly determined to avoid any unnecessary hiccups with the CRH program, which was the last in a string of efforts dating back to 2000 to replace, or at least supplement , the aging HH-60G fleet, a saga you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Some of the desired improvements listed in the October contracting notice, as well as associated developments, are newer emerging requirements or concerns. For example, the importance of GPS receivers that are jam and spoof resistant has significantly grown in recent years . The U.S. military, as a whole, is also increasingly becoming concerned about the general obsolescence of various kinds of components, in general, and the difficulties and costs associated with acquiring replacement stocks as time goes on. This applies, in some ways, to the software licenses question, as well. Matters of intellectual property rights to the computer code that increasingly runs advanced aircraft and other weapon systems has become a more common point of dispute between the Pentagon and defense contractors, especially Lockheed Martin , now the parent company of Sikorsky, which makes the HH-60W. At the same time, as already noted, many of these upgrades the Air Force is eyeing for the HH-60Ws were available in 2012, at least in some form, or were already planned for the HH-60Gs. In addition, when it comes to advanced versions of ROVER and BFT 2, the Air Force has been looking to add those capabilities to the Pave Hawks for years now , as well. Just in August, the service issued a notice announcing its intention to buy ROVER VI and BFT 2 systems for existing HH-60Gs, which are still expected to continue flying for some time until sufficient numbers of HH-60Ws enter service. An HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF The October contracting notice also highlights the need for fixes to deficiencies found during developmental and operational testing that appear to have gone unresolved, despite the Air Force now beginning to receive its first HH-60Ws. “Qualification testing of many components of the aircraft has uncovered technical deficiencies. As a result, the program began flight test with a large number of CRH-specific systems in non-operationally representative configurations,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation said in its report covering testing and evaluation of major weapon systems in the 2019 Fiscal Year. That report did say that some improvements had been made to various key survivability features, including cabin and cockpit armor packages and self-sealing fuel hoses in the aerial refueling probe, but indicated some other issues remained. “Poorly designed hover symbology does not provide necessary safety-of-flight cues in degraded visual environments” and “Qualification testing of the fuel cell caused substantial hydrodynamic ram damage to the test article, necessitating repairs and analysis of system impact prior to continued testing.” There is a “contractual specification to meet the reliability requirement roughly 2 years after IOT&E [initial operational test and evaluation], but the projected reliability during IOT&E may not meet the requirement,” the report added, regarding the general reliability of the helicopter. “The Program Office has modified the acceptance criteria to allow some fuel cell leakage to be considered a pass of the specification.” It’s not immediately clear what of these remaining issues may have been further rectified in the 2020 Fiscal Year. The October 2020 contracting notice makes clear that at least some deficiencies with the HH-60W identified in earlier tests are still unresolved. An HH-60W undergoing testing in an anechoic chamber., USAF All of this can only raise questions about the exact operational utility of the HH-60Ws that are entering service now. It’s unclear when the Air Force expects to declare initial operational capability (IOC) with the type. As of 2018, the goal was to have done so by September of this year, but that did not turn out to be the case, with the service only taking delivery of the first two examples two months later. The immediate need for all of these upgrades to the HH-60W also distorts the true cost of each one of these helicopters, no matter how much baselining the requirements back in 2012 may have helped control costs. It seems hard to believe that the Air Force was unaware from the beginning that it would need at least some amount of additional funding after the first helicopters arrived to ensure that the entire fleet was truly capable of performing their intended missions. There has already been discussion, including here at The War Zone , about how capable a traditional helicopter, such as the HH-60W, will be in any future combat search and rescue scenario, especially against a higher-end opponent with a more robust integrated air defense network. If those threats demand the employment of stealthy combat aircraft, which are themselves not entirely immune to them , one would imagine they represent an even more significant danger to a very non-stealthy helicopter. With this in mind, the Air Force has already begun to explore more novel means of recovering downed pilots and other personnel, including from within denied areas. There’s no denying that the Air Force’s HH-60G fleet is in need of replacement. It remains to be seen, however, how long and how much additional funding it will take for the HH-60W, which lacks many important capabilities in its present form, including some that the older Pave Hawks have, to reach its full potential.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 17, 2020",Thieves Broke Into Russia’s Il-80 Doomsday Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what seems like a remarkable breach of security, unknown thieves have helped themselves to equipment from inside one of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ rare Il-80 Maxdome “doomsday aircraft.” The converted airliner, which plays a role analogous to the U.S. Air Force’s E-4B , as a strategic airborne command post in time of nuclear conflict, was at an airfield in southwest Russia when the caper took place. While it is not clear exactly when the raid was carried out, the incident was reported today by Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti . According to their story , the Il-80 was undergoing maintenance when “unknown persons opened the cargo hatch” and stole what is described as “radio equipment.” The fact the aircraft was receiving maintenance, and that this was taking place at an airfield in the Rostov region, points to the incident having occurred at the facility of the Beriev company at Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov. As well as being an aircraft design bureau and manufacturer, specializing in amphibious aircraft, Beriev is responsible for outfitting and upgrading equipment in several different special mission aircraft operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Furthermore, the RIA Novosti report mentions that the police have spoken to a representative from the Beriev company, according to an unnamed official from the transport department of Russia’s Interior Ministry in the North Caucasian Federal District, in which Taganrog is located. The spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed that an investigation is now underway. An Il-80 at Chkalovsky Air Base. Note the aerial refueling probe on the port side of the forward fuselage for long-duration sorties., Alexander Shukhov/Wikimedia Commons The Maxdome fleet is normally based at Chkalovsky, near Moscow, alongside Il-82 communications relay aircraft. Here, they are assigned to a specialist airborne command post unit that’s subordinated to the National Defence Management Center of Russia’s General Staff. Four examples of the Il-80 are in service. In the event of a full-scale war, the Il-80 would be mobilized to transport the Russian President, who, during peacetime, relies on a civilian organization, Rossiya, for his aerial transport. Unlike the presidential aircraft in the Rossiya fleet, which are essentially VIP versions of standard airliners, the Il-80 is more comprehensively protected against the effects of a nuclear detonation and is a fully integrated part of the command system of the Russian nuclear forces. As such, from his suite onboard the president is able to order the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles , from land or sea, or make other critical warfighting decisions. The centerpiece of the Il-80’s mission suite is known as Zveno-S and includes an advanced communications suite, satellite antennas for which are carried in an enormous canoe-shaped fairing above the forward fuselage. Two large underwing pods each carry a turbine engine that serves as an additional power supply source for the onboard equipment. Numerous other antennas and fairings are littered around the fuselage, with a different configuration on each of the four aircraft. A pod fitted on the port side of the rear fuselage contains the Fregat trailing wire antenna, a very low frequency (VLF) system for communications with submerged ballistic missile submarines , in much the same way as the U.S. Navy’s E-6B Mercury . This side view of an Il-80 reveals the housing for the Fregat VLF trailing wire antenna on the rear fuselage., Aleksandr Markin/Wikimedia Commons First flown with its full equipment suite in 1987, the Il-80s are now somewhat long in the tooth, and an upgrade program was launched in 2008, introducing the improved Zveno-2S system. Details are next to non-existent but it is known to have been installed in at least two aircraft since then and it’s possible that the Maxdome that fell victim to thieves was undergoing the same work. There is also another, potentially separate, modernization program that may have resulted in this particular Il-80 being sent to Taganrog. In May 2019, it was announced that Russia plans to enhance its Il-80 and Il-82 aircraft, and that experimental design work on the project was complete. “We have started modernizing airborne command posts based on the Il-80 and Il-82,” said Russia’s Deputy Minister of Defense Aleksey Krivoruchko, at the time. “The [Polyot Research and Production] Enterprise is the chief developer of the onboard communications and control system and has successfully wrapped up its experimental design work on its upgrade.” The four Il-80s are the last derivatives of the Cold War-era Il-86 Camber airliner flying anywhere in the world., Kirill Naumenko/Wikimedia Commons Since Polyot, based in Nizhny Novgorod, is the company that was originally responsible for developing the Zveno-S, and presumably also the Zveno-2S, communication suite, it is also possible that the modernization program mentioned last year is simply a continuation of the previous Zveno-2S upgrade. Not surprisingly, the type of “radio equipment” stolen from the Il-80 at Taganrog has not been disclosed. There has been some speculation that the equipment may simply have been taken for its scrap value. However, even if the theft concerns less-sensitive items, the fact that intruders entered this aircraft — a strategic asset that is key to the nation’s nuclear deterrent — in the first place, is a cause for alarm. It also raises more questions about the security standards at Russian air bases , especially those that are dual-use, with military and civilian applications. Since it was undergoing maintenance at the time, it’s possible that the most critical items for the aircraft’s nuclear warfighting mission may have been removed, or at the very least secured from prying eyes. Nevertheless, the interior of the Il-80 has apparently never been seen by the public. While the break-in might well not have put Russia’s strategic command structure in peril — this aircraft was not at readiness, or in any kind of normal operation — the very fact that unauthorized persons made it onboard must be a cause for serious concern.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 23, 2020",Flooding Threatens To Put New British Carrier Out Of Action For Six Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A flooding incident aboard the British Royal Navy’s second Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales , will reportedly prevent the warship from going to sea for at least six months. Repairing the damage will mean a delay for the carrier’s planned sailing to the United States, where it is due to carry out the Westlant 21 trials with the F-35B Lightning short takeoff and vertical landing fighter jet. The Sun newspaper was first to report today that the damage sustained in the October 16 incident will put the aircraft carrier out of action until spring 2021 at the earliest. The Royal Navy subsequently confirmed the incident had occurred but did not say how long it might take to make the necessary repairs. “HMS Prince of Wales is alongside at HMNB [Her Majesty’s Naval Base] Portsmouth conducting repairs following a flood in an engine room,” a Royal Navy spokesperson told Naval Technology . “The ship’s company are getting ready to sail for further training and trials in 2021.” The flood reportedly occurred while the warship was in dock in Portsmouth, on the south coast of England. The warship’s hull was not breached in the latest incident, which is thought to have been the result of faulty pipework leading to a burst fire main — a system that supplies seawater to the fire hydrants to put out any blaze onboard the vessel. HMS Prince of Wales , left, alongside sister vessel HMS Queen Elizabeth , at HMNB Portsmouth., Crown Copyright The Sun has published a video , apparently taken by a member of the crew, showing serious flooding below decks. Footage includes water pouring down concrete stairs and submerging electrical cabinets. At one point in the video, a sailor remarks that an engine compartment is filled with at least three feet of water. “Thousands of gallons of seawater poured into an engine room and submerged electrical cabinets for over 24 hours,” the article states. The process of repairs, including checking miles of cables, “will take months” and is expected to cost “millions” of pounds. The damage is reported to have affected the ship’s high-voltage electrical system propulsion system, which consists of two Rolls-Royce Marine gas turbine alternators, and four diesel engines, providing a total power of around 110 megawatts. The website Save The Royal Navy provided the following analysis of how the October flooding may have damaged the aircraft carrier: “Photos that emerged in October show compartments flooded quite deep in places. The QEC [ Queen Elizabeth class] carriers are propelled by electric motors with high-voltage power supplied from diesels and gas turbine generators through a complex system of converters, switchboards and cabling. As warships have increasingly come to rely on electric propulsion, the hazards of high voltages can make damage control more complex and dangerous. Fortunately, the flood did not occur at sea with the engines running and the high-voltage system was probably not in use. However, if elements of the electrical system were submerged in saltwater then it will require stripping out and replacing which will be costly and time-consuming.” Routine maintenance on one of HMS Prince of Wales ’s diesel engines in the forward engine room., Crown Copyright “Following an issue with an internal system in HMS Prince of Wales , the ship’s company removed water from one of the ship’s compartments,” a Royal Navy spokesman told the Sun back in October . “No one was injured and an investigation into the cause of the issue is underway.” At that time, however, the Navy would not disclose if the repairs would disrupt the warship’s planned training schedule. This is the second flood known to have affected HMS Prince of Wales , which was commissioned into Royal Navy service on December 10, 2019. In May 2020, another flood affected the warship, and on that occasion, video footage showed water pouring through a ceiling and flooding one of the living quarters. Other flooding issues have affected her sister vessel, HMS Queen Elizabeth , too. In July 2019, the carrier had to return from sea trials earlier than planned after an internal leak was identified. That incident began with a high-pressure burst that buckled a stairwell, bent several bulkheads, and split deck-plates, causing flooding on several decks and putting three people at risk of drowning, according to Forces News . Speaking after the event, the then-captain of HMS Queen Elizabeth , Commodore Steve Moorhouse , said: “Floods are part of the business, the really reassuring thing is that my sailors responded exactly as you would want them to, so all done and dusted, we are ready to sail.” Two years previously, HMS Queen Elizabeth required repairs after a defective rubber seal on a propeller shaft was discovered, allowing seawater to travel along the shaft and enter the ship. “This is scheduled for repair while she is alongside at Portsmouth,” said a Royal Navy spokesperson at the time. “It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials program will not be affected.” HMS Prince of Wales has not been to sea since returning to Portsmouth on March 25, 2020, after completing sea trials, including a port visit to Liverpool and training in U.K. waters. Another period at sea had reportedly been planned for this fall, to conduct helicopter trials and training. It seems the October flooding incident may have led to this being shelved, at least for the time being. HMS Prince of Wales in Liverpool in February 2020, during its last period at sea. , Crown Copyright Any delay to the Westlant 2021 deployment, which will see the first F-35 operations aboard the HMS Prince of Wales , would be a blow to those tasked with bringing the carrier into frontline service. While it’s not clear how any such postponement might affect the broader timeline for the warship’s entry to operational service, according to the Sun , Royal Navy officials have insisted the carrier will still be operational by 2023, as originally planned. That, however, may require the second carrier’s existing workup schedule to be compressed, as some analysts have already suggested . Regardless, the Royal Navy should still have HMS Queen Elizabeth available for its planned first operational cruise in 2021, which is the next major milestone for the emerging Carrier Strike capability in the United Kingdom. Known as Carrier Strike Group 21, that activity will undoubtedly be the focus for the carrier fleet, as well as the various supporting vessels, aircraft, and helicopters that will be involved . Thereafter, it remains to be seen what steps will have to be taken to ensure HMS Prince of Wales is ready to sail alongside its sister vessel as part of a two-strong carrier fleet by 2023.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the shuttering of its sister squadron in 2016 , Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85 (HSC-85), the Firehawks, based out of Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, is now the Navy’s only dedicated special operations helicopter squadron. The unit belongs to the U.S. Naval Reserves, but incorporates reservists and active-duty personnel and flies the MH-60S “Sierra” version of the Seahawk helicopter . You can read all about HSC-85 and why the Navy has so few dedicated special operations helicopter assets, as well as how HSC-85 fits into the U.S. military’s larger special operations aviation ecosystem, in this past feature of ours. Suffice it to say, HSC-85 is made up of seasoned Sailors and Naval Aviators and it remains a capable, if not niche asset, within Naval Air Forces’ portfolio. The Firehawks can execute a range of missions within their focus mission set, including firing a number of weapons to provide close air support, such as ‘crowd-pleasing’ miniguns and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. Combat search and rescue and, of course, inserting and extracting special operations teams at sea and on land remains the unit’s bread and butter. The video showcase below, which was posted on December 5th, 2020, gives us an incredibly exciting look at the Firehawks’ exploits. It is packed with awesome footage, from raiding ships at sea to gunners billowing 7.62 ammunition out of fire-breathing miniguns, and so much more. Check it out below: At this point, HSC-85 acts as much as a brain trust of organic naval special operations helicopter support knowledge as a squadron dealing with this unique mission set. While the naval special operations support role, including acting as flying chariots for U.S. Navy SEALs, will increasingly be executed by less specialized fleet squadrons in the future, and of course units like the Army’s elite 160th SOAR will continue to pick up much of this capacity, especially for the higher-end spectrum of operations, hopefully, HSC-85 won’t end up like HSC-84 and become the victim of budget cuts. In the meantime, we ask the Firehawks to keep posting awesome videos like this to remind everyone what they bring to the table and of their rich naval special operations heritage .

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 30, 2021",General Atomics Avenger Drone Flew An Autonomous Air-To-Air Mission Using An AI Brain,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has revealed that it conducted a semi-autonomous flight test in October involving one of its stealthy Avenger drones equipped with an “autonomy engine” originally developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and now managed by the U.S. Navy. The unmanned aircraft worked together with five other simulated Avengers to conduct a mock search for aerial threats in a designated area. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. issued a press release about the October demonstration on Dec. 4, 2020. The announcement did not say where the flight test had occurred. The company states that the demonstration also supports the work it is doing for the Air Force’s Skyborg program , which is seeking to develop a suite of artificial intelligence-driven systems that will be able to control networked “ loyal wingman ” type drones and fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). “This represents a big step on the path to more sophisticated autonomous missions for unmanned aircraft,” GA-ASI President David Alexander said in a statement “Operator input can be minimized to support optimal manning of multiple products for complex air battles.” The star of this particular demonstration was the company-owned Avenger equipped with the “autonomy engine” that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had developed as part of its Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program. CODE dates back to at least 2014 and aimed “to focus in particular on developing and demonstrating improvements in collaborative autonomy – the capability of groups of UAS [unmanned aerial systems] to work together under a single person’s supervisory control,” according to an official project website . As its name implies, CODE was also heavily geared toward developing systems that would still work “in denied or contested airspace,” especially in the face of significant electronic warfare jamming. “Using collaborative autonomy, CODE-enabled unmanned aircraft would find targets and engage them as appropriate under established rules of engagement, leverage nearby CODE-equipped systems with minimal supervision, and adapt to dynamic situations such as attrition of friendly forces or the emergence of unanticipated threats,” DARPA’s website says. An official infographic, seen below, shows a notional advanced manned combat aircraft linked to autonomous unmanned platforms carrying out strikes and electronic warfare missions in a denied area via other drones acting as localized communications relays and navigation aids. Though the CODE concept did involve networking with manned aircraft, it also envisioned groups of drones using the systems developed to operate as fully-autonomous swarms , as well. DARPA General Atomics’ October demonstration is not the first time CODE software has been used in an actual flight test. In February 2019, six Navy RQ-23 Tigershark drones flew a series of tests at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground to see how well the system reacted to the appearance of various “virtual targets, threats, and countermeasures,” according to DARPA. Later that year, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) took full ownership of the CODE software database. However, in this more recent test, General Atomics did develop additional algorithms for CODE to support “behavioral functions for a coordinated air-to-air search.” During the demonstration, a human operator then instructed the Avenger and its five virtual wingmen to carry out the aerial search mission, which they then performed autonomously. The CODE “engine” flew the physical Avenger drone for more than two hours, according to the company’s press release. It’s interesting to note that the instructions from the human operator were sent to the drone using a Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) radio via the well-established Link16 waveform. The Navy developed TTNT first for the EA-18G Growler and it is now a key component of the service’s Block III upgrade package for its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . In 2016, a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet notably used a TTNT data link to share information with a Kratos Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 (UTAP-22) Mako drone acting as a “loyal wingman.” General Atomics says that the demonstration supported other work outside of continued experimentation with the CODE system, as well. “The CODE autonomy engine was implemented to further understand cognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI) processing on larger UAS platforms, such as Avenger,” according to the General Atomics press release. “For this initial flight, we used Avenger as the flight surrogate for the Skyborg capability set, which is a key focus for GA-ASI emerging air-to-air portfolio,” GA-ASI President Alexander added. The Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Skyborg program, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , is perhaps the best known of multiple projects focused on AI-driven autonomous capabilities, especially for unmanned aircraft, presently ongoing through the U.S. military. The AFRL Autonomy Capability Team 3 (ACT3) is separately working on a suite of systems it hopes will able to autonomous control a drone in a real-life dogfight with a manned aircraft in 2024 . ACT3 had originally hoped to be ready to conduct this demonstration next year. In August, an AI-driven “pilot” notably went undefeated against a human opponent in an entirely simulated dogfight as part of DARPA’s AlphaDogfight Trials. This project is tied to the Agency’s larger Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, which is exploring how AI and machine learning could help automate various aspects of aerial combat, both with regards to manned and unmanned platforms. In a manned context, this could include the integration of a “ virtual co-pilot ” to help reduce the burdens on human aircrew and speed up their decision making processes. The test of the Avenger ability to use CODE to carry out an air-to-air mission that, had it been real, could have seen the drone and its wingmen autonomously detect threats and pass that information off to other platforms, or engage them directly, is certainly an important step forward in this field of research and development. It certainly underscores the kind of capabilities the Air Force and the Navy are looking to add to future aerial combat aircraft fleets, which both services say will include a mixture of manned and unmanned types . The Air Force said in September that some form of demonstrator aircraft had flown in support of its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) future air combat program, which is, right now, primarily seeking to develop various technologies that go into future manned and unmanned combat aircraft. It’s also an important demonstration of General Atomics’ technological capacity, especially as the Air Force looks to end purchases of its flagship product, the MQ-9 Reaper. A number of new foreign sales of Reapers and derivatives are now on the horizon , but the company is already looking ahead to competing for new U.S. military drone-related contracts, including Skyborg, as well as the Air Force’s MQ-9 replacement effort, known as MQ-Next . Autonomous capabilities, as well as systems that utilized AI and machine learning, are likely to be increasingly important requirements for any U.S. military drone program as time goes on. In September, General Atomics announced it had conducted another flight test involving an MQ-9 carrying an AI-driven targeting system, known as Agile Condor, that is designed to help automatically spot and track, as well as categorize objects of interest. You can read more about that technology in this past War Zone piece . The Avenger, also known as Predator C, was itself once considered as a potential MQ-9 replacement, but the Air Force declined to pursue it, at least publicly. A small number of these drones have enjoyed a more secretive career, either with that service or the Central Intelligence Agency, or both, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . General Atomics continues to market advanced versions of the Avenger, but it has proposed a clean-sheet stealthy flying wing-type design for MQ-Next. Concept art General Atomics has released regarding its MQ-Next proposal., General Atomics All told, this newly disclosed October flight test is another important step forward in autonomous aerial combat developments that looks set to have far-reaching impacts for the U.S. military and General Atomics.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Lewis and Clark class dry cargo ship USNS Washington Chambers (T-AKE-11) pulled into San Diego Bay on Friday, December 4th looking remarkably worse for wear with the length of its hull and superstructure streaked with dark rust stains. The poor appearance of the ship, which was put into service less than a decade ago, is more evidence of a troubling trend that has manifested across America’s naval forces. Vessels marred with ‘running rust,’ especially after particularly long deployments or generally high operational tempos, have become a far more common sight in recent years. We recently reported on the very rough outward appearance of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Stout after its record-setting deployment, but the USNS Washington Chambers looks markedly worse.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2022",France Confirms That Indonesia Wants To Buy Rafale Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Indonesia’s protracted search for a new fighter aircraft has taken another, surprising, twist, with confirmation that the Southeast Asian country is in negotiations with France to purchase Dassault Rafale multirole jets. The latest development comes after Indonesia showed interest in Austria’s Eurofighter Typhoon fleet, and with plans to acquire Russian-made Sukhoi Su-35 Flankers apparently still stalled. The potential sale of 36 Rafales was confirmed yesterday by French Minister of Defense Florence Parly, during a TV interview. She noted that the contract signature was still pending, but that the deal was “very well advanced.” France’s La Tribune financial website had previously reported that talks between Indonesia and France had begun, but mentioned 48 Rafales rather than 36. According to this source, Jakarta is eager to “quickly finalize an agreement” on the purchase as part of a wider defense cooperation agreement between the two countries. The website further stated that “several corroborating sources” had confirmed that the negotiations “are progressing very well,” with Jakarta hoping that the deal could be signed off before the end of the year. On the other hand, the French side is apparently erring on the side of caution, hoping to secure more time “to complete a meticulous agreement.” A two-seat Rafale B fighter., Dassault Aviation France doesn’t have a long history of major arms transfers to Indonesia, but in recent years the country’s defense industries have been making more inroads here, including the sale of an additional eight Airbus Helicopters H225M combat search and rescue rotorcraft to the Indonesian Air Force in 2019. An Indonesian Air Force H225M combat search and rescue helicopter., Airbus Helicopters Indonesian Minister of Defense Prabowo Subianto met with Parly in Paris in October to reiterate his interest in the Rafale, according to the Nikkei Asian Review . The current export customers for this type are Egypt, India , and Qatar. In recent months, Greece, too, has unveiled plans to buy 18 of the French jets, as The War Zone discussed in this previous article . The Dassault fighter is also in the running for fighter procurement programs in Finland and Switzerland , with decisions due in both countries next year. While an Indonesian move for the Rafale had not been expected, it is clear that the country is eager to introduce a new fighter type to help modernize its inventory. The Indonesian Air Force’s fighter fleet currently operates around eight survivors from the 12 F-16A/B Block 15OCU fighters delivered from 1989, plus 23 upgraded F-16C/Ds. One example of the latter was written off in an accident in 2015. A two-seat F-16B from the batch of Vipers delivered to Indonesia from the late 1980s., Australian Department of Defence As well as this U.S.-supplied equipment, the Indonesian Air Force flies different versions of the Russian-made Flanker, in the form of five single-seat Su-27SKs and a pair of two-seat Su-30MKs, deliveries of which started in 2003, along with nine two-seat Su-30MK2s, the first of which touched down in the country in 2008. It had been expected that Jakarta would buy additional Flankers, in the form of the latest multi-role, single-seat Su-35 version, and a $1.1-billion deal for 11 examples was announced in July 2017. According to unnamed sources in Indonesia , Washington has applied pressure on Jakarta to shelve the deal with Moscow, threatening sanctions in response. However, in March 2020, Dmitry Shugayev, director of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation insisted that the Su-35 deal was still on. Indonesian Flankers — single-seat Su-27SK and two-seat Su-30MK2 versions — fly in formation with a pair of Australian F/A-18 Hornets. , Australian Department of Defence A more ambitious plan for the Indonesian industry to jointly build the KF-X new-generation fighter with South Korea has also run into trouble. Indonesia remains involved in the KF-X, with PT Dirgantara Indonesia working as an industry partner alongside Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI). This 20 percent share of the project was hoped to translate into Indonesian orders for 50 of the jets. The first prototype of the KF-X is now taking shape in South Korea but, last August, Indonesia failed to pay its second installment to secure its stake in the program. Moreover, the KF-X is not expected to enter production until sometime between 2026 and 2028, meaning a new fighter is likely still needed in the interim. Final assembly of the first KF-X prototype in South Korea. Indonesia’s status within this program is now unclear., KAI The search for an alternative to the Su-35 seems to have taken Minister of Defense Subianto on visits to Austria, France, Turkey, and the United States, last October, according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review . As well as political sensitivities, which seem to have scuppered the potential Sukhoi deal, Subianto also has the problem of balancing his country’s books, with a defense budget that’s been hit by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly for Jakarta, the Su-35 deal with Russia would have seen half the payments made in the form of exports of palm oil, rubber, and other commodities. In addition to the potential Rafale sale, Austria’s defense minister had also confirmed earlier this year that she planned to begin talks to sell the country’s 15 Typhoons to Indonesia. While these second-hand aircraft could well provide a lower-cost solution, such a deal would also require a political consensus in Austria, as well as approval from the four Eurofighter partner nations — Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom — as well as the United States. As The War Zone pointed out before , however, the Typhoons offered by Austria currently lack the kind of air-to-ground capability that Indonesia might be required to counter the growing number of domestic terrorist groups, for example. The Austrian Air Force’s entire Typhoon fleet was offered to Indonesia earlier this year., BUNDESHEER/MARKUS ZINNER According to the Nikkei Asian Review , Subianto’s visit to Washington D.C. included talks about buying a new fighter. It may have included a discussion of the viability of potential Su-35 or Typhoon orders and their political implications, but it’s also possible that the purchase of a U.S.-made fighter was on the table. It’s reported that the United States has offered Indonesia more F-16s, now including the latest F-16 Block 70/72 variant, as well as pilot training. Lockheed Martin has already made a concerted effort to pitch the F-16 Block 72 to Indonesia, promising “cutting-edge technology to the Indonesian Air Force in the most advanced F-16 configuration on the market today.” This includes an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, new mission computers plus display processors, a large-format 6×8-inch high-resolution display, an internal electronic warfare system, and an advanced data link. Moreover, there is currently a significant effort to secure additional Foreign Military Sales orders for the F-16, based on Lockheed Martin’s new baseline configuration for the jet, that will come with a standard base price tag, and which you can read more about here . Computer-generated concept art of an F-16V in Indonesian service. , Lockheed Martin In November 2019, it was reported that Indonesia was looking to acquire two squadrons of new F-16s — likely around 24 aircraft — as part of the country’s five-year strategic plan, running from 2020 to 2024. At that time, however, Indonesia was still pursuing the Su-35 purchase and the status of the potential Viper deal is now uncertain. Furthermore, and despite these overtures, there have been reports that Indonesia is holding out for the more advanced F-35 from the United States, rather than the F-16. Considering the cost of the Joint Strike Fighter, and Indonesia’s tight budget, that may still not be realistic, even if such a deal were approved by the U.S. government. It is also possible that interest in the F-35 is being used by Indonesian officials as a bargaining tool, perhaps to secure a better deal for the F-16 or American approval for the Su-35 acquisition. A U.S. Air Force F-35A., USAF There could also be a resistance to “buy American” after that country imposed an arms embargo on Indonesia between 1999 and 2005, as a result of human rights violations in East Timor . This affected the availability of the aircraft already delivered to Indonesia, including the first batch of F-16s, and now-retired F-5E/Fs . Regardless of Indonesia’s final decision, there is a clear desire to purchase new jets, reflecting the country’s strategic position at the southern end of the South China Sea , where air policing is set to be an increasingly important mission in the future. In particular, a maritime dispute between China and Indonesia rumbles on in the region, exemplified by recent incidents in which Chinese fishing boats accompanied by Chinese Coast Guard vessels have entered waters within Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. As well as fishing rights, these waters also include Indonesia’s largest untapped natural gas field, the East Natuna gas field, a key strategic resource. In the past, incursions by the Chinese fishing fleet have led to formal diplomatic protests from Jakarta. The Indonesian military has also responded by deploying naval vessels to the area and F-16s to Natuna Island . With these maritime disputes in mind, Indonesia is additionally weighing up the purchase of French-made Scorpène class submarines and Gowind class corvettes. For now, however, a fighter jet seems to be the clear priority. While the Rafale might still be an outsider for Indonesia, it would clearly offer a high level of capability as well as seemingly being a politically “safe” option that’s received approval from senior French officials. However, the complex path to providing Indonesia’s future fighter may well throw up yet more surprises.

Our exchange underlines how rapidly all of the various technologies that are necessary to realize an operational laser weapon are maturing, and how much more they need to mature in order to make laser weapons far more commonplace on the battlefield of the near future—including on land, at sea, and in the sky. So, without further ado, here’s the interview: Tyler: How do you see lasers, and even directed energy as a whole, including high-power microwave weapon systems, how do you see these non-kinetic options integrating with kinetic options [such as missiles and gun systems], whether it’s at sea, on land, or in the air? What’s the picture of how that looks to the guy or gal on the ground that would actually be relying on these technologies… Or even making the choices to employ them in real-time? Rob: Yeah, so that’s a great question. I’m gonna give you more of a ‘visioneering’ view of how we see that being done because these systems are just now going out, right? So we’re going to do a lot of learning as these systems start getting put on platforms and the users are going to start using them, and those users are going to use them in ways that we haven’t even envisioned, to be honest with you. So, I’ll start with how we see it. Let’s take two examples and I’ll try to be brief, an Army ground-based example and a Navy ship-based example. Right now, the Army systems, there are a number of… these mortars, rockets, artillery… and you may be at a forward operating base, or you may be even in a mobile command system, but let’s take a forward operating base, where there’s a sensor network, right? There are radars that are doing situational awareness; they’re spinning, they’re looking, and then all of a sudden, a bunch of tracks [radar targets] start coming over. Depending on the types of threats, this could all be happening very quickly. So, the tracks from the radar, it says, “Look, it looks like there’s a bad object coming in from this sector” and it commands the laser weapon to move its optic, so there’s usually a turret, or a beam director, as we call it, which has very high-quality optics in it to project the laser beam, but also to do the acquisition and tracking piece. So, all the acquisition and tracking piece is done with cameras, for lack of a better word, in video now, in different parts of the spectrum, whether it’s visible or short-wave infrared, mid-wave infrared, or long-wave infrared, it’s still fundamentally a camera with video streams. So, the optics slew over and grabbed the object optically, all of a sudden, you get an image on a TV screen, on a control screen, of what the thing is. You may be able to look at it in different parts of the spectrum, too. Then, the human can look and determine, “Oh, that is a hostile threat.” You’re already tracking the threat. So, now, by engaging with the laser weapon, the laser beam comes out of the same optics that you’re using to track. And then the laser engages the threat and then can negate it. Or, if on the other hand, higher resolution imagery says, “No, that’s benign,” you don’t have to engage it. So, that is kind of how the user interface will look, there’s also the ability to use the optics without the laser, just to provide situational awareness, right? To use these optics to look around. In the Army case, there are very few systems right now that are out there that can negate rockets, artillery, and mortars . There are some kinetic systems in development. But what we see, again, is both systems probably being deployed; kinetic interceptors, as well as, we’ll call them a laser interceptor, for now, that’s not a common terminology, or a laser ‘effector.’ In the Navy case, it will be very similar, but you can imagine the combat system room with a bunch of… With all the many consoles, and one of them would be laser console and the combat system would cue the system again and you’d slew the optics and you look at the target. Now, something that’s interesting that we’re doing on the Navy program is that beyond the high energy laser to defeat the threat, we’re also integrating different lasers, we call them dazzlers , which are non-lethal . Lockheed’s HELIOS system will have both a high-power laser weapon and dazzler built into a single integrated unit. , Lockheed There may be a UAV that is looking at the fleet, and you don’t want them to be able to continue to look at the fleet, but you don’t really want to do a hostile act. You can turn on the dazzler laser. You’re tracking the object, and you’re basically shining a very bright spotlight into its cameras. Now, all of a sudden, they can’t see, in a non-lethal way. So, over time, how these are all going to be used, deployed, the decision-making trees, we’re going to just keep learning and the users are gonna really learn how best to use these systems. Tyler: What are the real limitations that still exist? I mean, is it the beam attenuation and the thermal loads? Because we always hear that we want to ‘scale’ this stuff, we wanna be at X amount of power by this year, and we’re missing some of the goals … So whether it’s in the air, at sea, or on land, what are some of the biggest limitations, biggest hurdles that still exist when it comes to making these systems able to do what we’ve imagined them to do? From shooting down, not just UAVs and disabling small boats or C-RAM [Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar] types of applications, but also shooting down anti-ship missiles and potentially ballistic missiles . What’s the big void that exists that we still have to cross? Rob: From a technology perspective, there are a number of domains that need to be continued to be advanced. So, everybody likes to talk about scaling laser power, and for good reason. In other words, more power means you can reach out at longer ranges, or you can defeat the threat in a shorter period of time. But as you scale power, you need to be able to keep the beam quality, right? In other words, if you just scale the power, but your ability to focus the [laser] spot diminishes, then you’re not really going to be able to use that power for shorter defeat times or longer ranges. So, let’s just start with the power scaling piece. Then, if you’re just making stuff bigger and bigger, you also need more electrical power and you need more thermal management systems. So, continuing to push the electrical efficiency of these systems higher and higher will become important to minimize the demands on the power employing systems. But now, let’s say you’ve achieved this power. If you want to reach a longer range, it means that your beam is going to propagate through the atmosphere for a longer distance, and you have to be able to maintain the aim point, right? So you’re tracking and your line-of-sight stabilization has to keep improving. And then, the atmosphere will begin to distort the laser beam, depending on the type of atmosphere you’re in, if you’re in a highly turbulent atmosphere or… It’s actually turbulence that’s the biggest problem, because what it does is… so think about when you’re looking down a hot road and you see the heat waves coming off the road that distort the mountain or the car that’s coming down the road… So, those kinds of heatwaves are variations in the atmosphere that are bending the light that’s coming to your eyes. Say, it’s one o’clock in the afternoon, you’re driving through Arizona, you’re on a two-lane highway, and off in the distance, there’s this car coming at you, but it looks like there’s water… the car’s image is distorted, etcetera, all the light that’s coming to you, to your eye is being distorted by all these heat waves that are coming off the road. And those are things we call variations of the index of refraction of the atmosphere. Well, similarly, if you try to propagate a laser beam through that, it would also be distorted and wouldn’t be able to image very well to the target. So, to a lesser degree, if you’re trying to go farther and farther in range, variations in the atmosphere begin to break up or distort the laser beam, and make it harder and harder to focus. So, being able to do that atmospheric compensation piece, which is known as adaptive optics , so there’s technology that’s been developed, but is still maturing where you need to be able to measure the distortion in the atmosphere and then compensate for it, so that the beam propagates through the atmosphere and focuses tightly on to a target. Each of these scaling points, so scaling and laser power, scaling and range, all of your precision needs to keep improving to make the systems more and more effective for the types of threats that you’re talking about. So, not an easy answer like, “Oh, there’s just one thing that needs to be fixed, and as soon as we fix that, we’ll be fine,” but the good news is there’s a capability that we can deliver today, and then as we improve and as the technology improves and the computing power improves and the ability to make these high-quality optics improve and/or laser scaling improves, then the systems are going to keep improving. Tyler: On the aerial side, a lot of the interest we get about laser technology comes from the tactical air side of things, and being able to put one of these on a fighter aircraft and being able to use it to defend against incoming missiles, like the SHiELD program . Can you speak about that and sort of what the vision is, where we’re at, and where we can go with that in the future, including is that something that could be eventually applied to a low observable aircraft, not just something you slap a laser pod on to? I know Lockheed is cutting edge in this area, so I’d love for you to address it. Rob: Let me cover number one and then I’ll be a little bit more careful about number two, how does that sound? So, you’re familiar with the SHiELD program, as you probably also know, Lockheed Martin has the LANCE contract , so we’re developing the laser to go into the pod. What I think is important to understand about the technology that could be demonstrated on the SHiELD program is that the fact that we’re even talking about putting a weapons class laser in a pod that could be on a fighter jet, shows you how far the technology has really come. It may not seem like that to people that aren’t laser folks that have been trying to do this for a long time… where we thought, “never in a million years could we pull this off.” And now, all of a sudden, here we are, and that we can make things smaller. AFRL For the tactical airborne, the hardest piece of the technology is the ‘SWAP’—the size, weight, and power. The issue with tactical fighters is, there is no room for anything on a tactical fighter. All platforms are filled to the brim, right? As soon as you have a platform, you start putting stuff on it. So, even though a ship is much larger than a tactical fighter, there’s less room on a ship than you would think, and that’s mainly because the ships are already full of stuff too, right? But a tactical fighter is clearly, that’s been the biggest challenge from being able to make something small enough and powerful enough to be useful. So, SHiELD is the beginning of this activity and as technology continues to miniaturize, and if you could trend where this technology is going, the laser systems are getting smaller and more powerful. We haven’t even gone yet to employ the full kind of hardening and packaging the way we do with our targeting pods. So for example, Lockheed Martin does the Sniper targeting pod , and we also do F-35 EOTS . Those are literally compact, hardened optical systems that can do targeting, tracking, and pointing of laser beams. So, beginning to apply those techniques and making the lasers… continue to make the lasers smaller will enable their use on tactical fighters. Now, as far as… I don’t know, if you call them 5th gen [fighters], but as far as 5th gen is concerned, as you can well imagine… you’re probably not going to hang a pod off of that plane, and so, the ability for the system to be packaged up inside is gonna become key. And once again, there isn’t a lot of room… So, continuing to reduce the volume [taken-up by a laser weapon]. Most importantly, these planes can actually lift a lot of weight. They have more ability to lift weight than there is actual room to put things inside… But as a prime platform maker, we understand what the options are and where things could potentially go. Tyler: Some have noted the forward fuel tank [or lift fan on the B model] in an F-35. I’m sure you know about that… For something like this to go into a big open space and you lose some gas in the process, but that’s a lot of potentially available volume. Rob: You said the forward fuel tank? Yeah. Is that what you were saying? Tyler: Yeah. Where the lift fan sits in an F-35B. Rob: Yeah. Where the lift fan… Yeah. Tyler: There’s that similar area on the A and C model, too. Rob: So, there is volume there, if you take out the fan or if you take out fuel, and then, these all become trades. Right? Tyler: Right. Rob: Do you want to reduce the range, but carry this capability? Tyler: Yeah, that’s always the hardest question. Right? Rob: Yeah. AFRL Tyler: So, like HELIOS [High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance], on the naval side, it’s an aggressive program. The Navy wants lasers now. They really want the technology. What will this system be able to do that, say the LaWS system that went on the amphibious sea base about six or seven years ago, what will the new system be able to do that LaWS couldn’t? What type of leap are we going to be seeing in this new generation of directed energy weapons for naval ships? Rob: Yeah, so I’m gonna qualitatively answer that question. The HELIOS system will have much more laser power. It will have much higher beam quality. It will have a bigger beam director, so that you could propagate it farther. And it will also have the dazzler function. Tyler: So, we are talking about a pretty big leap in every way. Rob: It’s a big leap in every way, and it will be tied into the combat system, which LaWS wasn’t. LaWS was a very important step. Tyler: Yeah. Rob: You have to walk before you run. You can’t skip the steps. So LaWS was a very important step. HELIOS is another bigger step. Significant. Lockheed Martin Tyler: For the ships that in the future, as these systems, as the users understand them more and refine how to employ them, because it’s a beam, it can only hit one thing at one time, just like a missile. But a laser also has such a deeper magazine depth. Do you see the Navy putting multiple lasers on a ship, like what they do with, say, a Phalanx system or even like a Rolling Airframe Missile system? Do you see them integrating these on different turrets to offer much greater coverage at any given time and the ability for simultaneous engagement of targets? Rob: Yeah, so specifically, how these systems would go and how many they would put on and so forth, is ultimately a Navy question. But I would just say, generically, the smaller, more powerful you can make the systems, the more opportunity there would be to decide how many of these systems you’d want to have.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 13, 2020",China’s Y-20 Transport Appears To Be Finally Flying With Indigenous Jet Engines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After much speculation and at least one false alarm, it seems we finally have a strong indication that at least one of Chinaâ€™s Xiâ€™an Y-20 military transport aircraft is now flying with indigenous WS-20 turbofan engines, which offer more power than the Russian-made Soloviev D-30KP-2s fitted to earlier examples. If true, the development would represent a significant advancement in capability for the big airlifter, which first entered operational service in 2016 and is broadly analogous to the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s C-17 Globemaster III . The new photo apparently showing the re-engined Y-20 seems to have been first posted to the Chinese microblogging website Weibo back on November 21, 2020, by a user named @èŒ¶æ°´è‚¥è‚¥çŒ«. More recently it was shared on other social media channels by, among others, Andreas Rupprecht, an expert on Chinese military aerospace and friend of The War Zone , who tweets as @RupprechtDeino . Unlike a previous image that also emerged on social media on November 21, and which was later revealed to be manipulated, the new image appears to be the real deal. The new photo shows a Y-20, apparently still in primer paint, and with characteristic enlarged engine nacelles, accompanied over Xiâ€™an-Yanliang Air Base by a J-11 Flanker chase plane â€” standard procedure for such a test flight. Following the let-down from 21. November I'm still not sure but this one seem real now. It was indeed posted on Weibo on 21. Nov but only noticed now and shows as reported by spotters the particular aircraft in primer accompanied by a J-11BS chase plane during its maiden flight. pic.twitter.com/EgdzvtCdUF — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) December 3, 2020 Oh well, this is indeed a major disappointment: ğŸ˜® That alleged image of the Y-20B with four WS-20 engines is not real, even the original photographer confirmed this, since he posted that image already on 27. July 2020. pic.twitter.com/8PQkOLuDzN — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 22, 2020 China has already made rapid progress with the Y-20 program and production is now progressing at a prodigious rate . However, the airlifter, in its original iteration, has always been hamstrung by its obsolescent engines. The original Y-20A, dubbed â€œKunpeng,â€ after a giant bird of Chinese mythology, is powered by four Russian-made low-bypass Soloviev D-30KP-2 engines, which are lacking in terms of thrust and efficiency compared to modern high-bypass turbofans. No less than 20 Y-20s were noted at Xiâ€™an-Yanliang Air Base in December 2019., PHOTO Â© 2019 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION It was always the plan to eventually install indigenous WS-20 high-bypass turbofans, allowing the Y-20 to achieve much more of its potential and remove dependence on a foreign engine source. The WS-20 is expected to deliver around 31,000 pounds of thrust, compared to 26,450 pounds for the D-30KP-2. Previous analysis had suggested that the new engine might only be ready for limited production starting from 2024, which suggests that the program could have been accelerated, or perhaps has not faced the problems that had been envisaged. On the other hand, we have so far only seen likely evidence of a single re-engined Y-20 and while Xiâ€™an may be capable of producing airframes in large numbers, it is not currently clear if the same applies to the WS-20 engines. Bearing in mind that jet engine technology is one critical area in which China has traditionally lagged behind its rivals, then it is possible that large-scale production of the new-generation turbofan could still be some way off.Â The re-engined version of the aircraft for the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Air Force, or PLAAF, is likely designated Y-20B. An Il-76LL testbed fitted with a single WS-20 high-bypass turbofan for preliminary flight-test work., VIA CHINESE INTERNET Even with its D-30KP-2 engines, the Y-20 can reportedly carry a maximum payload of 132,000 pounds, outstripping the 96,000 pounds carried by the PLAAFâ€™s Russian-made Il-76 Candid airlifters. While the PLAAF secured around 20 Il-76s from Russia and other sources, Beijingâ€™s inability to acquire more of these transports was also a major spur to the Y-20 project. These figures also make an interesting contrast to the C-17. According to the U.S. Air Force , the C-17 has a maximum payload capacity of 170,900 pounds, which comfortably outstrips the Chinese transport, at least in its Y-20A form. The re-engined Y-20 might help to reduce that capability gap to the U.S. Air Force transport. A Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Air Force Y-20A with the original D-30KP-2 engines., AP The significance of the Y-20 for the wider Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army, and Beijingâ€™s geopolitical aspirations, lies in its ability to rapidly deploy both troops and cumbersome weapons systems, including the latest versions of the Type 99 main battle tank, over considerable distances, likely to be a crucial aspect of Chinaâ€™s new-look military strategy. The Y-20 also has the potential to deliver large amounts of other equipment and basic supplies to forward areas, to support sustained operations in a way that is routine for the U.S. Air Force C-17. As long as China continues to make pace as a global power, then the demand for the Y-20 can be expected to grow, too. Now, with new engines apparently soon to be available for production Y-20s, the aircraft will be better equipped to undertake these missions. As well as purely military missions, the Y-20 has also already demonstrated its potential for humanitarian or other â€œsoft powerâ€ applications, for example when it was used to bring medics and other humanitarian supplies to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier this year. You can read all about that particular mission in this previous War Zone article . A view inside the main cargo hold of one of the Y-20s sent to Wuhan earlier this year., VIA CHINESE INTERNET In fact, so important to the PLAAF is the Y-20, that there are reports that Xiâ€™an slowed down work on the secretive H-20 bomber program to refocus resources into the cargo plane. Only after work on the initial airlifter prototype wrapped up in late 2012 did the company return to the H-20 in earnest. In the future, the Y-20B is also expected to form the basis of a new aerial refueling tanker, addressing another current deficiency in the PLAAF order of battle. An unconfirmed image of the Y-20 tanker variant, likely designated Y-20U, began to circulate recently, seemingly showing a J-20 fighter jet approaching the trailing hose-and-drogue assembly. So far, itâ€™s not clear if this photo is genuine, but a tanker version of the transport can probably be expected sooner rather than later.Â Once available, the Y-20U will complement the limited Il-78 Midas tanker fleet â€” just three second-hand examples â€” and will be especially useful for supporting PLAAF fighters on long-range patrol missions over the South China Sea and the eastern Pacific near Japan. It will also be a much more capable asset than the tanker conversions of the H-6 Badger bomber, which offer a comparatively limited fuel payload. An image purportedly showing a J-20 approaching a tanker-equipped Y-20 during trials., VIA CHINESE INTERNET Other potential variants of the re-engined Y-20 include a proposed airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) platform and a civilian cargo derivative, which has previously been exhibited in model form, known as the Y-20F-100. In the civilian sector, the Y-20 perhaps even has the potential to displace the Il-76, which is currently a popular choice for commercial chartered airlift.Â A model of the civilian Y-20F-100 provides an idea of how the re-engined Y-20B may look., VIA CHINESE INTERNET An AEW&C version could also be very useful to the PLAAF, which has again been hampered by the limited availability of Il-76s for modification to the KJ-2000 Mainrin g configuration. Currently, the service operates just four examples of the Mainring. A Y-20 AEW&C aircraft could supersede the KJ-2000 as a heavyweight counterpart to the AEW&C variants of the turboprop-powered Y-8 and Y-9 families. Regardless of developments in the tanker and AEW&C realms, providing the re-engined Y-20 meets expectations, it seems the aircraft is well on its way to fulfilling the PLAAFâ€™s strategic transport needs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2020",Crazy Video Footage Shows The Exact Moment The Arecibo Radio Telescope Collapsed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The National Science Foundation has released two video clips, one from a vantage point closer to the ground and another shot using a drone, that show the precise moment at which a series of cables at the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico snapped, sending the 900-ton instrument platform crashing into the reflector dish hundreds of feet below. The accident at the site, which was originally built in the 1960s to support missile defense-related research, occurred on Dec. 1 and you can read more about its history and the events that had led up to this disastrous event in the War Zone ‘s initial reporting on this incident here . The video footage, seen below, appeared on the National Science Foundation’s website on Dec. 3, 2020, and also includes older b-roll of personnel working on the telescope. The site is part of a larger complex known as Arecibo Observatory, which also includes a smaller radio telescope with a 12-meter-wide reflector dish and a space-facing laser imaging system, as well as a visitor’s center. The National Science Foundation provided the following official description about what is seen occurring in the clips from the actual collapse: This video, that starts with a view of the top of Tower 4, was taken from the vantage point of an Arecibo Observatory drone, utilized for monitoring the condition of Tower 4 support cables. Four cables are seen in the center of this video. The top cable does not support the telescope platform, but instead supports the catwalk described in the narrative for the previous video. The three lower cables are, from left to right, M4-1, M4-2, and M4-3. Note that a number of individual wire strands of the M4-1 and M4-2 cables are noticeably broken at the beginning of this video. The M4-3 cable does not appear to have any broken wires at the beginning of this video. The first indication of the coming failure is the breaking of another M4-2 wire, accompanied by a puff of “smoke” and chips of paint flying away from the surface of the cable. Four seconds later the entire M4-2 cable appears to disintegrate. The failure of M4-2 is followed a fraction of a second later by the demise of M4-1, followed a fraction of a second later by the failure of M4-3. The drone operator then swings the drone around to view the reflector dish and fallen platform, azimuth arm, Gregorian dome and the falling cables and catwalk. The top section of Tower 12, near the Visitor Center, can be seen tumbling down the hill to the left of the operations building.  The Tower 12 backstay cables that connect the top of Tower 12 to the ground cause damage behind Tower 12, well away from the edge of the telescope dish. An investigation into the exact causes of the collapse is ongoing, as are efforts to assess the extent of the damage that the falling instrument platform and snapped cables caused and any impacts on the surrounding environment. In November, the National Science Foundation (NSF) had already announced its plans to decommission the Arecibo Radio Telescope after previous cable breaks left it unsafe to operate or even repair. It had also suffered damage during Hurricane Maria in 2017. “We are saddened by this situation but thankful that no one was hurt,” NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement in a press release after the accident. “When engineers advised NSF that the structure was unstable and presented a danger to work teams and Arecibo staff, we took their warnings seriously and continued to emphasize the importance of safety for everyone involved. Our focus is now on assessing the damage, finding ways to restore operations at other parts of the observatory, and working to continue supporting the scientific community, and the people of Puerto Rico.” “We knew this was a possibility, but it is still heartbreaking to see,” Elizabeth Klonoff, Vice President for Research at the University of Central Florida, which leads the consortium that presently manages the Arecibo Observatory for NSF, said in her own statement. “Safety of personnel is our number one priority. We already have engineers on-site to help assess the damage and determine the stability and safety of the remaining structure. We will continue to work with the NSF and other stakeholders to find ways to support the science mission at Arecibo.” A photo showing some of the damage from the fallen instrument platform, part of which is seen toward the top, to the reflector dish., UCF NSF presently plans to make necessary repairs to the smaller radio telescope and laser imaging facility so that researchers can continue their work at the complex using those instruments in the future. At least some of the funding for that would come from money Congress had previously appropriated to repair damage to the complex sustained during Hurricane Maria. “Once safety on site is established, other work at the observatory will be carried out as conditions permit,” NSF post-collapse press release added. It remains to be seen how the National Science Foundation may now look to replace the unique capabilities that the Arecibo Radio Telescope, which had been the largest in the world until 2016, had offered for decades. No matter what, the video footage we now have the collapse only underscores how sad an end this has been for this historic scientific instrument.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The Untold Story Of How Indonesian And Australian Jets Nearly Came To Blows Over East Timor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a previously unknown story of an unusual, and dramatic, aerial encounter in a little-known conflict. If fully accurate, a new account detailing the events that allegedly occurred on September 16, 1999, suggests they could have potentially led to a deadly aerial encounter between an Australian F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter and a British Aerospace Hawk light combat aircraft flown by an Indonesian Air Force pilot. The narrative, which is based on an interview with the Indonesian Hawk pilot, Henri Alfiandi , appears on the Indonesian Mylesat website, which covers defense affairs. As well as his description of a confrontation with Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hornets, the same aviator recalls a mission to try and intercept a single RAAF F-111 swing-wing combat jet that was flying an apparent “show of force” mission. While the incident involving the F-111 doesn’t quite seem to perfectly tally with other published accounts , the story Henri recounts otherwise seems fairly credible and the level of detail it provides on an underreported air war, down to individual aircraft serial numbers, is notable. The events described took place at the height of the 1999 East Timor crisis , when violence erupted on the eastern half of the island of Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after it had voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. The Indonesian military had occupied East Timor for the previous 24 years, maintaining a brutal rule and seeking to eliminate any resistance from the insurgents that resisted Jakarta’s rule. In the wake of the independence vote in August 1999, pro-Jakarta militias, backed by Indonesian security forces, stepped up their attacks on East Timorese civilians. With 2,600 people killed in a three-week period, and many thousands more displaced, international concern began to mount. A pair of Indonesian Air Force A-4E Skyhawks on patrol., Dirgantara Mandala Museum/Wikimedia Commons The Indonesian Air Force was ostensibly tasked with covering the withdrawal of Indonesian forces from East Timor, but with deployments of combat jets to West Timor and an Indonesian Navy task group patrolling the waters off East Timor, the United Nations, which had overseen the election, was worried about possible retribution from Indonesia in the form of military intervention. The interview begins with Henri reminiscing about his time flying the A-4 Skyhawk , an earlier-generation subsonic attack jet that had seen previous use on anti-guerrilla operations in East Timor. “It was the days of Top Gun and I flew on the A-4, not to be outdone by the F-16,” Henri reflects. “The Top Gun film influenced me as a combat pilot and made me proud.” At this time, the F-16 jet was the most capable air-to-air fighter in the Indonesian Air Force, but by 1999, Henri had been posted to a unit flying the British Aerospace Hawk. While the F-16 was the most capable fighter in service with the Indonesian Air Force in 1999, it was the Hawk that bore the brunt of the missions over Timor., Australian Department of Defence The nimble Hawk was designed as a jet trainer, but also employed as a light combat aircraft, and flown by Indonesia in both single-seat and two-seat versions. The transfer of Hawks to Indonesia was itself the source of a major controversy in the United Kingdom, with critics voicing their concerns that the jets were being used in a combat role, despite informal British government assurances that they would not be used against the Timorese. In one high-profile incident, campaigners broke into the British Aerospace factory and attacked one of the Hawks destined for Indonesia with hammers. With the Indonesian Air Force at increased readiness to respond to the tense situation in East Timor as of September 1999, Captain Henri found himself deployed to Kupang Air Base, in West Timor. At the time, Henri explains, the base was hosting two-week rotations of three Hawk jets and the pilots had orders to shoot down any unauthorized aircraft entering Indonesian airspace. Four days after arriving at Kupang, on September 16, Henri says he was tasked with a routine combat air patrol (CAP) mission. The flight lead for the sortie was Captain Azhar “Gundala” Aditama in single-seat Hawk Mk 209 serial number TT-1207. Henri, callsign “Tucano,” was in two-seat Hawk Mk 109 TL-0501 together with Anton “Tomcat” Mengko. The two jets reportedly took off at around 09:00 hours to fly a CAP in the southeast Flight Information Region (FIR), which bordered Australian airspace off Darwin, in that country’s Northern Territory. The Hawk mission was coordinated using Ground Control Interception (GCI), via a radar unit at Kupang commanded by Major Lek Haposan. It was Haposan who alerted Azhar to the fact that two unidentified aircraft had crossed the Darwin FIR boundary at an altitude of 8,000 feet and a speed of 160 knots. According to the account, the radar operator then requested that the Hawk flight check on what he assumed were helicopters, heading for Dili, the capital of East Timor. Henri asked Azhar, the flight lead, to use his radar — the single-seat Hawk Mk 209 has the AN/APG-66H pulse-Doppler set, similar to the radar found on the F-16A/B, while the two-seater has no radar — and to verify the contacts’ speed. A pilot salutes ground crew ahead of a mission in a two-seat Indonesian Air Force Hawk Mk 109., Indonesian Air Force The flight lead reported the contacts moving at a speed of 150 knots, then noted that the figure was steadily increasing… 160, 170, 200 knots. The unknown aircraft were now at a distance of around 80 miles from the Hawks. At this point in the account, it is not clear if the GCI was still providing information on the contacts, or if they were being tracked using Azhar’s radar, which would have been very much at the limits of its range. “Knowing that, I immediately went high and assumed a dogfight position to protect Azhar because I didn’t have radar,” Henri recalled. “I was behind him.” The two Hawks then climbed to an altitude of 28,000 feet, and by now it was clear the contacts weren’t helicopters, but fighter jets. The flight lead selected a combat mode for his radar and then the unidentified fighters turned directly towards the Indonesian Hawks. An Indonesian Air Force Hawk Mk 209 armed with wingtip AIM-9P Sidewinder missiles, like Azhar’s aircraft., Indonesian Air Force As the contacts came toward them, Henri explains that Azhar identified them, shouting “Hornet” over the radio. The pair of RAAF F/A-18A/B Hornets were presumably flying from RAAF Tindal, a base in the Northern Territory, from where a reinforced RAAF presence was intended to dissuade Jakarta from embarking on any military escalation in East Timor. According to Henri’s account, Azhar locked on to at least one of the F/A-18s before Henri warned him “We have not declared war!” It seems the Hornets didn’t enter Indonesian airspace at any point. A pair of RAAF F/A-18A Hornets during a refueling mission., Australian Department of Defence The Hornets then turned back south toward the Darwin FIR while the Hawk pair returned to Kupang. Henri then explains that more aircraft began to pour into the Darwin FIR, with another two groups of four fighters each, plus a larger aircraft that he suspected was a tanker. As soon as he landed, Henri says he ordered the ground crew at Kupang to prepare the radar-equipped Hawk Mk 209 for another flight, requesting a “hot” refueling, in which fuel is pumped into the tanks while the engine is still running. That wasn’t possible, but, after rapidly draining a cup of tea, Henri was able to get airborne in the Mk 209, which was still armed with a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking air-to-air missiles. It’s not clear whether or not he was accompanied by another Hawk this time. Airborne again, Henri claims he immediately selected the radar, but found it wasn’t functioning. He attributed this to the far more sophisticated electronic countermeasures on the Australian Hornets.

At this point, Henri realized that his Hawk’s drop tank was not delivering fuel properly, interfering with the jet’s center of gravity and affecting its handling. Once again, the engagement between Hawk and Hornet was broken off, this time before Henri had made visual contact with the Australian jets. Henri returned again to Kupang, where senior officers apparently berated him for being too eager to confront the Hornets. Over the next three days, the Indonesian Hawk pilots remained on alert, but there were no more reports of any more aerial incursions, Henri contends. The pilots were on standby to scramble from 06:00 to 21:00, but in this period activity was often limited to watching transport aircraft arriving to bring in aid to Dili, the aviator recalls. A U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft lifts off at Lajes Field, Azores. The C-5, from the 312th Airlift Squadron, Travis AFB, California, was carrying pallets of Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as part of the humanitarian relief effort for East Timor., US NATIONAL ARCHIVES In the meantime, a multinational International Force East Timor (INTERFET), organized and led by Australia, had been deployed to East Timor to establish and maintain peace. The first INTERFET forces arrived in Dili on September 20 and, by the end of the month, more than 4,000 troops were deployed. Australian troops on patrol in East Timor in their Australian Light Armoured Vehicles (ASLAVs)., Australian Department of Defence On September 23, 1999, Henri remembers the siren suddenly sounding again and the Indonesian pilots, some of whom had just begun their evening prayers, running to the ready room before jumping into a car that took them to the flight line. In the race to scramble, one of the aviators recalled lacing his boots and strapping himself into the cockpit while the Hawk’s engine was spooled up. This time, Henri’s wingman was Major Hasbullah, and he explains that they were tasked with catching another unidentified aircraft. Henri reckons the two Hawk Mk 209s were airborne within 12 minutes of the alert sounding, which left the controllers at the base with no time to illuminate the runway. With no time for a pre-flight briefing, either, Henri decided to speak in Javanese to explain the mission plan to his wingman, since it was expected that the Australians would be listening in on their communications and that they understood Indonesian. Henri quickly realized that Hasbullah didn’t understand Javanese, before the two Hawks then headed north. Then, according to Henri, a radio call came from the GCI at Kupang, “half screaming,” to announce that a RAAF F-111 had just roared over the base, apparently from the direction of Dili. An afterburner takeoff for a RAAF F-111 at the Australian International Airshow, Avalon., Australian Department of Defence Capable of speeds of Mach 1.2 at sea level, the F-111 was clearly well beyond the reach of the subsonic Hawks. The F-111, affectionately known to RAAF crews as the “Pig,” had been deployed to RAAF Tindal in late August, bringing them closer to East Timor and other potential Indonesian targets. These powerful, if aging, jets were then on standby to support INTERFET with reconnaissance flights and airstrikes if required. In the event, they never dropped any weapons in anger. An F-111 taxies to the RAAF Tindal runway with a load of high-explosive bombs during an exercise., Australian Department of Defence Official Australian accounts note that some RF-111C reconnaissance sorties were flown over East Timor between November 5 and 9, albeit with Indonesian approval, marking the only operational employment of the RAAF F-111 fleet. This suggests the reported September 23 mission, if it indeed took place, may not have been authorized by Jakarta. Regardless, Henri and Hasbullah returned to base, carefully noting the waypoints since they had no experience in night flying from Kupang. For their actions on the 23rd, both airmen were apparently personally congratulated by the commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, Soni Rizani, and the incident made national headlines. It was the end of this brief period of combat service for Henri Alfiandi and he was promoted to the rank of Major later the same year. East Timor formally declared its independence in May 2002. The crisis of 1999 had damaged the previously good Indonesian-Australian relations, and both Canberra and Jakarta subsequently worked hard to restore elements of past cooperation. This has extended to the military sphere, including joint maneuvers, such as the Pitch Black air warfare exercise , and the transfer of Australian military aid to Indonesia, including C-130H Hercules transports. A former RAAF C-130H Hercules transport, now in service with the Indonesian Air Force., Australian Department of Defence Ten years after the standoff in East Timor, Henri was Indonesian Air Attaché in Washington D.C., where, by a remarkable coincidence, he claims to have met one of his antagonists from 1999, during a round of golf. “Henri, where were you in September 1999?” the Australian Air Attaché apparently asked him, before explaining that he had been the pilot of the F-111. “I just wanted to test your combat readiness,” the Australian reportedly told Henri. It’s a surprising twist to an equally surprising story, but at least one ex-RAAF F-111 pilot served in this capacity at the time, so it’s quite possibly an authentic account. While the crisis only marks an obscure entry into the annals of air combat history, it can only be hoped that further details of the Indonesian-Australian encounters over East Timor will also finally come to light.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2021",Russia’s Okhotnik Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Tests Air-To-Air Missiles: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) has reportedly been flight-tested with air-to-air missiles for the first time. While details remain limited, if true, this could be a significant development for the flying-wing “strike drone,” which Russia hopes to have in service as early as 2024 . The recent series of weapons trials apparently saw the unmanned aircraft used in a “fighter-interceptor role” and were reported by Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti . The outlet said that the tests had taken place over the Ashuluk training range in southwestern Russia. “From the airstrip of the military airfield of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ Combat Training and Combat Application Center at the Ashuluk training range, the Okhotnik performed several flights with functional simulators of guided air-to-air missiles,” a source within Russia’s “military-industrial complex,” told RIA Novosti . “In the combat version [of the drone], such missiles are designed to destroy other aircraft.” The use of the Ashuluk range for these reported missile trials is not a surprise. Located around 80 miles north of Astrakhan in Russia’s southwestern region, this complex is operated by the 185th Combat Training and Combat Application Center, the only Russian unit of its kind, which is tasked with operational and tactics training for fighters and air defense units. The training is intended to closely approximate combat conditions, including “enemy” (aggressor) aircraft, air defense, and electronic warfare elements. An Okhotnik UCAV during earlier testing. The jet-powered, 20-ton drone has previously been flying from Akhtubinsk. , YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The Okhotnik was said to have been outfitted with simulated air-to-air missiles (AAMs): inert weapons with both infrared and radar-homing seeker heads but without engines and warheads. This indicates that the tests did not involve any live missile launches. The report also doesn’t say if any live or simulated aerial targets were used in the testing and, if so, how the appropriate targeting information was obtained by the Okhotnik. The RIA Novosti piece doesn’t specify what types of missiles were involved in the reported tests, either. It did mention that they included infrared and radar-homing types, which could point to the drone having carried both short-range and medium-to-long-range AAMs. With the Okhotnik still in the early phase of its evaluation, any missile armament likely comprised types that are already in the inventory or at least at an advanced stage of development. Russia’s primary close-combat AAMs at present are the R-73 and R-74M family and the country is also working on the K-74M2 dogfighting missile , which is intended for deployment from the internal “quick launch” weapons bays of the Su-57 Felon fighter jet. The K-74M2, which features a lock-on after launch (LOAL) mode, beginning its flight under inertial control before achieving an in-flight lock-on, would be a suitable candidate for internal carriage by the Okhotnik. A display of AAMs from the Vympel company comprising, from bottom to top: a gray launch rail, an R-77, an R-74M, and an apparent new design tailored for internal carriage., Anton Novodereshkin/TASS In terms of medium-range AAMs, Russia is currently focused on the R-77 and improved R-77-1, while a more capable K-77M is also under test. The K-77M is another weapon optimized for internal carriage aboard the Su-57 and, perhaps, the Okhotnik, too. You can read more about the K-77M and other new long-range Russian AAM programs here . RIA Novosti’s report also notes that previous Okhotnik test flights had focused exclusively on its flight qualities and the functionality of the flying-wing drone’s primary onboard systems. The drone itself is being developed under the Udarno-Razvedyvatelnyi Bespilotnyi Kompleks (URBK), or Strike-Reconnaissance Unmanned Complex, program with Sukhoi as the project lead. After breaking cover during initial ground trials in January 2019, the Okhotnik — meaning Hunter in Russian — was first flown in August of that year at Akhtubinsk in the Astrakhan region. RIA Novosti’s story added that the missile trials “will make it possible to assess the coupling of the drone’s avionics with missile guidance systems and the lead Su-57 aircraft.” This adds weight to reports that the plan is to utilize the Okhotnik, at least partially, as a loyal wingman-type complement to the manned Su-57. It’s also possible that the drone might help overcome certain deficiencies in the Su-57 design, which you can read more about here . In a previous indication of plans to use the Okhotnik in a manned-unmanned teaming scenario, a video emerged in September 2019 showing an Okhotnik flying together with a Su-57 . The Russian Defense Ministry has previously claimed the Okhotnik will “broaden the [Su-57’s] radar coverage and provide target acquisition for employing air-launched weapons.” If true, this suggests that the drone could be used to cue longer-range weapons against air and ground targets on behalf of the Su-57. It would also imply that it would be equipped with sensors allowing it to detect, track, and engage aerial targets. With this in mind, it could also be possible for the drone to attack aerial targets with its own weapons, although the degree of autonomy that would be involved in such a process is unclear. However, the emerging ability of the Okhotnik to carry missiles itself would lend it to a future role as a “weapons carrier” for the Su-57, increasing the fighter’s available arsenal and potentially keeping the manned fighter further away from hostile fighters and other threats. Video stills showing a Su-57 launching a short-range AAM, possibly from one of its two small wing-root weapons bays . A “loyal wingman” Okhotnik armed with AAMs could serve to increase the missiles available to a Su-57., Russian Ministry of Defense Capture It’s also unclear whether the air-to-air missiles used in the latest trials were carried externally or within the Okhotnik’s internal weapons bays. While external carriage of weapons would further diminish the Okhotnik’s low-observable characteristics, which have already been called into question , at least in its current form, this may be less of an issue if its role is to simply boost the number of missiles available to an accompanying Su-57 for certain missions. On the other hand, internal carriage of offensive weapons would appear to be a prerequisite for the strike role, for which the Okhotnik was previously earmarked. Signature reduction, including through internal weapons carriage, would be needed to reduce its chances of detection and make it more potent in the offensive counter-air and destruction of enemy air defenses roles. A future version of this UCAV is supposed to feature major signature reduction upgrades, a model of which you can see in this previous piece of ours . The RIA Novosti report did not make any mention of air-to-ground weapons trials for the drone at this time. The first Okhotnik prototype prepares to take off for a test sortie., Russian Ministry of Defense Capture Previously, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov had said the Okhotnik would begin tests in an armed configuration between 2023 and 2024, which suggests that the development program may have now been accelerated. Arming a drone with an infrared-guided air-to-air weapon may be a significant move in Russia, but is not without precedent. In the United States, similar development stretch back to 2003, including the arming of the now-retired MQ-1 Predator with Stingers and, more recently, tests of MQ-9 Reapers armed with AIM-9X Sidewinders . An MQ-9 carrying an AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile., USN While the slow-flying MQ-1 and MQ-9 are in a different class to the Okhotnik, which is expected to be able to fly at speeds of around 540 knots, the U.S. Air Force at least is also working toward fielding loyal wingman-type drones that will be able to carry air-to-ground, if not air-to-air weapons. This is in addition to what are almost certainly classified test and developmental UCAV programs, the potential existence and implications of which you can read all about here . Just recently, in the unclassified realm, the stealth UCAV concept seems to also be highly favored to replace the Air Force’s MQ-9s in the years to come. While it remains to be seen what types of missiles the Okhotnik will eventually carry, and how the drone will be deployed in an air-to-air role, it seems certain that the program is currently enjoying a high priority as the Russian Aerospace Forces increasingly embrace unmanned technologies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 30, 2020","Navy Boss Tells Congress That A New Frigate Will Be Named USS Congress. No, Really.","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite told legislators at a hearing today that the second frigate in the upcoming Constellation class, ships previously referred to as FFG(X)s , will be named USS Congress . Given the context, this might have initially come off as some kind of jokey icebreaker to soften the mood or outright pander to lawmakers who control the service’s purse strings. In actuality, the Navy’s top civilian official was being entirely serious and the name is actually well in line with plans to name at least the first few of these vessels after the original USS Constellation and her sister ships, which were the first six frigates built for the fledgling U.S. Navy in the late 18th Century. The first USS Congress also holds the distinction of being the first American warship to visit China, which seems like notable symbolism given the ever-growing importance of that country , and the greater Indo-Pacific Region , in U.S. military planning, as a whole . Braithwaite made the announcement about the next USS Congress at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support on Dec. 2, 2020. The Secretary of the Navy, who has only been in that post since May, had declared that the first FFG(X) would receive the name USS Constellation in October . Since then, he has also revealed the names of a number of other future ships and submarines, all with a stated focus on hearkening back to important naval history and heritage. This has notably included plans to give at least three forthcoming nuclear submarines fish-related monikers after decades of primarily naming them after cities and states, something you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . USS Congress is not a particularly creative name, per se. The dysfunctional legislative branch’s overall approval rating in the eyes of the American public has been even worse than normal in recent months and, pandering or not, it may not seem like the best choice of moniker for a new warship at the moment. A number of members of the defense press, among others, initially thought Braithwaite was outright joking with legislators. However, USS Congress makes perfect sense in the context of the Constellation class naming plan. The original USS Constellation was also one of the first six frigates built for the Navy shortly after the end of the Revolutionary War. Two other warships had also carried the name USS Constellation during the Revolutionary War and had served with the Continental Navy, both of which were scuttled after sustaining significant damage in separate engagements with the Royal Navy. As one of the Navy’s primary warships of that post-Revolutionary War-era, Congress fought in the First Barbary War off North Africa, including blockading Tunisia. It then ferried that country’s ambassador to the United States at the conclusion of that conflict. A drawing of USS Congress from 1816., US National Archives The frigate also took part in the War of 1812 , capturing or assisting in the capture of multiple merchant vessels. That war helped cement the United States’ independence from its former colonial parent. In 1815, Congress fought in the Second Barbary War , sailing both off Tunisia and Libya. After that, the ship primarily conducted counter-piracy patrols closer to home. Under the command of Captain John D. Henley, Congress also visited China in 1819, becoming the first American warship to visit that country. Unlike the Perry Expedition to Japan, decades later, which involved the threat of force before U.S. personnel were allowed to come ashore, this trip appears to have been relatively uneventful. Still, it highlights the beginnings of the Navy’s presence in the Pacific. Starting in 1824, Congress served primarily as a reviving ship for new Navy sailors, never sailing and only moving between Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia and Washington Navy Yard in the District of Columbia under tow. In 1834, the service finally decommissioned and scrapped the ship. The Navy actually had three other ships named USS Congress between 1841 and 1919, as well. The first of these, another sailing frigate, was sunk by the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia during the Civil War. The second ship in this trio, a screw sloop, that could also operate either by way of its steam engine-powered propeller or under sail, served in the Atlantic and the Caribbean from 1870 until 1876. The last of these was a diminutive patrol vessel, originally built as a fishing boat, that operated in waterways around Washington, D.C. for less than a year. A drawing of the Civil War-era USS Congress ., USN The USS Congress patrol boat served for less than a year between 1918 and 1919., USN The future Constellation class USS Congress will be the first time the Navy has had a ship of this name in service since 1919. If this naming scheme continues, then the service may be set to receive Constellation class frigates named after three of the other ships from the historic first batch of six, the USS United States , the USS Chesapeake , and the USS President . The Navy will not be able to name one of the forthcoming frigates USS Constitution , at least under present conditions, as that ship actually technically remains in service after more than 220 years. Nicknamed “Old Ironsides,” is the oldest formally commissioned naval vessel still in operation anywhere in the world and serves today as a floating ambassador for the Navy, with its crew conducting various education and other community outreach activities to promote the service and its history and heritage. The USS Constitution in Boston, her home port, where she remains the oldest commissioned naval vessel in service in the world., USN Whether or not America’s legislative branch evokes positive sentiments among average Americans at the moment, it’s clear that Secretary Braithwaite has a keen sense of Navy history when it comes to naming future ships and submarines. USS Congress may not seem particularly original, and announcing it in front of members of Congress was certainly an interesting choice, but, all jokes aside, it does carry very important symbolism for the service.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Pilot In A Real Aircraft Just Fought An AI-Driven Virtual Enemy Jet For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two U.S. companies have recently completed what they say is the world’s first dogfight between a real aircraft and an artificial intelligence-driven virtual fighter jet. The experiment, run by Red 6 and EpiSci, is the first step toward similar technology being provided to U.S. military fighter pilots, which would allow them to battle virtual adversaries as part of augmented reality training. You can read all about this potentially highly disruptive technology in this recent War Zone exclusive feature . The concept could help dramatically reduce the costs of air combat training compared to the adversary aircraft that currently have to physically fly against fighter pilots. It could also help solve a rash of other tactical challenges when it comes to replicating realistic foreign threats for fleet aviators. The live-flight augmented reality dogfight involved a Berkut 540 experimental plane and a simulated, reactive adversary aircraft in the form of a computer-generated projection inside the Berkut pilot’s augmented reality helmet-mounted display. The adversary was a representation of the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter , created in augmented reality by EpiSci’s Tactical AI technology. The unusual aerial contest took place out of Camarillo Airport, California. “With this first-ever within-visual-range dogfight against an AI bandit, EpiSci’s Tactical AI demonstrated the ability to work on a real aircraft, with flight-ready hardware and sensors,” said Chris Gentile, EpiSci’s Vice President for Tactical Autonomous Systems. “While fielding autonomous systems that control fighters may be in the future, this system is ready now to bring next-generation capability to our training programs, providing immediate benefit to the USAF’s ability to develop and maintain world-class fighter pilots. By introducing them to this technology now, they’ll be even more prepared to use a range of unmanned tools in the future.” The Berkut 540 used in the latest demonstration., Mike Killian EpiSci drew upon its previous work in the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Alpha Dogfight program to create its Tactical AI technology in a hybrid AI system. In this way, the kind of AI-driven simulation that was previously found only in traditional ground-based simulators can be introduced to the cockpit — in this case, presenting the pilot in the real aircraft with a simulated adversary flying a J-20 fighter. The demonstration also used the Airborne Tactical Augmented Reality System (ATARS) developed by Red 6, which includes the display and control systems needed to inject augmented reality into the real world of the cockpit, and then for these virtual entities to interact with the surroundings as if they were a part of the real world. The Founder and CEO of Red 6, Daniel Robinson., Mike Killian “Red 6’s ATARS system enables real pilots to fly real airplanes connected together in an augmented world,” explained Dan Robinson, CEO and founder of Red 6. “With the additional integration of Tactical AI into our platform, we are now able to interact and respond to any threat aircraft. This opens spectacular possibilities for training,” Robinson added. Robinson was at the controls of the real aircraft in the mock dogfight. ATARS is billed as the first wide field-of-view, full-color augmented reality solution for “dynamic outdoor environments.” It doesn’t get much more dynamic than a fighter jet and that’s where Red 6 aims to bring this technology. Ultimately, it aims to provide pilots flying real-world aircraft to perceive synthetic threats in real-time and in high-speed environments. This, of course, requires augmented reality to be blended seamlessly with the environments both inside and outside the cockpit. Daniel Robinson wearing the AR headset. , Mike Killian There is also the potential to employ Tactical AI in scenarios beyond replicating enemies in air combat exercises. More generally, it could serve to present various other presentations for military pilots at different levels of instruction, for example, simulating flying in a larger formation, including alongside unmanned loyal wingmen . “Pilots of the future will need to be comfortable teaming with AI — and training is the ideal place to introduce this technology,” said EpiSci’s Gentile. Now, after this pioneering aerial battle between a real aircraft and an AI-driven virtual foe, this ambition is one step closer to becoming a reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2017","Yes, Serbian Air Defenses Did Hit Another F-117 During Operation Allied Force In 1999","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The story of how one of the U.S. Air Force’s prized F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jets came to be shot down over Serbia during Operation Allied Force on March 27, 1999, is, by now, familiar. The loss of “Vega 31” and the subsequent recovery of pilot Lieutenant Colonel Dale Zelko is an episode that we have looked at in detail before at The War Zone . What’s less well known is that another F-117 was hit by a Serbian air defense system during that same campaign, but details of what happened have only recently become available. In the latest edition of The Afterburn podcast, which you can listen to in full here , retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charlie “Tuna” Hainline , a former F-117 pilot, confirms what had, for many years, been a rumor: that a second stealth jet was hit by the Serbians, but managed to return to base. While noting that much about the incident in Allied Force remains classified, he still provides some fascinating details of what appears to be a previously unconfirmed event. Hainline flew the A-10 operationally before switching to the F-117 after the once-secret program had “come out of the black,” and soon after Operation Desert Storm . He also explains that he flew a single mission over Iraq in early 1993, during the policing of the no-fly zone over that country. On that occasion, it seems that “Tuna” targeted some Iraqi air defense systems and had his first experience of being on the receiving end of hostile ground fire, but his jet emerged unscathed. An F-117 in front of a destroyed hardened aircraft shelter at Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. Hainline flew his first combat mission in the stealth jet from here in 1993., NATIONAL ARCHIVES At the time of the Operation Allied Force, in 1999, Hainline was on his second F-117 tour, assigned to the 9th Fighter Squadron, the “Flying Knights,” and deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. From here, the missions were of fairly long endurance, and “pretty grueling,” typically around six hours between takeoff and landing. At least two hours were normally required to reach the tanker track, which was located over Hungary, followed by a precision bombing mission involving roughly 30 to 45 minutes of total flying time over the former Yugoslavia, and then returning home via another tanker “top-up.” With just two laser-guided bombs in its internal bays, the Nighthawk normally dropped both weapons on a single target. During Allied Force, these target sets frequently included communications installations, including radio masts, which had to be struck at the base to “tumble” them. Hainline mentions other targets, too, among them bridges, factories, buildings that intelligence suggested were associated with high-value individuals, and petroleum, oil, and lubrication (POL) facilities. An F-117 deploys its drag chute on landing at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, on April 4, 1999., U.S. AIR FORCE/PUBLIC DOMAIN Hainline’s “interesting night,” as he puts it, involved a mission with two F-117s, flying on roughly parallel target runs, around 10 miles apart. “Tuna” doesn’t provide the date, but it was certainly after the Serbians had shot down the first F-117, according to Hainline’s account. Unconfirmed sources had previously stated that this incident occurred on April 30, 1999. On the night in question, Hainline recalled “quite a bit of AAA [anti-aircraft artillery] and at times quite a few missiles being fired.” These surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) included examples of the same Soviet-made SA-3 Goa that had previously brought down “Vega 31,” but there were other missile types in use at the time, too, according to “Tuna.” S-125 Pechora surface-to-air missiles, known to NATO as SA-3 Goa, on display in a Finnish museum., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS During their frontline career, Nighthawks almost always flew combat missions with support from jamming aircraft, including EF-111 Ravens and EA-6B Prowlers .  Not only did they lack any defensive countermeasures, beyond their stealthy shaping and radar-absorbent material, of their own, but F-117 pilots were nearly oblivious to the status of threats in their vicinity during their runs over hostile territory due to lack of onboard threat-detection equipment . Even radio reception was degraded due to antennas being pulled in to “stealth-up” the aircraft over enemy territory. Electronic attack support had been notably lacking in the case of the “Vega 31” shootdown, although it’s unclear if it was lacking for the mission Hainline described. According to most accounts, the night “Vega 31” was shot down was the only evening where EA-6B Prowlers were not present to wreak havoc on hostile radars. On this occasion, over Serbia, advance warning of hostile SAMs was provided to the F-117 aircrew by Air Force F-16CJ “Wild Weasel” pilots, whose jets were equipped with the HARM Targeting System (HTS) for the suppression of enemy air defenses mission. So it was, on the outskirts of western Belgrade, heading north, that one of the “CJ” pilots called a SAM launch — right at that moment, Hainline was on his target run, with only around 30 or 40 seconds before his bomb was supposed to drop on an antenna. An F-16CJ breaks away from a KC-135R Stratotanker after refueling during NATO Operation Allied Force on March 31, 1999., U.S. Air Force/Public Domain “Tuna,” who knew he was a little offset to the west of the SAM launch, providing a modicum of safely, recounted what happened next to The Afterburn : “I kind of looked to my right over Belgrade, and [saw] this huge missile coming up — it looks like a Saturn V thing. I knew my number two guy was over there somewhere. Then I see another launch — this big glow, and even from that far away you can see a lot of detail. The plume, the smoke going, and then just this ball of fire coming up towards you.” Hainline called upon the training he’d received for just such a situation, which required him to keep the autopilot engaged since manual turning or banking movements could have a negative impact on the jet’s radar cross-section, potentially presenting the missile with a juicier target. “As I’m heading towards this target, one missile explodes and the other one kind of goes up into space,” Hainline continued. “I don’t know if it hit him,” he added, referring to his wingman. Hainline continued on his bomb run and managed to get his bomb away cleanly and hit the objective. US National Archives He then headed back to the tanker track, but the expected rendezvous there with the other F-117 didn’t happen. A period was now spent circling around, during which Hainline persuaded the tanker to remain on station. The aircraft then worked to conserve fuel as much as possible, waiting for the other Nighthawk to arrive. Finally, the boom operator on the KC-135 Stratotanker spotted an F-117 pulling closer through the darkness, with no lights on. “His airplane wasn’t in really good shape,” Hainline remembered, and soon after the other F-117 had plugged into the boom, the jet fell away, leaving “Tuna” and the tanker crew wondering if it was now flying on only one engine, or if some other problem had presented itself to the pilot. Hainline called out instructions to the tanker, requesting the crew put the flaps down to reduce speed and allow the other Nighthawk to reconnect. Despite fuel spilling out around the receptacle, the damaged F-117 managed to fill its tanks and both stealth jets then headed back to base. A Nighthawk being refueled by a KC-10 Extender tanker on a mission out of Edwards Air Force Base, California. Tanking was, according to Hainline, one of the hardest aspects of flying the F-117 to master. , NATIONAL ARCHIVES En route back to Germany, Hainline said the other Nighthawk “kind of disappeared again,” but both jets eventually made it back to Spangdahlem. Hainline’s efforts to ensure his wingman made it home safely were rewarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross, a commendation for “heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.” While the recognition that another F-117 was damaged by Serbian air defenses during Allied Force is noteworthy, Hainline emphasizes the fact that SAMs were a real concern for the “Black Jet” in any combat scenario. He describes how the F-117 would be routed to avoid “double-digit” SAMs — referring to the Russian-made SA-10 Grumble, also known as the S-300 , and more advanced types — since the jet was considered “low observable, not invisible.” Even comparatively old systems, such as the SA-3, remained a genuine threat, as confirmed by the downing of “Vega 31” earlier in the campaign. A two-ship of F-117s formates for the camera in the mid-1990s., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Beyond talking about his time in the F-117 and this incident over Serbia in the podcast, Hainline reflected on other aspects of his flying career, including a period as an F/A-18 Hornet exchange pilot and carrier qualification with the U.S. Navy’s Strike Fighter Squadron 106 , the “Gladiator.” It is well worth a listen. Suffice to say, that mission over Belgrade in 1999 was perhaps the most hair-raising in Hainline’s impressive career. It also goes to show that there are still more stories to be told about the mysterious Nighthawk , the operations of which continue to be obscured by a veil of secrecy .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 16, 2021",Air Force To Build Alternate Airbase On Tinian Island In Case Guam Gets Knocked Out,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to reports, the Department of Defense is moving ahead with plans to formally build a backup air base at Tinian Island, located just 100 miles to the north of its giant and highly strategic U.S. military airbase on Guam, known as Andersen Air Force Base . This comes as the Pentagon is working to expand its existing airfields located deep in the Pacific and even create new ones that it could use during a major peer-state clash, namely with China, in the vast region. It is all part of an emerging distributed combat operations strategy that will likely be as much about survival as about getting an advantage on the enemy, at least during the opening stages of a potential conflict in the Pacific Theater. Anderson Air Force Base is so key to U.S. strategy that the possibility that a natural disaster could knock out flight operations in the entire region is also a driving factor behind this initiative. While Guam isn’t as at risk of adversary missile attacks as America’s military outposts located in Japan, or even South Korea, its ability to continue operating during a barrage of ever more plentiful and capable Chinese ballistic missiles is highly questionable at best , leaving alternative airfields both nearby and far away, absolutely critical to a sustained a war effort. Wake Island, which is located 1,500 miles east of Guam, is the largest such installation. You can read about the upgrades to that remote island outpost in this recent feature of ours . However, that base on Wake Island will be more about staging airpower as a conflict heats up, not just with dealing with dislocated airpower in the opening stages of an attack. This is where new developments at Tinian Island will come into play. Tinian Island., Google Earth Tinian, which is now part of the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI), a U.S. territory, was seized from the Japanese by U.S. forces in the summer of 1944 during the twilight of World War II. It became home to a huge and historic airfield located on the northern stretch of the island. It is from this base, called North Field, that two B-29 bombers, modified to carry atomic bombs as part of Operation Silverplate, flew separate sorties that would comprise the only operational uses of nuclear weapons to date. These missions were in addition to waves of bomber and reconnaissance runs that flew over Japan and around the Western Pacific from the island during the later stages of the war. B-29s line the taxiways at North Field. , Public Domain Following the end of World War II, the airfield’s big parallel runways, aprons, and support structures largely fell into disrepair, but it remained an austere airfield capable of receiving tactical transports, such as C-130s , for training. In more recent years, the airfield has been rehabbed a bit for austere deployment exercises, but it is not capable of accepting the fighter jets, bombers, or large support aircraft that frequent nearby Andersen on Guam. North Field has now largely succumbed to the landscape, but one of the old runways is still used for austere airfield and expeditionary training operations. , Google Earth Another airfield located in the central part of the island, Tinian’s actual airport, but also known by its World War II designation ‘West Field,’ on the other hand, can support combat jet types, but it is a small facility. In some cases, arresting gear systems have been deployed to safely operate groups of fast jets from the airfield for training purposes in the past. Tinian International Airport is pretty sparse, but that will change in the near future. , Google Earth The Marines have done just that on multiple occasions with their F/A-18 Hornets. The Air Force recently deployed some Eagles to the airfield for austere operations training, as well. But once again, this is the relatively tiny airport that lacks the infrastructure to sustain military aircraft operations for a protracted period of time.

The aircraft dispersal exercise involved Airmen and aircraft, based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, flying to and operating from airfields throughout the region. Resilient Typhoon is a dispersal exercise designed to validate Pacific Air Force’s ability to maintain readiness while adapting to rapidly evolving regional events such as inclement weather. , U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Matthew Seefeldt , U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Matthew Seefeldt Now, the U.S. is going to build a full-on alternate operations facility on Tinian. This facility would be capable of accepting formations of diverted aircraft and even launching combat operations if Andersen AFB were to be put out of commission, even if just temporarily, by enemy action or even by a natural disaster. With this new facility will come other improvements to the island and its infrastructure needed to make it capable of accommodating transient guests and more robust military operations. From what we can tell, this initiative is centered around a 40-year lease deal that was signed in 2019 and will leverage the aforementioned Tinian International Airport and its existing 8,500-foot runway and small apron, and expand upon it. Haggling over the agreement has been going on for years, but now, the divert field project is officially moving forward. A Stripes article from 2016 outlines what the Pentagon was looking for in this proposed auxiliary airfield capacity and why it was necessary: “The divert initiative in CNMI will create the only divert airfield in the Western Pacific and provide the U.S. Air Force the capability to conduct either temporary or sustained refueling operations from an additional location in the region,” Gen. Mark Welsh, chief of staff of the Air Force, said in a Defense Department statement in February, when the choice of Tinian was announced. “It will also give us another location to use when supporting contingency or natural disaster responses in the region.” The infrastructure of the Tinian airport will be upgraded to support up to 12 tanker aircraft and all support personnel needed for divert operations. Regular exercises will take place at the airfield, up to eight weeks each year. It isn’t clear if the scale of the project has grown in recent years, especially considering how dire the need for alternative basing in the vast region has become due to the growing threat from China. Being able to support as many as a dozen tanker aircraft would demand a major expansion of the existing airfield. It’s also worth noting that, with more static capabilities already on the island, using the austere North Field complex to support the staging of tactical airliners and other military equipment would be easier during a crisis.

J. Gage Karwick Right now, just the sprawling America’s Robert E. Kamosa Transmitting Station (REKTS) shortwave radio relay installation, which transmits Voice Of America, Radio Free Asia, and Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in this part of Pacific, is the only major manned facility that occupies this portion of the island. REKTS., Google Earth While a new alternate operating airfield on Tinian will provide some risk reduction to the Pentagon’s current heavy reliance on Andersen AFB, it too will be vulnerable to high-end foes’ advanced missile capabilities. Although it is worth noting that taking out two airfields that are defended by missile interceptors with medium-range ballistic missiles is costlier and a harder to execute proposition than just one. Still, these intrinsic vulnerabilities have not gone unnoticed and other airfield projects are ongoing throughout the Western Pacific or are being eyed by the DoD in an attempt to generate more basing options in case a contingency situation arrives. An affiliated ‘agile deployment’ initiative, in which tactical airpower deploys in small numbers to austere bases for short periods of time, has been in development and is now being accelerated to match this grander strategy. This won’t just help in terms of the survivability of its own forward-deployed forces, but it will also make the enemy’s targeting and defensive plans all that much more complicated and costly. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules delivered U.S. Army Pacific Soldiers onto the newly renovated Angaur Airfield for training exercises in the Republic of Palau, Sept. 6. The successful arrival of the military cargo plane validates the airstrip’s use by military and commercial aircraft. “The completion of the Angaur Airfield Joint Improvement Project is a game changer,” said U.S. Ambassador to Palau John Hennessy-Niland. “Palau now has a secondary airstrip. This had been a long-standing request from the government of Palau and the State of Angaur.”, US Army We will keep an eye on the progress of this new highly important project on Tinian, but rest assured, the list of alternate operating locations in the Pacific that are capable of accepting U.S. military airpower will grow markedly in the years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 3, 2020",Collapsed Arecibo Radio Telescope Was Originally Built For Ballistic Missile Defense Research,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government’s massive radio telescope in Arecibo , Puerto Rico, the second-largest such instrument in the world, has collapsed onto itself, effectively destroying it, but thankfully causing no injuries. While the site, construction of which was completed in 1963, is best known for its work in radio astronomy, most don’t realize it was originally built with support from the U.S. military in part to aid in the research and development of ballistic missile defense systems. The National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. agency that presently owns the site, confirmed that the telescope’s triangular-shaped instrument platform, which weighs some 900 tons, had fallen onto the reflector dish over 400 feet below on Dec. 1, 2020. The instrument platform had been suspended above the dish using cables running from three towers, one of which was effectively sheered in half during the collapse. The tips of the other two were reportedly broken off , as well. “The instrument platform of the 305m telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico fell overnight. No injuries were reported,” a post on NSF’s official Twitter account on Dec. 1 read. “NSF is working with stakeholders to assess the situation. Our top priority is maintaining safety. NSF will release more details when they are confirmed.” On Nov. 19, NSF had already announced it would decommission the site following an assessment that showed the structure was too dangerous to operate or even attempt to repair. Cable breaks in August and November had already damaged the dish and raised the risk of collapse substantially. “It sounded like a rumble. I knew exactly what it was,” Jonathan Friedman, who lives near the site and had worked there as a senior research associate for 26 years, told The Associated Press . “I was screaming. Personally, I was out of control…. I don’t have words to express it. It’s a very deep, terrible feeling.” Radio telescopes are primarily designed to collect radio waves emanating from objects in space, or even in the very upper reaches of the Earth’s atmosphere, for various research purposes. They are also capable of “imaging” objects, ranging from galaxies to individual planets to asteroids “near” Earth , using these signals. The Arecibo Telescope as it looked prior to the collapse., NSF The Arecibo’s site origins trace back to the 1950s, when Cornell University proposed its construction to the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which is today known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). A desire to better understand the composition of the ionosphere and how it might impact objects passing through, including ballistic missile reentry vehicles carrying nuclear warheads, was a key reason for its construction. At the time, ARPA was in charge of a broad ballistic missile defense program known as Project Defender . It was believed that nuclear warheads would produce a distinct signature when reentering the atmosphere, making it possible to distinguish them from decoys , so long as that signature could be quickly identified and categorized. The plan was to use the Arecibo Telescope to help gather general, but still valuable information about the ionosphere in support of this effort. ARPA was also interested in using it for various radar-related experiments , as well. The telescope could still function as a general-purpose research tool, too. William E. Gordon , a physicist and astronomer at Cornell, oversaw the telescope design, which originally consisted simply of the large reflector dish. The presence of large sinkholes in and around Arecibo made the area ideal for hosting this massive instrument. However, ARPA was concerned that the initial plan would limit the telescope’s value, since it would have a fixed field of view. This led to further design studies and the eventual construction of the suspended instrument platform with a movable beam-steering mechanism. Work began on the site, which was originally named the Department of Defense Ionospheric Research Facility , in 1960 and operations began at what had been renamed the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory in 1963. In 1973, upgrades were made to increase the telescope’s maximum operating frequency. In 1997, a Gregorian reflector system was installed, allowing for improved focusing of incoming radio waves, along with a more powerful transmitter. This all gave the site the ability to take on a planetary radar role, including watching for potential hazards in space, such as incoming asteroids. The complete Arecibo Observatory complex also eventually included a facility hosting a space-facing laser imaging system and a visitor’s center. A picture of the Arecibo Telescope, circa the 1990s., National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center Cornell University managed the site on behalf of NSF, with additional funding from NASA, between 1963 and 2011. During that time, the site supported various scientific research efforts, including the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. Researchers made their first attempt to contact an extraterrestrial species in 1974. During the Cold War, consideration had also been given to using the site for military intelligence purposes , including scooping up Soviet radar signals after they had bounced off the surface of the moon. The U.S. military did conduct similar indirect signals intelligence collection using fixed “ Elephant Cage ” antenna arrays positioned around the world. In addition, Arecibo had something of a movie career, being the setting for the climactic showdown between Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond and Sean Bean’s Alec Trevelyan in 1995’s GoldenEye . It was also featured in 1997’s Contact , a dramatic film that was based on the real-life SETI program. It made an appearance in the 1995 science fiction horror movie Species and an episode of the hit television show The X-Files , as well. Video game developers also used the site as a set-piece over the years. Despite the obvious and unique value of the Arecibo telescope, which remained the largest such instrument in the world until 2016, when China opened the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), operations had already been in decline for more than a decade before this fateful accident last night. In 2006, NASA stopped providing supplemental funding to support the site, and the NSF officials recommended further slashing the budget for operating and maintaining the facility from $10.5 million in 2007 down to $4 million by 2011. By 2007, the annual budget had already dropped to $8 million and NSF was considering shutting the entire facility down if it could not secure additional outside funding. In 2011, it did strike a deal with SRI International to take over management of the observatory complex from Cornell University and to help support its operation. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused significant damage to the telescope. NSF did not make an effort to restore all of the instrument’s capabilities after the storm, determining that repairs would have cost more than its annual operating budget. The next year, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida took over management of the site in a deal that included providing outside funding to help operate and maintain the site, with the hope that this would secure its future. This, unfortunately, was not meant to be. The first cable failure in August of this year left a 100-foot long tear in the reflector dish and the second cable break in November smashed a larger hole in the dish. There had already been concerns about the stability of the structure after the first cable snapped and the on-site engineering team, in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, subsequently deemed the site unsafe to work in. A look at the cable that snapped in November., NSF Damage to the dish from the cable breaks., University of Central Florida It’s unclear how NSF may now look to replace this lost capability, but, no matter what, the collapse certainly marks a sad end for this particularly unique scientific instrument that was born out of the Cold War.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 27, 2020",Let’s Talk About Remote-Controlled Gun Turrets And The Killing Of Iran’s Top Nuclear Scientist,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior Iranian official has now claimed that Israel killed top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last week using a gun in either a remote-controlled or entirely automated mount on a pickup truck and that no actual human assassins were involved. No hard evidence has been provided to substantiate this assertion, which sounds like it was ripped straight from the 1997 action movie The Jackal , but it’s not entirely implausible. In July, an Israeli company unveiled a man-portable gun turret that it says can scan for and lock on to targets automatically and then be fired by an operator using a wireless, tablet-like device. Ali Shamkhani, a General in Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who serves as Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, made the claim during the funeral procession for Fakhrizadeh earlier today. Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency, which has ties to the IRGC, appears to have first reported these details about the purported remote assassination yesterday. The attack that killed the Iranian nuclear scientist, himself an IRGC officer and who U.S. and Israeli intelligence have assessed to have been in charge of Iranian nuclear weapons development efforts for decades, took place in the city of Absard, less than 50 miles east of the Iranian capital Tehran, on Nov. 27. You can read more about what was known at that time in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on this incident. “The enemy used a completely new method, style, and professional and specialized way to succeed in reaching its goal,” Shamkhani subsequently declared at Fakhrizadeh’s funeral. IRGC General Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council., IRNA Per Shamkhani’s remarks and Fars’ report from Sunday, as well as other news stories from Iranian outlets, Fakhrizadeh was headed with his wife for a weekend in Absard at the time of the attack. The black Nissan sedan they were driving in was part of a four-vehicle convoy. Shortly after the convoy made a turn, an electronically-controlled gun turret located inside a parked blue Nissan pickup truck shot at the sedan carrying Fakhrizadeh. The car came to a stop and the scientist is said to have gotten out, apparently unaware that the sounds he heard of objects hitting the vehicle were actually gunfire. The gun then continued to fire, with bullets hitting Fakhrizadeh in the side and back, including at least one that left his spine severed, according to Fars. A bodyguard, who may have also been in the car, tried to save him by jumping on top of him and was also wounded, per the report. The pickup truck then exploded. It’s unclear how many other casualties there may have been in total. Fakhrizadeh was reportedly rushed to a local medical clinic before being flown by helicopter to a military hospital in Tehran, where he succumbed to his wounds. Other reports have asserted that the gun turret was “controlled by satellite” and that the weapon was recovered and had “the logo and specifications of the Israeli military industry.” No pictures have been released, so far, claiming to show any remains of the gun or its automated mount. What is absolutely important to note here is this version of events almost entirely contradicts Fars’ own initial reporting of the incident, which said that the explosion had occurred first and that a team of gunmen had then killed Fakhrizadeh. This scenario seemed to suggest a complex attack in which the explosive-laden truck was used to first bring the convoy to a halt. That report also claimed that three to four people had died at the scene, including all of the attackers. Other Iranian media reports later said that a dozen gunmen had been involved in the assassination and that a 50-person support team had also been in the country to help carry out the attack. Previous assassinations, including of other Iranian nuclear scientists , attributed to Israel have involved a mixture of bombs mounted on cars and other vehicles, as well as gunmen on motorcycles. The gun turret story feels better suited to a Hollywood blockbuster. It is perhaps most reminiscent of 1997’s The Jackal , in which the titular hitman, played by Bruce Willis, attempts to assassinate the First Lady of the United States using a remote-controlled heavy machine gun concealed inside a minivan. At the same time, as already noted, in July, Israeli company Smart Shooter debuted the newest addition to its SMASH product family , the SMASH Hopper, also known as the Light Remote-Controlled Weapon Station (LRCWS). This system combines a gun equipped with the SMASH 2000 computerized gunsight and a remotely operated mount that the company says can be installed on a tripod or a pedestal mount on the ground or on a vehicle. You can read more about this system in this past War Zone piece all about it. The SMASH Hopper turret on a tripod., Smart Shooter The SMASH 2000 gunsight, which doesn’t require an automated gunmount, already has the ability to automatically detect targets and lock on to them, only allowing the operator to fire when they are most likely to score a hit. You can read more about this sight in this previous War Zone story . SMASH Hopper builds on the inherent capabilities of the SMASH 2000, giving an operator the ability to set the turret to automatically scan and then lock on to targets and then giving the command to fire. The user can also manually operate the turret, if desired. All of this can be done using a tablet-type device either physically connected to the turret via a wire or through a wireless connection. An even lighter weight remotely-operated system, SMASH Hopper Light, is also available with many of the same capabilities. It uses a special, proprietary tripod and has a more limited field of fire than the standard SMASH Hopper when deployed, but it can be carried and emplaced by a single person. SMASH Hopper Light, Smart Shooter Smart Shooter’s promotional images show SMASH Hopper and SMASH Hopper Light fitted with 5.56mm AR-15/M16 pattern carbines . Its product material says that the full-size system, at least, can also accommodate 7.62mm caliber weapons based on the Stoner SR-25 pattern rifle. As such, it’s certainly possible that the hit team could have set up a remotely-operated turret, such as SMASH Hopper, in the Nissan pickup and operated it remotely from somewhere nearby, or even set it to function in a semi-autonomous fire mode, although that seems less likely. Of course, it’s equally possible, if not far more plausible, that Iran, embarrassed that a top nuclear scientist was killed in broad daylight in the middle of the country, is effectively asserting that the assassination succeeded only because its enemies employed “a completely new method” as Shamkhani put it. It’s also possible that both scenarios are partially true. That this new technology was leveraged as part of the hit, but that actual hitman also took part in making sure Iran’s prized scientist didn’t live to see another day. Often times, some sort of diversion can be beneficial in these types of attacks. Having a vehicle ahead open fire with a remote gun turret would certainly qualify for such a diversion. All this being said, the Iranian government has yet to provide any hard evidence to support any of the reported chains of events that led to Fakhrizadeh’s death, whether the attack involved some kind of remote-controlled turret or not. It remains to be seen whether or not any such additional information, including supposed pictures of any weapons used in the attack, will emerge given the broad consensus, inside Iran and elsewhere, that Israel was responsible, regardless of the method. It’s still important to note that the idea that Fakhrizadeh was killed in a remote-controlled ambush of some kind is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. Precisely this type of capability does exist, and not in a big heavy form, and it is indeed manufactured in Israel. This could be all the more reason for Iranian officials to point to this technology as the culprit of the assassination, regardless of any proof it was actually present or not.

Three F-15QAs are currently in Boeing’s flight-test program, with two examples having been dispatched to Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, in California, for intensive trials in November. “This is largely a mission systems and cockpit test effort, focusing on these key areas,” explained Boeing Chief Test Pilot Matt “Phat” Giese, speaking exclusively to The War Zone . “We are going to touch pretty much every aspect of the mission system, and make sure everything is integrated properly for this customer. This is a short part of the overall test program [for the F-15QA], and involves just a few weeks here in Palmdale. There’s some unique things we can do here from a range and airspace capability that we just can’t get at our plant in St Louis, and that’s why we have this mini deployment.” F-15QA turning final at Plant 42 in Palmdale., Dan Stijovich Giese explained that the current test work at Palmdale is designed to ensure that the first F-15QAs are ready for delivery to the customer in 2021. “The key is to clear the critical test points that we can’t get done in St. Louis, so we can support the first ferry next year — that’s what we are driving maturity into the system for.” “The nearby R-2508 range complex is one of the areas we are training in, so you can get the air-to-ground, low-altitude, parts completed. One of the key things out here on the west coast is the Sea Test Range for over-water testing.” Giese said that the Palmdale detachment coincided with the Boeing test team passing the 100 flight test hour milestone across the test fleet of three F-15QAs. An F-15QA is put through its paces during testing at Palmdale in November., Dan Stijovich Giese has been heavily involved in test work related to the Boeing Advanced F-15 . “It was a little nostalgic bringing the F-15QA out here, as it’s been a while since we were here [testing the Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA ]. So it was exciting to get back on the site. It reminds me of the hard work we put in over a seven year period on the Advanced F-15’s digital fly-by-wire [FBW] system.” The F-15SA was the first variant of the Eagle to feature a fly-by-wire system. “I’ve been involved from the very beginning of this new transition, where we took an incremental leap from the — for lack of a better term — “legacy” F-15 to what is now a “digital” F-15, and that happened when we made the first flight of the Saudi jet on February 20, 2013. I was a part of the subsequent testing out here, and that was full envelope — high and fast, low and slow — all the things we had to do to verify the envelope.” The move to fly-by-wire control was a transformational leap for the F-15, and represented one of the biggest upgrades since the very first YF-15A made its maiden flight in June 1972. It meant that the Boeing test team had to effectively start from scratch when it came to evaluating the F-15SA. “The point of the flight-test program for the digital Eagle was to verify the entire flight envelope,” explains Giese. “The Advanced F-15 has new flight control computers, and a new digital architecture — so with the complete redesign we had to go out and verify numbers that had been in the tech orders since the 1970s.” The F-15SA was the first fly-by-wire Eagle, which first flew in 2013., Boeing “We re-validated the envelope, and verified that the performance was as good as or better — in almost all cases better — than [earlier] F-15s. Some of that testing included flutter, where you shake the airplane at very high speeds and at varying altitudes, to determine if there’s going to be any vibrations that are objectionable or cause any structural damage. We did noise and vibration testing, and high angle-of-attack work to demonstrate that the aircraft is not just a good high and fast fighter, but also able to fly slow when the pilot needs to turn hard and point at something. It was as if it was a brand new clean sheet design, and as a test pilot, I was in heaven.” The aim of bringing fly-by-wire to the F-15 was threefold. Reliability, redundancy, and performance. “From a reliability perspective, you have two flight control computers, and each has two channels, plus quadruple inputs to each of the flight control surfaces. A quad-redundant flight control system from the flight control computers to the stabilators provides very high levels of reliability. The mean time between failures for flight control problems rose significantly higher. I can say personally, in the six-plus years of flight-test that I did on the new digital fly-by-wire flight control system, I had zero ground aborts for flight controls.” “In the performance realm, the F-15 has always been awesome at going high and fast — we’re the only jet that gets out to Mach 2.5 — but it’s also a really good low speed, high angle-of-attack fighter if you need to get into the fight in a phonebooth with an adversary. With helmet mounted sights there’s less of a requirement to point at an adversary to prosecute an attack, but if you need to turn, the Advanced F-15 has incredible capability. Throughout the test program I tried to spin this jet, and I was unsuccessful, even with high lateral asymmetry on the platform. This is a very stable, safe, reliable, flight control system.” The F-15QA features the same digital FBW flight control system, as well as two significant developments over the F-15SA — the new cockpit and structural enhancements. The wings and the nose barrel were completed with Boeing’s Full-Size Determinant Assembly [FSDA] production techniques. F-15 FSDA uses a process to eliminate drilling and shimming from assembly by adding fastener holes at the supplier level. This new process significantly reduces rework, increases quality, and leads to improved ergonomics. “It’s reducing parts, it’s easier to install, and it increases the life of the platform,” says Giese. The cockpit of the Advanced F-15 complete with new Large Area Display and low-profile HUD., Boeing “The bedrock of the new cockpit layout is the new all-glass Large Area Display [LAD],” explains Giese. “The test program for the QA is designed to mature this product.” That testing consists of verifying the major mission systems on the aircraft: such as the Raytheon AN/APG-82(v)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, and how the the LAD interfaces with what Giese calls “the heartbeat of the jet” — the ADCP II (Advanced Display Core Processor II) mission computer. “I like to call the LAD my F-15 iPad,” smiles Giese. “It’s a 10×19-inch display that’s fitted in both cockpits, all glass, and it features an infrared [IR] touch display. Both are configurable per cockpit, so my Weapons Systems Officer can set the display in a different way to how I set up my display based on personal preference. There are a couple of different window formats that we have available and they will match the variables of the particular mission. There may be a time I’m on an eight window display, a five window display, or maybe I want two giant 9×9 windows to look at if maybe I’m doing some precise targeting. They can be changed very quickly and what we’re finding in flight-testing is that the very high-resolution color image quality of the screen allows for very precise targeting, monitoring of the sensors, and mission management.” “We have taken a lot of lessons learned from other platforms and rolled them into this LAD technology. You can manipulate the display with a bare or gloved finger, or move individual windows around by tapping and moving them. One of the feedbacks we got from other platforms is that in turbulent environments or if you’re under G, it can be hard to manipulate the touchscreen, so we’ve made everything on the LAD to also be controllable via the Hands-On Throttle-And-Stick [HOTAS] controls — you can move cursors, change the display format — so you don’t have to actually touch the display. Other feedback we got is that some pilots just like to push a button or rotate a knob, so underneath the new low-profile Head-Up Display [HUD] is what’s called the HRCCP [HUD Radio Communications Control Panel]. This features the same digital keypad as on the LAD, so if you want to go old fashioned and hit a button or change a radio channel, you can do that — including under G or in turbulent conditions — as opposed to using the large area touch display capability. It’s the exact same format as on the LAD, so it’s not something else you have to learn.” An F-15QA on approach to Palmdale in November., Dan Stijovich The F-15QA also features the aforementioned new low profile HUD . Giese says: “It’s a little narrower than the previous HUD, more in line with the F-15C in terms of the size. We’ve learned as time moves on that the HUD is being used less and less — especially for tactical things — because we have helmet-mounted displays and the ability to keep eyes out of the cockpit and and display all of that data on a Digital Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System ( D-JHMCS ). So, reliance on the HUD is slowly diminishing. This is the baseline now, so future variants will also feature this low-profile HUD, including the F-15EX.” A lot of the current test work, while meeting Qatari requirements, is de facto applicable to the new F-15EX for the USAF. “It’s a great effort to focus on the Qatari jets, but everything we’re doing here is going to roll into the F-15EX,” Giese endorses. “We are really going to shift our focus to delivering the F-15EX aircraft early next year for the USAF flight-test program. It’s giving us a high confidence level that this is going to be a mature delivery of those first two aircraft to the USAF early next year.” The main difference between the F-15QA and the F-15EX is that the new USAF Eagles will include the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System ( EPAWSS ). In addition, the F-15QA runs a bespoke customer Operational Flight Program (OFP) software, whereas the F-15EX will run OFP Suite 9, which dovetails with the current F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15C standard. It’s designed to promote commonality across the F-15 community. “I can see an operator that can quickly jump from platform to platform because of the commonality between the OFPs,” says Giese. This was one of the key drivers for getting the F-15EX into USAF hands quickly — a ready solution that allows existing F-15C and E personnel to move seamlessly to the new jet with only minimal retraining. Boeing intends to wrap-up F-15QA verification work in time for deliveries next year. The flight-test team will then move over to F-15EX verification testing. The work that is already being completed with the Qatari jets is helping to expedite that process, meaning that the USAF’s new Advanced F-15s will be able to meet the objective of being ready and available on the flightline in very short order — complete with all the latest bells and whistles found on the world’s most impressive Eagles to date, and more.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 16, 2021",Navy Will Spend Around $30 Million To Scrap Fire-Damaged USS Bonhomme Richard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has decided not to repair the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard , which burned for around four days following an explosion in July, suffering major damage as a result. The service decided that neither restoring it to its original configuration nor converting it to a different use were cost-effective options. Instead, it will spend approximately $30 million to scrap it. The Navy made the announcement about the ship’s fate in a call with journalists on Nov. 30, 2020, more than four months after the fire was finally brought under control. An explosion on July 12 touched off multiple blazes that damaged some 60 percent of the ship, which was sitting pier-side in San Diego undergoing maintenance at the time. Over the course of the multi-day incident, 63 sailors and civilian firefighters were injured both as a result of the initial blast and the subsequent firefighting efforts. You can read more about what happened in The War Zone ‘s reporting at the time . The exact causes of the incident remain under investigation, but, in August, the service revealed that it was looking into the possibility of arson being a factor. Additional investigations are ongoing into how the ship’s design, as well the Navy chain of command, responded to the fire in order to glean information that could be used to improve safety systems, including fire suppression equipment, and protocols. “After thorough consideration, the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations have decided to decommission the Bonhomme Richard due to the extensive damage sustained during that July fire,” Navy Rear Admiral Eric Ver Hage, the head of the Navy Regional Maintenance Center and the Director of Surface Ship Maintenance and Modernization at Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), said. “In the weeks and months since that fire, the Navy conducted a comprehensive material assessment to determine the best path forward for that ship and our Navy.” The Navy assessed that it would have cost between $2.5 and $3.2 billion to return Bonhomme Richard to its pre-fire configuration, a process that the service estimated would take between five and seven years to complete in a Gulf Coast shipyard. A less costly repair option that would have resulted in the vessel being reconfigured as a hospital ship or submarine tender would still have likely cost more than a billion dollars and taken five to seven years to complete, a greater expenditure of time and resources than buying an all-new ship for either of these roles. Scrapping the ship will not be without its own costs. The Navy expects to spend around $30 million to break the Bonhomme Richard down, something that will take between nine months and a year to do. The service has already begun the process of salvaging any still usable systems from the remains of the amphibious assault ship, but will not be able to send it off to the shipbreakers until all the investigations are complete. A look at the remains of USS Bonhomme Richard ‘s center island and other portions of the ship after the fires were finally brought under control., USN How the the loss of Bonhomme Richard will impact the Navy’s operations remains to be seen. The ship was one of eight Wasp class vessels, the service’s main type of amphibious assault ship. It also has two new America class amphibious assault ships, as well as a third, the future USS Bougainville , under construction. The Bougainville will be the first example of a distinct subclass, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . In the meantime, the Navy will have to rely on the other seven Wasp class ships, which have the job of moving around Marine Expeditionary Units , sometimes with significant airpower in the form of large detachments of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters. These Amphibious Ready Groups regularly patrol or are otherwise prepositioned around the world, ready to respond to various crises and contingencies on short notice. Admiral Ver Hage said that this reality was definitely taken into consideration when deciding to scrap Bonhomme Richard , but that there were other concerns about how the expenditure of time and resources to repair that ship might have impacted the Navy’s other shipbuilding priorities and other maintenance schedules. The service has been struggling for years now to address significant maintenance backlogs and expand available shipyard infrastructure . “In the end, the decommissioning decision had a number of factors, and one of which was, what would be the impact of the dollars spent and the actual effort to rebuild, what would be the impact on the industrial base? The dollars definitely would disrupt our strategy for investment,” Ver Hage said. “And then from an industrial base perspective, we had concerns that it would impact new construction or other repair work, and we knew that Gulf Coast would be the spot to get the building or the restoration done because of the capacity and their capabilities – but in the end made the decision for multiple factors, as I mentioned, that decommissioning would be the way to go.” A look at some of the fire damage inside the USS Bonhomme Richard ., USN This decision also notably comes as the Navy is pushing a proposed plan to reach a total fleet size of more than 500 ships by 2045, which could include a number of light aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships in a similar role, topics The War Zone has explored on multiple occasions in the past. It is also looking to move away from traditional large amphibious warfare ships toward smaller designs as the Marine Corps pursues its own dramatic overhaul of its force structure, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . All told, the Navy clearly came to the conclusion that sending Bonhomme Richard to meet the scrapper’s torch was the least bad option it had available.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",Australia Teams Up With U.S. To Get Hypersonic Missiles For Its Super Hornets In Five Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia is gearing up to start testing a new air-launched hypersonic missile “within months.” Details of the joint U.S.-Australian program are still emerging but point to a multi-million-dollar effort to develop an air-breathing, long-range missile that could ultimately be carried by a range of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft. The new weapon is due to be formally announced tomorrow and prototypes are being developed together with the United States under the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment, or SCIFiRE. Hypersonic weapons are generally understood to be capable of flying at least five times the speed of sound, giving them faster response time for striking critical targets and making them much harder to defend against than their slower counterparts In an official release , the U.S. Department of Defense noted that “The SCIFiRE effort aims to cooperatively advance air-breathing hypersonic technologies into full-size prototypes that are affordable and provide a flexible, long-range capability, culminating in flight demonstrations in operationally relevant conditions.” “Developing this game-changing capability with the United States from an early stage is providing opportunities for Australian industry,” said Australian Defense Minister Linda Reynolds. “Investing in capabilities that deter actions against Australia also benefits our region, our allies, and our security partners. We remain committed to peace and stability in the region, and an open, inclusive, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.” Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds in the cockpit of an F/A-18 Hornet, flanked by No. 75 Squadron Executive Officer, Squadron Leader Daniel Truitt, and Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld., Commonwealth of Australia “SCIFiRE is a true testament to the enduring friendship and strong partnership between the United States and Australia,” added Michael Kratsios, Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. “This initiative will be essential to the future of hypersonic research and development, ensuring the U.S. and our allies lead the world in the advancement of this transformational warfighting capability.” The ambitious timeline, including missile tests in the coming months, is intended to yield an operationally ready weapon within the next five to 10 years, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald . While Australia has apparently struck a new deal with the United States regarding SCIFiRE in the last few days, this program dates back as long as 15 years. It has included joint research on hypersonic scramjets , rocket motors, sensors, and advanced manufacturing materials. In the past, The War Zone has examined previous U.S. and Australian hypersonic experiments, including the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HiFIRE) program, which you can read more about here . A U.S. Air Force contract announcement as long ago as 2008 indicated that one of the aims of the HiFIRE program was to gather information that could be “applicable to the design of next-generation high-speed strike weapons.” Hypersonic weapons were also among the technologies earmarked for investment in Australia’s Defence Strategic Update and Force Structure Plan that was released earlier this year. That document included provisions for between AUS $6.2 billion and $9.3 billion to be invested in “high-speed long-range strike, including hypersonic research” up to 2040. Other than the fact it will be air-breathing, details of the new hypersonic missile itself are scarce, but it seems clear that it will involve Australian contractors, as the country seeks to build up its high-tech defense industrial base. A meeting between Australia’s Department of Defence and industry representatives is scheduled for this week. The missile is likely to be carried, initially at least, by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jets, but could also potentially be integrated on P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft. An F/A-18F Super Hornet from No. 1 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force., Commonwealth of Australia While the F-35A Lightning II has been mentioned as a possible launch platform, it seems unlikely that a hypersonic weapon would be small enough for internal carriage by the stealth fighter. Lockheed Martin has previously revealed a concept for a variant of its air-launched Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept hypersonic missile, or HAWC, as an external armament option for U.S. Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighters . An artist’s concept of a follow-on to the HAWC missile for the U.S. Navy., Joseph Trevithick It’s notable, too, that efforts are underway in the United States to provide a similar hypersonic capability for the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , with a project run by the Air Force Research Lab and contracted to Boeing, which is working on a dual-mode scramjet design. Separately, Boeing is also engaged in a project developing a ramjet-powered high-speed missile demonstrator for the U.S. Navy, with that service’s F/A-18E/Fs again among the likely carriers. While the initial focus of the SCIFiRE work seems to be firmly on an air-launched missile for the RAAF, Australia is also looking to develop hypersonic weapons for launch from the ground or from warships, and it’s possible that a family of weapons may eventually be developed for different launch platform applications. Australia is the latest nation to move to develop a hypersonic strike missile and development has likely been accelerated in response to China’s increasing activity in the field of long-range hypersonic and ballistic missiles. Australia also has a keen eye on China’s growing ability to threaten different types of targets in the Asia-Pacific region with a variety of weapons. Canberra has already committed to a major overhaul of its defenses in light of China’s military advances, and the tensions between Beijing and the United States, which is Australia’s close military partner and primary provider of aircraft and air-launched weapons. “We must face the reality that we have moved into a new and less benign strategic era — one in which the institutions and patterns of cooperation that have benefited our prosperity and security for decades are under increasing strain,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier this year . Australia’s recalibration of military priorities toward the Asia-Pacific has included the purchase of the highly capable and stealthy AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, from the United States to arm the F/A-18F. That missile travels at subsonic speeds. Now, by moving toward adding hypersonic missiles to the inventory within an ambitious timeframe, Australia is looking to harness significant technological advances as it seeks to maintain its military edge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 18, 2021",The Army Wants To Launch Drone Swarms Behind Enemy Lines From High-Altitude Balloons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is looking at developing a network of high-altitude balloons that would fly in the stratosphere and be able to launch swarms of unmanned aircraft , including those configured as loitering munitions , also known as “ suicide drones ,” over enemy-controlled territory. These lighter-than-air vehicles could also be configured as sensor platforms to collect various kinds of intelligence or deploy other surveillance systems that would fall to the ground in order to monitor hostile movements, as well as act as communications relays. The Army’s Program Executive Office for  Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors, or PEO IEW&S, posted a briefing, which had been presented at a recent industry day event and that showed general depictions of these concepts of operation, on the U.S. government’s top contracting website, beta.SAMG.gov, last week. The balloons are one part of a broader, layered Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS) concept that the Army is in the early stages of developing. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , managed to save a copy of the briefing, which was later taken down, and posted the slides on Twitter . US Army It was previously known that the Army was exploring using balloons floating in the stratosphere, which begins at altitudes ranging from 23,000 to 66,000 feet, depending on where you are on Earth, for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and communications roles. As part of the larger MDSS network, they would fill something of a gap between traditional ground-based and aerial ISR and communications platforms and space-based systems. “Conceptually, with the types of missions that the Multidomain Task Force is working, the high-altitude balloons would be a key capability enabler,” Brent Fraser, head of the Concept Development Division at Space and Missile Defense Center of Excellence, part of the Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), told Defense News in an interview in October. “[The balloons would] be able to provide some beyond-line-of-sight capability, whether it’s communications, extended distances, to be able to provide the ability to enable sensing of targets deep in the adversary’s areas, to be able to reinforce and complement existing sensing systems other than the aerial layer as well as the space layer.” The PEO IEW&S slides, seen earlier in this story and below, show high-altitude (HA) balloons in these roles. When it comes to ISR, they indicate that the lighter-than-air craft could carry electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) suites, as well as radars with synthetic aperture imaging , or SAR, and moving target indicator (MTI) functionality. Though not mentioned, these balloons would also be ideal platforms for carrying electronic warfare jammers and cyber warfare systems . US Army US Army In addition, the slides also depict balloons sending out swarms of drones or deploying unattended ground sensors (UGS). No additional details are provided about the potential capabilities of the swarming drones of the UGSs. It is worth noting that the Army is also in the process of developing air-launched drones, which could be fired from manned or unmanned aircraft , with swarming capabilities to carry out ISR missions and act as loitering munitions, as part of its Air Launch Effects (ALE) program. You can read more about that effort in this previous War Zone story . A US Army UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter launches a drone in an Air Launch Effects-related test in September 2020., US Army The service is also exploring other novel loitering munition concepts, including potentially delivering them via a hypersonic missile as part of a program nicknamed Vintage Racer . The PEO IEW&S slides do notable depict units using missiles in development under the Army’s broad Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) effort to deploy suicide drones, as well as clusters of UGSs, deep into enemy territory. Using balloons for these various roles holds the promise of being able to deploy persistent capabilities in denied or semi-denied areas that could be difficult for an opponent to detect or neutralize. High-altitude balloons have traditionally had relatively small radar signatures and radar reflectors have been employed to make them more visible to reduce the chance of accidents. Electronic warfare packages, as well as using them tactically in concert with other platforms , could help maximize their survivability. These would be cheaper than satellites and potentially less vulnerable than traditional manned or unmanned aircraft. With that in mind, balloons could also serve as at least interim replacements on relatively short notice for certain space-based capabilities, such as communications or navigation , should satellites get destroyed or otherwise disabled during a conflict, which is a very real possibility . The ability to launch UGSs, or even carry out strikes directly on targets they find using individual loitering munitions or fully autonomous swarms, would only make them more flexible and disruptive to enemy operations. A swarm could include ISR-configured drones , as well as those capable of strikes, as well, allowing them to further scout ahead and find new targets on their own. “It’s just phenomenal what we’re able to do with high-altitude balloons,” Army Lieutenant General Daniel Karbler told Defense News in an interview published earlier this month. “I don’t have the cost analysis but, in my mind, pennies on the dollar with respect to doing it. If I had to do it via a [low-Earth orbit] or some satellite constellation, what we are able to provide with high-altitude balloons, it’s tactically responsive support to the warfighter.” Of course, this is hardly the first time that the Army, as well as the U.S. military, as a whole, has explored using lighter-than-air vehicles as sensor platforms or communications relays. The most infamous of these was the abortive Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, or JLENS , which were tethered aerostats carrying radars intended to spot and track incoming low-flying threats, including cruise missiles. In 2015, a JLENS aerostat infamously broke free of its mooring at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, drifted into neighboring Pennsylvania, and caused significant damage to power lines before becoming tangled in a tree. This incident, together with cost growth and delays, contributed to the decision to cancel that program in 2017. Other tethered aerostats carrying search radars, as well as electro-optical and infrared cameras, are still in use to provide surveillance around bases and support counter-drug operations in the Caribbean. However, high-altitude balloons offer the ability to cover a much wider area than aerostats tethered to the ground, that are relegated to specific area surveillance. It’s not the first time that a military, as well as intelligence agencies, have used high-flying balloons for intelligence-gathering purposes, or even to launch attacks, either. During World War II, Japan launched balloons carrying incendiary bombs toward the Pacific Northwest with the hope of starting debilitating forest fires, a strategy that failed to produce any meaningful results. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), among others, employed balloons in the past to try to peer into denied areas, as well as to act as decoys part of a special project to gather information about Soviet radars, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Previously, these kinds of balloon-based systems had been limited in their utility because they were hard to control and could generally only stay aloft for periods measured in hours or days. Technological advancements mean that current generation high-altitude balloons are much easier to deliberately navigate to a desired area and can stay in the air for weeks or months at a time. In August, balloon-maker Raven Aerostar announced that one of its Thunderhead Balloon Systems had demonstrated its ability to stay aloft for 59 days. Personnel work to launch a high-altitude balloon made by Raven Aerostar., US Army The Army’s high-altitude balloon plans are not the only time in recent years that the U.S. military has explored the potential value of these lighter-than-air craft, as well. In 2019, U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) sponsored tests of Raven Aerostar balloons carrying ISR packages at altitudes of 65,000 feet across six states to explore their potential use in counter-drug operations and disaster response, as well as general intelligence collection. The U.S. military isn’t the only one looking into uses for high-altitude balloons, either. Last week, NATO posted a video on YouTube about a project the alliance is conducting in cooperation with the University of New South Wales in Australia to develop a balloon-based radar system, ostensibly for “emergency response and disaster relief” scenarios. Commercial companies have been looking into the use of high-altitude balloons, too. Loon, originally Project Loon, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, notably offers high-altitude balloons to help provide cell phone and internet service in remote areas or in the wake of a natural disaster . The Army is still very much in the early stages of defining exactly what it might want from its balloon-based concepts of operation. “We’re in the initial stages of defining what those requirements would be,” Army Colonel Tim Dalton, a space and high altitude capability manager at SMDC’s Space and Missile Defense Center of Excellence, recently told Defense News . “There’s kind of two aspects to the high-altitude piece: the high-altitude platform, so it’s the balloon, and then whatever it’s carrying on there for a payload.” From the briefing slides that have now emerged online, it seems clear that the Army is already looking at using high-altitude balloons in a number of different roles, including as platforms to deploy swarms to strike behind enemy lines.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Mar 17, 2020",Check Out This AC-130 Gunship Pilot Wearing A Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s known that pilots that fly the AC-130W Stinger II gunship wear the Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display , but we haven’t seen much imagery showing it in use. Now, thanks to photos released from exercise Gulf Sentry, which was held last week in the Persian Gulf off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, we have a great shot of a pilot of the gunship not just wearing Scorpion, but the improved variant of the helmet-mounted display, known as HObIT, or Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker. HObIT more accurately tracks pilot head movements compared to the original version of the Scorpion. The HObIT system is an upgrade for the Thales Visionix Scorpion helmet and it features a new monocle with updated symbology. The helmet also employs a new Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) optical head tracker that works in tandem with a group of small circular stickers that are placed on the interior of the cockpit to seamlessly track the pilot’s head movements even if the helmet moves out of the optical tracking zone. Thales The Thales helmet has already been incorporated into a number of aircraft types for both air-to-air and air-to-ground applications, with the AC-130W fielding the system after the A-10C Thunderbolt II. It now has an increasing number of applications including the upgraded F-5ATs of contract aggressor company Tactical Air Support Inc., which you can read all about here . The War Zone also recently reported how the Scorpion helmet was tested by pilots flying the U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor . A close-up view of the AC-130W pilot wearing the Scorpion helmet., U.S. Air Force/SrA Duncan Bevan Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) AC-130Ws are converted C-130H transports, and their crews continue to use holographic rifle sights to provide a relatively simple way of lining up the gunship in a pylon turn against targets on the ground. You can read more about this arrangement of an off the shelf system for this unique application in this previous War Zone article . The addition of the Scorpion helmet will provide Stinger II pilots with an enhanced ability to more accurately target weapons and improve a pilot’s situational awareness. It displays full-color symbology in front of the pilot’s eye and is linked in with the aircraft’s sensors and data-links so that targets and other objects of interest, as well as primary flight data, are displayed in an augmented reality fashion all around the pilot.  It’s a major advance for the USAF’s gunships, with Air Force Special Operations Command’s new AC-130J Ghostrider set to field the same system. AC-130W sips gas from a KC-135E., USAF Older AC-130s, such as the now-retired AC-130H and U models, had a sideways-looking Head-Up Display (HUD) for the pilot in order to help train the aircraft’s guns on a specific target area. This was in addition and/or in cooperation with the aircraft’s advanced sensors and computer systems. It was a case of having to fly the aircraft in a manner to enable the weapons to be employed — much like a 17th-century warship with a Broadside that featured a battery of cannons. As well as the aerial gunners in the cargo bay, the crew members in the cockpit could also fire some of those weapons themselves, if necessary. An aerial gunner operates the AC-130W’s GAU-23/A 30mm cannon., U.S. Air Force/SrA Duncan Bevan The AC-130W is armed with the GAU-23/A 30mm Bushmaster II cannon and a devastating 105mm Howitzer, but it can also call upon an array of smart weaponry to rain down all manner of lethal effects. This includes AGM-176 Griffin air-to-ground missiles and GBU-44 Viper Strike munitions that can be deployed via its rear ramp. The AC-130W can also fire AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and drop GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs. You can read more about the AC-130W’s range of armaments here . An inflatable target is attacked by an AC-130W during the recent exercise., U.S. Air Force/SSgt Timothy Clegg Exercise Gulf Sentry was held between the United States and the United Arab Emirates Joint Aviation Command (JAC) from Aug. 9-12 exercised the mission of Air Operations in support of Maritime Surface Warfare (AOMSW) in the Arabian Gulf . An AC-130W assigned to U.S. Special Operations Central Command (SOCCENT) worked alongside Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) who were responsible for directing live fires at simulated targets. A media release said: “It gave Emirati and U.S. pilots a chance to hone strike capabilities together against surface targets such as maritime infrastructure and fast attack craft.” An aerial gunner removes a casing from the 105mm Howitzer onboard an AC-130W Stinger II., U.S. Air Force/SrA Duncan Bevan For the AC-130 crew, this exercise appears to have provided an excellent opportunity to exercise the AC-130W’s firepower in a maritime environment, and it wasn’t the first time it did so in recent months. The need to strike large numbers of small craft in the Arabian and Persian Gulfs is a burgeoning requirement for U.S. Central Command. This kind of air-sea training reflects the need to rehearse a vital Persian Gulf mission, underscored by the ongoing tensions with Iran in the Strait of Hormuz. Equipped with a wide range of new tech weaponry, that can now be more quickly and effectively employed by the AC-130W crew, means the gunship continues to prove its worth. Blending the Scorpion helmet-mounted display with that impressive airborne arsenal makes the AC-130 an even deadlier attack platform that can unleash its killer blows faster and more accurately than ever before.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jul 21, 2020",F-15 Eagle Pilot Explains Exactly How He Downed Three Migs During Two Wars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Retired U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle pilot Colonel Cesar “Rico” Rodriguez has an incredible story to tell. In his 26-year service career, he played important roles in two major air wars. Remarkably, it’s almost 30 years since “Rico,” who still goes by his Air Force callsign, first sat in the cockpit of his McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle ready to go to war on a sweltering night in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Operation Desert Storm was the first chapter in his incredible story. “Rico” and his fellow Eagle “drivers” etched one of the most fearsome reputations in combat aviation as an invincible band of lethal airborne enemy aircraft slayers. Of the 32 air-to-air kills by Eagles of that war, two were his. He was part of the 58th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS), and strapped to his jet were four live AIM-7M Sparrow radar-guided air-to-air missiles and four shorter-range AIM-9M Sidewinders. Eight years later he would fly another fully armed F-15 into combat, this time with new weapons and upgraded systems, in the skies over Kosovo as part of Operation Allied Force. Here he would notch up his third kill. Today, he recounts his extraordinary experiences in the cockpit of the Eagle to help new recruits understand the importance of training and striving for excellence. It was what prepared him when he went into combat at very short notice. Rodriguez and his fellow Eagle pilots knew instinctively what to do, a fact that he emphasized in his exclusive interview with The War Zone . The path to the Eagle cockpit Speaking from his office in Tucson, Arizona, “Rico” tells us how he always dreamed of flying F-15 Eagles, but that he was still honored to initially be awarded a place on a Basic Course learning how to fly the A-10 Thunderbolt II . “I got to fly some very complex and demanding missions as an A-10 pilot in Korea for two years. I had almost 900 hours of “Hog” flying in that time — which is pretty amazing.” When he subsequently went back to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico as an instructor for lead-in fighter training, he did so with an eye on the prize of an F-15 cockpit. “I started to add more air-to-air backseat rides in the T-38 during CT [Continuation Training] with former F-15 pilots and we could fly against F-15s from the squadron across the street at Holloman. It really helped me to build my three-dimensional situational awareness picture of the air-to-air mission using my eyes and ears. It helped me immensely when I eventually got selected to go to Tyndall [Air Force Base, Florida] to start a short F-15 transition course.” “The F-15C is a very complex weapons system. I was able to employ the training I’d already established, but now as a young F-15 pilot,” he continued. “When you start to apply the intricacies of HOTAS [Hands-On Throttle And Stick] controls and the physical demands of flying a jet without a G limiter, plus adding the visual feed of the radar and the audio lead of the radar warning receiver, then you can start understanding how to max-perform the Eagle.” An F-15C pilot eases back from a tanker during a mission in the Middle East., U.S. Air Force/MSgt Larry Reid Jr. “Rico” completed Eagle school and joined the 58th TFS, the “Gorillas,” at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1989. He then began working through his Mission Qualification Training. This is the process junior pilots must work through on an operational unit to progress from being a wingman, through two-ship lead, four-ship lead, and ultimately become a mission commander. “Little by little I started to feel more comfortable in the jet,” he says. When “Rico” arrived at the 58th TFS, the squadron commander Lieutenant Colonel Francis “Paco” Geisler had assembled an impressive team that was stacked with weapons officers and a huge amount of collective experience. “We had a very strong squadron, both in terms of hours and capability. It included Captains John ‘JB’ Kelk, Rick ‘Kluso’ Tollini, and Robert ‘Cheese’ Graeter. The mindset was that we were going to be the baddest guys in the air — it was never a cakewalk.” In the summer of 1990, Rodriguez led a detachment to Gulfport, Mississippi, in support of some Missouri Air National Guard F-4E Phantom IIs that were on their squadron’s “fini” deployment before transitioning to the Eagle. “We had eight jets and a full maintenance contingent there for a week. It was the final day and we did an 8-v-16 air-to-air mission — it was their take on World War Three! We did everything to give them a chance to see what the F-15 could do and that last day was full-up beyond visual range — all the handcuffs were off!” “When we landed we had planned one heck of a party, but the crew chiefs came over to my jet and said they’d received word from Eglin that we weren’t to party. As a matter of fact, we had to pack our bags and get back home that evening.” “They put the tanks back on the jets and we left for Eglin, taking off into the approaching sunset.” “We all flew straight-in approaches, and as I rolled down the runway I looked right and could see huge activity all over our flight line — I’d never seen it so alive in my life. It was wall-to-wall F-15s armed with live [AIM-7] Sparrows and AIM-9M [Sidewinders].” “Once we got to the squadron building we were told that we’d been put on deployment orders. The CO said: “We don’t have a date yet, but go home and put yourselves into crew rest.” A pair of 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing F-15Cs fly with a Royal Saudi Air Force F-5E during Operation Desert Shield., U.S. Air Force/SrA Chris Putnam On Aug. 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Kuwait. U.S. President George H. W. Bush ordered ground, sea, and air forces to Southwest Asia to stabilize the region and persuade Saddam to withdraw his invasion force. For “Rico” and the rest of the 58th TFS, it was a tense time. “We sat tight and did a lot of mission study plus briefings relative to the Iraqi air order of battle and GBAD [Ground-Based Air Defenses]. We were tweaking our tactics based on the threat intel we had.” “Paco” Geisler had turned the “Gorillas” over to Lieutenant Colonel William “Tonic” Thiel — but not before he’d assembled a team that was fully prepared and ready to go to war. Heading to Saudi Arabia Thiel was notified shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that his squadron was tasked to deploy and he was ready to send 769 personnel and 24 F-15C Eagles. “Rico” picks up the story: “They informed us there would be two Eagle squadrons deploying; us and F-15s from Langley [Air Force Base, Virginia]. When we planned the deployment a big hurricane was building in the Atlantic Ocean, which meant the northern route around Greenland and the United Kingdom was out for us. So they built a huge tanker bridge literally right around the Equator so we could go the long way to Saudi Arabia. There were several spots on that bridge where if we couldn’t take gas from the tanker, the only option was to bail-out near a boat in the Atlantic.” A lot of that Atlantic crossing involved flying in bad weather. As we hit the eastern Atlantic we refueled over the Strait of Gibraltar, staring straight at the rising sun. Our last tanker bracket was over Egypt and from there we headed into Saudi Arabia. An F-15C pilot from the 58th Tactical Fighter Squadron inspects an AIM-9M prior to launching from Eglin AFB at the start of Operation Desert Shield., U.S. Air Force/SSgt Taylor It was late August, and really hot when we landed. From the time I strapped into the jet at Eglin until I got out in Tabuk it was about 22 hours — it was one of those days that never ended, people had to be literally craned out of the cockpits. We put birds on alert within 48 hours of arriving and were manning alert CAPs [Combat Air Patrols] and undertaking a couple of ATOs [Air Tasking Orders]. Initially, it wasn’t 24/7 CAPs; we flew when some kind of high-value asset was in the air. It took a little while before we set up round-the-clock ops around the AOR [Area Of Responsibility]. We saw the Iraqis launch [MiG-25] Foxbats and they were our main concern in the Desert Shield phase ahead of the main Operation Desert Storm. They executed their launch profiles really nicely. If we didn’t exercise “Grinder” tactics properly we wouldn’t be at the right altitude to take a shot at them —  we might need to turn before the Iraqi border. “Grinder” involved us having one group of F-15s “hot” [radar pointing at the target] and one group “cold” [flying away from the target]. We had to grind ourselves back far enough, with enough distance, so that when it looked there was a true commit from them across the border, we could jettison our tanks and climb into the high 50s [nearly 60,000 feet] and have a high enough Mach number to launch our AIM-7s. It took time for us to talk to the E-3 AWACS to help us get to the right shoot box should the opportunity present itself. Flying as two-ships and four-ships presented one of the true lessons of Desert Storm — pairing up your teams. It was a myth that we had more than enough pilots, we didn’t, but we needed experience in the teams. By pairing us up in combat it gave us the flexibility to fly whatever schedule was given to us. Once the war kicked off, all the wingmen were at least two-ship flight lead, so they could become number three if required. An F-15C down low over the desert carrying live AIM-7 Sparrows and AIM-9M Sidewinders., U.S. Air Force Only on one occasion did we break up our pairs. The four-ship meant we could fly any mission — Offensive Counter Air [OCA] and Defensive Counter Air [DCA] and if we were on the ground, one could act as the SOF [Supervisor Of Flying], one could sit “Top Three” — on the ops desk — and the other two could help with the mission planning cell.” Eagles into the storm At midnight on Jan. 17, 1991, the assembled Eagles both at Tabuk, and the jets from Langley at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, joined forces on the first night of Operation Desert Storm with a surprise attack over Baghdad. Their mission was to clear the skies of Iraqi fighters over the capital and open a “lane” for the strike force. The first wave of missions saw Captain “JB” Kelk from the “Gorillas” claim the first aerial “kill” of the war for the Eglin Eagles, downing a MiG-29 Fulcrum with an AIM-7 Sparrow. That same night, Captain Rhory “Hoser” Draeger and U.S. Marine Corps exchange officer Captain Charles “Sly” Magill took out a pair of MiG-29s near Baghdad before Captain “Cheese” Graeter then claimed two Dassault Mirage F1s. F-15Cs from the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing deployed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia., U.S. Air Force “Rico” takes up the story: “I flew the very last mission of Desert Shield before we moved into Desert Storm. We got a couple of hours of sleep and came in to fly a couple of DCA missions on day one. On Jan. 19, again I was on DCA in the western sector [flying F-15C 85-0114], protecting the high-value assets in what was known as HVACAP, but then me and my wingman Captain Craig “Mole” Underhill were switched to OCA. A strike package was supposed to be supported by the Langleys, but they had to weather-cancel. So they scrambled F-15s from Tabuk to be the OCA four-ship, led by Rick Tollini. The mission commander said to leave a two-ship DCA in the CAP and take two DCA birds forward to become the post-strike OCA for the strike package. “Mole” and I went to the tanker, got on the frequency with Rick, and his four-ship for the final briefing from the mission commander — it was a push. We were on the tanker still pressing north when Tollini and his flight engaged a variety of threats. They ended up getting two “kills” in the early stage of the push. They ended up jettisoning their external fuel tanks, which meant they no longer had enough gas to get to the target area and then come home. So, the mission commander committed the group forward with “Mole” and I at the tail-end to climb up and start building a radar picture in front of the strike package — taking the role of lead OCA. As we built that radar picture we had one unknown contact extremely far in the north and west. Then eventually we developed a second contact northeast and east, which was the closest to us and originated out of the Baghdad area. As we were proceeding forward on track we handed over the western contacts to our AWACS controller to monitor, we were going to put our radars into the eastern group. As we started to commit on that group, elements of our strike package were starting to hit their targets. The eastern group came at us in what we call a Res [resolution] Cell, meaning we couldn’t break them out at the long-range with our radar. Eventually, we could see it was a two-ship, slightly echelon formation, to the north-northwest, and as we got close they went from close to a tactical formation. Then, low and behold they executed the tactic that all of our Red Flag exercise debriefs had told us about. There were known blind zones in our mechanically-scanned radar and these guys went into the notch at exactly the right range, so we lost our locks on them for a while. As they started to “drag” [give the impression they were leaving the engagement], we picked them up again. We were now inside the Sparrow WEZ [Weapon Engagement Zone], but if we were going to take a shot we were going to have to follow them for a long time [to support guidance of the missile]. The MiGs went into a “beam” maneuver [perpendicular to our track] and held it for what felt like 15 secs, then turned and “dragged” again. They weren’t in afterburner, and we were coming out of high altitude, so we could have easily run them down. Meanwhile, the last striker called “Millertime,” meaning he was going to drop, so OCA was technically no longer required. An F-15C drops away from the tanker during a Combat Air Patrol during Desert Storm., U.S. Air Force Just as I was about to call for “Mole” and I to abort, we got a radio call from the AWACS who said: “Citgo, pop-up contacts 330 for 8.” That was the bearing and range off of my jet, which put them in the 9-9:30 clock position for me. It was outside my radar field-of-view so I snapped to heading 330 — I don’t remember reaching down and jettisoning my fuel tanks, but I did. As I turned my jet was immediately enveloped in vapor around the wings. “Mole” saw this and my fuel tanks flying off, and he initially thought that I’d been hit. I rolled out on 330 with my auto guns system on and boom, I got a lock right at eight miles. Very quickly I started to do an identification “matrix” on the threat [to find out what it was]. However, I immediately knew that this was not going to be valid because we had rules of engagement that required anything inside of 10 miles to be visually identified. The rules were written like this due to our ability with the radar in certain scenarios to “see” the F-117 Nighthawk . In hindsight, the way you write that is: when you are operating with an F-117, or at night in conjunction with an F-117, if you have a lock inside of 10 miles you have to identify it. It was re-written the next day. Even when the fighter gave me a hostile lock it still wasn’t sufficient grounds to take a shot based on the ROE. I started thinking defensively, talking to “Mole” to get him to do his “matrix.” He was outside of 10 miles and could, therefore, meet the full intent, plus he had augmentation from an RC-135 Rivet Joint electronic warfare aircraft, which helped him out. I came out of 30,000 feet, rolled the airplane inverted and pointed my nose at the ground, dispensing chaff to decoy the threat away me, and my main aim was to get below his radar field of view and into the ground clutter. As I passed through 5,000 feet I became concerned about hitting the ground, so I leveled off under 1,000 feet. I could see his lock on my RWR. [I found out later that between the Rivet Joint and my electronic warfare that his radar was being jammed appropriately and as a result he couldn’t employ any of his weapons against me]. When “Mole” finished up and got confirmation of the target being hostile, he took a shot. I looked over my left shoulder and saw his Sparrow come off the jet and pull towards my high six o’clock. It stopped burning and I was straining to see the target. The smoke trail from his missile was a bit like a pointer. I took the trailing edge and followed it, and there I found the MiG-29, about three miles off my right wing. “Mole’s” missile hit him smack in his face and it turned the aircraft into what looked like a huge sparkler in the sky under the high noon sun. I called “splash one,” and as I did the AWACS came back: “second group north 10.” We had a couple of options. The AWACS was notoriously about three miles off in their range estimations. So it could have been 13 miles or seven miles. We could have turned south and never seen the contact, but we decided to turn north. “Mole” was up in the high 20s and I was down very low. We would force the fighter to commit to one of us. As it turned out he didn’t lock either of us and on seeing him it allowed me to do a vertical lead turn on him from low to high to visually confirm him as hostile. There were times it looked like an F-15, times it looked like an F/A-18, and it wasn’t until I passed about 50 feet off of his left wing that I was able to confirm it was a brown and green MiG-29 with the Iraqi flag on the fins. I started to gain some angles on him and the dogfight ensued. First merge I had angles on him. The next time at the 180-degree point of the circle I’d gained 90 degrees of angles on him, but I didn’t have a clear shot. The engagement started at 8,000 feet and it was coming downhill fast. By the time I got my closure rate under control on the outside of the circle I was then coming back to the inside to get a sweet shot. He was at about 400 feet and I was 600-700 feet above the desert. I pulled to the inside of the circle to put my ASE [Aeronautic Steering Engagement] on him. That’s the aiming section for the AIM-7. There’s a dot in the HUD [Head-Up Display] and if you put the dot inside the ASE, you had a valid shot. I was still about 1,400 feet behind the MiG, but I wasn’t thinking about using the gun. He suddenly rolled inverted from 300 feet and started a Split-S maneuver, and of course, that wasn’t going to work for him. He hit the desert floor and ended up tumbling in a big fireball. This Iraqi MiG-29 was destroyed on the ground during Operation Desert Storm., U.S. Air Force/SSgt Jose Otero I got back together with “Mole” and we headed back to the tanker. Unbeknown to me, when my body reaches a level of adrenaline in a life and death situation I go into a severe series of tremors and shakes. So when we came out of this fight and got on the tanker to get some gas I thought it was time to start relaxing. I suddenly started to feel significant vibrations, and at first, I thought it was something wrong with the jet. I let go of the stick and grabbed the towel racks [hand grab rails on the canopy arch] and the jet leveled off and all was fine. It felt like forever, but was probably only a minute or so of serious convulsions going through my body. I didn’t think anything of it and certainly didn’t tell the flight doc! As we were coming home I said to “Mole” that I thought it was the right time to do a low approach, kick in the burners and do an aileron roll. As it turned out, we got a pretty good ass-chewing from our wing commander for that hot-dogging. Back on the flight line I remember my crew chief wondering how I had managed to get a “kill” with all my missiles still on the jet! We debriefed as a pair with the intel team and the mission planning cell for the report that went to CENTCOM [U.S. Central Command] and we were back flying the very next day. Celebration wasn’t really part of the calculation. We didn’t really see each other from the other four-ships. After “JB” and “Cheese” got their “kills” on night one, I don’t remember seeing them for almost a week. We used to say we operated on “leadership by sticky notes.” That’s how any congratulations were communicated — via a note stuck to our flight gear in life support.” Second “kill” Over the next few days, “Rico” and his associated four-ship flew a mixture of planned and alert scramble missions. He takes up the story: “Typically we were flying two or three times a day. If you were on alert, you tried to get a little sleep. Generally, the flow was to get between four and six hours of sleep in between each working day. On Jan. 26, I was flying “114” again and that day it was really only the F-15Cs and the high-value assets like the AWACS that were up — the weather was terrible. That day was the first time I’d changed my wingman. Our formation was led by Captain Rhory Draeger, with Captain Tony “Kimo” Schiavi, myself as number three and my wingman was Captain Bruce “Roto” Till. We were way up north of Baghdad when we got a radio call that there was activity in the area of H2 Air Base, which was way out to the west. Rhory re-formed us in the traditional “Wall-of-Eagles.” We were very high, and I thought we’d never see anything that we’d be able to shoot at, but our AN/APG-63 radar had no problem “seeing” through the weather, and we could fire AIM-7s through the clouds as well. Rodriguez straps into F-15C 85-0114 at Tabuk with his first MiG-29 “kill” already painted under his name., U.S. Air Force/TSgt Fernando Serna About 25 miles from where we’d calculated the merge would take place we saw a huge sucker hole in the clouds and could see the ground. We all dived through it and came out at around 15,000 feet. We continued to dive down to around 10,000 feet while tracking the Iraqi fighters that were flying a very low level at about 400 knots, navigating along a major highway in a Vic formation [one aircraft leading, with one on either side in echelon]. As soon as we came through the clouds I could see through my target detection (TD) box in the HUD a small dot that little by little built into the silhouette of a MiG-23 Flogger. We “sorted” the target group in F-15 standard procedure, which means the flight lead takes the enemy leader, the number two takes the northern contact and I took the southern guy, while the number four pilot searched around us [for any other contacts]. We were completing our ID “matrix” when we received information from the AWACS that a U.K. Special Operations guy out in the desert had earlier visually confirmed three MiG-23s were moving on the flight line at H2. He’d passed the information to the E-3 crew with the proper authentication — so we had a human intelligence, as well as our own electronic identification. We also found out later, via the special ops guy, that one of the MiG pilots was a cousin of Saddam Hussein. With the targets confirmed, Rhory took his shot and I saw the missile come off the rail and quickly accelerate down toward the desert floor. It leveled off at around 50 feet — the same altitude as the MiGs. “Kimo” fired his Sparrow and then I fired mine. The first missile appeared to pass the lead MiG, but soon it became apparent that it had flown close enough to do some kind of damage as the jet started turning and trailing smoke, before catching fire. Rhory pulled off to the north and uncaged a Sidewinder ready to hit him again, but as he did the MiG blew up. An AIM-7 Sparrow streaks away from an F-15., U.S. Air Force/TSgt Michael Ammons In the meantime, the two Iraqi wingmen checked south and in doing so heated up the intercept with our missiles. Nearly simultaneously both missiles hit their respective targets and both MiGs crashed either side of the highway in two huge fireballs. I suspect the MiGs never knew we were there until the leader was hit. They had flown a comms-out launch and were using the road to navigate their way to Baghdad to get fuel before continuing onwards to Iran, where a lot of Iraq’s fighter aircraft had fled. This intercept continues to be used in the training environment as what people call “the classic.” We used minimum communication, we had near-perfect radar synchronization in the four-ship for sorting and targeting the MiGs. People who have heard the [cockpit recorder] tapes always ask how Rhory and I remained so calm as we got ready to shoot missiles? I tell them that there’s a certain calmness there because we’d both been there before — for both Rhory and I these were our second kills.” Rodriguez says that as the war progressed, the F-15C’s prowess led to more pilots becoming keen to put their training into practice and claim more aerial victories. It was what he called “MiG-itis.” Overall the 58th TFS claimed 16 aerial victories in Operation Desert Storm, more than any other unit. With 32 overall “kills,” the F-15C had proved its ability to surgically target and eliminate the enemy fighters with impunity. Col Rick Parsons was the commander of the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing during Desert Storm and he claimed a “kill” on February 7, 1991., U.S. Air Force/Don S. Montgomery The third “kill” — Operation Allied Force NATO launched Operation Allied Force in 1999 in response to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic’s campaign of “ethnic cleansing” of Kosovar Albanians. Although NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana did not authorize airstrikes against Serbia until Jan. 30, the USAF had already worked up several potential air campaigns. When it was finally decided, Allied Force was to be an operation designed to force Milosevic’s withdrawal from Kosovo. With the use of ground troops rejected by NATO, an air campaign was designed to focus on the Serbian air defense systems and otherwise employ strikes against Serbian military targets. The first attacks of the campaign began on the night of Mar. 24, 1999, as aircraft from 13 member countries, including U.S. Air Force B-52s and B-2s, launched the initial phase of attacks under what the U.S. military called Operation Noble Anvil. “Rico” takes up the story. An F-15C from the 493rd Fighter Squadron takes on fuel at night during Operation Allied Force., U.S. Air Force “I was by now a Lieutenant Colonel as the 48th Fighter Wing’s Chief of Safety, and flew F-15Cs with the resident 493rd Fighter Squadron, the “Grim Reapers.” We deployed as the only F-15C squadron to support the operation. We didn’t have the airplanes or the manpower to truly support all the ATOs [Air Tasking Orders] that were being contemplated for Allied Force, so it was literally a case of needing to get everyone downrange. The wing commander deployed me as Chief of Safety and as a mission commander, and four-ship flight leader. We took jets from our home base at RAF Lakenheath, U.K. to Cervia Air Base, Italy, and we also had jets deployed to Turkey that we moved a couple of weeks before the war was projected to kick off to give us a complement of 22 Eagles. In the latter stages of Desert Storm, the 58th TFS had been the first unit to receive the new AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile [AMRAAM]. It had been on the drawing board and we’d trained some tactics before the war. Compared to the standard of the jets that we flew in Desert Storm, the F-15C had moved on significantly. Post-Desert Storm we had worked with industry and requested some upgrades. Now we all had AMRAAM, plus some changes to the cockpit because we found that we were flying some really long missions. That included things like improving the HOTAS to avoid having to reach around the cockpit too much, but we still didn’t have a data-link or Night Vision Goggles. Once settled in Italy, we started flying Initially in the DCA role, but that eventually evolved into full-up combat operations. We generally had three main areas of operations. One in the north along the Hungarian border. One in the center abeam the capital Belgrade, and one to the south where all the atrocities were taking place and where most of the strikers were going. So there we were tasked to maintain open flight lanes for them. An F-15C from the 493rd Fighter Squadron flies alongside a MiG-29 from the Slovak Air Force., U.S. Air Force/TSgt Brad Fallin Serbian air activity was sporadic, but it indicated to us that we were dealing with a far more mature threat than we had seen in Iraq, especially with the Integrated Air Defense Systems [IADS] they were employing. You might be on CAP in an area you thought didn’t have an IADS, then all of a sudden your RWR would light up like a Christmas tree and you’d have a different Surface-to-Air-Missile [SAM] indication in every quadrant! For the opening night of the campaign, I was in F-15C 86-0169, which we called “The Love Machine.” As we got to our jets at Cervia, our intelligence officer came out to provide us with an updated Electronic Order of Battle. It included details of two MiG-29s that been seen in Belgrade, but were no longer there. From a tactical perspective, it didn’t change our planning — we were prepared to fight a highly maneuverable target set with an all-aspect radar and infra-red-guided missile. But it was great situational awareness for us because the general thinking was that the Serbian MiG-29s were only interested in protecting the capital. We launched across the Mediterranean and hooked a left turn up the Adriatic. The flight lead and his number two were on the western side, with me and my wingman to the east. Our plan was to get to our point of protection near Montenegro and set up an east-to-west corridor for the strikers to start going in. It also coincided that it in a straight line from our lane was the town of Pristina, where Slatina Air Base had underground storage for aircraft. I was flying from south to north and I could see between the mountain peaks an occasional radar blip for a contact that was moving northbound, but I could never lock it up. The aircraft seemed to be hiding in the mountains while trying to build some situational awareness with his ground-controlled intercept operator so they could snap him onto a vector to go against the leading edge of the strike package we were protecting. Once he started to climb above the ridgeline at around 11,000 feet, he became a clear target. I locked him up at about 50 miles from me. I tried to engage my AWACS controller, but he was a little perplexed and not quite as prepared as he should have been. He was asking more questions than he was providing answers. As I was monitoring and tracking it, it came to a point where it was no longer in our best interests to let this guy go unchallenged. I’d done everything an F-15 could do to positively identify the target, and I was 99.9% sure it was a MiG-29 and that it had come out of Slatina, but the current rules of engagement specified that the AWACS had a vote in the identification “matrix.” When it became clear he couldn’t get his vote to me in time, I took the shot. USAF The AMRAAM shot was beyond 35 miles, and about the time I took it, my wingman started to get locked-up by SAMs in the area, so I cleared him off to the west. The missile appeared to be guiding well and I didn’t feel I needed to take a second shot. As it was counting down in the HUD with five seconds until impact I got my eyes on the bearing and range of the threat and began to move away from the SAMs — by now some of the indications I had in my cockpit indicated full lock and I was sure they were getting really close to shooting some missiles at me. Sure enough, the timer indicated zero and to the split second the fireball ensued at about 15 miles in my two o’clock position. It was a dark night and it was like they’d suddenly turned all the lights on in a row of stadiums at once, with the explosion reflected against the snow-covered mountains. Having downed a MiG-29, Rodriguez then supported B-2s in a strike on Serbian positions., U.S. Air Force/MSgt Matthew Plew The MiG-29 “splash” occurred about seven minutes into our 50-minute VUL. We also had a follow-on 20-minute VUL to protect a flight of B-2s that were coming in from the south. Once all the strikers exiting the area, we were the last to leave.” An enduring legacy The 493rd FS notched up four “kills” during Allied Force, with Captain Mike Shower claiming a MiG-29 as it got airborne from Batajnica Air Base on the opening night, followed by Captain Jeff Hwang who claimed a double MiG-29 “kill” on Mar. 26. Rodriguez subsequently moved to Headquarters, Air Combat Command, and was then promoted to full Colonel, moving to Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, to become the deputy Operations Group Commander. He retired from the USAF in 2003 after 26 years, having accumulated some 1,700 flight hours in the F-15. He has worked for Raytheon since 2006 and is now the Vice President for Global Requirements and Capability in the Middle East for Raytheon Missiles and Defence. The two “kill’ markings are still proudly carried on F-15C 85-0114, which is now assigned to the 44th Fighter Squadron., U.S. Air Force/SrA Giovanni Sims His incredible combat record makes him one of only three post-Vietnam triple “MiG-killers,” and the only one of these to have claimed them in two separate campaigns. He concludes: “Being a fighter pilot is still the most dangerous profession in the world. When you’re in that zone as a young Captain with 300 hours under your belt, you truly feel like you are a part of that jet. Seeing ‘114’ still on operations , currently deployed to the Middle East as part of the 44th Fighter Squadron out of Kadena Air Base, Japan, she looks like the same bird on the outside, but internally she is very different. F-15Cs today fly with a new Active Electronically Scanned Array [AESA] radar, a Fighter Data-Link, and the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod to allow them to visually identify targets at long-range. Her maintenance team is taking great care of her. Back then and to this day, the F-15C is what I call a ‘badass machine’ that can own the sky with the right training and maintenance supporting her.” USAF Contact the author: jamie@thedrive.com Jamie Hunter Contributor History News & Features People"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Stick a torpedo inside a casing through a hatch on one end, close the hatch, and then fire it out the other end of the casing via another hatch. Seems simple enough, right? Well, that laughably simplified description of what is involved in firing ‘fish’ from a submarine is horrible, but not to worry, because we now have one that is way, way better. The highly popular SmarterEveryDay YouTube channel went aboard the Los Angeles class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Toledo (SSN-769) for a look around and to chat with the crew about their unique world . As part of the series, an entire episode was dedicated to explaining how Toledo’s torpedo tube actually works and it is way more involved than most would probably imagine. They did such a wonderful job with this explainer. It really highlights all the mechanical engineering that goes into just firing the torpedo out of the submarine. The host even crawls inside the torpedo tube with a flashlight to give us a first-hand look at what it looks like in real life. Submarines look so simple and smooth from the outside, but that is a product of their stealthy and efficient design requirements. What lies beneath is a dizzying array of tightly packed and often miniaturized technologies, as well as over a century and a half’s worth of mechanical engineering evolution.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For aviation photographers, few atmospheric effects are as prized as vapor . Often referred to as ‘vapes,’ ‘capes,’ ‘cones,’ or ‘streamers’ depending on how the vapor propagates around the aircraft, it infuses breathtaking action and drama into an already great shot. Catching it with three dissimilar aircraft flying in formation, one of which is a straight-winged A-10 Warthog, a plane that isn’t known for putting out big vapor with ease, is a once in a lifetime shot. This is exactly what Ryan Kelly of Fulldiscaviation.com pulled off in Ocean City, Maryland last week. And no, vapor does not signify the aircraft is going supersonic. You can read all about vapes and what causes them in this past piece of ours . Ryan gave us the low-down on how he pulled off the killer shot: I took this photo on rehearsal day of the Ocean City Air Show in Maryland. Heavy rain and storms went through the area earlier in the morning, which only helped the already high humidity. There was one particular spot over the water that seemed to be the vape spot that really made them pop. Vapes over everything that day! I’ve never seen vapor that heavy on light turns, let alone the Heritage Flight. The image was taken with a Nikon D500 paired with a Sigma 150-600C.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 30, 2021",F-117 Nighthawks Now Appear To Be Flying As Adversaries In Red Flag Aerial War Games,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 Nighthawk’s story just gets richer with age . Over the last half-decade, we have seen a consistent expansion of flying operations by the supposedly retired stealth attack jets. Although I have long posited that the F-117s that are still flying would be involved in aggressor operations, the Air Force’s demand for low-observable adversary capabilities has since become clear . Alongside this development, it has become outrightly apparent that these aircraft are in fact providing ‘red air’ support for select exercises and developmental events. Now it appears that their role as aggressors has been expanded in the form of participation in Red Flag, the Air Force’s largest international air warfare exercise held multiple times a year across the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range , or NTTR, with the central hub of the exercise being Nellis Air Force Base in North Las Vegas. What we know is that a handful of the roughly four dozen F-117s still stored at Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) have continued to take part in research and development efforts, largely in relation to low-observable testing, which includes trialing new radar-absorbent coatings and off-board sensors . They are a central player in what is emerging to be a low-observable integrated testing task force that largely emanates from TTR and includes access to a number of exotic testbed aircraft , sensors, and threat representative systems. But another part of the F-117’s duties has blossomed into a more traditional role. We were first to report on hard validation of the F-117’s aggressor support mission last December when evidence emerged of F-117s, flying under their now well-known “KNIGHT” callsign and working with 64th Agressor Squadron F-16s , participated in a complex air combat exercise likely related to the prestigious USAF Weapons School. Now, barring some strange coincidence of factors, it seems clear that this mission has migrated to the much larger Red Flag exercise. Then, in May of 2020, the F-117s did something unprecedented, they flew a number of red air missions out over Pacific against a Navy Carrier Strike Group that was undergoing its most deeply integrated and complex training just prior to deployment. Since then, they have been spotted often over the vast expanses of the Mojave Desert and the NTTR. They even landed at Edwards Air Force Base recently, another first since their retirement a dozen years ago, at least as far as we know. All of this has perpetuated a sense that the F-117s are creeping steadily out of the shadows once again. F-117 formation seen during the type’s retirement in 2008., USAF As Red Flag 20-3, which you can read all about here , hit its crescendo last week before wrapping-up on Friday, August 14th, a division (four aircraft) of F-117s were spotted intermingled with the 64th Aggressor Squadron’s F-16s, getting fuel from the ‘red air’ tanker and participating in actions downrange. Multiple similar missions are said to have occurred throughout that final week of Red Flag and satellite imagery largely confirms this. Between Aug. 10 and 14, no less than what appears to be six F-117s appear to have been parked in the open on TTR’s northern ramp. This was a first as far as we know. Usually, no more than two F-117s go about their shy business from the base. These aircraft typically spend a brief time on the ramp and park in their own hangars after their missions are completed. Having six nighthawks consistently on the ramp during the last week of Red Flag seems very similar to the strip alert-like tactics that aggressors of the past have used at the secretive base. Tonopah Test Range Airport was turned into the sprawling installation it is today thanks in part to its use as a clandestine location to fly captured Soviet fighters out of during the twilight of the Cold War. You can learn more about the Red Eagles program and how TTR came to be in this past post of ours .  It’s also worth noting that Red Flag increases in complexity to challenge its participants as it wears on, with the most capable threats often saved for the last week or last days of the exercise. Every day throughout the week ending in August 14th, six F-117s were present on the northern ramp at TTR. , PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Regardless, the F-117s appear to have staged in force for what would have been an unprecedented tempo of operations, at least since their retirement, in order to support Red Flag evolutions throughout the week. Red Flag includes two sorties per day, one during mid-day and one during the night. It’s also worth noting that by most estimations only four to six F-117s were still in the flying pool. This points to the real possibility that the six jet fleet is a minimum number and more airframes may have been regenerated as the F-117’s flying duties grew. These latest developments underscore that the secretive F-117 force, which has a direct association with the “Dark Knights” moniker, is very much involved in adversary air support, beyond discreet test and developmental duties. It would make some sense that they are providing a dissimilar, low-observable threat representation for frontline aircrews to contend with, at least until the 65th Aggressor Squadron, which will be outfitted with F-35As, comes online and can assume a similar, albeit more robust role. Considering that the U.S. no longer has a monopoly on stealth technology, with foreign cruise missiles , fighter aircraft , and even drones being produced with low observable qualities. As a result, new sensors will be hitting the U.S. fighter force very soon that will help detect, track, and engage what radar has trouble seeing. Ever-increasing network connectivity and data fusion will also help in countering stealth threats, but you have to train against them in order to best employ these technologies operationally. Although the F-117 doesn’t represent the cutting-edge of stealth technology, it does represent a complex foe to contend with, to say the least, and one unlike any fighter pilot or airborne early warning and control radar operator has ever seen before. Considering the edge the U.S. still holds in terms of low-observable technologies, the F-117 is at least a decent stepping stone and stop-gap measure before employing true 5th generation aggressor aircraft. Paired with electronic warfare and creative tactics, one can imagine just how wily the F-117s could be as part of the greater aggressor force. Far lesser aircraf t are used daily in the adversary role in the hands of contractors. How higher-end and lower-end assets are mixed into a potent adversary air plan is what really matters when it comes to stress-testing U.S. and allied fighter aircrews. Ground crews work on an F-117 during its operational career, which spanned 25 years. , USAF All these factors, as well as the need for F-117s to continue to act as a control variable in developmental testing, have led to what appears to be a bizarre renaissance for the once written-off F-117 Nighthawk, even if its shallow resurgence will only be for a limited period of time. Still, an F-117 aggressor gives the Pentagon’s growing adversary air community a highly unique asset to employ against pilots that could very well end up facing off against an enemy stealth asset in actual combat. With their inclusion in this iteration of Red Flag, we may very well be seeing much more of the “Black Jet” in the not so distant future, at least before they finally vanish for good.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 11, 2020",Test Pilot Explains The YF-23 Black Widow’s Awesomely Innovative Flight Control System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we continue our series on the YF-23 Black Widow , an aircraft that has captured imaginations like few non-successful aircraft designs ever have, we now get an unprecedented look at the aircraft’s unique and highly innovative flight control system from one of Northrop’s top test pilots, Roy Martin . Once again, this video comes to us from the awesome Western Museum of Flight , the same place where YF-23 test pilot Paul Metz explained why the aircraft lost to the YF-22. It provides some fascinating details about lesser-known aspects of the YF-23 , an aircraft that was packed with new technologies , in a similar manner as to how an F-22 test pilot recently explained the incredible flight control system on that jet, which was the end result of Lockheed winning the Advanced Tactical Fighter tender . Some of the highlights include the “accel-decel throttle’ that allowed pilots to fly the aircraft via controlling its speed instead of thrust via the throttle. This dynamic auto-throttle-like setup was apparently really intuitive and helped pilots keep their attention on other pressing tasks, like looking out of the cockpit, instead of trying to maintain the kinetic state. Martin notes that controlling the YF-23’s speed traditionally was a bit of a hassle as it was so ‘slippery’ that it could accelerate away as a result of just a moment of inattention. Tiny air data pressure holes replaced pitot tubes for primary air sensor data on the YF-23. The small constellations of holes are so small you wouldn’t even know they were there. This was a first for a fighter and the tech was pioneered to a more limited degree on the top-secret Tacit Blue technology demonstrator . Small, but super powerful actuators had to be developed to control the aircraft’s ‘flaperons’ as the jet’s wings were so thin a normal actuator would not fit. The massive widely splayed tailerons also required a new type of actuator called a ‘two-stage direct drive actuator.’ The issue was the huge tails would have to be able to move rapidly at slow speeds for dogfighting while also being able to have the power to push super high-pressure air around during high-speed flight well above the speed of sound. As a result, an actuator with two separate chambers was created to be able to accomplish both tasks. It worked extremely well as it is known that YF-23 met all super-maneuverability requirements without complex and heavy thrust vectoring nozzles. Roy Martin also gets into the crazy simulator Northrop had built, called the Large Amplitude Motion-Based Simulator, in which they pushed the flight handling qualities of the aircraft to the limit before actually flying it. It proved to be amazingly accurate. The simulator itself appears to be a modern marvel and is likely closely related to the Air Force Research Lab’s LAMARS simulator ,  which was also built by Northrop. Check out the full video below. Martin is outstanding at conveying the complex nature of topics he is talking about in an easy to digest and conceptual manner. His insights are fascinating, to say the least: Concat the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 22, 2020",How A Canadian Pilot Became The First Westerner To Fly The Feared MiG-29 Fulcrum,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Readers might be forgiven for not knowing that the first Western pilot to get a chance to fly the then-Soviet Union’s much-vaunted MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet was a Canadian. But the story of how now-retired Royal Canadian Air Force Major Bob Wade got his hands on the warplane only months before the fall of the Iron Curtain is an extraordinary one. It’s relayed by Wade himself in a fascinating podcast hosted by the Cold War Conversations website, and some of the details are well worth examining. The entire interview, which you can find here , is also worth listening to in full. Having a chance to take the controls of one of your principal enemy’s top-end fighters is a pretty unusual event in itself. Wade had no idea what awaited him at the 1989 Abbotsford International Airshow, where he would find himself in the front seat of a MiG-29UB combat trainer with only a rudimentary 10-minute briefing, no understanding of Russian, and a back-seater with only the most basic grasp of English. Today, the Mikoyan MiG-29 is a familiar sight in air forces around the world , and it’s perhaps hard to recall just how alarmed Western observers were when this potent fighter entered service with the Soviet Air Force in the early 1980s. At this time, the United States was so eager to evaluate Soviet-built warplanes that it went to extreme lengths to obtain them, flying them in secrecy to better understand their capabilities and giving its pilots a chance to fly against them. The most dramatic example of this was the Cold War-era Red Eagles MiG aggressor squadron, which you can learn more about here . It wasn’t until the era of “ glasnost ” that the general public — and foreign military top brass alike — got to see the jet at closer quarters. There was a spectacular appearance at the Farnborough International Airshow in the United Kingdom in 1988, which kicked off a series of presentations by Soviet (and soon-to-be Russian) military aircraft around the globe. You can watch that display here: The 1988 Farnborough appearance introduced the world to Anatoly Kvochur , who would go on to be one of the best-known test and demonstration pilots of his era, later working for the Sukhoi design bureau. By the time of the Abbotsford Airshow in August 1989, Kvochur had made headlines for all the wrong reasons, with a dramatic low-level ejection from his MiG-29 at the Paris Air Show in France in June of the same year. By the late summer of 1989, the Soviets’ latest-generation warplanes had made a serious impression on Western observers and it seems someone in Moscow thought it was time for them to get some exclusive access to rival hardware. Before coming to North America for the Abbotsford Airshow, Wade recalls, Soviet officials had made efforts to secure their own familiarization flights in an F-15 Eagle or F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter. Should one of the North American air arms accept, there would be a seat waiting for one of their fighter pilots in a Soviet MiG-29. The American military point-blank refused this offer. The two Soviet MiG-29s en route to Canada are intercepted by F-15s from the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing at Elmendorf., U.S. AIR FORCE When the two Fulcrums came to visit, arriving in North American airspace over the Bering Strait, they were intercepted by USAF F-15 fighter jets on alert at Elmendorf Air Force Base . The Soviet fighters touched down at the Alaskan base for a night stop, still with no agreement in place for any reciprocal flights. Wade was alert force commander at Canadian Forces Base Comox, British Columbia, home of the closest fighter alert facility, when the MiGs were due to arrive at the commercial airport of Abbotsford. He describes how he was alerted by North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) that the Soviet jets were expected to arrive via the Alaska panhandle, before touching down at Abbotsford in southern British Columbia. However, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was expected only to shepherd them through the country’s airspace, since the Soviet pilots would be under civilian air traffic control from Vancouver. At this time, there were normally four RCAF CF-18 Hornets on alert at Comox, two of them active, and two on standby. Wade recalls that with three of his Hornets available, it was decided to send all of them up for this most unusual of intercepts. NORAD told him and his crews to “proceed no closer than 1,000 feet and make no attempt to communicate with the MiG-29 pilots.” Wade and his wingmen picked up the MiGs as planned at the bottom of the Alaskan panhandle, where they also met the Elmendorf F-15s that had escorted the Soviet jets through U.S. airspace. On the NORAD side, this whole process was controlled by an E-3 AWACS radar plane, Wade remembers. “We had never seen a MiG-29 before,” he said. “Of course, we’d had lots of intelligence briefings on it, but everyone was pretty excited to see one in person.” View from a CF-18 cockpit of a mixed formation of Hornets and MiG-29s., VIC JOHNSON VIA HAROLD SKAARUP Approaching the Soviet jets — one single-seat Fulcrum-A and one two-seat Fulcrum-B — from the stern, Wade and the other RCAF pilots trailed them at a height of approximately 37,000 feet and a speed of around Mach 0.9. After the NORAD Eagles and Hornets had made use of the unique formation to take some photos of all the jets, the CF-18s and MiGs continued south, while the Eagles waved off. Twenty minutes later, the RCAF fighter pilots’ excitement had probably only diminished slightly when Wade noticed that the MiG duo was now headed approximately 40 degrees off their intended track. Since the Soviets were under civilian control, Wade recalls that he was unsure where they were being vectored to, so made an appropriate call to AWACS. “Hey, we have no idea where they’re heading,” came the response from the surveillance plane. Wade then called Vancouver on his second radio, only to find that they hadn’t had contact with the Soviet aviators, either. A useful comparison of the CF-18 Hornet (foreground) and single-seat MiG-29., VIC JOHNSON VIA HAROLD SKAARUP At this point, Wade made the decision to approach the Soviet lead (the MiG-29UB), who used hand signals to indicate his radio had failed. With strict instructions not to fly near the alert base at Comox, Wade pointed at the lead pilot then took up a position 40 degrees to the left of their previous course and the Soviet pilot turned immediately in response, before signaling that they had only had 30 minutes’ of fuel remaining. A safe arrival at Abbotsford now looked touch-and-go, so Wade decided to put the Eastern bloc visitors on his wing, two MiGs on the right, two CF-18s on the left, tucked in tight to begin the descent into Abbotsford through 30,000 feet of cloud. After waving the MiGs off to land, Wade was “pretty impressed by what the boys did,” he reflected. Wade then describes his return to base at Comox, where the crew chief told him that the phone had barely stopped ringing — it was the Soviet Embassy (“How they got the phone number of the QRA, I’ve got no idea”). They wanted to thank Wade for his assistance and invite him as a guest at the upcoming airshow. Wade didn’t have to think about the decision long — he was already headed to the base to take part in a static display of aircraft. The two-seat MiG-29UB parked on the ramp at Abbotsford in front of a giant An-225 transporter., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE But the welcome awaiting Wade at the Soviets’ pavilion on the first day of the show was Cold War-frosty. After introducing himself, he was told “Nyet, go away.” The following day, the same thing happened, with the Soviet guard again telling Wade’s RCAF contingent to leave. Finally, on Sunday, the last day of the show, the Soviets seemed to have had an abrupt change of tack. “They really wanted to fly the F-15 or F-18 and get a Western pilot to make an assessment of MiG-29 to help them market it,” Wade speculated. With any chance of one of their test pilots flying in a Western “teen-series” jet having evaporated, it seems Moscow decided instead to go on the public relations offensive, showing a Western pilot exactly what their jet was capable of. Bob Wade, in the dark flying suit, strapping into the MiG-29UB with test pilots Roman Taskaev and Valery Menitsky (left)., VIA COLD WAR CONVERSATIONS The offer was initially turned down by the Canadian top brass but, luckily for Wade, Deputy Defense Minister Mary Collins was at the event and helped get it signed off. In Wade’s view, the minister put her career on the line to secure his place in the Soviet cockpit. With Anatoly Kvochur still recovering from his bailout in Paris, his colleague Valery Menitsky would fly in the back seat, but he spoke very little English. Wade borrowed an ill-fitting g-suit and helmet and was quickly shown how to start the jet’s twin Klimov RD-33 turbofans. With all instruments in Cyrillic, and measurements in kilometers per hour and meters, Wade would have to rely on the instincts he’d developed as a military aviator. The preflight brief was limited — no details were given about take-off, landing, or flap speeds. Wade assumed Menitsky would handle that. With 10 minutes to prepare, there was now some concern on the Canadian side that the flight might not be such a good idea after all. “Don’t screw this up or we’ll both be looking for work,” Collins told Wade. “She might be looking for work but I’d be dead!”, he reflected. A CF-18 flown by Lieutenant Colonel Ray Levasseur, commander of 433 TFS, escorting the single-seat MiG-29 flown by Roman Taskaev, during a second visit to Canada in June 1990., VIC JOHNSON VIA HAROLD SKAARUP Once in the jet, Wade was determined to use his experience as a CF-18 demonstration pilot to evaluate the MiG and aimed to replicate parts of his own 12-minute low-level aerobatic routine for comparison. This video shows Wade at work in his CF-18 during an air display: Wade was told by Menitsky that he was happy for him to take-off. Wade still had no idea of take-off speed, let alone the fuel load of the jet he was sat in. Once airborne, Wade decided he wanted to perform a roll at the top of the climb-out. “Pulling through the vertical after take-off, on the F-18 airspeed would stagnate or maybe roll back a few knots; on the MiG-29 when I pulled through the vertical that airplane was still accelerating, so I knew it had better thrust-to-weight at whatever fuel weight it was carrying. I was pretty happy with that”, he recalls. After another vertical climb, it was time to attempt some hard maneuvering, including maximum stick deflection, rolling in both directions. Wade judged the results “equivalent to the F-18. The F-18 would roll at 720 degrees per second; the MiG-29 was quite comparable.” Roman Taskaev leaves his MiG-29 parked on the ramp after a demonstration flight at Abbotsford., U.S. AIR FORCE Exactly how hard he was maneuvering was hard to judge, though. Wade couldn’t find the G-meter, let alone read it. He reckons he was pulling around 7g and found he had enough power, in afterburner, to sustain the turn. Then “Valeri pilot,” came the command from the back seat, and the Soviet aviator slammed the jet back into the vertical, and at around 3,000 feet idled both throttles for a tailslide . The CF-18 would need 5,000 feet to recover from such a maneuver, Wade reflected. He was also surprised to note both the MiG’s afterburners kicking in instantaneously when lit — unlike in the Hornet. Menitsky pushed the stick forward and the nose fell — another surprise — and they flew out without a problem. “Bob pilot,” was the next command from the back seat, and now it was Wade’s chance to perform a tailslide. He was “surprised how easy it was.” VIC JOHNSON VIA HAROLD SKAARUP Eager to know what the Fulcrum could do in low-speed dogfighting, on the next recovery from the tailslide, Wade held the nose, selected afterburner and kept the jet steady at around 70 degrees nose-up, checking rudder responsiveness in both directions. “I was amazed, I learned a lot in that particular maneuver”, Wade notes. He judged the MiG equal to the F/A-18 in the low-speed, high-angle-of-attack domain. Menitsky then pulled a 360-degree turn that Wade estimates was around 8g, leaving the Canadian “buried into the cockpit, working hard just trying to stay conscious.” Watching the airspeed indicator through the maneuver, the speed never increased or decreased by more than around 20 knots — “Pretty credible turn capability,” in Wade’s assessment. After 15 minutes, the next command came: “Bob pilot landing.” Wade took the jet around, dropped flaps and gear when it felt right, touched down and rolled out. His conclusion: “I was pretty impressed with it.” The MiG flight had won over Wade, but he was still of the basic opinion that Soviet fighters were built for a war of attrition — “rivets sticking out, tires threadbare, pretty crude,” but that they overcame these shortcomings with their sheer power. Notably, the Soviets wouldn’t turn on the head-up display , and the MiG-29UB was not fitted with radar. Nonetheless, Wade felt he had a good understanding of the jet’s capabilities in a dogfight. Here, he reckoned, it would be equivalent to a Hornet, although the MiG’s 30mm gun had better range than the Hornet’s 20mm M61A1 Vulcan cannon . After touchdown, the Soviets made efforts to ensure Wade didn’t speak immediately to the media. Instead, he was ushered back to the pavilion where he was plied with no fewer than three tumblers of vodka, as he and his hosts toasted the jet, Wade, and then the Soviet Union. “Those boys drank it straight down,” remembers Wade — who did the same. “I don’t really know a lot that went on after that in the pavilion… I was pretty drunk,” he remembers. VIC JOHNSON VIA HAROLD SKAARUP With the benefit of hindsight, Wade admits he probably talked up the MiG: “I really gave them good press” and he had “no qualms about painting them 10 feet tall” — this, after all, would also be for the benefit of North America’s defense industry, he explains. In the wake of the events at Abbotsford, Canada’s Chief of Defense Staff called Wade to Ottawa for an urgent debrief, immediately after which a pair of CIA agents wanted to hear his account, too. Wade’s intelligence windfall would see him spending the next 12 months or so delivering 20-minute briefings on the Fulcrum around NATO. Three months after the Abbotsford show, the Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War standoff evaporated overnight. As happened in many countries, Canada saw a major subsequent defense spending drawdown. The RCAF was slashed from six operational CF-18 units to just three, and Wade left the service, finding work as a commercial pilot. Once the Warsaw Pact collapsed, the NATO powers would have plenty more opportunities to fully evaluate the Soviet jet, including the former East German fleet that was inherited by the air arm of the newly reunified Germany . The United States also began to assemble a collection of its own MiG-29s, for detailed analysis, as part of its foreign materiel exploitation ( FME ) effort — no fewer than 21 MiG-29s were snapped up from the former Soviet republic of Moldova in 1997, one of which is now on display at the Threat Training Facility at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. In the meantime, Western pilots flying MiG-29s would become more commonplace, and the Fulcrum itself remains a key element of NATO air arms in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. As for Wade, his relationship with Russian fighters almost had a surprising revival. He remembers getting a call from Langley at some point in the mid-1990s, telling him the Russians had chosen him to fly in a Su-30 (with thrust-vectoring engines), at Farnborough — what’s more, he would be paid to do it. A day before he was due to fly to the United Kingdom, another call from Langley informed him the trip had been canceled by the Russians. It was, Wade admits, “one of my big regrets.” The author would like to thank Harold Skaarup for sharing photos of the MiGs’ visit to Canada.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Sep 10, 2020",How F-16 Testers Are Evolving The Jet’s New Radar Beyond The Homeland Defense Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is deeply engaged in advanced testing that will help it to exploit the full capabilities of the F-16’s new Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array, or AESA, radar. It’s part of uncovering the full potential of the radar, and the F-16 for that matter, as it joins more squadrons, firstly in the Air National Guard, followed by active-duty units. AESA radars offer a massive leap in capabilities over their mechanically scanned array predecessors, both in terms of range, fidelity, fast-scanning ability, reliability, and resistance to being jammed or being fooled by enemy countermeasures, among other advantages. You can read more about AESA arrays in these past War Zone pieces for more background on the topic. The Air Force recently highlighted the radar and the added capabilities it offers in a media release that detailed how the radar was tested on a first-of-its-kind combined mission with four suitably upgraded F-16s on July 2, 2020. By testing four AESA radars at the same time, the service also assessed whether the aircraft experienced interference and evaluated if the radars’ signals improved or degraded while operating together. “Now that we have a number of these radars available, especially in operational test, we are going to work our way through all mission sets […] all the way through air-to-air, air-to-ground, Suppression of Enemy Air Defense, Close Air Support, and how we integrate it across all types of other aircraft too,” Air Force Major Joe “Hurt” Viegas told The War Zone . Viegas is the AESA program manager from the 59th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. That unit is part of the 53rd Wing’s 53rd Test Management Group, which is headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. A view from inside the cockpit during the four-ship F-16 mission from Eglin on July 2., U.S. Air Force/Jack Harman “What’s somewhat unique about the overall F-16 test enterprise is that the 53rd Wing and the Test and Evaluation Group have been really trying to streamline our efforts in terms of rapidly fielding capabilities,” Viegas added. “Though this is a fielded capability, talking to the APG-83 specifically, this is being [rolled-out] in incremental phases.” Northrop Grumman developed the AN/APG-83, also known as the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), as a scalable and tailorable AESA based on its work with the F-22’s AN/APG-77 and the F-35’s AN/APG-81. It is ideally suited as a retrofit solution for the F-16’s mechanically-scanned AN/APG-66/68 radar and is also now available in new-build Vipers. Flight-testing of the radar on the F-16 first commenced at Edwards AFB, California, in November 2009, and Taiwan became the launch customer when it selected the radar for its F-16V upgrade . The radar is now a key part of that upgrade package and it will also be found on new-production F-16C/D Block 70/72 aircraft, which you can read more about here in this previous War Zone piece . SABR is also being assessed for possible USAF bomber upgrades . Viegas says that the 53rd Wing is now tasked with “stressing” the AESA in a realistic and combat-representative environment, collectively using two Eglin test units , along with the 59th TES at Nellis and the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center (AATC) in Tucson, Arizona. Four AESA-equipped F-16Cs prepare for the mission from Eglin on July 2, 2020., U.S. Air Force/MSgt Tristan McIntire “The Air National Guard has already received this new capability to a certain degree and is already flying it. So, the significance of the most recent flight is that fielding of this capability has been quite a unique experience for the 53rd Wing. The initial task was basic integration of a new capability in the F-16 [for the] Air National Guard units that are protecting our nation from a homeland defense perspective, as quickly as possible,” the major continued. “Now the 53rd Wing has accomplished that task, which is to get capability to the warfighter as quickly as possible, the task is how can we further develop this radar and truly stress the capabilities that we can integrate it into our tactics, techniques, and procedures [TTPs], our three-dash-one [tactics manual],” added Maj Viegas. “Once we have the Guard sufficiently stocked with this capability, the Air Force is going to pivot and start fielding this to active-duty units.” “The ANG has got it fielded as we are doing testing. The 53rd Wing is passing information to them so they can work effectively with the new capabilities as well as creating our recommendations and TTPs for when the active-duty starts getting the radar,” added Air Force Captain Michael “Echo” Arnold, the AN/APG-83 Tactics Investigation Unit Project Officer for the 85th TES. While the Nellis element of the 53rd Wing team will start work with upgraded AESA-equipped F-16s this Fall, the current work lies with the Operational Flight Program Combined Test Force (OFP CTF), a combined effort between the 40th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS) and the 85th TES, at Eglin. The same team will take a similarly efficient combined approach when the new F-15EX arrives there next year for initial test work. A Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 being installed in an Air National Guard F-16 at Joint Base Andrews., U.S. Air Force In January 2020, Northrop Grumman said the USAF completed the first installation of the AN/APG-83 radar on ANG F-16s at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, to meet a U.S. Northern Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) for homeland defense. This followed a June 17, 2017, announcement from the USAF that it had selected the AN/APG-83 to upgrade 72 F-16s to meet the JEON. In addition, the USAF plans to retain 350 Block 40/42/50/52 F-16C/Ds in service through at least 2048 and it is putting them through a service-life extension program (SLEP), plus adding new avionics, including the AESA radar. The new radar enables the F-16 to detect and track targets at greater ranges and with increased precision, especially low flying targets with small radar cross-sections. Cruise missile defense was one of the driving factors in equipping the Guard Vipers that stand watch over Washington, D.C. with the radars. AESA are also more reliable than their mechanically scanned forebearers and they are capable of enhanced air-to-ground mapping. “This [enhanced air-to-ground mapping] capability allows us to target the northwest corner of a small building or the cockpit of an aircraft [on the ground at an enemy airfield] from several miles away, beyond line-of-sight [beyond visual range],” Jack Harman, a 40th Flight Test Squadron government civilian F-16 test pilot, was quoted by the USAF as saying. “[The radar] improves our ability to identify the threat prior to us being targeted. We no longer have to be inside a threat envelope in order to detect it.” Upgrading the existing F-16 radars with the new AESA is a major capability jump for the USAF F-16 community, and it also enables greater collaboration in the fighter integration effort with 5th generation assets. “That new hardware and software [in the AESA] is how we’re leveraging lessons learned from the F-22 and F-35 […] and funneling all those lessons into what we are developing in the F-16,” said Major Viegas. An F-16C from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron that is fitted with the new AN/APG-83 AESA radar., U.S. Air Force/MSgt Tristan McIntire Viegas says the team of F-16 test units will work through all mission sets and assess if the AESA changes any aspects of those and see how the fighter integrates with all types of other aircraft too. “We will be bringing APG-83-equipped aircraft from Eglin out here to [ Nellis to] participate in those Large Force Test Events ,” he adds, saying that all of the work will then be integrated into the USAF Weapons School course. The new AESA upgrade is a critical part of keeping USAF F-16s credible for the remainder of their service lives . It also brings the F-16 into step with the Air Force’s other front line fighters with a radar technology that has become a benchmark in capability across the international fighter aircraft community.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 2, 2020",Air Combat Tales From Australia’s Storied Pitch Black Aerial War Games,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia’s premier large force aerial combat exercise Pitch Black isn’t happening this year. So, we should be thankful that the Royal Australian Air Force has taken the opportunity to dredge through its extensive media archives to present some of the highlights from past editions. There’s some real stand-out content, too, in the form of candid and fascinating recollections from some of the air combat pilots who have taken part in the maneuvers over the years. Pitch Black is normally run every two years and the planned 2020 iteration was expected to be one of the most interesting yet, promising participation from the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and Republic of Korea Air Force . Both would have been making their debuts at the event, which was to be held between late July and early August. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions saw the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) major international air combat exercise canceled back in May. Taking the place of showcasing live maneuvers, the RAAF has instead launched its #ExPitchBlackOnline campaign in the last few weeks. As well as recognizing all those participants in Pitch Black’s 39-year history, one of the air arm’s press officers describes the initiative as “scratching that itch” for service personnel and enthusiasts missing their regular fix of airpower. It’s well worth taking a look at the RAAF’s Facebook account , where most of this content has been collated, but there’s much more besides that. These four F-4Es from the USAF’s 51st Tactical Fighter Wing were among participants at Exercise Pitch Black 84., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia An aerial view of a USAF B-52 Stratofortress (left, background), an RAAF F-111C, and an RAAF HS748 at RAAF Base Darwin during Exercise Pitch Black 84., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia The media campaign was kicked off by Air Commander Australia, Air Vice-Marshal Joe Iervasi , with a video, seen below, on the Royal Australian Air Force’s YouTube and Facebook channel. Iervasi reflected on his own experiences of Pitch Black, beginning with his first taste of the aerial war games in 1997. After flying tours on RAAF ‘Classic’ Hornets and an exchange posting on the Royal Air Force’s Tornado F3 swing-wing interceptor, he was struck by the sheer scale of the exercise. “I remember the first time I stepped onto the flight line at Darwin, just to see so many air combat aircraft from all over the world, and going ‘wow, we’re all going to be airborne at the same time in that airspace’,” Iervasi said. “The key lesson I learned from those early days is get your head out, and have a look around, because chances are you’re going to see someone coming before the radar finds them as well.” A Royal New Zealand Air Force A-4K Skyhawk at RAAF Base Darwin during Exercise Pitch Black 84., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia A pair of RAAF Mirage IIID fighter jets at RAAF Base Darwin during Exercise Pitch Black 88., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia It’s not just the 85,000 square miles over Australia’s Northern Territory that are available to aircrews, they can also hone their fighting skills in another 10,000 square miles of airspace over the Arafura Sea, northeast of Darwin. “It’s the best airspace in the world to do it — as we say, you’ve got from the surface to the moon, [you can go] supersonic, and it’s got a great tactical training range there as well, dropping live or inert weapons, you can get shot at from an aircraft, you can get shot at from the ground — simulated or simulated live,” Iervasi enthused. Iervasi was back at Exercise Pitch Black in 2008 as Commanding Officer of No. 3 Squadron, leading F/A-18 Hornets at RAAF Base Darwin. He also took part in the 2012 and 2016 editions, both times in different command roles, latterly as Commander Task Force 640 — responsible for the entire airborne contingent. The air vice-marshal also recalled the time that mission planners borrowed callsigns from the 1991 comedy film Hot Shots back in the late 1990s. “There were a couple of missions where we gave people the opportunity to make their own callsigns up,” he said. “There was a replication of a few of the callsigns [from Hot Shots] — there was ‘Fluffy Bunny Feet,’ which is kind of difficult when you’re trying to check in a dozen aircraft, and ‘Fluffy Bunny Feet Two, Three, Four’ check in,” Iervasi continued. “It was just enjoyable to play around with that, but in terms of the professionalism of the actual operation itself, it was always there.” Among the RAAF assets involved in Pitch Black 98 was this F-111C strike aircraft., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia A Republic of Singapore Air Force E-2C Hawkeye participating in Exercise Pitch Black 98., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia Republic of Singapore Air Force TA-4SU Skyhawks at RAAF Base Darwin during Exercise Pitch Black 98., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia Delving deeper into the history of Australia’s flagship exercise, the RAAF has also brought together an exhaustive breakdown of each Pitch Black exercise since it began in 1981. When it first kicked off at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in June 1981, Pitch Black was a pure air defense exercise for the charismatic delta-wing Mirage IIIO fighters from No. 77 Squadron. They were tasked with fending off attacks by RAAF No. 1 Squadron F-111C Aardvark strike aircraft. Air Vice-Marshal (retired) John Quaife’s career includes flying Mirage and Hornet fighters in Pitch Black, although his initial exposure to the exercise was with the diminutive MB326 “Macchi” lead-in fighter trainer in 1982. He flew six ‘target’ profiles out of RAAF Base Richmond, two of those sorties at night. “In 1982, Pitch Black was a Sector Air Defence Exercise (ADEX) designed to exercise the air defense sector as it was established at Williamtown — that meant exercising the alert-detect-scramble-intercept kill chain, with an emphasis on night flying. As pilot of a Macchi ‘target’, my job was to simply fly a pre-planned route out of Richmond that entered the Williamtown airspace from the North West. Along the way, I would be intercepted by Mirages scrambled out of Williamtown, no doubt launching from an alert posture in the Willy Operational Readiness Platform.” “There was no free play (in the exercise). I have no idea who was calling the shots, but I suspect it was the Sector Air Defence Commander, and in those days we used to have such things as SADOC (Sector Air Defence Operations Centre) executive courses to teach people how to do that stuff.” “My next Pitch Black experience was in 1988. By this time I was a Hornet FCI flying with No. 77 Squadron. Five out of my seven exercise events were flown at night. By 1988, the exercise had shifted to Darwin but it was still an Air Defence Exercise. This meant the defenders were the good guys (Blue), with the attackers playing the bad guys (Red). My logbook shows me that there was a United States Air Force F-15 outfit in town playing adversaries. Because the exercise was (centered) on Air Defence, it was very much a ‘clean’ exercise of RAAF air defense capability — no allies played on the Blue side. It’s worth noting that F-111s were always Red Air.” “I next flew a Pitch Black in 1991 as FCI with No. 75 Squadron. I flew 12 missions all labeled Vital Area Defence (Darwin) with four of them flown at night. Once again, visiting USAF F-15s flew as Red Air. By now I was beginning to think Pitch Black was getting a bit tedious.” “We had excellent airspace, we had an exercise that included complex scenarios flown at night (no one else was doing that), but we had a purpose-built F/A-18 base at Tindal that was not being exercised, we were only beginning to think about developing Delamere Range , and we were still spending hours on alert practicing moving up and down the alert posture.” “When we got airborne, we would spend many hours going around and around a CAP station — you would consider yourself lucky if you got to intercept anything. There was no real debrief or attempt to analyze outcomes and there was certainly no kill removal (where participants who are ‘shot down’ are required to leave the airspace).” “By Pitch Black 2002, I was now Commander Air Combat Group (ACG), I was the Officer Conducting the Exercise, so I changed the rules. I converted Pitch Black from an air defense exercise into a strike exercise.” “In developing the exercise, we tried to maintain the good bits from the previous incarnation, but avoid some of the bad stuff. Exercise Pitch Black 2002 was the first Pitch Black where we were able to exercise Air Combat Group as a Group with F-111 and F/A-18 finally working together. We certainly kept the night serials.” “The exercise in 2002 was flown on the East Coast with No. 75 Squadron Hornets deployed to Amberley (the Republic of Singapore Air Force also participated that year). This was the exercise that generated some ‘crinkly faces’ in the planning conference because it was the first time that we changed the roles of Red and Blue Force. In 2002 we had just returned jets from the Diego Garcia deployment, and we would soon deploy No. 75 Squadron in early 2003 to the Middle East Area of Operations. There was a bit going on.” “Exercise Pitch Black 2002 involved some heavy planning in order to generate enough overland airspace (additional Training Areas off the top of the Richmond airspace was included too, as I recall). Out of that experience, we realized that we should retain an exercise as an annual event, but keep one focused on air defense (in odd years) while the bigger Pitch Black exercise (in even years) got heavily into the complex offensive exercise that it has become.” “We kept the exercise to a planned daytime and nighttime event, which meant we could control activity through ‘periods of vulnerability’ and, as long as the players stayed within the ‘VUL Time’ (VUL meaning Vulnerability Window — the time period when the exercise was ‘active’) they could free play their tactics. Moving off the ADEX script also gave the air defenders an asset management challenge that had been missing in scripted exercises. De-emphasizing air defense also gave the exercise a lot more meaning and value for the participation of other Force Element Groups.” Quaife talks more about how the exercise has changed since then — as well as his experiences of other wargames, including the U.S. Air Force-led Exercise Cope Thunder, the forerunner to Red Flag-Alaska — in this interview . US Pacific Air Forces F-16Cs approach an RAAF KC-30A tanker for air-to-air refueling at Pitch Black 2016., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia A Royal Australian Air Force F-111 pilot sits in his aircraft awaiting clearance to head out on a mission from RAAF Base Darwin during Exercise Pitch Black 2008., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia Another exercise veteran, Squadron Leader Paul Simmons, shared his memories of flying Hornets at Pitch Black in the mid-1990s. At that time, the ‘Classic’ Hornet was a very different beast, armed with infrared-guided AIM-9M Sidewinder missiles and the AIM-7 Sparrow radar-guided missile. His first involvement in the exercise came in 1994 at RAAF Base Tindal, having recently graduated onto the aircraft from No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit. “The exercise was based on Defensive Counter Air (protect Australia from attacks) and Tindal was the center of the action. (There were) many memorable missions with some eye-opening night engagements against USMC (United States Marine Corps) Harriers and RAAF F-111s attacking at night and at low level.” “My two most vivid memories are: Sitting at the end of Runway 14 at Tindal on Alert 3 (if given a scramble order, we had to be airborne in 3 minutes) as Number Two to Binny.” “It was late afternoon and we had been there for an hour, all was quiet and I was calm. Suddenly we received the scramble order as a low-level attack on Tindal had been detected 40 nautical miles northwest of the field. The heart gets pumping really quickly — start the left engine and scramble. We did a formation take-off, and then at a couple of hundred feet Binny [Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin (retired), Simmons’ former flight lead] waves me away into tactical formation. We set the switches in the cockpit to fight, heading south briefly before turning hard back to the north to engage. We spent the 30 minutes in an old-school crazy fight against many low-level strikers and some escorts, killing most of the attackers before running out of weapons and fuel and landing back at the base a short time later.” “The other memory is — it was night, and we were flying in the standard very dark Northern Territory sky — many years before we had Night-Vision Goggles. We were sitting in a CAP (Combat Air Patrol) with our radars searching the inky blackness for signs of attacking forces. We detected low-level F-111s and headed west in afterburner to engage as quickly as we could. Trying to hang on to visual contact with Binny while also working the radar and shooting at low-level contacts and their escorts at height at night is busy, to say the least. I lost some heartbeats that night but stayed visual and shot a couple of bad guys… which for a new wingman was a win!” Air-to-air with a Mirage 2000-9 from the United Arab Emirates Air Force and an F/A-18A from the RAAF at Pitch Black 2014., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia A RAAF F/A-18F from No. 1 Squadron (top) in formation with an Indian Air Force Su-30MKI Flanker during Exercise Pitch Black 18., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia By the time Exercise Pitch Black 96 came around, Squadron Leader Simmons was at No. 3 Squadron, leading a four-ship formation of Hornets. “We were tasked as the ‘Kamarian Orange Forces’ and flying out of Darwin under the command of Air Marshal Geoff Shephard (retired), who was then Officer Commanding No. 82 Wing. We were the bad guys, and included United States Air Force B-52s and F-16Cs , and RAAF F-111s. We were flying against RAAF F/A-18s of Nos. 75 and 77 Squadron, USAF F-15Cs, who were supported by a USAF E-3C Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS).” “We were escorting two B-52s where we started over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf at high level, with four F-111s, eight F-16Cs, and six F/A-18s. On the Mission Commander’s word, we had the B-52s and F-111s descend steeply to low level while putting out a ton of chaff (radar countermeasures), escorted by my four F/A-18s, while the rest of the fighters covered all altitudes from 50,000 feet to low level. It was quite a mess for the defenders to sort out and stop. Ingressing at low level on the wing of two B-52s with their wings ‘flapping’ due to the heat and thermals, while targeting and shooting defenders, remains quite a memory.” Part of the Orange Force tactics for Exercise Pitch Black 96 involved ‘shooting down’ the Blue Force E-3C AWACS, denying the Blue Force of a vital force-multiplier. Simmons recalled the game plan for that particular sortie: “We would press in as usual, but stay for a while longer as a distraction while one of our F-16s in a ‘clean and fast’ configuration (they had taken all the radar reflecting and drag-inducing tanks, pylons and missiles off) would do a tactic and then get to very low altitude and spring through the defenders and try and ‘kill’ the E-3. The tactic worked a charm, and the F-16 got through and killed the E-3, which was south of Tindal, numerous times before being shot and recovering extremely high and slow back to Darwin with little fuel remaining.” “In retrospect, it was not the best mission to plan such a move with the VIPs on board and it was even less well-received as the F-16 joined on the wing of the E-3 and kept mercilessly calling the ‘kill’ on the Blue Force radio frequency. Later that day the E-3 landed in Darwin, and we all got out on the tarmac cheering our victory as it taxied by. I still remember Binny giving me the ‘disappointed dad’ look in the bar that night, trying to explain to me why despite the great tactical execution, of all the days, today was not the best and we made the ‘sell’ he was part of all the harder.” Simmons is just one of many past exercise participants to have contributed to a massive collection of brief memoirs, all of which you can find here . They include plenty of memories of the RAAF’s iconic F-111s making noise and rocketing low over the ground, two things they are fondly remembered for. JAS 39 Gripens from the Royal Thai Air Force head out for another mission during Exercise Pitch Black 2018., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia Indonesian F-16s depart RAAF Base Darwin during Exercise Pitch Black 2018., Australian Department of Defense, Commonwealth of Australia Videos posted by the RAAF bring to life some of the other highlights of Pitch Black from the mid-to-late 1990s, including air-to-air refueling of F-111s, F/A-18s, and Singaporean F-16s. You’ll also see footage of the Republic of Singapore Air Force’s A-4SU Skyhawks (including the unique twin-canopy trainer versions); ground movements and takeoffs from RAAF F/A-18As, F-111s , and USAF F-15Cs; RAAF Boeing 707s, plus the RAAF’s twin-turboprop HS748 tactical transport tackling a dirt runway. And, if that’s still not enough to ‘scratch that itch’, the RAAF public affairs crew have also put online all editions of the RAAF News newspaper from 1961 to 1997. All told, we’re being treated to a real treasure trove of nostalgic Pitch Black content. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Forces Royal Australian Air Force"
Aaron Amick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",How Submarine Sonarmen Tirelessly Hunt For Enemies They Can’t Even See,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sound analysis is a vital tool in naval operations. Sonar operators are a trained group of sailors who are responsible for managing a large amount of real-time acoustic information. They combine some natural ability with yearlong shore-based training before putting on a set of headphones at sea. The means and methods of the sonar operator’s job are one part of science combined with some individual talent to recognize acoustic patterns both audibly and visually. In this article, we will dive into what a sonar team provides the tactical decision-makers on board a vessel and how they go about providing it. To understand how a sonarman analyzes acoustic detections , we must begin with understanding sound itself. Sound is energy moving through a medium, like water or air. It travels in sinusoidal waves radiating out in all directions from a source. These waves have both an amplitude energy level and a wavelength frequency. A sonar system will detect these waves and display them in different formats to the operator. Editor’s note: For those new to the topic, this is a very basic and brief description of a submarine’s sonar. It is dated in a sort of wonderful way, but still worthwhile for a basic primer: Sonar systems use a variety of arrays to detect energy. A single array is a group of elements that send information to the sonar beamformer. An element is a hydrophone that can be a piezoelectric device that is sensitive to sound or a more modern synthetic element that is much smaller. Smaller elements allow design engineers to add more receivers to an array while also shrinking its overall size. The sonar array feeds data into signal conditioners like a preamplifier and equalizer. This signal ‘cleaning’ is carefully done by the processor so as not to strip any contact information from the raw signal. The data passes into the beamformer, where it is ‘sorted’ in the proper direction. Now the sonar signal is ready for display on the operator’s console. The bow sonar arrays on the Seawolf class attack submarines. In addition to these primary arrays, modern submarines feature conformal arrays and towed arrays, which all contribute to the sonar ‘picture’ emanating out many miles from the submarines. , Penn State Navy ROTC Presentation Slide The sonar operator will analyze this signal on two general interfaces: the broadband display and narrowband display. The broadband shows the collective energy received by the array on a bearing over time in a ‘waterfall’ format, cascading down from top to bottom, like a digital scroll. Broadband sonar displays what areas around the array are louder than others. The sonarman can listen to each bearing and determine if the rise in background noise is a target or not. Modern sonar systems have multiple arrays displaying data at the same time in this format. When multiple arrays are involved, this requires two operators working together to manage the flow of real-time data and make tactical sense of it. The narrowband processors take the broadband energy and divide it into individual frequencies that cross the full spectrum of the array. The array size and number of elements determine the frequency range of the information displayed. This operator must carefully investigate every bearing and every frequency from every array in real-time. Narrowband sonar displays are a collection of data pages that are examined continuously, zoomed, interrogated, and calculated for possible contact relations. Sea environments vary greatly and have an enormous impact on sonar performance. Deep-sea oceans have unique characteristics like deep sound channels that trap noise and allow it to travel for hundreds of miles with very little loss of energy. Littoral areas have freshwater run-offs from rivers and snow melts create vertical sound barriers that reflect your own sound. It’s like sailing in a sonic hall of mirrors. Ice caps and marginal ice zones are noisy areas that can mask and reflect sonar signals from moment to moment as you pass beneath ice keels. It’s like walking through a forest blindfolded where you can only detect the tree when it’s at arm’s length. USN via Seaforces.org The sonar picture of the area around the platform (ship or submarine) is a tactical puzzle. Small, inconsistent, and unrelated data must be pieced together to determine if a contact is detected. Once one is, the sonar system will begin tracking the noise source for the operators. Several passive ranging techniques, speed calculation, and real-time bearing change formulas are used to generalize the target’s position. In a high contact environment, this can rapidly overwhelm an operator. To help manage the flow of information, the Sonar Supervisor stands behind the operators where they can see all the displays. They act as a second set of eyes looking for things the operators may have missed. He or she is typically the most experienced operator on the team and can help classify and localize a new detection. The Sonar Supervisor is the liaison between the raw acoustic data and the Approach Officer. The Approach Officer is typically the Captain, but can be any commissioned officer. The Sonar Supervisor is responsible for providing a clear picture of the real world tactical situation outside the submarine and to make sure that it matches the tactical fire control system’s report. There is a team of people working the fire control computers, this is the Fire Control Tracking Party, they set the target solution. This is the solution a weapon will be given before it’s launched. The sonar supervisor has an independent solution he calculates from the raw acoustic data. He is the check between the reality outside the submarine and what the fire control tracking party believes is happening. USN The sonar system assists in target detection and classification. Automated and manually designated threat events are preloaded into the sonar computers. If the requirements are met, the sonar display will mark the detection to bring the operator’s attention to it. The automated tracking system tracks and stores contact history without operator action. When the sonarman assigns his tracker, the sonar computer already has the recent history of the target and offers it to the operator for analysis. Let’s go through a hypothetical mission where all this comes together. Before we get underway we swing by the squadron building and pick up our package. It contains the latest weather projections for our operating area and any units that are not in port and maybe in the area. We get underway and update the sonar search plan with the probable threats we expect to encounter. During our transit time, we are receiving radio traffic updating us with unit locations, both NATO and otherwise, that may be in our area. We attend daily ‘Warfighter Councils’ in the wardroom where we brief the Captain about our current environment and expected encounters, if any. This is were we deconflict the operating schedule of the submarine’s mission assignments. We can’t conduct noisy evolutions on the mission, so we get that done early while underway. Intelligence updates are discussed here and changes to the sonar search plan are discussed. Just before the mission begins, we will pull into the nearest NATO or Pacific Fleet port and pick up a fresh pack of food, drop off any trash, and most importantly pick up the ‘Spooks.’ Spooks are crypto-radio sailors who spend most of their time locked inside the radio room’s exclusion area, but are vital to mission success. The Office of Naval Intelligence will also send us two or three specially trained sonarmen to assist us in tracking and recording the mission targets from the sonar perspective. A Submarine Group or admiral’s representative will ride with us as well. USN Once on station, the sonar team manning is increased. We switch to eight hours on watch, eight hours off watch ‘Port and Starboard’ rotations. Half the 14-man sonar division is on watch at any time. This is required for recording verification, annotation, and documenting the events that are about to unfold. Each sonar operator is wearing headphones, listening to the low volume static-like white noise of the ocean. The watches are long and intense as each new update is vigorously scrutinized for detection. Patterns are matched and measured with onscreen tools and cursors. Automatic artificial intelligence algorithms flag potential targets for the sonar operators to verify. Target acquisition in sonar begins a series of events. Trackers are assigned to the target from every array that correlates to the detection. Initial movements are closely monitored because no one is sure how close the new contact is to their own ship. ‘Quick quiet’ is announced silently by cycling the lights around the submarine. No one moves. The engine room watch stands in place with their logs in hand. The cooks in the galley are like statues with mitten gloves and serving pans. No one moves. Generally speaking, Sonarmen are trained to detect changes in patterns. A sharp, metallic transient object is out of place in the natural undersea world. A narrowband frequency shift or a distant active sonar can be subtle, but the experienced sailor can quickly identify these changes. These are the audio and visual cues the trained sonar operator hunts for tirelessly while on watch. USN Contact classification is done in two steps: First, the initial classification is the impression the operator gets when he first hears the target. General categories are biologics (fish and sea life), seismic (earthquakes), merchant, aircraft, trawler, warship, and submarine. It can also be a transit detection like a sharp metallic sound that is heard out of the blue or active sonar that lights up a display like it’s the holidays. The second step in classification requires analysis. It takes 30 to 45 seconds to get a look at a new detection and discover what kind of engine she’s running, what kind of hydraulic pumps are online, and what screw blade configuration she is using. This second step is what confirms the initial classification or changes it to the correct one. The analysis of information is a large part of the sonar team’s responsibility. Data is not just directed from the array to fire control. The experienced sonar team analyzes each detection for the contact’s characteristics. Target classification is a stepped process of assigning a general rating like biologic or merchant, then refining it into a specific classification as more information is available. The target solution begins with a general direction of motion and is improved to a particular course, speed, and range. Today’s military algorithms can solve these questions quickly, but they still must be verified by the sonar team. Just outside our submarine, our target unknowingly passes along our port side. We wait as the contact passes through CPA (closest point of approach) and opens range. During this time, sonar data is sent to the fire control computers and a solution is set. When the Captain is ready, he will order us to come around and begin to trail the target. In the control room, the target solution is laid down on a Fusion Plot. The Fusion Plot combines all the targets from every array on a single image anyone on the Tracking Party can use to get the contact picture around our submarine. Information like detailed frequency analysis from the target’s mechanical and electrical sources are also plotted and used to help confirm the solution. Target frequencies are recorded and plotted over time. As the target moves, the frequency shifts slightly due to its Doppler effect. Watching this Doppler shift is one method sonar ‘sees’ the contact and plots its position. A well-trained team will do this without direction. Contact classification and other updates are passed over sound powered circuits that allow quiet communication between stations. At the sonar consoles, some operators are tasked with finding new contacts. Just because we found our high-value target doesn’t mean he’s alone. In fact, he’s probably not. Few countries outside NATO operate independently. The hunt continues. USN Tracking contacts while searching for new targets requires a disciplined operator. Contact maneuvers, changes in the environment, and automated tracker failures must be recognized immediately as not to ruin the contact solution with false data. The search for new contacts continues while the operator ensures a solid contact track is maintained. Every direction, elevation, frequency, and automated detection must be verified on each array. Then the search cycle begins again and is repeated for up to six hours at a time. A sonar watch is exhausting and deserves a good shower afterward. The intense cooperation of the sonar team and the sonar algorithms are necessary to be successful in the high data flow of today’s complex sonar environments. The sea is full of noise. Fishing trawlers, long voyage merchant ships, wind, rain, tectonic and biological activity is a constant backdrop the sonar operator must use their tools to peer through the deepsea veil and find the target. Sonar employment is a hunt. Underway, the sonar team is planning tactical positions, taking advantage of the environment and topography to catch their prey. The target knows they are being hunted. They are planning their own ambush and have a lot of the same tools we have. This hunt is also addictive and keeps sonarmen coming back for more—studying the environment, looking for that acoustic advantage that may be the difference between success and being detected. It’s a tactical game where the board is constantly changing. There is no procedure or checklist to follow at this point. When the sonarman dons their headphones, they must use initiative, intuition, and individual ability to execute their role within the sonar team in order to catch the target. This is what it’s like to hunt on a submarine. Dominating an engagement with superior ability and tactical execution is the reward that keeps these undersea hunters coming back. Once you experience victory at sea, nothing else can give you a similar feeling. It makes the hard work in the training simulators, hours of lecture, reading, and study worth the effort. Improved knowledge and practical experience give today’s sonarmen the confidence and ability to fight and win the next hunt. Aaron Amick is a retired U.S. Navy submarine sonarman.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 11, 2020",Why Russia’s MiG-35 Is Starting To Look Like A Dead Duck,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Almost four years on from the MiG-35’s first flight, there’s no sign of the hoped-for large-scale orders for the warplane from the Russian Defense Ministry. The Fulcrum-F — described by the manufacturer as a “Gen 4++” fighter — had been slated to begin frontline squadron service around mid-2020, but to date, Russia has purchased only six examples. The latest iteration of the Fulcrum, which is based on the standard MiG-29 ‘s 43-year-old Cold War-era design , entered development in 2014 thanks to defense ministry funding ready to meet a domestic requirement, but the fighter is still undergoing its mandated state flight-test campaign. It had been hoped that trials would be completed by late 2018 or early 2019, after which Moscow would place an order for at least 30 aircraft. Confusingly, the Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG (RAC MiG) has used the MiG-35 designation before its current and latest incarnation. The name was previously applied to a pair of prototypes flown as long ago as December 2011 and then offered, unsuccessfully, to India under its 126-aircraft Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) tender. Although speculative — the prototypes were based on modified MiG-29K/KUB naval fighters — the promised Indian MiG-35 would have been more advanced than the current offering, including a Phazotron-NIIR Zhuk-AE active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar. The first two pre-production examples of this latest MiG-35 were presented to officials in an official ceremony at RAC MiG’s Lukhovitsy factory, southeast of Moscow, in January 2017. During the event, Russian Aerospace Forces commander-in-chief Colonel General Viktor Bondarev said that all of the service’s “lightweight” fighters would eventually be replaced by the new MiG-35. The MiG-35 cockpit is dominated by three liquid-crystal displays and a HUD., RAC MiG The initial two jets were single-seat MiG-35S, with the bort number ‘702,’ and two-seat MiG-35UB, carrying ‘712’. These aircraft had both completed maiden flights towards the end of November 2016. While test work continues, the defense ministry has signed up to buy just six MiG-35s, ordered in August 2018 under the State Armament Program. This token force — four single-seaters and a pair of two-seaters — will continue the evaluation effort and are then expected to join the Strizhi (Swifts) aerial display team based at Kubinka near Moscow. In August last year, RAC MiG admitted the joint state tests wouldn’t be complete before the end of 2021. It’s a far cry from earlier ambitions to introduce the MiG-35 as standard “lightweight” fighter across the Russian Aerospace Forces, also known by the Russian acronym VKS. In the meantime, the requirement for such a fighter looks increasingly questionable. With just one frontline MiG-29 unit remaining in the VKS order of battle, it’s hard to see exactly where the MiG-35 fits in. Rather than trading legacy Fulcrums for brand-new MiG-35s, some squadrons have switched to the “heavyweight” Su-30SM Flanker instead. Moreover, when it comes to the price tag, the difference between “lightweight” products from RAC MiG and the “heavyweight” offerings from the Sukhoi stable can be overstated. Even in its original form, the cost of a basic MiG-29 was 80% that of the Su-27 Flanker . The difference in operating costs between the two fighters was also similar. Plans to outfit the Strizhi team with MiG-35s were revealed by the then commander of the VKS, Lieutenant General Andrey Yudin, in March 2017. While the team’s aircrew do have a frontline combat tasking alongside their display work, it’s likely the jets would mainly be used to hunt for lucrative export orders. It was at one stage expected that Strizhi pilots would get their hands on MiG-35s from late 2019, during a conversion course with the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center at Akhtubinsk in Russia’s southwestern Astrakhan region — there is no confirmation that this happened. It’s noteworthy that while the Strizhi team still relies on the veteran Soviet-era MiG-29, the VKS’ Russikiye Vityazi (Russian Knights) team traded its Su-27s for Su-30SMs back in 2017 and has now begun to receive the latest Su-35S Flankers , too. A MiG-35 prototype carries four KAB-500Kr TV-guided bombs and a pair of inert R-73 air-to-air missiles., RAC MiG The other prime candidate to receive the MiG-35 within the VKS is the 3624th Aviation Base at Erebuni, in neighboring Armenia — the last of the air arm’s frontline MiG-29 operators. Back in February 2017, the base’s commander, which Russian media only referred to as Colonel Petrov, said that the unit’s aging MiG-29s would be replaced by MiG-35s. With no follow-on contract signed, delivery of the jets to the air force’s Armenian outpost has become an increasingly remote prospect. More recently, it’s been suggested the base will start to receive new Su-30SMs instead . Should the new-generation Fulcrum ever enter VKS service, it will likely receive the MiG-35S (single-seat) and MiG-35UB (two-seat) designations. Internally, RAC MiG calls these aircraft 9.41SR and 9.47SR respectively — in fact, they both share a common airframe structure and cockpit canopy. The single simply eliminates the seat from the rear cockpit and replaces it with an additional fuel tank. The MiG-35 is a far cry from the basic and strictly limited capability MiG-29. The advanced cockpit is furnished with three color liquid-crystal displays as well as a monochrome head-up display (HUD). The fighter’s Phazotron-NIIR FGM-129 Zhuk-M radar — inherited from the carrier-based MiG-29KR/KUBR — features a mechanically scanned slotted-array antenna rather than an AESA. It’s combined with a new OLS-UEM optronic system that brings together electro-optical and infrared sensors plus a laser rangefinder/designator. The pilot is also provided with a helmet-mounted display system. The MiG-35 in single-seat form. Both this and the two-seat fighter share a common cockpit canopy., RAC MiG While token efforts were made to enhance the MiG-29’s survivability during its early development, the MiG-35 features a more modern self-protection suite in which a radar warning receiver is combined with a missile approach warning system (six ultraviolet sensors to ensure 360-degree coverage) and two wingtip laser warners. The suite can be complemented by an external radar jamming pod. The latest-generation armament includes both air-to-air and air-to-ground stores, among them the RVV-SD air-to-air missile, an improved version of the R-77 , with active radar seeker for engagements at beyond visual range. Alongside the full range of conventional air-to-ground weapons, new-generation precision-guided stores include the modular Kh-38 air-to-surface missile and the Grom family of glide munitions. A twin-seat MiG-35 leads a two-ship formation., RAC MiG The appearance of a further refined MiG-35 at last year’s biennial MAKS airshow outside Moscow indicated that RAC MiG has begun to look for MiG-35 customers further afield. This MiG-35 variant was presented in a “renewed export configuration” with enhanced avionics including open-architecture software, reinstated Zhuk-AE AESA radar, plus a new larger wing and tail. In this form, the jet is being offered to India to meet its new requirement for 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA). Here, the Russian manufacturer faces stiff competition from Airbus Defence and Space, Boeing, Dassault Aviation, Lockheed Martin, Saab, and Sukhoi. Without a doubt, the MiG-35 is a capable fighter. The similar MiG-29M/M2 has also secured an export order from Egypt . However, prospects for the new-generation Fulcrum with the Russian Aerospace Forces appear slim. Combined with the continued ascendancy of the Flanker, and with the all-new Su-57 waiting in the wings, it’s becoming increasingly hard to make the case for a large-scale MiG-35 order.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",The British Had A Plan To Drop Anthrax Laced Cattle Feed Over Germany In 1942,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Under the darkly ironic codename Operation Vegetarian, the United Kingdom developed a scheme to respond in kind should Nazi Germany unleash a biological warfare attack on the British mainland during World War II. The fear of Hitler employing germ warfare was very real, intensifying after the fall of France in the summer of 1940, after which the United Kingdom was expected to be the next major target of the German military conquest of Western Europe. Chair of the Bacteriological Committee in the United Kingdom, Lord Maurice Hankey urged Prime Minister Winston Churchill to look into the practicality of biological weapons “so as to put ourselves in a position to retaliate if such abominable weapons should be used against us.” Churchill agreed and set up a team of scientists at Porton Down, a top-secret laboratory in Wiltshire, southwest England, to embark on a project examining options for reprisal — should it ever be needed. The choice of biological weapon fell on anthrax . Caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis , anthrax is a familiar agent of biological warfare. Anthrax spores occur in nature and can be produced in a lab. The spores can be delivered in the form of powders or sprays, or via contaminated food and water, and can persist in the environment for decades. Humans contract the disease when spores enter the body via a cut or scrape (cutaneous anthrax), via inhalation (pulmonary) or by consumption of infected meat (gastrointestinal). While pulmonary is the most lethal (around 80% mortality, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ), the gastrointestinal version used for Operation Vegetarian still results in death in between 25% and 75% of cases. These figures all depend on levels of exposure and availability of antibiotics, which can usually treat cutaneous anthrax. Maurice Hankey, in 1934., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Tests were conducted on Gruinard Island on Scotland’s north coast and on Penclawdd off the Welsh coast. The former was bombarded with anthrax spores from the air by Vickers Wellington medium bombers, killing the island’s resident sheep within three days. Penclawdd, meanwhile, was attacked by a Bristol Blenheim in a follow-up test. The twin-engine bomber delivered a single device from around 5,000 feet. Its target was two lines of sheep — 60 in all — placed downwind of the impact point. The three pounds of liquid anthrax spores were found only to have killed two animals outright. Nevertheless, after these trials, anthrax was judged 100 times more effective than a chemical agent on a weight-for-weight basis. January 1942 saw the go-ahead for Britain’s production of anthrax on a large scale with the War Cabinet simultaneously recommending that it be used against Germany as a reprisal weapon if Britain was attacked using germ warfare. Porton Down scientists by 1943 had produced an operational stockpile of five million cattle cakes infected with anthrax spores. Under Operation Vegetarian, these were to be delivered by Royal Air Force Avro Lancaster bombers — 12 in total — that would drop the deadly cargo over northern Germany. Aiming for farmland rather than population centers, the scheme was planned to wipe out the country’s beef and dairy cattle. As well as removing a vital food source, the bacterium would also work its way into the human food chain that was expected to lead to fatalities numbering tens or hundreds of thousands, if not millions. The Lancaster was an obvious choice for the mission, had it ever been sanctioned. The four-engine type had entered service in December 1941 and would go on to excel both as a conventional heavy bomber and in a range of more unconventional missions, including dropping the 22,000-pound “Grand Slam” earthquake bomb and the “Upkeep” bouncing bombs that breached German dams in the raids of May 1943. Of course, Hitler never sanctioned the use of biological warfare for reasons that have never been fully explained. It’s been speculated he may have had an aversion to germ warfare based on his experience of being gassed in World War I or his phobia of microbes . The Nazis nonetheless carried out research in this area including establishing an entomological institute to study the physiology and control of insects that inflict harm to humans. British anthrax stockpiled under Operation Vegetarian was ultimately destroyed at the end of the war — all but two crates of infected cattle cakes were incinerated. It’s not clear what became of the remainder, but the spores they contained were still judged to be effective as of 1955. The defeat of Nazi Germany was not the end of British interest in biological warfare. On the contrary, with the beginning of the Cold War, the focus now turned to the Soviet Union, which had begun its own experiments in the field before World War II and which had captured a Japanese biological weapons facility in Manchuria. The effect of the anthrax tests on the British islands was dramatic and long-lasting, including reports of livestock deaths on the Scottish mainland after an infected sheep carcass from Gruinard was washed up on a beach. According to Porton Down’s official account, the mile-long island was not fully decontaminated until 1986 following a painstaking sterilization process amid mounting public pressure . Today, Porton Down continues to play a role in biological and chemical weapons – rather than developing them for potential wartime use, it’s now tasked with developing countermeasures. It was also a focus of attention in the wake of the poisoning by nerve agent of former Russian military officer and double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, in nearby Salisbury in March 2018. A scientist at the Defence Science & Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, 2011., CROWN COPYRIGHT Operation Vegetarian — details of which for many years remained within classified the National Archives — is clearly one of the more extreme plans hatched by the Allies during World War II, but it’s a clear reminder of the kind of thinking at the highest military levels during one of the darkest periods in Europe’s history.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 17, 2018",This Was The Largest Conventional Explosion America Ever Set Off,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The massive explosion at the Port of Beirut in Lebanon yesterday quickly drew comparisons to a nuclear bomb going off, especially due to the huge shockwave and mushroom cloud it produced, despite those being characteristics of any large detonation. In fact, the United States and others have used very large amounts of conventional explosives over the years to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon without the complexities and environmental concerns associated with actually setting one off. The largest of these – which was the biggest single deliberate conventional explosive detonation ever – was a test on June 27, 1985, called Minor Scale , that involved detonating 4,744 tons of ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) explosive at the Permanent High Explosive Testing Grounds (PHETG), situated within the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. For comparison, Lebanese authorities say that around 2,750 tons of pelletized ammonium nitrate was a key contributor to the blast in Beirut, which, as Hans Kristensen, the Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists noted, is less than two thirds the basic weight of the explosive pile assembled for Minor Scale. The Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA), which eventually morphed into the present-day Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), conducted Minor Scale to gather data on how a nuclear explosion might affect various pieces of military hardware, including the Hard Mobile Launchers for the then-in-development MGM-134A Midgetman intercontinental ballistic missile. The 4,744 tons of ANFO, placed inside a fiberglass dome and detonated at ground level, produced a blast equivalent to just over four kilotons of TNT. DNA’s intent was to roughly simulate the effects of a nuclear warhead with an eight kiloton yield air-bursting over the target area. The previous record-holder for largest planned single explosive detonation had been an event nicknamed the “ British Bang ” in Germany’s Heligoland archipelago in the North Sea, which the U.K. government had gained control of following the end of World War II. Evacuated of its residents during the war and used primarily as a bombing range immediately after, the Royal Navy disposed of approximately 4,000 tons of surplus munitions by blowing them up on one of the islands on April 18, 1947. The force of the blast was roughly equal to 3.2 kilotons of TNT and created a large crater dubbed the Mittelland. The United Kingdom returned the islands to Germany in 1952. The Minor Scale test was only one of a number of conventional explosions used to simulate nuclear weapons effects that the United States, as well as Canada and Australia, carried out starting the 1950s. These included the Sailor Hat tests that the U.S. Navy executed between November 1964 and June 1965. The first of these was Sailor Hat Alpha, an underwater detonation in the Pacific Ocean near San Clemente Island off the coast of Southern California, which used a charge that produced the same blast effect as 20 tons of TNT. The remaining three tests all involved explosive piles, each one of which with an approximate yield of 500 tons of TNT, on land at Smuggler Cove on the Hawaiian island of Kahoʻolawe. After the Minor Scale test, the Defense Nuclear Agency had said it did not intend to carry out any future detonations that would involve a larger explosive pile. “Future tests are not expected to get bigger than Minor Scale,” a 1986 report on the test said. “There are no plans for a test called Major Scale.” However, this kind of testing did still continue after Minor Scale. Another particularly large Defense Nuclear Agency test, called Misty Picture , took place at the PHETG at White Sands on May 17, 1987. This involved the detonation of 4,685 tons of ANFO and produced a blast equivalent to just under 4 kilotons of TNT. The Misty Picture explosive test., DOD One of the last planned such explosive tests was one known as Divine Strake, which DTRA, the Defense Nuclear Agency’s successor, planned to carry out in 2006. This was to involve setting off 700 tons of ANFO inside a tunnel at the Department of Energy’s Nevada Test Site ostensibly to help in the development of deep-penetrating conventional weapons to defeat facilities involved in the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. The agency insisted that the event was not related in any way to nuclear effects testing, despite the obvious potential value in the development of bunker-busting nuclear weapons, as highlighted in a number of press reports at the time. In 2007, DTRA formally canceled the test in the face of controversy over its intended purpose and concerns that it could launch radioactive dust , leftover from previous nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site, into the atmosphere. “I have become convinced that it’s time to look at alternative methods that obviate the need for this type of large-scale test,” then-DTRA Director Dr. James Tegnelia said in a statement on Feb. 22, 2007. “This decision was not based on any technical information that indicates the test would produce harm to workers, the general public, or the environment,” an accompanying DTRA press release said. No matter what Divine Strake’s actual intended purpose might have been, it, along with Minor Scale and these other tests, all remind us of the immense destructive power that conventional explosives can produce, as was on full display during the recent tragic events in Beirut.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on May 14, 2021",Check Out This Incredibly Rare Image Of An F-22 Pilot Wearing A Helmet Mounted Display,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When discussing modern air-to-air fighter aircraft, the U.S. Air Force’s F-22A Raptor is typically smothered with superlatives, yet to this day its pilots still don’t wear a helmet-mounted display — one of the modern standards for even lesser fighters. After being dropped from the original program requirements due to time, cost, and integration hurdles, the U.S. Air Force openly discussed plans to try and upgrade the jet with such a system back in 2013, but operational squadrons have never received them. The War Zone has received an exclusive image that clearly shows a Raptor operational test pilot wearing the Thales Scorpion Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) in 2014. The photograph was apparently taken at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, during the planned test program that was outlined the year before. However, the official results of this evaluation and any further fielding plans remain unknown. The USAF wanted the F-22 to have an HMD by 2020 to tie in with weapons upgrades. Although pilots were reportedly impressed with Scorpion, unknown issues kept it from being deployed across much of the relatively small F-22 fleet . The Scorpion HMD system fits onto the Raptor pilot’s existing helmet, adding a “monocle” in front of one eye to display high-definition color symbology. Unlike early iterations of the widely adopted Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System JHMCS, it is adaptable to night vision goggles. These fit in front of the eyepiece so the pilot can still see the data it displays in darkness. The modification also adds a somewhat domed visor, which does appear rather large under the Raptor’s sleek canopy. Judging by the image, it seems the increased size of the helmet might have impedeed the pilot’s ability to look round at extreme angles in the rear hemisphere. A frontal view of an F-22A Raptor., Jamie Hunter As noted earlier, the Raptor was always intended to have an HMD. Although leveraging such a system for short-range air-to-air missile targeting has been standard fare for Russian fighters for decades, it wasn’t until the mid-2000s when the F-15 Eagle combined the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) with the high-off-boresight capabilities of the AIM-9X Sidewinder that the USAF was able to employ such a capability. Since then it has become widespread across the Air Force and Navy tactical jet inventories. Modern fighter pilots are bombarded with a wealth of information from the aircraft’s various sensors. Being able to stay “heads-up,” looking out of the cockpit, and monitoring critical flight information and targeting data, is a valuable part of overall situational awareness. It is well known that attempts to magnetically “map” the F-22’s cockpit for JHMCS proved problematic, with low-observable treatments and other cockpit design elements hampering its integration. As F-22 procurement was slashed from 750 aircraft to just 187 production Raptors, the fighter became a lower priority for the Pentagon, especially as the larger and export-capable F-35 program grew in stature. Despite the Raptor exhibiting blistering performance in aerial engagements during exercises, funding for upgrades had to be rationed. Meanwhile, most other tactical fighters in the U.S. inventory were receiving HMDs, initially JHMCS, and those not selected for this system subsequently began receiving the Scorpion system. It was initially fielded in the A-10C Thunderbolt II , and later in earlier-Block F-16C/Ds belonging to the Air National Guard and Reserve. An A-10C pilot wearing a Scorpion HMD., Jamie Hunter Meanwhile, F-22 upgrades became focused on its secondary air-to-ground capability amid a need to give the Raptor more diverse capabilities and not just focused on the air-to-air role. Increment 3.1 in 2011 added “Global Strike” capabilities, with provision for the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb. Increment 3.2A added a range of combat identification improvements and a receive-only mode for the Link-16 data link. However, the follow-on 3.2B was focused on improved air-to-air missiles via the short-range AIM-9X and AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The USAF made significant ovation when the F-22 received the AIM-9X , which was a long-overdue upgrade over the AIM-9M that it previously carried. However, the lingering lack of an HMD meant Raptor pilots were unable to leverage the missile’s high-off-boresight abilities beyond using the radar alone to direct the missile’s seeker. Despite the Raptor’s impressive thrust-vectoring maneuverability, the ability to target enemy aircraft at short range without having to point the jet’s nose at them can mean the difference between winning and losing in a dogfight. The HMD also increases situational awareness dramatically for the pilot. An AIM-9X loaded on an F-22A., Jamie Hunter “ Thrust vectoring gives you the ability to point, but it doesn’t mean you’re automatically going to win,” an F-22 Weapons Officer told The War Zone . The F-22’s strength starts with its prowess in beyond-visual-range (BVR) air combat — killing an enemy aircraft at long range. However, modern aerial engagements often require visual identification of the target before firing due to rules of engagement to mitigate the chance of killing a friendly asset. Moreover, an F-22 only carries six long-range AIM-120s, and therefore could easily be overwhelmed by enemy mass. Faced with a large formation of opposing fighters, “leakers” could potentially get past the barrage of long-range missiles and into close-quarters air combat. Moreover, the increasing use of modern infrared search and track (IRST) systems means the stealthy Raptor cannot count on the element of surprise. The Raptor’s stealth, high-situational awareness, and blistering performance are a clear advantage. Theoretically, an adept F-22 pilot should be able to sneak up on an enemy aircraft and deliver a knockout punch without the opponent ever knowing it was there. But, as laid out above, that isn’t always the case and the possibility of getting into that close-in dogfight means that a surprisingly high emphasis is placed on this type of training at operational F-22 squadrons. Slowing down to point the jet’s nose is a classic Achilles’ heel and risks potential attack. Maintaining a high energy state is key in multi-aircraft close-range engagements. While the thrust vectoring clearly has its uses in close-range air combat, being able to out-turn the enemy, and bring legacy air-to-air missiles and the gun to bear, the lack of HMD remains a critical deficiency now that the AIM-9X is integrated onto the jet. The first guided launch of an AIM-9X from an F-22 Raptor was completed on February 26, 2015, by Maj Christopher Guarente., Lockheed Martin/David Henry The F-22 first fielded the AIM-9X under Update 5 after a lengthy and drawn-out test program. This was an interim upgrade ahead of the full Increment 3.2B. While it provided the Raptor with an off-boresight close-in capability, it cannot be used to its full potential without a helmet cueing system. “We have AIM-9X on the jet now, which is a great improvement, but we would love to have a helmet [mounted cueing system],” one Raptor pilot told The War Zone .  “It’s more critical for our fourth-generation colleagues than it is for the Raptor, because typically I can arrive in the bandit’s six o’clock undetected.” Another admitted the F-22 remains at a disadvantage under some circumstanced in the close fight due to the lack of helmet sight. “We are not equal to the threat in that environment.” An F-22A with an AIM-9M extended out of the side weapons bay door., Jamie Hunter As we mentioned earlier, without an HMD, the F-22 must rely on its radar to provide cueing and telemetry to AIM-9X’s Block II missile’s data-link in what is called “helmetless high off bore-sight” (HHOBS). So instead of the helmet providing the targeting info, the radar does. This has some great advantages and severe limitations, but suffice it to say the F-22 is unable to take full advantage of the missile’s engagement envelope without the pilot wearing an HMD. You can read more about the whole F-22 helmet-mounted display and AIM-9X saga in this past feature of ours. A recent Air National Guard report entitled “Weapons Systems Modernization Priorities” states: “Multiple simulations and an operational utility assessment conducted by the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron demonstrated that using an HMD provides a distinct first- shot, first-kill advantage. Although this advantage applies primarily to within-visual-range engagements, the HMD also substantially increases situational awareness during beyond-visual- range intercepts.” Various efforts have been ongoing since 2015 towards finally giving the F-22 an HMD by this year, however, none have come to fruition. Studies are reported to include options for an all-new helmet, which could see a “toned-down” version of the F-35’s HMD being adopted. We are not aware of any progress in fielding such a system at this time. It is incredible that the world’s most expensive fighter aircraft, a thoroughbred design built to absolutely dominate air-to-air combat, still lacks a capability that is so prevalent in other types, especially when considering how the USAF relies so heavily on a small fleet of Raptors for air supremacy.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",This Is The First Photo Ever Of A Stealthy Black Hawk Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are constantly on the lookout for more details about the U.S. military’s highly elusive stealthy Black Hawk helicopters, one of which famously crashed during the raid that led to the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011, as well as any possible predecessors that predated them. Now, what appears to be a previously unpublished picture has come to our attention that shows a heavily modified EH-60 electronic warfare and signals intelligence variant of the Black Hawk. Is seems to be, at the very least, one of the missing links connecting the unique Black Hawk helicopters used on the Bin Laden raid and stealthy Black Hawk design concepts dating back to the 1970s. It is our understanding that the picture in question seen at the top of this story and again below in a slightly enhanced manner, has a relation to Fort Eustis in Virginia. In addition to being home to 128th Aviation Brigade, previously known as the U.S. Army Aviation Logistics School, Fort Eustis’ Felker Army Airfield it also hosts a unit commonly known as the Flight Concepts Division (FCD), that is now called the Aviation Technology Office (ATO). This is the unit understood to be responsible for leading the development of the stealth Black Hawks used during the Bin Laden raid and many of the U.S. Army’s most advanced and secretive rotary-wing capabilities. Uncredited The picture is undated and we have no immediate information about any program or programs the helicopter might have been associated with. The location where it was taken is also unknown, but is a desert locale that could indicate it was shot somewhere in the American southwest, which is home to a number of aviation test facilities, including top-secret air bases, such as Area 51 and the Tonopah Test Range Airport . The stealthy Black Hawks used in the Bin Laden raid were housed at the former, according to reports . The Bin Laden raid Black Hawks were said to be based on the special operations MH-60 airframe. However, the helicopter seen in the photo is clearly a heavily modified Sikorsky EH-60 variant, though it’s not clear if it is an EH-60A or EH-60L version. Both of these helicopters carried versions of the AN/ALQ-151 Quick Fix system , which was capable of both intercepting hostile electronic emissions and providing direction-finding information to locate the source, as well as electronic warfare jamming. The EH-60A carried the AN/ALQ-151(V)2 Quick Fix II system, while the EH-60L was equipped with the more capable AN/ALQ-151(V)3 Advanced Quick Fix suite. The helicopter has the four dipole antennas, two on each side of the tail boom, found on both the EH-60A and EH-60L. Under the fuselage, it appears to have the long, retractable whip antenna found on the EH-60A, versus the more robust antenna system found on the EH-60L. This ventral antenna is associated with of the AN/ALQ-17A(V)2 Trafficjam communications jamming system, which is part of the larger Quick Fix II suite. An early EH-60A helicopter in flight with its retractable ventral antenna in the deployed position., US Army via Ray Wilhite An EH-60L helicopter, showing its significantly different ventral antenna configuration., US Army It also has two large missile approach warning sensors, one on each side of the nose under the main cockpit doors, which are part of the AN/ALQ-156A Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) found on EH-60As and EH-60Ls. Two identical sensors were also mounted well behind the fuselage doors on this system, providing the Black Hawk with 360-degree coverage. The EH-60s were eventually equipped with a version of the AN/APR-39 radar warning system , as were other Black Hawks, which includes smaller receivers on the nose and tail of the helicopter. An EH-60A supporting Operation Desert Storm with the radar warning receivers seen fitted., US Army Two more radar warning receivers were installed at the rear of the fuselage between the main cabin and the tail boom., US Army Interestingly, it also has stub wings, which provide one hardpoint on each side of the helicopter. These are more commonly associated with MH-60L/M Direct Action Penetrators assigned to the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, as well as U.S. Navy MH-60S Seahawks . The External Stores Support System (ESSS) wing kit, which has two hardpoints on each side of the helicopter and was used on the EH-60L, is far more common. One of the US Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s MH-60L Direct Action Penetrators., US Army The helicopter’s most notable features are, of course, the extreme modifications to the nose, the “doghouse” where the engines and main gearbox are situated, as well as the engine intakes and exhausts. It also has a heavily modified rotor hub. All of these features appear to be designed to reduce its radar signature, especially from the critical forward hemisphere aspect. The duckbill-like nose is reminiscent in many ways of stealthy design concepts that Sikorsky crafted in 1978 for the U.S. Army Research and Technology Laboratory, a unit at Fort Eustis. This extensive study was the first indication of the Army’s interest in a reduced signature Black Hawk. You can read all about it in this previous War Zone feature . A diagram showing a stealthy Black Hawk concept that Sikorsky developed for the US Army in the late 1970s., USArmy In addition, the nose, as well as the doghouse and rotor hub, all have some visual similarities to a kit that Bell developed for the OH-58X Kiowa in the 1980s. We also detailed this little known about Kiowa stealth upgrade in this past War Zone feature . The Army evaluated, but did not adopt the OH-58X en masse, though it did buy a number of the stealthy kits for use with its OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopters. An OH-58X demonstrator., Bell via Flight Global Sikorsky had proposed using advanced radar-absorbing composite materials as part of its stealthy Black Hawk design studies in the late 1970s and Bell incorporated similar concepts into its OH-58X. Sikorsky also experimented with its S-75 technology demonstrator during the mid-1980s, which made heavy use of composites and informed the development of the abortive Boeing-Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche . The Comanche also featured a complex shrouded rotor hub design similar to this particular Black Hawk. It is almost certain that many, if not most of the additions to this EH-60 were also made of composites to help improve with radar signature reduction and limit the additional weight added to the helicopter when installed. The Sikorsky S-75., Sikorsky An RAH-66A Comanche prototype., Boeing-Sikorsky It’s also worth noting that the modified engine intakes on this Black Hawk appear to help conceal the fan faces of its two turbine engines and dramatically clean up the area around the engine nacelles and forward doghouse area. These are all features that traditionally have a high degree of radar reflectivity. Later model UH-60As and UH-60Ls, as well as other H-60 variants based on those versions, also have infrared reduction fairings over their exhausts that have an opening at the front that allows cool air to pass through. On the aircraft in question, this area has been screened-over likely with a radar attenuating mesh. A closeup of the engine intake and exhaust fairing as seen on typical UH-60As and Ls., US Army A mirrored close up of the intake and exhaust on the modified EH-60 for comparison., US Army Unlike the helicopters used in the Bin Laden raid, this particular example has no modifications to its tail rotor, which would have negatively impacted its all-aspect radar reflectivity and especially its acoustic signature. However, the radar reflectivity of the helicopter’s front aspect would have been the most pressing concern when it comes to RF stealth, especially when penetrating into heavily defended areas. We also don’t know whether additional stealthy add-ons, especially for the tail, were developed later for this project or were otherwise not fitted in this particular instance. Without knowing the particular variant of EH-60, it is especially hard to try to determine the date of this photograph. Sikorsky began developing the EH-60A for the Army in 1980 after the service decided against fielding the Quick Fix II system on a variant of the venerable Bell Huey helicopter known as the EH-1X. The EH-60As would eventually replace older EH-1H helicopters equipped with the AN/ALQ-151 and AN/ALQ-151(V)1 Quick Fix suites. A low-quality picture of one of the 10 EH-1Xs built for the Army before work shifted to the EH-60A. Note the Quick Fix II system’s whip antenna in its deployed position under the tail., US Army Between 1989 and 1990, work began on the Advanced Quick Fix system, which was originally supposed to go on another UH-60A variant, known as the EH-60C. The Army eventually decided to install it on a modified UH-60L, taking advantage of that variant’s more powerful engines. This became the EH-60L. This is not to be confused with EUH-60L helicopters configured as airborne command posts. The Army did not ultimately pursue the Advanced Quick Fix system, and the helicopter to go with it, on a widespread basis, a fate that befell many U.S. military programs in development right around the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Based on what we know, it is very plausible that this photograph was taken sometime in the late 1980s or more likely the 1990s. This would fit with the work Sikorsky was doing together with Boeing at that time on what would become the RAH-66, though it’s not clear how these two efforts may have been related. The use of an EH-60, in this case, may simply have had to do with this particular helicopter being available to take part in some tests. The small EH-60 force is known to be used for various tests and modifications trials. It’s also worth noting that it has long been reported that the stealth Black Hawks employed during the Bin Laden raid had a “snap-on”-type kit, but the tail from the one that crashed has long seemed far too elaborate to be part of that kind of very temporary modification. Public Domain It’s possible that there might have been some confusion as to how far work on stealthy modifications to the Black Hawk had progressed by time of the historic raid. The helicopters were an extremely well-kept secret at the time, one that we would have likely never learned about if the crash hadn’t occurred. Pentagon officials could have misconstrued older tests with more basic kits with a far more elaborate configuration used on the raid. There is also a possibility that the Army may have been interested in developing a stealthy kit for more general use on its Black Hawks and this was one rendition of such a solution. Adding these features to the EH-60 variants specifically could have been a more concerted effort, as well. A decreased radar signature could help those platforms get close to their targets without detection and then jam them, creating paths for non-stealthy helicopters, as well as fixed-wing aircraft, to follow through. A kit that could be added and removed from any Black Hawk variant, as necessary, would have been a good way to prevent any unnecessary exposure of the capability during routine operations. Any degradation in performance would not have been permanent, either, allowing the helicopters to fly in a normal configuration the rest of the time. Finally, we have to address the big question outstanding: could these modifications be the same as those used on the Bin Laden raid helicopters? Clearly it didn’t have anywhere near the same treatment to its tail. Could a kit exists that uses these forward elements, or very similar ones, with the addition of a far more elaborate tail assembly to reduce acoustic signature as well? That is possible, but at this point, our best guess is that this was an evolutionary stepping stone, or an earlier iteration, of what would eventually lead to the now-famous, but never seen ‘Stealth Hawks.’ Still, nobody who isn’t forbidden to discuss it on the record really knows for sure. In the past, The War Zone has been told that the Stealth Hawks used a MH-60 for their base platform, but an outer composite body was specifically built by Sikorsky to accommodate it, making it a far more elaborate and permanent application. We still have not been able to corroborate these claims. In addition, it is stated that newer and even more complex generations of the Stealth Hawks were built following the Bin Laden raid and are in service now. It’s amazing to think that it has been nearly a decade after the daring mission into Abbottabad went down, yet we still don’t have any additional official information about the helicopters used nor a single spotting of a similar platform. Maybe the best description of the aircraft from someone who actually took part in Operation Neptune Spear came from Robert O’Neil, who is often referred to controversially as ‘the man who killed Osama Bin Laden.’ He recounts the following in the weeks leading up to the raid: When we got to Nevada a few days later, where the team trained on another full-scale compound model, but this one crudely fashioned from shipping containers , we turned the corner, saw the helos we’d actually use, and I started laughing. I told the guys, “The odds just changed. There’s a 90 percent chance we’ll survive.” They asked why. I said, “I didn’t know they were sending us to war on a fucking Decepticon.” Now, thanks to this image, we finally have some hard evidence of what at least one rendition of a ‘Stealth Hawk’ actually looked like and Decepticon certainly fits the bill. We have already reached out to the Army for more information about this particular Black Hawk and any information about its stealthy features. We will be sure to let you know what else we are able to uncover about this helicopter. Authors Note: The original version of this story said that the EH-60s had a certain type of radar warning receivers, but those sensors are actually part of the AN/ALQ-156A Missile Approach Warning System. We have updated the article to reflect that.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 31, 2020",The Only Missile-Toting Ekranoplan Russia Ever Built Just Took Its Last Trip On The Caspian,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s only completed Project 903 Lun class ekranoplan , a type of wing-in-ground-effect craft , recently floated out onto the Caspian Sea for the first time in decades and probably for the last time ever. Designed by the Soviet Union during the latter stages of the Cold War as a high-speed anti-ship missile craft, it only saw very limited service and is now going on display at Patriot Park in the city of Derbent in Russia’s semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan. On July 31, 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the ekranoplan, also known as MD-160, had arrived in Derbent after a 14-hour journey south from the Russian Navy’s base in Kaspiysk, which is also in Dagestan, where it has been languishing in disrepair since it was withdrawn from service sometime in the late 1990s. It took a day to prepare the craft, which is non-operational at present, for the trip and a tug towed it to its new home. The plan to send MD-160 to Derbent had first emerged publicly in January. The primary construction of MD-160, which had a maximum takeoff weight of 837,757 pounds, began at the Krasnoye Sormovo plant along the Volga River in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, more than 940 miles north of Kaspiysk, in 1986. It was powered by eight Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofan engines, each with a maximum thrust rating of 28,600 pounds, mounted in two banks of four engines on each side of the forward fuselage. Wing-in-ground-effect designs are effectively very large aircraft that would primarily fly very close to the surface. They are generally flying boats, though, which allows for very efficient sustained high-speed flight, because it is easier and safer to operate them over water. However, any large flat space, including ice, will technically provide a suitable operating environment. Work on MD-160 was finished in 1991, just in time for the collapse of the Soviet Union, afterwords it was transferred to the Capsian Sea Flotilla, which had become part of the new Russian Navy. The Capsian Sea Flotilla had already been tasked with testing and evaluating ekranoplans under the Soviet Union, particularly the massive Korabl Maket, or “Ship Prototype,” better known as the Caspian Sea Monster , which arrived in 1966 and operated in the region until it was destroyed in an accident in 1980. The Caspian Sea Monster had a maximum takeoff weight of 1,199,315 pounds and was powered by 10 Dobrynin VD-7 turbojets, each rated at 28,670 pounds of thrust. It held the title of the largest and heaviest aircraft in the world until the Soviet Union’s Antonov An-225 Mriya flew for the first time in 1988. While the Capsian Sea Monster had been largely a research and development platform, the Lun class, which was originally expected to comprise eight examples in total, was to be a combat craft. The design featured six P-270 Moskit anti-ship missiles, also known to NATO as the SS-N-22 Sunburn, mounted in pairs on top of the central fuselage. A large surface search radar was installed in the tail. These ekranoplans were intended to launch high-speed attacks on hostile surface warships, while using their low-level flight profile and speed to enhance their survivability. However, Russia’s wing-in-ground-effect force never came to be. The economic turmoil in Russia that followed the fall of the Soviet Union led to the cancellation of numerous military projects. A satellite image of MD-160 at Kaspiysk in April 2020., Google Earth Even before the Soviet Union fell, there were questions about the future of the Lun class. A second example was under construction, but the Soviets had already decided to build it as an unarmed missile resupply variant to support MD-160. After the Soviet nuclear submarine K-278 Komsomolets sank in 1989, a proposal emerged to change its configuration again to one of search and rescue and mobile hospital platform, dubbed Spasatel , or “Rescuer.” You can read more about the K-278 accident, which has left the submarine leaking radiation on the bottom of the Barents Sea to this day, in this past War Zone piece . A model of Spasatel., TASS Russia revived the idea of finishing Spasatel in 2017 with a focus on operations in the increasingly strategic Arctic region , but no work to this end appears to have happened so far. This craft was reportedly nearly complete when the project came to an indefinite halt in the 1990s, but it has sitting in Nizhny Novgorod ever since and looks to be in questionable condition today. In 2018, there were also reports that the Russian military might be interested again in fielding missile-armed ekranoplans, but there have been no clear developments in this regard since then. Whatever Russia’s future ekranoplan plans might hold, the only completed example of the Lun class appears to have taken its last trip, but will now hopefully be better preserved as the interesting piece of history that it is.

Robert Hopkins,"Updated on Nov 19, 2020",Here’s How An EC-135 Crew Pulled Off One Of The Most Jaw-Dropping Air Show Takeoffs Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For years the RAF Mildenhall Air Fête was one of the highlights of the British air show season. Its reputation for bringing unusual, exotic, and far-flung visitors made it a “must-see” event for guests and flight crews alike. The Air Force’s EC-135H SILK PURSE definitely fit the bill of unique aircraft participants. The 10th Airborne Command and Control Squadron (ACCS), based at RAF Mildenhall from 1970 to 1991, operated five Boeing EC-135H SILK PURSE airborne command posts in support of the U.S. Commander-in-Chief, Europe (USCINCEUR), the head of U.S. European Command. These would launch in time of crisis to provide an aerial backup to ground-based command centers, and operated much like the BLUE EAGLE EC-135Js for the Pacific, the SCOPE LIGHT EC-135Ps for the Atlantic, and the EC-135Cs (including the vaunted LOOKING GLASS for Strategic Air Command) in the continental US. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gL0zdpPvxwc Traditionally, the 10th ACCS EC-135s made rather docile appearances at the Air Fête, usually flying in formation with U.K.-based fighters to demonstrate their air refueling capability. After one such display with F-111s , an image was altered to show one of the Aardvarks as a secret “Aurora” type airplane caught by an intrepid oil rig photographer over the North Sea, causing no end of wild speculation. Author’s collection With the anticipated disbandment of the 10th ACCS in late 1991 due to the “peace dividend” associated with the end of the Cold War, coupled with the extensive corrosion of the SILK PURSE fleet due to the salty damp air both in the United Kingdom and Lajes Field, the Azores, where the EC-135Hs sat ground alert, the unit planned for its final flight at the 1991 Air Fête. The aircraft commander for the flight was Major “Mad Jack” Elliott. He had previously flown the LOOKING GLASS EC-135Cs at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, the many different EC-135s at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, and the COBRA BALL RC-135S at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. Elliott was on one of the flights that witnessed the “Dome of Light” while flying out of Alaska. You can read all about these mysterious phenomena in this past War Zone feature . While stationed in Alaska, “Mad Jack” led the RC-135 Combat Tactics Team (along with the author), and took part in many spirited discussions about the performance of the TF33-equipped ‘135s. Part of this involved planning for an RC-135S takeoff in a high-threat condition, as the COBRA BALL was not equipped with the HAVE SIREN counter infrared system found on the RIVET JOINT RC-135V/W and COMBAT SENT RC-135U fleets. This meant an aggressive takeoff and climb would be used to reduce vulnerability to shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles , such as the SA-7 . In truth, there was little need for this at Eielson AFB, and zero need at the COBRA BALL’s forward operating location at Shemya AFB in the Aleutian Islands. Beginning in 1988, the RC-135S deployed to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa , with anticipated movements to other locations that were less secure than Alaska. As a result, these “hangar flying” debates were far more significant than mere “what if” exercises, and the general consensus was to climb at 3-engine speed plus 50 Knots-Indicated Air Speed (KIAS), irrespective of nose-up angle. 6th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing Tactics patch. , Author’s collection When the KC-135A first became operational, its low-thrust J57 engines barely provided sufficient thrust, even with water injection (thrust was 11,200 pounds ‘dry,’ 12,925 pounds ‘wet’), during its maximum fuel load takeoff for nuclear war. Consequently, the pitch picture at takeoff was a mere 8.5 or 9 degrees nose up, allowing the airplane to accelerate while providing a very minimal margin of error. With TF33 turbofans, thrust increased to 16,050 pounds (and 20,000 pounds for the F108 high-bypass turbofans on the KC-135R/T ). For decades, SAC operating procedures were clear: follow the 8.5 or 9 degree climb profiles or die. On 16th November 1988, KC-135R 62-3554 Cherokee Rose set 16 time-to-climb records up to just under 50,000 feet. Its F108 engines were fully uprated to 24,000 pounds of thrust. The airplane was airborne in an amazing five seconds , accelerated to 325 KIAS, then raised the nose to 27 degrees and maintained 0.78 Mach until reaching the desired altitude. Clearly, in the right conditions, the KC-135 was capable of more than its stodgy 8.5 or 9 degree rotation. Author’s collection KC-135R 62-3554 ‘Cherokee Rose’ used in the record-setting flights., Bruce Radebaugh With these thoughts in mind, “Mad Jack” and crew carefully planned their “takeoff to remember.” EC-135H 61-0291, named Anglian Lion, was chosen for the flight. Given that the airplane would carry only a minimal fuel load for the display, it was nearly 100,000 pounds lighter than its maximum takeoff weight, substantially improving its performance. Moreover, the crew planned to delay rotation from the calculated point on the runway to increase the airplane’s speed at takeoff. Tire placard speed—the maximum speed the tires can tolerate on the ground—is 198 KIAS, so the actual rotation point was carefully calculated to be less than this speed and with sufficient runway remaining to ensure becoming airborne safely. The aircraft would rotate to whatever nose-up attitude would allow the airplane to climb to approximately 1,500 ft before leveling off with a safety margin of 3-engine climb speed plus 50 KIAS in case of an engine failure after decision speed. The actual takeoff went as planned, although the steep angle led to decreased airflow through the engines, causing a noticeable compressor stall on the #4 engine. The crew chief, who was in the boom pod during takeoff, thought the airplane “went vertical!” The 7th Air Division commander, Brigadier General Kenneth L. Hagemann, who was unaware of the carefully planned start of the show, joked “there goes my career.” In any event, the takeoff certainly impressed the crowd! “Mad Jack” is center, kneeling; Kyle is center, standing in front of the entry door pressure plate., Andrew Kyle In today’s far more conservative Air Force, surely there are critics who would say this was unsafe for a big airplane like the EC-135, while citing the Thunderhawks KC-135 crash and the loss of the B-52 at Fairchild. Those are accidents from unrelated causes and are better left for another post. In the case of the Anglian Lion , however, this definitely non-standard takeoff was carefully calculated using official takeoff data and was well within the jet’s operational limits.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Russia Releases “Tsar Bomba” Test Footage Of The Most Powerful Nuclear Bomb Blast Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The nuclear bomb , codenamed “Ivan,” that was dropped by the Soviet Union over Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean on October 30, 1961, was the largest device of its kind ever detonated. The monstrous weapon had a yield of around 50 megatons — equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT. Until now, the available imagery of that test has been strictly limited, consisting of short, grainy clips and poor-quality stills. https://youtube.com/watch?v=nbC7BxXtOlo The colossal Ivan device was developed under a program known as izdeliye 202 (meaning “product 202”, otherwise known simply as “V”). Years later, when more details became known about it in the West, the weapon would be dubbed “Tsar Bomba.” On August 20, 2020, the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation — the Russian state concern responsible for nuclear enterprises, including nuclear weapons — released a 30-minute documentary film on its official YouTube channel showing the test in unprecedented detail, from the initial transport of the device itself to the mushroom cloud that later rose some 6.2 miles over the Arctic archipelago. The release of the film coincides with the 75th anniversary of Russia’s nuclear industry — although a thermonuclear bomb popularly described in the West as a “doomsday weapon” was perhaps an unusual choice for the commemoration. Regardless, it was a remarkable technological achievement. An engineer checks over the Ivan device before its transport to Olenya Air Base., ROSATOM While the style of the documentary is pure Soviet propaganda, it reveals plenty of fascinating details about the test. After the “Top Secret” titles, one anachronistic scene shows the fully assembled Ivan bomb moved at one stage by a steam train. Its destination was Olenya Air Base near Olenegorsk on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia, where the bomb was unloaded and then moved onward by truck. Remarkably, variants of the four-engine Tu-95 Bear bomber, the type that carried the devastating cargo aloft for the flight over the Barents Sea, remain in service today, though in much-modernized form. The particular aircraft used for the October 1961 test was the Tu-95V, a special adaptation of the first-generation Bear-A nuclear bomber, with an enlarged and reinforced bomb bay for semi-recessed weapon carriage. Like many other strategic bombers of its era, the Tu-95V featured an anti-nuclear-flash white scheme, although in this case it was extended to cover the propeller blades, too. The documentary shows us inside the cockpit of the Tu-95V, where aircrew don protective goggles before we see the 26.5-ton bomb falls away gently under a parachute towards its intended target — the Russian Defense Ministry’s State Testing Site No. 6 — close to Novaya Zemlya’s Matochkin Strait. The detonation itself is recorded from several different aspects, including from the air. The Tu-95V was accompanied for at least some of its mission by at least two other aircraft, including a twin-jet Tu-16 bomber serving as a “flying laboratory,” equipped with cameras, radio-telemetry equipment, oscilloscopes to determine the power of the explosion, and pressure recorders to measure the intensity of the shock wave. Other measuring equipment was installed on the Tu-95V itself, including sensor probes that replaced the usual tail gunner’s position. One scene from the documentary shows a model indicating a formation of five aircraft in total, at least at the start of the mission. The Tu-95V receives a coat of white paint on its contrarotating propellers. , ROSATOM The mission itself was controlled from an underground bunker at Belyusha Bay, 162 miles south of the test site. Closer to the site of the detonation itself was D-8, 56 miles from the test area, which housed further measuring and recording equipment, plus an underground command post, with warships being used as a communications relay between the two stations. State Testing Site No. 6 itself didn’t feature any buildings or vehicles to assess the damage, but was equipped with additional automated testing gear: cameras and filming equipment, and below-ground oscilloscopes. The bomb was dropped from the Tu-95V flying at an altitude of 34,449 feet, and detonation occurred at 13,123 feet above the ground — an airburst — which would have substantially reduced the radiation produced, and this may be the reason the documentary refers to the weapon as a “clean hydrogen bomb.” But of course, everything is relative when it comes to the world’s most powerful nuclear device. The mushroom cloud is seen from one of the aircraft involved in the mission., ROSATOM According to the video, the Tu-95V was 28 miles away from the release point, and the detonation produced a fireball visible 621 miles away, despite cloudy conditions. “The explosion was accompanied by a bright flash of unusual strength,” the narrator explains. Within seconds, a column of dust had risen to a height of around 6 miles. The footage then moves to one of the Tu-16 aircraft, at a distance of 155 miles from the detonation and we see the huge fireball, rising slowly and expanding to reach a maximum of 12 miles across. Forty seconds after the detonation, the fireball has reached a height of approximately 19 miles, after which a mushroom cloud begins to form, reaching a maximum height of 37-40 miles and a diameter of 56 miles. We see the Tu-95V returning home, with the mushroom cloud still visible at a distance of 497 miles, before we take to the ground “a few hours” after the explosion, to see the destruction wrought on Novaya Zemlya. Scientists are seen arriving onboard a specially-equipped Mi-4 helicopter radiation reconnaissance systems, disembarking unprotected, since “even in the very center of the site, [radiation] was insignificant.” Some of the team then put on protective gear and head by closer to the center of the test site, apparently using a GT-series tracked vehicles designed primarily for operations in snowy conditions. Here, for “dozens of kilometers” in every direction, the earth has been scorched, most of the snow vaporized, and the few structures that existed above the surface have been obliterated. A Mi-4 helicopter lands on the test site in the aftermath of the nuclear blast. , ROSATOM The Soviet Union’s path towards the 50-megaton test of October 1961 had begun with the country’s first nuclear detonation, which took place on August 29, 1949, involving an experimental device known as the RDS-1. This was followed by a first air-delivered bomb, the 30-kiloton RDS-3 Maria, dropped on October 18, 1951, by a specially adapted Tu-4 bomber, itself an unlicensed copy of the B-29 Superfortress. By 1953, the Soviets had developed nuclear bombs for larger-scale production and was able to field the 30-kiloton RDS-4T Tatyana that could be carried by a twin-engine Il-28 Beagle jet bomber. The same year, the Soviet Union detonated its first thermonuclear bomb, the RDS-6S Sloyka, in a ground test that took place on August 12. Ivan was the brainchild of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and was authorized in July 1961 at an especially frosty period in East-West relations that culminated in the Berlin Crisis and the city’s permanent partition by the Berlin Wall . With typical bombast, Khrushchev had demanded his engineers develop a thermonuclear weapon with an unprecedented yield of 100 megatons, requiring a three-stage warhead, rather than the usual two. It seems the team responsible had concerns about the radiation risk and decided to reduce the yield to 50 megatons — still equivalent to around 3,800 Hiroshima bombs. The documentary notes that the bomb casing itself was sized to carry a 100-megaton charge. The Ivan bomb descends under a huge parachute after being dropped over Novaya Zemlya. , ROSATOM By contrast, the largest nuclear device ever detonated by the United States was the one it set off during the Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific on March 1, 1954. Unlike the Soviet test, this yield was achieved by accident, after a miscalculation by the designers. Nevertheless, the yield produced — 15 megatons as opposed to the planned 5-6 megatons — still fell well short of the Ivan test. The Castle Bravo device was mounted in a “shot cab” on an artificial island, rather than being air-dropped, but it was later developed into the Mk 21 bomb that could be carried by a U.S. Air Force B-36 Peacemaker or B-47 Stratojet bomber. Meanwhile, Ivan’s detonation was destined to be a high watermark in atmospheric nuclear testing. Amid mounting concern about the fallout generated by above-ground tests, the Partial Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963 by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States . Thereafter, all tests were required to be conducted underground. One of the bomber crew wearing tinted goggles to protect against nuclear flash., ROSATOM The Ivan bomb was ultimately too large to be of practical military use — both in terms of delivery and finding targets that warranted its use. However, the Soviet Union remained heavily engaged in developing freefall nuclear bombs alongside missiles and other delivery systems. Nuclear weapons are still assigned considerable importance for today’s Russian armed forces and most Russian combat aircraft are capable of delivering nuclear bombs. While details of modern Russian freefall nuclear bombs remain highly classified, their equivalent practice bombs provide some indication of their appearance and are issued to tactical fixed-wing units for use in exercises. The release of this Cold War-era documentary is a sobering reminder of the lingering presence of these weapons and their awesome destructive power.

Commander Colin 'Farva' Price,"Updated on Jul 10, 2020",Navy F/A-18 Squadron Commander’s Take On AI Repeatedly Beating Real Pilot In Dogfight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The recent 5 to 0 victory of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) pilot developed by Heron Systems over an Air Force F-16 human pilot does not have me scrambling to send out applications for a new job . However, I was impressed by the AlphaDogfight trials and recognize its value in determining where the military can capitalize on AI applications. For most military aviators, it may be easy to scoff at the artificiality of the contest. I may have even mumbled, “Never would have happened to a Navy pilot…” Instead, I think it is important not to get wrapped too much around the axle about the rules of the contest and instead focus on a couple of details that really jumped out at me on the advantages an AI pilot would have over a human pilot. For the contest setup, the argument about the death of the dogfight, or that there is no need for within visual range engagements anymore is a tired one. There was a pretty popular movie in the ‘80s about that very argument, so I am not going to rehash it here. The fact is we still constantly train to dogfight in the Navy, or as it is more commonly referred to ‘Basic Fighter Maneuvers,’ or BFM for short. Editor’s note: To get up to speed, you can read all about the AlphaDogfight trials and their stunning outcome in this recent War Zone piece. You can also watch the final round where the AI faced-off against the USAF F-16 Weapons Instructor and hear some commentary about the high-profile trials from those that worked on it for DARPA in the official video below. BFM is great airborne training for gaining an understanding of your energy state in relation to the enemy and to exercise your situational awareness in a three-dimensional space in a physically demanding environment. An aviator has to understand how to aggressively maneuver their aircraft while at the same time integrating their weapon systems to cue a weapon, assess the quality of the weapons track, and determine if the trigger should be pulled to employ the weapon. All at the same time, they must be preventing the enemy from accomplishing the same process. It is a dynamic and stressful environment that creates better fighter pilots. I have yet to meet a pilot who is an above-average BFM pilot, but struggles in other mission sets. There are multiple reasons why aircrew may find themselves at the merge with the enemy. But if they do end up at the merge, the goal is always the same: take the first shot to kill the enemy before they can shoot them. This fact sometimes gets lost in training engagements. To maximize the training, the BFM fight will often be taken to a “logical conclusion.” Even though each aircraft may trade shots early in the fight, the two aircraft will keep fighting down to the hard deck till there is an obvious winner. Aircrew will come to the debrief patting themselves on the back for the gun footage they have of the other aircraft, but once the footage is played, they realize they absorbed the first shot well before their triumphant gun pipper placement. The real-world logical conclusion could have been very different if they were missing a wing or engine because of a missile impact. The goal at the merge of achieving the first shot must be continually hammered home. Still, the reality is that missiles do not always guide and fuze, thus we extend fights to teach aviators how to continue to survive or turn a defensive situation into an offensive one. The true sport of fighter jet aviators is a guns-only BFM engagement. A guns-only BFM engagement is a test of who can efficiently maximize their energy package and capitalize on each merge. Much like chess, truly great BFM pilots are thinking two to three merges ahead, not just reacting. https://youtube.com/watch?v=sHUx5YtMdcU It does not take much skill to put the aircraft’s lift-vector on the other aircraft and yank on the Gs. In fact, if in doubt, just doing that will take care of 75 percent of the fight. But BFM is about being smoothly aggressive . Understanding the difference between when it is necessary to max-perform the aircraft and when it is time to preserve or efficiently gain energy back is key. In a tight turning fight, gaining a couple of angles at each merge can suddenly result in one aircraft saddled in the other aircraft’s control zone working a comfortable rear quarter gun-tracking shot. In true gamesmanship fashion, the guns-only BFM engagement was the setting for the AlphaDogfight contest. So what jumped out at me about the engagements? Three main points. First was the aggressive use of accurate forward quarter gun employment. Second, was the AI’s efficient use of energy. Lastly was the AI’s ability to maintain high-performance turns. USN During BFM engagements, we use training rules to keep aircrew and aircraft safe. An example of this is using a hard deck, which is usually 5,000 feet above the ground. Aircraft can fight down to this pretend ground level and if an aircraft goes below the hard deck, they are considered a “rocks kill” and the fight is ended. The 5,000 feet of separation from the actual ground provides a safety margin during training. Another training rule is forward-quarter gunshots are prohibited. There is a high potential for a mid-air collision if aircraft are pointing at each other trying to employ their guns. Due to the lack of ability to train to forward-quarter gunshots, it is not in most aviators combat habit patterns approaching the merge to employ such a tactic. Even so, it would be a low probability shot. A pilot must simultaneously and continuously solve for plane-of-motion, range, and lead for a successful gun employment. It is difficult enough for a heart of the envelope rear-quarter tracking shot while also concentrating on controlling a low amount of closure and staying above the hard deck. At the high rates of closure normal for a neutral head-on merge, a gun envelope would be available for around three seconds. Three seconds of intense concentration to track, assess, and shoot, while at the same time avoiding hitting the other aircraft. The Heron Systems AI on several occasions was able to rapidly fine-tune a tracking solution and employ its simulated gun in this fashion. Additionally, AI would not waste any brain cells on self-preservation approaching the merge avoiding the other aircraft. It would just happen. The tracking, assessing, and employing process for a missile is not much different than the gun. I am pretty confident AI could shoot a valid missile shot faster than I can, given the same data I am currently presented within the cockpit. Super Hornet pilot in the cockpit about to launch off the deck. , SuUSN The second advantage of AI was its ability to maintain an efficient energy state and lift vector placement. BFM flights certainly instill aviators with confidence in flying their aircraft aggressively in all regimes of the flight envelope. However, in today’s prevalent fly-by-wire aircraft, there is less aircraft feel providing feedback to the pilot. It takes a consistent instrument scan to check the aircraft is at the correct G, airspeed, or angle-of-attack for the given situation. Even proficient aviators have to use a percentage of their concentration (i.e. situation awareness) on not over-performing or under-performing the aircraft. AI could easily track this task and would most likely never bleed airspeed or altitude excessively, preserving vital potential and kinetic energy while also fine-tuning lift vector placement on the other aircraft to continue the fight if required. Lastly is AI’s freedom from human physiological limitations. During the last engagement, both aircraft were in a prolonged two-circle fight at 9 Gs on the deck. A two-circle fight is also referred to as a ‘rate fight.’ The winner is the aircraft who can track its nose faster around the circle, which is directly proportional (disregarding other tools such as thrust vectoring ) to the amount of Gs being pulled. More Gs means a faster turn rate. 9 Gs is extremely taxing on the body, which the pilot in the contest did not have to deal with, either. A human pilot would have to squeeze every muscle in the legs and abdominals in addition to focused breathing in order to not blackout. During training, I maintained 9 Gs in the centrifuge for about 30 seconds. Then I went home and took a nap, and that was without being shot at. AI does not care about positive or negative Gs. It will perform the aircraft at the level required. F/A-18F manuevering hard. , USN The truth is current aircraft have to be built to support the ‘pile of human’ sitting in it. The human will always be the limiting factor in the performance of an aircraft. I fight the jet differently now than I did as a junior officer when I was young and flexible. I have to fight differently. I know what my capabilities are to get a consistent and repeatable shot with the little bit of neck magic I have left to keep sight of the other aircraft. The fact that in the contest, the AI had perfect information at all times, and rules of engagement were not a factor, are not inconsequential details. I recognize that providing the amount of data and sensor fusion the AI would require to perform at the same level in a real aerial engagement (one that does not take place in cyberspace) is not a small undertaking and still a bit in the future. The rules of engagement discussion could fill up the syllabus for the entire semester of an ethics class, and will always be a touchy subject with regards to AI’s involvement in war. I am not an engineer, nor an ethics professor. Yet, as a pilot, I am intrigued. A computer model was able to react to the movements of a human pilot and effectively employ weapons. During the five engagements, the AI had 15 valid gun employments and the human pilot had zero. These results also hint at the AI’s ability to avoid being shot while effectively employing its own weapons. Farve and his fellow Black Knights of VFA-154 flying and fighting in the age of COVID., Courtesy of Commander Price An AI-enhanced weapon’s employment system in my aircraft? I am not ready for Skynet to become self-aware, but I am certainly ready to invite AI into the cockpit. Hell, I am only a voting member as far as the flight controls are concerned in the Super Hornet anyways. If I put a control input in that is not aerodynamically sound (i.e. could result in a departure from controlled flight), the flight control system will not move the control surface or will move a different surface to give me the movement I am requesting. Who is flying who? So, if tomorrow my seven-year-old daughter decides she wants to become a Naval Aviator, I am not going to shoot down the notion and go on a rant about the last generation of fighter pilots. I know there will be a Navy jet for her to fly. My future grandchildren, however?

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 18, 2021",The Potentially Revolutionary Celera 500L Aircraft Officially Breaks Cover,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Otto Aviation’s Celera 500L has officially come out of the shadows and the company has now outlined its vision for the potentially revolutionary high-efficiency aircraft, including possible unmanned variants and military versions configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The War Zone was first to report on this unusual bullet-shaped plane after it was first spotted at the Southern California Logistics Airport near Victorville in 2017 and has been following its secretive development very closely ever since . The announcement, which appears to be the first official statement from Otto Aviation on the Celera 500L to date, has coincided with the launch of a new website promoting the aircraft. The press release did not provide specific details about the aircraft’s first flight or when it occurred, but says it has flown 31 times in total, so far. In June 2019, the plane, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N818WM, was observed conducting what appeared to be taxi tests on the ground at the Southern California Logistics Airport, indicating that it could take to the skies soon afterward. The website says that it hit an “aerodynamic efficiency proven” milestone in the fourth quarter of 2019. “Innovation at its core is solving a problem without conventional bias. Our goal was to create a private aircraft that would allow for direct flights between any city pair in the U.S. at speeds and cost comparable to commercial air travel,” William Otto Sr., the Chairman and Chief Scientist of Otto Aviation, said in a statement. “In many cases, individuals and families will be able to charter the Celera 500L at prices comparable to commercial airfares, but with the added convenience of private aviation. We believe when the price of private air travel is competitive with commercial air travel, an enormous market opportunity will result.” “We believe the Celera 500L is the biggest thing to happen to both the aviation and travel industries in 50 years,” he continued. “Beyond using our aircraft for passenger travel, it can also be used for cargo operations and military applications. Since the results from our prototype test flights have been so promising, we’re ready to bring the Celera 500L to market.” Otto Aviation Otto Aviation Otto Aviation Otto Aviation says the Celera 500L had a maximum cruising speed of at least 450 miles per hour and a range of over 4,500 miles. It also has impressive fuel economy, achieving 18 and 25 miles per gallon, according to Otto Aviation. A traditional business jet with similar capabilities to the Celera 500L, including its six-passenger capacity, typically burn a gallon of fuel for every two to three miles of flight, making Otto’s design dramatically more economical, as well as more environmentally friendly. The company says that the Celera 500L will have an unbelievably low per-hour flight cost of just $328. Otto Aviation This and aircraft’s other notable performance characteristics are made possible in large part due to its highly aerodynamic overall laminar flow shape, which produces approximately 59 percent less drag than existing similar-sized, more conventionally-shaped aircraft. Its high-efficiency Raikhlin Aircraft Engine Developments (RED) A03 V12 piston engine is another important part of the equation. The A03 has a multi-stage turbocharger and can run on Jet A1 fuel, as well as kerosene or biodiesel. Germany-based RED touts the engine as a very high-efficiency design with low fuel consumption and very good reliability over existing piston engine designs with equivalent horsepower ratings. “The Celera 500L’s aerodynamic airframe requires significantly less horsepower to achieve take-off and cruise speeds, allowing for a more fuel-efficient power plant [the A03] to be utilized,” Otto’s website says. One of seven different patents Otto holds that apply to the Celera 500L also describes the aircraft’s novel exhaust system with a heat exchanger to provide an additional boost in thrust. The aerodynamic shape also gives the plane excellent handling even if the engine fails, adding an additional margin of safety. You can read more about the plane’s design and features in more detail in these past War Zone pieces , The aircraft’s teardrop shape also provides a roomier main cabin compared to many similarly-sized business jets, as well as small turboprops. This will improve passenger comfort for long-duration flights. Otto notes that a range of 4,500 miles, together with a typical takeoff run of around 3,300 feet, means that the Celera 500L will be able to fly between virtually any airports in the United States without need to stop to refuel. Otto Aviation Though primarily aimed at civilian and commercial operators, Otto’s new website also highlights the potential for the Celera 500L to use its long-range and high fuel economy to support military missions, including transporting personnel and cargo, as well as conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. A version of the aircraft, possibly unmanned, equipped with any number of sensor suites could be an impressive persistent surveillance and communications relay platform able to orbit over particular areas for very long periods of time and cover a wide swath of the battlefield from its high perch. It could also be able to reposition itself quickly and transit to its tasking area at jet-like speeds. We highlighted the potential military and surveillance utility, especially in an unmanned format, that variants of the Celera 500L could provide in our past coverage, as well. Otto Aviation has already proposed further developments based on the Celera 500L design. These include a possible variant using hybrid or all-electric propulsion for even greater efficiency and fuel economy, the aforementioned unmanned version, and an enlarged Celera 1000L. An artist’s conception of an unmanned variant of the Celera 500L., Otto Aviation Concept art showing the size of a possible future expanded Celera 1000L design compared to the existing Celera 500L., Otto Aviation At present, the company is looking to enter a B Round next year, during which it will seek outside investment, find a more permanent home for its operations, work toward getting the plane FAA certified, and begin taking actual orders. Otto’s goal is to have achieved FAA certification by 2023 and then have a manufacturing facility delivering actual production Celera 500Ls to customers by 2025. All told, after years of reporting on the mysterious aircraft, we are certainly very excited to see Otto Aviation’s Celera finally break cover in an official capacity. The aircraft certainly represents an incredibly ambitious and disruptive set of capabilities that could significantly change the course of aviation and transportation overall. Getting such an exotic concept into a flying form is an incredible feat in itself for the Otto Aviation team, one that requires large resources and comes with considerable high-risk, to say the least. We look forward to seeing how high the Celera idea can fly from here. Contact the authors: Joe@thedrive.com and Tyler@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway Air Manned ISR Unmanned"
Brett Tingley,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The Mysterious Cold War Case Of Unidentified Aircraft Descending On Loring Air Force Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite the newfound attention the topic of unexplained incursions into airspace over sensitive locales across the United States is receiving, these types of bizarre incidents are not necessarily new. One of the most puzzling accounts of such an event, or series of events, occurred during the depths of the Cold War. Over a series of nights in 1975, Loring Air Force Base in Maine was invaded by mysterious craft originating from Canadian airspace. At the time, the base was home to B-52 bombers and KC-135 tankers and was tasked with the nuclear alert mission. The Loring AFB incidents are extremely well documented, both in terms of personal testimonials and declassified CIA and National Military Command Center (NMCC) documents. What also made the events so interesting was just how many people were involved or knew about the potential threat and the reaction to it. It was truly a community-scale ordeal that even made its way into the national press. Considering we are talking about a base that housed nuclear weapons and a delivery system for those weapons, the bombers and tankers they rely on, the concern regarding the strange incursions was extreme, to say the least. What is also interesting about the bizarre events at Loring Air Force Base in the fall of 1975 was what was going on elsewhere, as well. Based on additional official documentation and reports, similar occurrences were remarkably widespread during this time period, albeit few, if any, were as widely experienced or as public in nature. Unidentified ‘Helicopters’ Appear Over Loring Air Force Base It was October of 1975. At the time, Loring Air Force Base was a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base that housed two KC-135 tanker squadrons and a B-52 bomber squadron, which had the alert nuclear weapons delivery mission. It was SAC’s easternmost base in the continental United States, putting it in a unique position to quickly respond to a crisis. The strange affair began on the evening on October 27 when security personnel at the base observed what was described officially as “an unidentified helicopter” that appeared near the northern perimeter of the installation. The aircraft was said to be flying at a low altitude, estimated to be around 150 feet, and appeared to feature a red navigational light and a white strobe. The helicopter seemed to be particularly interested in the highly-secure nuclear weapons storage area at Loring. Army National Guard helicopters were dispatched in an attempt to contact and identify the aircraft, but those attempts proved unsuccessful. The base was immediately put on high alert. Loring AFB in 1970., Wikimedia Commons Shortly after the craft appeared, radar operators in the control tower at Loring observed another unknown aircraft circling between 10 and 13 miles northeast of the base. Once again, that aircraft could not be identified despite numerous attempts to make contact by radio on both civilian and military channels. The first unknown aircraft eventually turned north and flew into Canada near Grand Falls, New Brunswick, and the second unknown craft vanished from radar, possibly landing or descending below radar coverage. Loring’s nuclear weapons storage area, also known as Caribou Air Force Station. , Library of Congress The next night, on October 28, another unknown aircraft appeared over Loring, this time without lights. Once again, National Guard helicopters were sent to investigate, but were unable to establish visual confirmation of the aircraft. In an Operation Report (OPREP) issued after the incident, officials wrote that “It is our opinion that the unknown helicopter has demonstrated a clear intent in the weapons storage area, is smart and a most capable aviator.” The incidents continued through at least October 30th. NMCC via FOIA In response to the incursion, Loring increased its local security presence and coordinated with Canadian authorities to allow U.S. aircraft to pursue the offending aircraft into Canadian airspace should the unknown aircraft return. The New York Times reported on the incursions in the 1979 article “U.F.O. Files: The Untold Story,” adding that despite the fact the Joint Chiefs of Staff received multiple briefings on the incursions, “Subsequent investigations by the Air Force into the sightings at Loring Air Force Base, Maine, where the remarkable series of events began, did not reveal a cause for the sightings.” CIA via FOIA Eyewitness Accounts Complicate The Helicopter Narrative One account of the aerial intrusions at Loring comes from Arthur Beers, who served at the base from 1970 to 1976. In an account posted to LoringRemembers.com , a site dedicated to chronicling the experiences of the many men and women who served at Loring, Beers described his “ most memorable experience ” at Loring: Probably my favorite story was when I was in the Rated Supplement as a Security Police Shift Commander.  I was on duty one evening when the Nuclear Weapons Storage Area was buzzed by a unknown helicopter. Obviously we reported this up channel and I raced out to the storage area. When I arrived, I was told that the National Emergency Command Post was on the line for me. When I talked to the Colonel at the National Command Post and explained what had been reported by my team at the storage area, he gave me orders to shoot down the helicopter if it tried to buzz the area again. I immediately went out to the brief my SAT Teams on these orders but before I could complete that briefing I was called back to the entry point where I talked with a General Officer who said that the President had been briefed and that my new orders were to shoot only if the helicopter tried to land (ah, heck!). I went out and rebriefed my teams in just the nick of time as the unknown pilot in an unlighted Huey type helicopter came back again and then two more times during my shift. He came back three other nights and then just disappeared. To my knowledge the identity was never discovered. A interesting side note to this, once the information got up to NORAD that we had this unauthorized flying over the storage area, NORAD launched the F-106 that was on alert at Loring. Not exactly sure how that jet jockey was going to see or shoot at a helicopter, 50 feet off the ground in the Northern Maine woods at night running with no lights, but I guess NORAD had to do something. Never saw the F-106, did see the helicopter. Other personal testimony complicates the claims that the intruder was actually helicopter. Michael Wallace, a former KC-135 tanker pilot who was stationed at Loring in 1975, shared his own bizarre Loring incursion experience on YouTube: Wallace states that he was briefed on an incursion over the nuclear-armed B-52s and weapons storage facilities at Loring. Wallace and a few hundred other personnel were informed of a silent, luminous object hovering over the base which could move “very quickly” and “unconventionally” in “rapid, straight-line movements, with straight vertical movements, can turn without any apparent radius in the turn. It’s pretty incredible technology.” The object was openly referred to as a UFO by base personnel. Wallace goes on to claim that Loring personnel were briefed only to speak to SAC officers about the incursion, not to speak to the press, and that they were “going to tell the press that there was a Canadian helicopter crossing the border and harassing us.” He also notes that interceptors were going to be brought in to assist in the efforts to protect the base and investigate what was going on. Wallace was eventually sent on a refueling mission in his KC-135 to support F-4 Phantoms for unrelated training when his flight was notified by the base’s command post to switch radio frequencies. The lead KC-135 in the flight was instructed to depart the formation, turn off its lights, go radio silent, and proceed to Loring under its own discretion, something Wallace describes as a highly unusual order. Wallace remembers hearing “stressed voices” over the radio as the pilots and tower personnel attempted to track the object as it seemed to fly back and forth over the base at incredible speeds. As quickly as the transmissions began, they ended as tower personnel stated simply “We’ve lost it.” When Wallace later saw the pilot of the lead aircraft who was sent to intercept the object, he told Wallace “I can’t talk about it, and you wouldn’t believe me if I could talk about it.” A NORAD document states “Information indicates that the A/C [aircraft] is a helicopter. However, the A/C remains unidentified. Descriptions of the observed A/C lighting have varied somewhat but not in such a way that there is any indication there is more than one A/C involved.”, Nick Redfern via FOIA LoringRemembers.com contains numerous other references to the 1975 incursions, with many former Loring personnel calling the incident their most memorable experience . One former Field Maintenance Squadron member remembers “the activity on the flight-line was a frenzy ” the night of the incursion. John E. Morkavich, who served at Loring from 1972 to 1975, recounted the following to LoringRemembers.com: I was a Hospital Corpsman OR Tech 72-75 and one night in the fall of 73 (I will stand corrected if someone else recalls and has better time line [sic]) the base sirens went off and they said thats [sic] the big one thats [sic] gonna scramble the jets and bombers. About 6 of us got on the roof of the medical barracks and waited for whatever. The base went nuts, claxons, sirens, security police vehicles speeding around lots of flashing lights. Lots of flight line roaring of engines. Well about 3 weeeks [sic] later I was in the Officers Club with Dr John P Sheppard and a couple of pilots were sitting with us. We talked sports and politics then Doc Sheppard asked what the hell happened the other night. They replied with the ubiquitous “Do You Have a Need To Know?” Sheppard said hell yes, so I heard this explanation and both pilots were dead serious. There was a UFO that came up on radar out of nowhere and was hovering over East Loring near the weapons storage facility. Aircraft was scrambled to intercept, it was seen visually and tracked on radar. Then the Lt Colonel said. “This damn thing was there one second and gone the next, vanished….then radar analysis showed this bogey was so far away and at such a high altitude…..let me tell you this -“… there is NOTHING on THIS PLANET that can do the things this aircraft or damn UFO did….” Then they got up and walked away from the table. Sheppard and I were stunned and we did not talk about it again. This is no BS and I welcome those who were there and remember. LoringRemembers.com even contains a section called “ the official UFO story ” which states simply “In 1975, a ‘UFO’ buzzed the WSA over a few nights. Internet lore has stamped this as a true UFO conspiracy involving numerous other bases. The DOD released a declassified report on the incident.” A 1975 CIA memo noting the Loring AFB incursion., CIA via FOIA One of the most thorough investigations of the Loring incidents was conducted by Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett and included in their 1984 book Clear Intent: The Government Coverup of the UFO Experience . An excerpt from that book containing sections on Loring can be found online here . It goes into great detail as to what the narrative of events was, at least according to their research. We will pick it up on the second night, but we encourage you to read the whole excerpt. On October 28, 1975, at 7:45 P.M., Sgt. Clifton W. Blakeslee and Staff Sgt. William J. Long, both assigned to the 42nd Security Police Squadron, were on duty at the munitions storage area. Along with Sgt. Danny Lewis, both Sgts. Blakeslee and Long spotted what appeared to be the running lights of an aircraft approaching Loring Air Force Base from the north at 3,000 feet. The aircraft did not come closer to Loring than about three miles at this time, and it was observed intermittently for the next hour. On first spotting the craft, Sgt. Lewis called the Command Post and advised it that the unknown craft had returned to Loring. Lewis reported that he could see a white flashing light and an amber or orange light. Once again, the Commander, 42nd Bomb Wing responded. Rushing to the area of the storage dump, he observed the unknown craft. He reported seeing a flashing white light and an amber-colored light on the object also. The speed and movement in the air suggested that the craft was a helicopter. From 7:45 P.M. to 8:20 P.M., it was under constant observation, both visually by the personnel in the storage area and electronically by the control tower radar, which showed the craft at a position three miles north of the Loring perimeter. The unknown craft would appear and disappear from view, and, at one point, appeared over the end of the runway at an altitude of 150 feet. The object subsequently shut off its lights and reappeared over the weapons storage area, maintaining an altitude of 150 feet. At this time, Sgt. Steven Eichner, a crew chief on a B-52 bomber, was working out of a launch truck along with Sgt. R. Jones and other members of the crew. Jones spotted a red and orange object over the flight line. It seemed to be on the other side of the flight line from where the weapons storage area was located. To Eichner and Jones, the object looked like a stretched-out football. It hovered in midair as everyone in the crew stared in awe. As they watched, the object put out its lights and disappeared, but it soon reappeared again over the north end of the runway, moving in jerky motions. It stopped and hovered. Eichner and the rest of the crew jumped into the truck and started to drive toward the object. Proceeding down Oklahoma Avenue (which borders the runway), they turned left onto the road that led to the weapons storage area. As they made the turn, they spotted the object about 300 feet in front of them. It seemed to be about five feet in the air and hovered without movement or noise. Exhibiting a reddish-orange color, the object was about four car lengths long. Eichner described what he saw next: “The object looked like all the colors were blending together, as if you were looking at a desert scene. You see waves of heat rising off the desert floor. This is what I saw. There were these waves in front of the object and all the colors were blending together. The object was solid and we could not hear any noise coming from it.” They could not see any doors or windows on the object nor any propellers or engines which would keep the object in the air. Suddenly, the base came alive. Sirens began screaming. Eichner could see numerous blue lights on police vehicles coming down the flight line and runway toward the weapons storage area at high speed. Jones turned and said to the crew, “We better get out of here!” They immediately did. The Security Police did not try to stop them. Their interest was in the object over the storage dump, not in the truck which was in a restricted area. The crew drove the truck back to its original location and watched from there. The scene at the weapons storage area was chaotic, with blue lights rotating around, and the vehicles’ searchlight beams shining in all directions. The men in the crew decided not to report what they had seen, because they had entered a restricted area and could have been arrested for the violation. The object shut off its lights and disappeared, not to be seen again that night. The 42nd Police conducted a security sweep of the weapons storage area inside and out, with no results. Radar had once again briefly tracked the object heading for Grand Falls, New Brunswick, finally losing the unknown at Grand Falls itself. Priority messages were sent to the National Military Command Center in Washington, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Air Force Forward Operations Division at Fort Ritchie, Maryland, SAC Headquarters, and the 9th Air Force, 45th Division, advising them that an unknown object had penetrated the base and had been in the nuclear storage area. The writers interviewed Chief Warrant Officer Bernard Poulin of the Maine Army National Guard’s 112th Medical Company (Air Ambulance), who was tasked with tracking down and identifying the unknown aircraft in a UH-1 as the nightly occurrences wore on in late October. Poulin told Fawcett that despite numerous witnesses seeing and hearing the intruder, his helicopter crew could not get visual confirmation on the aircraft, but gives additional details of his experiencing of walking into the SAC base on high alert for a mysterious intruder: “Well, we were launched on the first search mission after ground personnel started to see or hear the, quote, if you will, “UFO” go by. So, we would launch, and I believe that we were in the air for around 40 minutes looking for this thing, with the idea that it was a rotary-type craft we were searching for. We were vectored in by ground personnel to different spots on the base where the ground personnel were seeing or hearing it. All this time we were being tracked by base radar [traffic control radar which is designed to pick up aircraft], and radar was not painting the object that was being reported. Ground personnel would call and say the object is at this location, but radar would not pick it up. Well, anyway, we hunted around, and we didn’t see anything. Again they would call and say they could hear it at a location, and we would go there, but could not see it. We would then shut down and wait for the next call. And that went on for a couple of nights. This, again, was early evening or early in the morning. I can recall on the second night of the mission radar picked up a return, but it turned out to be a KC-135 tanker returning from overseas.” Poulin was asked: “According to some of the documents, personnel on the ground were reporting that at times you would bring your craft within 100 feet of the intruder, yet you could not see it?” He answered: “Yes, well, we could go real low to where they said it was and would turn on our search light and sweep the area with the light, but we never saw the craft. After it was over, we discussed our mission. The powers to be were quite concerned about what was going on and if we were able to see anything. They maintained all along up there, you know, those are pretty sensitive places and they have to know what the hell was going on.” When they arrived at the base, the security lid was on so tightly that both pilots were permitted to call their wives only once to say that they were on a mission. In a meeting with Chapman, Poulin recalled the Commander saying, “We’ve got to keep the lid on the fact that someone has been able to penetrate in and around the bomb dump, and we don’t know what’s going on. We’ve got to find out what is going on and prevent it from happening again.” Greenwood and Fawcett continue: At Loring, additional manpower was armed and ready for deployment. The Security Police Battle Staff was to be manned at Central Security Control. An additional two-man mobile patrol was assigned to the weapons storage area during the hours of darkness, while a ten-man reserve force was standing by, ready for deployment. A two-man patrol would be positioned at key vantage points about one mile north of the base for added surveillance. An SAC/SP message informed northern tier bases of the situation and recommended a “Security Option Three” alert all along the U.S.-Canadian border. The message went to Pease AFB in New Hampshire, Plattsburgh AFB in New York, Wurtsmith AFB in Michigan, Kinchloe AFB in Michigan, Sawyer AFB in Michigan, Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, Minot AFB in North Dakota, Malmstrom AFB in Montana, Fairchild AFB in Washington, and Barksdale AFB in Iowa. The subject-identifying line of the message was “Defense Against Helicopter Assault,” and it read: The past two evenings at one of our northern tier bases, an unidentified helicopter has been observed hovering over and in the near vicinity of the weapons storage area. Attempts to identify this aircraft have so far met with negative results. In the interest of nuclear weapons security, the action addresses will assume Security Option 3 during hours of darkness until further notice. Actions also should be taken to re-establish liaison with local law enforcement agencies that could assist your base in the event of a similar incident. Bases should thoroughly review and insure [sic] all personnel are familiar with actions to take in association with the helicopter denial portion of your 207-xx plan. On October 30, the Maine National Guard helicopter was replaced by a USAF helicopter and crew from Plattsburgh Air Force Base. The following evening there were several reports of unknown objects suspected to be helicopters, at distances varying from directly over the base to 10 nautical miles northeast of the base. Some reports were confirmed on RAPCON radar with altitudes between 300 and 5,000 feet. Additional, sporadic reports of helicopters continued well into December, though many of these were subsequently identified as normal helicopter traffic. In these reports, however, a distinction was drawn between the October sightings and later reports: Robert Fauk, Deputy Chief Patrol Agent with the U.S. Border Patrol, said he felt that an alleged helicopter report of November 18 was not the “Midnight Skulker of Loring.” He added, “This craft was too slow and too small to be the craft they had problems with at Loring.” Strangely enough, the Lewiston Daily Sun newspaper in Maine reported two eyewitnesses encountering a curiously lit aircraft on the morning of October 27, 1975 near the town of Poland. Poland is in the southwest corner of Maine, while Loring was in the northeast, so the two events may be unrelated. Still, it’s curious that two eyewitnesses far from the Air Force Base would describe seeing such a similar aircraft on the same night that the Loring encounters began. Greenwood and Fawcett’s book also claims a rash of civilian sighting occurred around the same time throughout the area. Lewiston Daily Sun Similar Incursions Continued At Other Military Installations Eerily similar events occurred at other U.S. Air Force Bases in the months following the incident at Loring AFB, although there is no definitive evidence that any of them were linked. On October 30, just days after the Loring incursion, the now-decommissioned Wurtsmith AFB in eastern Michigan had its own encounter detailed in the missive below. NMCC via FOIA In November 1975, personnel at Malmstrom AFB in Montana, another Strategic Air Command site, encountered bright lights that seemed to be accompanied by jet engine noises. NORAD scrambled two interceptors in an attempt to locate and identify the aircraft, but was unsuccessful in their attempts to do so. NMCC via FOIA In January of 1976, Cannon AFB in eastern New Mexico reported two unidentified flying objects described as “25 yards in diameter, gold or silver in color with blue light on top, hole in the middle and red light on bottom.” NMCC via FOIA On January 31, 1976, security personnel at Eglin AFB in Florida spotted lights near one of their radar sites, and later issued a press release announcing the incident. NMCC via FOIA Later that year, on July 30, 1976, security patrols at Fort Richie in Maryland spotted “3 oblong objects with a reddish tint” near ammunition storage areas, although a National Military Command Center memo issued after the incident cites temperature inversions in the area as a possible cause for the unexplained sightings. NMCC via FOIA Reporters Ward Sinclair and Art Harris referenced several of these events in a 1979 article in The Washington Post , and wrote that “a Nov. 11, 1975, directive from the office of the secretary of the Air Force instructed public information staffers to avoid linking the scattered sightings unless specifically asked.” Numerous documents have been declassified via the Freedom of Information Act which shed light on the Department of Defense’s response to the mysterious incidents at Loring and at other bases, some of which are mentioned above. You can read these documents for yourself at the PDF link below. Loring And Other Base Incursion Incident Files From The Mid 1970s. An Unsolved Mystery The 1975 incident at Loring Air Force Base shows that even nearly 50 years ago, some of America’s most strategically sensitive sites were vulnerable to intrusion from mysterious craft. While some reports cite the objects as “helicopters,” multiple eyewitness accounts complicate this characterization by describing jet engine noises, incredible feats of speed and maneuverability, bizarre descriptions of physical craft, and a seeming inability for pilots to get visual confirmation of them. Whether the multi-day string of aerial intrusion incidents over Loring AFB was perpetrated by a wily helicopter pilot with still unknown motivations, some type of bizarre Cold War strategic gamesmanship, or something even more exotic, remains unclear. The reality is that any of those possibilities are fascinating in their own right. What is clear is that something extremely strange did happen over the span of at least four nights at Loring in the fall of 1975, incidents that had hundreds of witnesses, some of which have provided direct testimonial as to their experiences. Although personal observations can vary in accuracy greatly, the core aspects of these events are backed up by numerous official documents that reach up to the highest levels of the U.S. military’s command structure. According to other documents from the time period, Loring wasn’t alone in enduring bizarre visits by unidentified aircraft, although in terms of the scope and detail of such incidents, the Loring AFB case seems to have few parallels.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today, internal weapons carriage is essentially a must-have feature for any next-generation stealth fighter . Designers of the latest low observable aircraft face the significant challenge of cramming often-bulky weapons inside a densely-packed airframe. Back in the early days of the Cold War, the team from the Convair company faced a similar predicament, albeit for other reasons, and managed to do an extremely elegant job with the weapons bays of its F-102 Delta Dagger interceptor. In the days long before low observability, a whole generation of U.S. tactical jets also carried much — or even all — of their ordnance internally. The reasoning then was that any extraneous protrusions, missiles and rocket pods included, were to be done away with if possible, to minimize drag and ensure that the maximum speed and efficiency could be eked out of the airframe. First flown in prototype form on October 24, 1953, the F-102 was designed as a destroyer of long-range Soviet bombers and was intended to replace a previous generation of subsonic interceptors primarily armed with guns and unguided rockets then in service with the U.S. Air Force’s Air Defense Command . Convair optimized the Delta Dagger for speed and decided to equip it with radar and with weapons offering longer reach, all with the aim of taking down nuclear-armed Soviet bombers before they could reach their targets. Ensuring the F-102 achieved its intended straight-line performance was a struggle, hampered by the constraints of engine technology at the time, but above all by the limited understanding of aerodynamics in the supersonic realm. When drafted, the F-102 was planned to reach a top speed of Mach 1.88. But when flown in prototype YF-102 form, the fighter proved unwilling to push beyond Mach 0.98 in level flight. By 1954, the planned maximum speed had been revised to a more modest Mach 1.23 and, after a series of aerodynamic revisions, the delta-winged F-102 duly entered service as the U.S. Air Force’s first supersonic interceptor. A specially prepared YF-102A pre-production aircraft even recorded a speed of Mach 1.535 — the fastest of any Delta Dagger. An F-102A prepares to ripple-fire a salvo of three Falcon missiles., SAN DIEGO AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVE The internal weapons carriage was necessary to ensure the F-102 slipped through the air in supersonic pursuit of its bomber targets. Carrying its full load of weapons in its belly, the smooth lines of the Delta Dagger were interrupted only by the optional external drop tanks, each carrying either 215 or 192 gallons of additional fuel. However, carrying drop tanks limited the maximum speed to Mach 0.95. From the start, the F-102 was intended to carry six air-to-air missiles (AAMs), all from the Hughes Falcon family, which eventually included variants of the AIM-4 and AIM-26. The F-102 carried its six missiles on trapeze launchers, two of which were installed in tandem in each of three weapons bays: left, center, and right. “You almost had to be a contortionist to load the center rails,” recalled Bill McAuley , a weapons technician with the 142nd Fighter Wing, Oregon Air National Guard. When selected by the pilot, the appropriate launchers popped out of the bays and three missiles would be fired in a salvo. The timing of this was determined automatically by the radar fire-control system. From the outset, the F-102’s bays had been designed around the Falcon series of missiles. This first-generation weapon was eventually developed into a wide range of variants, and Delta Dagger pilots were ultimately provided with multiple options when engaging threats with missiles. An experimental version of the Falcon had been first tested in 1949 and the weapon initially entered service with the U.S. Air Force’s F-89H Scorpion interceptor. The weapon was available in semi-active radar-homing (SARH) and infrared-homing versions, a mix of missiles providing flexibility for engaging targets under different circumstances and when confronting various countermeasures. A 431st Fighter Interceptor Squadron F-102A with a single Falcon visible in the right-hand bay., USAF/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The first of the radar-homing models were known as GAR-1s, while their infrared counterparts were GAR-2s. The effective range parameters for the initial SARH versions were between 5,000 and 25,000 feet. Equivalent data for the GAR-2 is not immediately available, but it seems the weapon’s performance was considered generally disappointing and production came to an end after just 1,600 examples had been completed. The type designations were later changed to fit a new unified nomenclature system from 1962 onwards, with the base variants of the GAR-1 and 2 becoming the AIM-4 and AIM-4B, respectively. Two Oregon Air Guardsmen load an AIM-4 Falcon into the weapons bay of an F-102 at Portland Air Base, Oregon, circa 1968., 142nd FW The Falcon was improved throughout its service life, yielding the radar-guided GAR-1D, later known as the AIM-4A, with improved maneuverability and an increase in ceiling up to 60,000 feet, and the equivalent heat-seeking GAR-2A, or AIM-4C, which had a more sensitive infrared seeker. The AIM-4C was subsequently superseded by the improved AIM-4D, issued from 1963, and which could now be launched from a minimum range of 1,000 feet. This became the definitive infrared-guided Falcon for the F-102, and also featured a further improved seeker head that could lock onto targets at greater ranges. The AIM-4A through D variants of the Falcons were all armed with a nearly 8-pound warhead that included just 2.7 pounds of explosive since a missile traveling at a speed of Mach 2-3 was judged to be adequate to bring down a bomber-size target. However, these early Falcons did require a direct hit, since they were not equipped with a proximity fuze . An F-102 driver poses with his jet and a full load of Falcon missiles., SAN DIEGO AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVE As well as unguided rockets and conventionally armed AAMs, the United States developed harder-hitting bomber-killer weapons during the Cold War too. Such weapons were intended to take out larger or high-priority targets, namely entire formations of bombers. Best known of these is the nuclear-armed AIR-2 Genie unguided air-to-air rocket. While the Genie was never issued to the F-102 force, the Delta Dagger did still receive an AAM with an atomic warhead. This was the GAR-11, later redesignated the AIM-26A, or “Nuclear Falcon,” introduced in late 1961. Equipped with radar guidance, the new weapon had a top speed of Mach 2 and carried a W54 warhead with a yield of 0.5 kilotons. It also featured a proximity fuze to increase the probability of a kill. This was the only guided nuclear-armed AAM ever deployed by the U.S. Air Force and remained in the inventory until 1972. The nuclear-armed AIM-26A missile., SAN DIEGO AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVE As well as the nuclear-tipped AIM-26A, a conventionally armed AIM-26B was also available to F-102 units. Again boasting a proximity fuze, this missile had a much larger (48.5-pound) warhead than the original non-nuclear Falcons and around half the Delta Dagger fleet was converted to carry this potent weapon. The new AIM-26 series weapons were longer and considerably bulkier than the previous Falcons and required modifications to the trapeze launchers in the center bay, which was the only bay adapted to carry them. In this way, the F-102 could carry two of these missiles in the center, a pair of earlier Falcons in each of the two outboard bays, plus a reduced load of 12 unguided rockets. Since early AAMs were less than reliable and had a fairly large minimum engagement envelope, the Delta Dagger’s complement of guided missiles was bolstered by a load of folding-fin aerial rockets, or FFARs, cleverly installed in tubes integrated within the weapons bay doors. The rockets were a useful backup in case the main missiles malfunctioned or were spoofed by countermeasures. They also increased the magazine depth of the F-102, allowing it to take out as many bombers as possible if World War III were to have come. A preserved F-102 with the weapons bays doors open and the Falcon missiles extended on their trapezes. Note also the blue-tipped rockets visible in the weapons bay door., RYAN FROST/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The rockets could also be used at lower altitudes where the early AAMs were least effective. For example, it required around 16 seconds between locking on to a target and launching a radar-guided Falcon. That might be acceptable for downing a lumbering bomber at high altitude, but was unlikely to yield success in a lower-level dynamic engagement. The infrared-guided Falcon, meanwhile, performed best when engaging a target flying above the F-102, which reduced the chances of its seeker being confused by ground clutter. Technicians working in the left weapons bay of an F-102. Six sets of blast tubes were installed in the doors to vent the flame and gasses from the rocket motors., SAN DIEGO AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVE At first, the rocket armament comprised 36 T-214-2 2-inch FFARs, but these gave way to 24 2.75-inch Mighty Mouse FFARs by mid-1956, being introduced on the 190th production aircraft and then being retrofitted on earlier jets. Weighing 18.5 pounds, each Mighty Mouse carried a 6-pound high-explosive warhead. In this revised form, the F-102’s rocket tubes were arranged as three in each of the four innermost weapons bay doors, each tube carrying a pair of four-foot-long FFARs. The effective range of the Mighty Mouse was around 2 miles. Preserved at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, this F-102A retains the original 24-rocket installation., USAF/Ken LaRock The procedure for launching the FFARs was even more visually impressive than the one for employing missiles. In an era of stealth, it’s a prerequisite that an aircraft’s weapons bay doors are open for the shortest possible period, enabling stores release before detection by enemy radar. That wasn’t a consideration for the Delta Dagger, but the doors were still able to open, unleash all 24 rockets, and then snap closed again within around two seconds. The weapons bay doors themselves were electrically actuated and operated by a complex system of compressed air maintained at a pressure of 1,500 pounds per square inch. Depending on the target, the pilot could choose to fire the rockets in salvos of six, 12, or 24. If rockets were selected, the missile trapezes would not be lowered into the slipstream. For all the ingenuity of the F-102’s combined missile-and-rocket-toting weapons bay, FFARs as anti-aircraft weapons were, by the late 1950s, clearly from another era. Beginning in 1957, the rocket tubes were removed from the inner doors of the left and right bays, and from the two doors of the center bay, reducing the load to just 12 of the Mighty Mouse projectiles. This remained the standard ‘fit’ until the Delta Dagger was finally retired in 1976, making it the last USAF air defense fighter to carry FFARs in the air-to-air role. An F-102A from the 509th Fighter Interceptor Squadron armed with AIM-4A and AIM-4D Falcon missiles at Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam, in 1968., USAF In the end, while the design of the F-102’s weapons installation was admirable, the fighter was only as good as its weapons. According to Peter E Davies’ masterful account of the aircraft, F-102 Delta Dagger Units , pilots were broadly skeptical about the effectiveness of the FFARs, which were prone to fanning out or sometimes colliding. On the other hand, the Falcons were first-generation AAMs with all the limitations that entailed. In particular, they lacked agility and required considerable time to prepare for action. Even the “fire and forget” infrared-guided AIM-4D needed two minutes to cool the seeker before launch. Once committed to combat in Vietnam , the Falcon proved less effective than the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder , although in that war it was called upon primarily to tackle low-flying, agile targets, which were quite different from the bombers that it had been designed to shoot down. While the Delta Dagger’s weapons bays were a notably compact solution to providing a Cold War interceptor with a range of weapons options while retaining a low-drag profile, this complex arrangement was not immune to failure, which was sometimes quite dramatic. The third production F-102A unleashes a full salvo of 24 unguided rockets., SAN DIEGO AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVE Davies recounts one such incident in a hangar at Thule Air Base, Greenland , in which an electrical fault in an F-102’s weapons bay resulted in an unplanned Falcon launch while the pilot was checking his jet’s fuel pumps. Despite the remaining load of Falcons and FFARs cooking off, there were no injuries to personnel, although both the F-102 and the hangar were wrecked. Sometimes human error played a part too. Davies recounts the accidental shootdown of a T-33 training jet during a missile evaluation test involving what was supposed to be an inert Falcon in 1958. On this occasion, the F-102 ripple-fired three live Falcons, taking off a portion of the trainer’s tail. The T-33’s two crew ejected safely at 43,000 feet. Ultimately, the demise of the “Century Series” aircraft spelled the end of internal weapons bays on U.S. fighter jets, at least for a time. The last of the F-106 Delta Darts — a much-improved development of the F-102 — bowed out of frontline service in 1988. Internal weapons bays were destined to come back into vogue before long, with the emergence of a new generation of stealthy fighters, starting with the F-22 Raptor , which would take to the air in prototype form just two years after the F-106’s retirement. The F-22’s bays also use trapeze launchers — modern-day versions of those used in the F-102. While we are unlikely to see a Delta Dagger-style combined rocket/missile weapons bay on a jet anytime soon — well, there is the possibility of such an arrangement with laser-guided rockets — work continues to expand stealthy fighters’ internal air-to-air payload options. These include the development of smaller hit-to-kill missiles , Lockheed Martin’s Sidekick to boost the F-35 ’s missile load, and the AIM-260 Joint Air Tactical Missile (JATM). The latter will be the U.S. Air Force’s first known air-to-air missile to be tailored from the outset for internal carriage since the Cold War.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 12, 2022",Drug Cartel Now Assassinates Its Enemies With Bomb-Toting Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mexico’s drug cartels are notoriously well armed and equipped, with some possessing very heavy weaponry, including armored gun trucks sporting heavy machine guns. Now at least one of these groups appears to be increasingly making use of small quadcopter-type drones carrying small explosive devices to attack its enemies. This is just the latest example of a trend that has been growing worldwide in recent years, including among non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals , which underscores the potential threats commercially-available unmanned systems pose on and off the battlefield. A civilian self-defense militia in the city of Tepalcatepec, in Mexico’s southwestern Michoacan state, reportedly recovered two dozen explosive-laden quadcopters from a car that a team of sicarios – cartel hitmen – had apparently abandoned, possibly after a failed or aborted hit, on July 25, 2020. The bombs attached to the drones consisted of Tupperware-like containers filled with C4 charges and ball bearings to act as shrapnel. One of the armed drones reportedly recovered in Tepalcatepec., video capture via Mexico News Daily The vehicle and its contents were said to be tied to the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), or Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has its main hub in neighboring Jalisco state, but exerts control over a wider swatch of territory. This includes areas much further down Mexico’s southwestern Pacific coastline and along the Gulf of Mexico on the opposite side of the country. CJNG first emerged in 2009 as an offshoot of the Milenio Cartel and has since waged a particularly violent campaign against many of Mexico’s other drug cartels, as well as Mexican authorities and civilian self-defense organizations, growing in size and scope in the process. As of July, American authorities estimated that CJNG was responsible for the movement of approximately one-third of all drugs from Mexico into the United States. It has also been working to expand its operations into Europe and Asia. A map of cartel areas of control as of 2015, with the CJNG in yellow., DEA That revenue has clearly translated into new weapons, vehicles, and equipment for the CJNG’s sicarios and other footsoldiers. In July, the cartel released a particularly striking video of a convoy of camouflage-painted trucks, pickups, and SUVs, some with mounted weapons and very visible add-on armor, together with heavily armed personnel in tactical gear, that all looked more like a military unit than a criminal gang. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OyVGiJacQqI These personnel, who all shouted of the nickname of their top boss, Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, throughout the footage, reportedly belong to a “special forces” contingent within the cartel’s overall force structure. This video followed a failed CJNG assassination attempt against Mexico City’s police chief Omar Garcia Harfuch in June. Harfuch was wounded in the shootout and two of his bodyguard’s died. CJNG’s growing resources have also translated into its new aerial capabilities. There were reports in April that CJNG had been dropping improvised explosive devices from small, conventional manned aircraft in attacks on members of the Tepalcatepec self-defense militia. The cartel apparently dropped this tactic quickly after Mexican authorities stepped up aerial surveillance in the region and has since shifted to using the diminutive drones. Quadcopters with explosives believed to belong CJNG were recovered in the city of Puebla, in the state of the same name, southeast of Mexico City, in April, as well. Mexican officials said they believed those had been destined for attacks on the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel in Guanajuato state to the northwest. The discovery of those drones led to raids that found more quadcopters, as well as various electronics and bomb-making supplies, including more C4. One of the armed drones recovered during a raid earlier in the year., Mexican Federal Police It’s not surprising at all that CJNG, especially, has turned to small unmanned systems as a means of carrying out its various violent campaigns throughout Mexico. Mexican cartels, among other criminal groups, have already been using them to carry drugs over walls and past other barriers, as well as conduct surveillance . There have been more sporadic reports of other cartels using small explosive-armed drones since at least 2017, too. The barrier to entry when it comes to crafting small bomb-carrying quad and hexcopter-type drones is notably low, in general. This is something The War Zone has highlighted on multiple occasions in the past , which makes the concept particularly attractive to non-state actors. In 2018, a group opposed to dictatorial Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro attempted to assassinate him at a public rally using a commercially available multi-rotor drone system. This came years after ISIS terrorists had very much brought the concept to an actual battlefield in Iraq. Small drones of various kinds of improvised munitions had steadily proliferated among terrorists and other armed groups in Iraq and Syria since then. Russia’s Syrian outpost at Khmeimim Air Base has been subjected to a regular stream of drone attacks since 2018. In July, authorities in the Iraqi capital Baghdad recovered a quadcopter drone with a very purpose-built-looking looking bomb underneath in a neighboring near the heavily fortified Green Zone area that is home to various government buildings and Embassies, including that of the United States. Iranian-backed militias often use these adjacent areas to stage rocket attacks on the U.S. Embassy compound . These are just a small number of the readily available examples of this tactic being employed. In fact, when it comes to the danger of drones being used for gangland assassinations, Japanese authorities warned back in 2015 about Yakuza families doing exactly what CJNG is doing right now in Mexico. Even larger nation-state militaries are starting to leverage the relative simplicity of hobby-like quadcopter drones as a starting place for more complex weaponized systems, including designs capable of operating cooperatively in autonomous swarms. Turkey is now putting such a drone system into production, which you read all about here . This reality has left the United States, among others, scrambling to catch up when it comes to developing countermeasures. The U.S. military, as a whole, has been investigating a wide array of different counter-drone technologies to handle these lower-tier threats, ranging from jammers to directed-energy weapons, including both lasers and high-power microwave beams . “I argue all the time with my Air Force friends that the future of flight is vertical and it’s unmanned,” U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said at a public event in June . “I’m not talking about large unmanned platforms, which are the size of a conventional fighter jet that we can see and deal with, as we would any other platform. I’m talking about the one you can go out and buy at Costco right now in the United States for a thousand dollars, four quad, rotorcraft, or something like that that can be launched and flown,” he added. “And with very simple modifications, it can make made into something that can drop a weapon like a hand grenade or something else.” CJNG’s recent activities only underscore that there is a serious need for countermeasures off the battlefield to safeguard VIPs, critical infrastructure , and more from spying and potentially dangerous harassment , as well as deliberate lethal attacks. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified the need for some kind of mobile counter-drone capability as an “ emerging requirement ” just this week. If this cartel successfully adds small armed drones to its already significant arsenal, and shows that they can be useful on a more regular basis, it could easily lead to an explosion of other criminal groups in the country, and elsewhere, adopting this tactic, as well.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2021",Historic Indian Carrier Set To Be Scrapped After 58 Years Of Service With Two Navies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indian Navy aircraft carrier INS Viraat , a warship with a unique history spanning 58 years, has made its final journey. The 24,300-ton displacement vessel recently arrived at Alang in India’s western state of Gujarat — the world’s biggest “ship graveyard” — where it will now be broken up. Shipping firm the Shree Ram Group bought Viraat via MSTC Limited, an Indian state-owned corporation, in July 2020 for approximately $5 million. Shree Ram began the process of moving the ship to Alang earlier this month. The Indian Navy had formally decommissioned the carrier back in March 2017. The scrapping of the carrier will bring a complete end to the ship, which began life on the other side of the world, while World War II was still raging. Originally named HMS Elephant , the warship was laid down at Barrow-in-Furness in northwest England. The vessel was one of the four examples of the conventionally powered Centaur class of carriers to ultimately be completed. With the end of World War II in 1945, work on the carrier was suspended. Construction resumed in 1952, by which time the ship had been renamed HMS Hermes . Since very little work had been undertaken on the hull, the Royal Navy was able to reconfigure the carrier to reflect the advances that had been made in related technology by the early 1950s. These included a flight deck angled at 6.5 degrees, steam catapults , a deck-edge aircraft lift, and a Type 984 3D radar system. Launched in February 1953, Hermes was commissioned into Royal Navy service in November 1959. In the mid-1960s, the carrier’s air defenses were enhanced with the addition of two quadruple launchers for radio-command-guided Seacat missiles , which replaced the original anti-aircraft armament of five twin 40-millimeter-calibre Bofors guns. For a while, in 1966, it looked like the end of the line for Hermes when the carrier was judged surplus to operational requirements. However, a plan to sell the warship to the Royal Australian Navy fell through. Still with the Royal Navy, by 1971, Hermes was considered too small to operate as a strike carrier, with its fixed-wing air group being limited to the Blackburn Buccaneer , de Havilland Sea Vixen , and Fairey Gannet , and not the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom . At the same time, the Royal Navy was slashing its carrier force and would eventually only operate a single full-size flattop, HMS Ark Royal . As a result, the role of Hermes was switched to a commando assault carrier — equivalent to a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship. By 1972, the ship’s original Type 984 “dustbin” radar had been replaced by a Type 965 “bedstead” system and a new deck-lighting system added that was optimized for rotary-wing operations. The catapult and arrester wires were removed. In its new guise, Hermes was able to accommodate a complete Royal Marine Commando unit, including a squadron of Westland Wessex assault helicopters, later superseded by Westland Sea Kings . In July 1974, Sea Kings from Hermes took part in the evacuation from Cyprus after the Turkish invasion of the northern part of the island. HMS Hermes steams at full power in the early 1960s, with Supermarine Scimitar and de Havilland Sea Vixen jet fighters arranged on deck., CROWN COPYRIGHT Another new role beckoned in the mid-1970s when British maritime priorities switched to anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The refit of Hermes into an ASW carrier was completed in 1977, with a new-look air group typically comprising nine ASW Sea Kings and four Wessex HU5 utility helicopters. The warship retained a limited commando role, too. The carrier then experienced another change in fortunes, as the emergence of the British Aerospace Sea Harrier short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) strike fighter meant that Hermes was considered suitable for a return to fixed-wing operations. Another major conversion began in 1980 with the installation of a “ski jump” take-off ramp over the bow, angled upwards at 12 degrees. The flight deck was also hardened to cope with the rigors of Sea Harrier operations. A typical air group now comprised five Sea Harrier FRS1s and nine Sea Kings. At the outbreak of the Falklands War in 1982, the Royal Navy’s new Invincible -class STOVL carriers were still in the process of introduction, but Hermes was set to be decommissioned the same year. Instead, Hermes’ superior communications fit, as well as its greater aircraft-carrying capacity, led to it being assigned as the flagship for the campaign in the South Atlantic. Hermes , therefore, headed up the task force assembled to retake the Falklands from Argentina and initially embarked 12 Sea Harriers, nine Sea King HAS5s , and nine Sea King HC4s . As the fighting continued, this was adapted to include 15 Sea Harriers, six Royal Air Force Harrier GR3s , five ASW Sea Kings, plus a pair of Westland Lynx equipped to decoy Exocet anti-ship missiles . RAF Harrier GR3s parked alongside Royal Navy Sea Harriers and a Sea King helicopter on the flight deck of HMS Hermes on May 19, 1982, during the Falklands campaign in the South Atlantic., CROWN COPYRIGHT On May 1, 1982, Sea Harriers flying from the deck of Hermes took part in the attacks on Port Stanley, in the Falklands, where Argentine forces had captured the airfield, and Harriers from the carrier also struck the grass airstrip at Goose Green. Meanwhile, the carrier’s Sea Kings played an equally important wartime role, including ferrying Special Air Service (SAS) troops to and from the islands under cover of darkness, with the helicopter crews using experimental night-vision goggles. The Falklands campaign was an undoubted success for Hermes, but after its return to the United Kingdom, it was decided that the carrier would in the future be used as a training ship, remaining in harbor. In addition to becoming increasingly difficult to maintain due to its age, Hermes required greater manpower than the newer Invincibles and had not been converted to use more efficient modern fuel types. After the training ship proposal was abandoned, the carrier continued to serve with Sea Harriers and Sea Kings on board until decommissioned in April 1984. At this point, India came forward as a customer for Hermes , the Indian Navy having declared its first Sea Harrier squadron operational in 1984. That service needed a replacement for the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant , which the country had purchased from the United Kingdom in 1957 and that initially lacked a “ski jump” ramp. Two years later India acquired Hermes , which was renamed INS Viraat , meaning Giant, and which was commissioned into service in May 1987. Embarking Sea Harriers, Sea Kings, plus Chetak plane-guard helicopters, Viraat served as the Indian Navy flagship prior to the introduction of INS Vikramaditya , which had previously served in the Russian Navy as Admiral Gorshkov , in 2013.

The government in Maharashtra even proposed turning the warship into a “ tourist hub ” including a five-star hotel, aquarium, and aqua sports facilities. Ultimately, however, preservation of the Viraat was rejected by the Indian Ministry of Defense who considered it economically unfeasible. On September 28, 2020, the aircraft carrier arrived at its final destination at the shipbreaking yard in Gujarat. The breaker’s torch is a sad end for a warship with an unparalleled history.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Modern single-seat fighter jets with advanced avionics are extremely capable. However, many argue that the two crew members that fly in the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle give this platform significantly more capability during highly complex missions, and especially those with complicated rules of engagement, in a highly complex battlespace, and where additional situational awareness may be critical to a mission’s success, in general. As such the F-15E community is in high demand, with the type being regularly dispatched to global hotspots to tackle such high-end , multi-role combat missions in both air-to-air and air-to-ground regimes. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel “Voodoo” Culver is an F-15E pilot with the 494th Fighter Squadron, known as the “Mighty Black Panthers,” based at Royal Air Force Lakenheath in the United Kingdom. The resident 48th Fighter Wing features two squadrons of F-15Es, an F-15C unit, and will start receiving F-35As as it reactivates the 495th Fighter squadron next year. In fact, the 48th recently announced a competition to name its latest unit . In this detailed video, conducts a pre-flight walk around check and explains the key attributes of the Strike Eagle, plus the benefits of the two-person cockpit , featuring a pilot and Weapon Systems Officer (WSO), also known as a “whizzo.” Being at the very tip of the USAF spear as a forward-deployed overseas unit, the Strike Eagles of the 48th are regularly on the road, often taking part in a range of training exercises and combat deployments. The F-15E has received a range of upgrades in recent years, including the new Raytheon AN/APG-82 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which means its multi-role mission is enhanced even further. They also have the ability to employ some niche capabilities, such as the AN/ASQ-236 “Dragon’s Eye” radar pod, as detailed in this previous War Zone feature . The type is also set to field a new self-protection capability in the form of the Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS). The range of enhancements means the Strike Eagle will continue to reign supreme in the European theater, so let’s hand it over to Lieutenant Colonel Culver, as he talks about the F-15E, known by many of its aviators as “The Mighty Mighty.” Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Jamie Hunter Contributor Around The Globe Europe News & Features United Kingdom"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 23, 2021",The Forgotten Fireball Made The First Jet-Powered Carrier Landing By Accident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly 75 years ago, a U.S. Navy pilot was the first to land a jet-powered aircraft on an aircraft carrier, but it wasn’t supposed to happen. The name of the pilot who made that milestone landing, Ensign J. C. “Jake” West, is now little known, as is the aircraft that he was flying, the curious Ryan FR-1 Fireball naval fighter, which had jet and piston engines. The Fireball was a true oddity with its radial piston engine in the familiar position in the nose, plus a turbojet engine buried in the rear fuselage. The unusual specification was a result of the limitations of early turbine technology. While the turbojet was trusted for a high-speed “boost,” it was not mature enough, and consumed too much fuel, for sustained cruise flight. Critical carrier landings also required the “insurance” of a trusty piston engine. The first jet engines were not considered responsive enough for a “bolter” — when an aircraft aborts an attempted deck landing after missing the wire, accelerates at full throttle, and takes off again for another attempt. Ensign West found out the importance of that two-engine insurance policy on November 6, 1945. At the time, he was assigned to the U.S. Navy’s Fighter Squadron 41 (VF-41), the “Firebirds,” which had only begun flying the Fireball the previous month. The squadron’s first task was to conduct carrier trials with the new aircraft aboard the escort carrier USS Wake Island (CVE 65). These carrier qualifications began one day before West’s impromptu jet-powered landing. On November 6, West was in the landing pattern headed toward the carrier when his Fireball suffered an engine failure. It wasn’t the General Electric J31 turbojet that he lost — the jet had already been shut down, which was the standard procedure for landing — but the Wright R-1820-72W Cyclone piston engine in the fighter’s nose. An FR-1 Fireball from Fighter Squadron 66 (VF-66), the first operational unit., SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES As the propeller began to windmill in front of him, creating drag, West feathered it to stop it from turning. West now had to make a rapid decision between ditching the FR-1 in the water, bailing out (there was no ejection seat), or attempting to start the jet engine. He chose the last of these options and began the procedure of starting the J31, which required up to around 30 seconds. The jet engine roared into life and as West climbed, he declared an emergency and carefully managed the throttle to ensure he had sufficient power to get back safely onto the boat. As he ensured he was lined up on the correct approach path, the crew on the deck below set up the barrier net for emergency recovery. The arrester hook caught the last wire before the aircraft ended up in the barrier. West had managed to recover aboard USS Wake Island on jet power alone. An FR-1 moments before catching the wire., SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES The fact that the FR-1 was a mixed-power aircraft — at least, it was supposed to be — means that West’s debut jet-powered carrier landing is often forgotten. Added to this, only a month after West’s landing, Lieutenant Commander Eric “Winkle’ Brown successfully put a pure-jet de Havilland Vampire fighter onto the deck of the U.K. Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Ocean — and this time, it was planned. Other accounts of West’s landing, including this one by naval historian Norman Polmar, suggest that the Wright Cyclone was still producing at least some power during the landing, although that wouldn’t be possible with the prop feathered. In his excellent blog , naval aviation historian Matt Willis is also skeptical about whether West recovered aboard the carrier using only turbine power. He points to claims in a book about the Vampire that again reference Norman Polmar, of “residual power in the piston engine.” The same book argues that the Fireball would have struggled to recover “with a dead engine, windmilling propeller, undercarriage, and flaps down” on jet power alone. Willis points to the 30-second starting procedure for the J31 as being insufficient for the aircraft to remain airborne after the piston engine had cut out. However, other sources explicitly state that West feathered his prop, which would have left no option but to rely on the jet to get back to the carrier. Whatever the truth, West’s landing was a significant achievement, reflecting the naval aviator’s cool-headed decision-making and flying skills. Wings folded, a Fireball sits on the wooden deck of an escort carrier. , SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES Much of the rest of the history of the FR-1 Fireball has faded into obscurity, as well. Development of the aircraft began early on in World War II when the U.S. Navy began to identify the potential of the emerging turbojet technology. With the above-mentioned drawbacks of these early turbines in mind, in late 1942 the Navy settled upon a mixed-power carrier-capable fighter before accepting the proposal from Ryan Aeronautical. It was the first time the San Diego, California-based company had built a combat aircraft for the Navy. In February 1943, Ryan received a contract for three prototype single-seat XFR-1 aircraft and by the end of the same year, orders had been placed for 100 FR-1 production aircraft, too. A first flight was achieved by the initial XFR-1 on June 25, 1944, but without the jet engine installed at that stage. Full mixed-power flying commenced the following month. The primitive J31 — which was known in-house by General Electric as the I-16 — was the first turbojet engine to see quantity production in the United States. Its origins lay in the General Electric I-A, the first working jet engine in the United States, and which had been developed in turn from the Power Jets W.2B, plans for which had been provided by the United Kingdom. The W.2B was an outgrowth of the Frank Whittle -designed W.1, the first British jet engine to ever power a flying aircraft — the experimental Gloster E.28/39 that made its maiden flight in May 1941. A flight of Fireballs “intercepts” a Douglas C-54 transport. Note the feathered props on the fighters. , SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES Such were the demands of the war in the Pacific that the Navy eventually ordered another 600 examples. All these were canceled, however, after the end of the war in August 1945, by which time just 66 FR-1s had come out of the factory. At a time of rapid aeronautical development, the Fireball included several “firsts” for the Navy. It was the service’s first single-engine carrier aircraft with tricycle landing gear, the first to have an entirely flush riveted exterior, and the first carrier aircraft with a low-drag laminar-flow airfoil. An impressive formation start-up by a line-up of Fireballs assigned to VF-66., SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES As the Navy’s first operational mixed-power carrier aircraft, the FR-1’s powerplant was intended to be fairly straightforward for the pilot to operate. The piston and jet engines used the same fuel and the engine controls allowed the pilot to switch back and forth between piston and jet, using two throttles located side-by-side on the same console. One drawback of having two distinct powerplants was the fact that the air intakes for the jet were in the wing leading edges, reducing the fixed armament to just four Browning 50-caliber machine guns in the center panels of the wings. All three XFR-1 prototypes were eventually lost in a variety of accidents during tests, but overall the Fireball was judged suitable for frontline service. Moreover, the threat of Japan’s rocket-powered MXY-7 Ohka kamikaze piloted missiles saw FR-1 trials ramped up and the first aircraft were issued to VF-66, the “Firebirds,” in March 1945 for potential service in the Pacific theater. An overhead view reveals the FR-1’s wide fuselage to accommodate the jet engine, plus the wing leading-edge intakes., SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES The commanding officer of VF-66, Lieutenant Junior Grade (LTJG) “Willie” Schmall’s experiences of flying the FR-1 are presented in Steve Ginter’s book Ryan FR-1 Fireball and XF2R-1 Darkshark , in which Schmall recalls the Fireball as “a fantastic little airplane. It was smaller and faster than an F6F [Hellcat], and it would maneuver just as quick as a wink. You could slap that stick into the corner of the cockpit and the Ryan would snap right now.” Schmall added: “It could outturn an F6F by far, and it had extremely beautiful visibility compared to other Navy aircraft.” While a succession of operational units did operate the Fireball, their combat-ready status was strictly limited and they were primarily engaged in qualifying pilots on carriers and further developing procedures for operating first-generation jets. Fireballs from VF-66 began carrier suitability trials in May 1945, when three examples landed aboard the USS Ranger (CV 4). However, two were damaged on landing (one had a nose wheel collapse, the other hit the crash barrier), bringing the tests to an early end. A technician signals the thumbs-up from the cockpit of a Fireball., SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES When the war in the Pacific came to an end on August 15, 1945, VF-66 had begun working up, but none of its aircraft had made it to a war zone — an initial operational deployment had been planned for October 1945. That month, the squadron stood down and all of its personnel and aircraft transferred to VF-41. At this point, the Fireball program was demoted to test status, which revealed that this stopgap fighter was, in many respects, highly impressive. High-speed maneuverability and turning radius were judged excellent, and the FR-1 was more agile than the U.S. Air Force’s P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter at low-level and could out climb it up to 18,000 feet. VF-41’s time on the carrier — which included “Jake” West’s historic landing — was a little more successful than VF-66’s experience, ending with 14 of the squadron’s 22 pilots qualified, but with many other mishaps experienced too. Above all, the nose gear proved very difficult to master. In March 1946, another round of carrier trials took place when VF-41 went aboard USS Bairoko (CVE 115), and yet more problems, again mainly related to the nose gear, which was still prone to collapse. The rear-fuselage “power egg” of the FR-1, with the General Electric J31 turbojet installed., SAN DIEGO AIR & SPACE MUSEUM ARCHIVES In November 1946, VF-41 was redesignated as VF-1E (the “E” suffix denoting assignment to a small-deck escort carrier), and there followed a busy period of carrier qualification on the USS Badoeng Strait (CVE 116). In April 1947, the squadron was aboard the same carrier for anti-submarine exercises, before going aboard the carrier USS Rendova (CVE 114) for a six-day period in June that year. The same month, VF-1E was back on the Badoeng Strait when one of its Fireballs broke in two after a particularly hard three-point landing. After an inspection, it was revealed that the squadron’s aircraft were starting to show structural problems, and the decision was taken to remove the type from frontline service. Plans for a re-engined FR-2 and FR-3 had been abandoned after the end of the war, but the XFR-4 with a more powerful Westinghouse J34 jet engine did advance to flight testing. There was also the more ambitious XF2R-1 Darkshark, an FR-1 modified with a General Electric TG-100 turboprop in the nose, with the J31 retained in the tail, and first flown in November 1946. Although a turboprop/jet-engine XF2R-2 variant even briefly attracted the interest of the U.S. Air Force, the era of the American mixed-power fighter was destined to be brief, ending when VF-1E gave up its aircraft in August 1947. The XF2R-1 Darkshark was the Navy’s first combat aircraft with turboprop propulsion (and also retained its rear-fuselage turbojet)., U.S. NAVY The Navy’s first exclusively jet-powered carrier fighter, the McDonnell FH-1 Phantom (not to be confused with its much more successful namesake ), had first flown in prototype XFD-1 form in January 1945. An example launched from and then touched down on the carrier USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVB 42), on July 21, 1946. This was the first takeoff and landing of a jet-powered aircraft from a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier and proved the potential of pure-jet carrier operations.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 23, 2021",Area 51 Has A Huge New Hangar Facility That Points To A Drone Swarm Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s clandestine flight test center deep inside the Nevada Test and Training Range , known as Area 51 or Groom Lake , among more colorful nicknames, continues to grow as it approaches its seventh decade of operations . Constant construction has grown the remote facility dramatically since the turn of the millennium, including the addition of a massive and still mysterious hangar built at the base’s remote southern end. Now, an even larger extension to an existing hangar facility that is quite peculiar in nature points to the very real possibility that the age of large swarms of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) has finally arrived. For around a year, construction has been underway in a prominent section of the southern ramp area at the base, near where the original A-12 Oxcart hangars still stand. A quartet of more modern hangars that are divided into two separate buildings, with each bay measuring roughly 90 feet wide, and are understood to be known as hangars 20-23, has been the recipient of a highly curious series of modifications. The hangars have stood for decades and are thought to largely serve Air Combat Command tactical aircraft programs, including supporting F-117 testing for many years. At first, it looked like they were about to be torn down. This didn’t end up being the case. Instead, massive enclosures were built over the aprons that flank the east and west sides of the original drive-through hangars.

In addition, the soft structure located just to the southwest of hangars 20-23 that has been badly torn for years and was eventually patched, has now been totally demolished. Interestingly, it appears that the soft structure actually concealed a unique-looking building inside of it, before it was torn down. The same area circa 2016. , Google Earth The near-finished product seen in September 2020., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The unique additions to hangars 20-23 create a combined hangar facility that is the largest of any on base by a substantial margin, measuring roughly 400 by 500 feet, overall. The additions have more in common with the ‘scoot and hide’ shelter extensions built onto the arm-de-arm hangar located between the ramp and the runway in the mid-2000s than they do with a traditional hangar. They appear to be more of a covered area portico-like addition than anything else, with the existing central hangars still acting as they always did. The ‘scoot and hit’ extensions built over the arm-de-arm shelter that sits between the apron and the runway at Groom Lake., Google Earth More views of this new add-on facility and its shed-like nature came from Gabriel Zeifman’s photos that he took while circumnavigating the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) with air traffic control’s approval on a number of occasions : A shot by private pilot Gabriel Zeifman of Area 51 included early stages of construction of the extensions to Hangar 20-23, Gabrial Zeifman Another shot months later shows the relatively massive covered area taking shape. , Gabrial Zeifman So, what is this somewhat peculiar addition all about? For hangars that easily fit one F-117 each with plenty of room to spare, having a huge covered structure built onto them doesn’t make a lot of sense, at least not for their original purpose, and especially on both sides of what are already drive-through hangars. As such, it seems that this revamped facility is not meant for a small number of large tactical aircraft, but instead, it seems to have been remodeled to support a fleet of smaller tactical aircraft, ones that are designed to fly together in a collective swarm on missions. What’s the justification behind this conjecture? Well, it solves a number of problems with scaling up testing of large swarms of unmanned combat air vehicles. First off, servicing and then staging the aircraft for a mission requires a lot of space and would benefit more by a production line-like arrangement than a traditional hangar and apron layout. The modifications are fairly ingenious as the arrangement would allow for a large group on drones to park outside of the view of satellites and out of the weather on one side, with the hangars in the center working as pass-through servicing bays for preparing them for another flight, and then moving them to the other side to await a launch en-masse on their next mission. Upon return, they would be parked on the other side once again and await servicing and staging for reuse. Just learning how to best stage, launch, and recover a large number of semi-autonomous jet-powered unmanned systems together will surely be a focus of any such program. The notional concept behind this odd construction., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. We believe, and sincerely hope, that advanced unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) testing has occurred for years under deep classification after the Air Force suddenly acted like the entire concept doesn’t even exist towards the end of the 2000s, a bizarre reality with huge implications you can read all about in this must-read feature of ours . In fact, it is even possible that a small pocket force of advanced UCAVs exists today in a semi-operational state. Regardless, the type of testing this revamped facility would support would likely be on a different scale. It is highly likely that higher-end UCAVs that are the size of manned fighters or larger and possess extreme range and low-observability have been in testing for years or even a small pocket operational force exists, but this is less likely the case for large swarms of attritable unmanned systems. , Northrop Grumman Testing of advanced networked UCAVs in groups of three or even six is one thing, what we are seeing here could potentially support much larger groups of lower-end, smaller UCAVs or drone surrogates, the likes of which have taken on a high profile recently. As such, the aircraft that would occupy this facility could be more about testing the concepts of networking, command and control, and experimental tactics and operating procedures related to large swarms than it would be about just the vehicles themselves. That being said, it is totally possible that those airframes could still represent a potential future production vehicle. Boeing, Kratos, and certainly Lockheed are all working on so-called attritable UCAVs that cost millions each, not tens of millions, are highly modular, and are optionally expendable. Beyond Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie , the company is known to have a number of classified programs underway that are of a similar in nature, but have to do with more advanced concepts and testing. You can read all about the future of attritable swarming drones here. Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie., USAF Boeing’s loyal wingman drone that is currently being developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. A similar system is also being offered to the USAF, depending on their requirements. , Boeing These jet-powered stealthy drones are smaller than their fighter-sized, high-end UCAV counterparts, and would be better suited for the airspace restrictions within ‘the box’ around Area 51 and within the greater NTTR. Many of the lessons learned from attritable UCAVs could be extrapolated over large swarms of those higher-end unmanned systems, as well. These types of drones are also the types that are being designed for the so-called loyal wingman role, in which a number of them are electronically ‘tethered’ via a semi-autonomous command-link interface to another manned aircraft. So, this concept of operations, which you can read all about here , could also be part of this advanced testing. All this comes as the news that a demonstrator for the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program has flown. As we discussed in detail , NGAD is not a new fighter, but a family of systems that will leverage common networking and command and control architecture, as well as sensor concepts, to work as a team to dominate air battles of the future. Swarming UCAVs are absolutely going to be part of that, so a facility that can support that aspect of NGAD makes a lot of sense. In fact, the ‘demonstrator’ itself could be the Air Force’s first large UCAV swarm, not just one airplane, and the manufacturer of those drones would have leveraged the flying force’s new ‘e-Plane’ concept of rapid digital design and prototyping to migrate the concept from idea to iron on the ramp in record time. Thanks to our colleagues Steve Trimble and Marcus Weisgerber , The War Zone’s long-standing assertion that the Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber would work as a central C3 node for tactical aircraft , including networked swarms of UCAVs , was all but outright confirmed by the Air Force’s Chief of Staff. Once again, we are talking about an interconnected family of systems here. Chief of Staff Brown also underlined that the NGAD demonstrator is more about how it was designed and built under the ‘e-Plane’ doctrine than it being an exquisite airframe (or airframes) itself. Regardless, with any UCAV type initiative, especially on the lower end, rapid evolutionary iterations of a design produced in small batches that use the same foundational networking and command and control architecture will be central to the effort. Once again, this fits perfectly with what we think this new facility at Area 51 will be used to support. Considering how fast the rest of the world is moving forward on UCAVs and attritable unmanned air combat systems , not to mention the glaring limitations of traditional manned tactical aircraft when it comes to emerging peer-state threats in Asia, one would imagine that the USAF has finally put these programs into high gear. Once again, while advanced UCAVs have likely been tested for some time clandestinely, larger swarms of smaller and far more modular and affordable systems that are emerging today as a key future air superiority concept are less likely to have been. Our assessment is that there is a strong possibility this major construction project indicates that this is about to change.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2020",The Full Story On That Oregon F-15 That Fired Its Missiles Into The Sea Before Landing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, The War Zone was first to report that an F-15C Eagle from the Oregon Air National Guard’s 142nd Fighter Wing had fired its live AIM-120C AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles into the Pacific Ocean before making an emergency landing at Portland International Airport. At the time, details about the mishap were limited, but now we have obtained a copy of the official Air Force accident report that describes exactly what happened. The F-15C in question, known by its serial number 78-0473 and going by the callsign “ROCK 42” at the time, was sitting alert at Portland International Airport on Feb. 20, 2019. That day, it and another alert jet were scheduled to conduct a mock scramble and then train with two additional flights of four F-15Cs each. Despite the planned training mission, since the 78-0473 was designated to be on alert that day, it was still armed with four AIM-120Cs and two AIM-9X missiles, all of which were live, as well as 940 rounds of 20mm ammunition for its M61 Vulcan cannon . It also carried 48 MJU-10/B decoy flares and two external fuel tanks. “The mission briefing and scramble ground operations were unremarkable,” the official accident report says, which The War Zone obtained in a redacted form via the Freedom of Information Act. Rock 42, the second in the two-ship alert flight, conducted an afterburner takeoff as part of the scramble drill at approximately 8:28 AM local time. 142nd Fighter Wing alert bird blasts out of PDX in full afterburner., Tyler Rogoway Shortly after the takeoff, the F-15C’s pilot, whose name and rank is not present in the unredacted portions of the accident report, noticed a warning light indicating that the jet’s left main landing gear had not retracted properly. Rock 42 alerted their wingman and local air traffic controllers and requested a clear block of airspace in which to try to fix the issue. In accordance with official Air Force procedures, the pilot lowered and then raised all of the plane’s landing gear again to see if this would unstick the left main landing gear. The pilot of the other alert F-15C, flying chase for the stricken Eagle, reported that the left main landing gear appeared to be locked in the downward position and did not move during this process. Unable to retract the left main landing gear, Rock 42 declared an inflight emergency and then began preparing for an emergency arrested landing at Portland International Airport. “The Landing Gear Emergency-Landing checklist directed the aircrew to ‘Jettison armament and chaff/ flares …’ The MF [mishap flight] obtained a clearance to the overwater airspace to prepare for the armament jettison,” the report says. Rock 42 fired off all 48 its MJU-10/Bs flares in the designated airspace over the Pacific Ocean without issue, after which the pilot continued to coordinate with Air Force personnel on the ground about both the nature of the landing gear issue and what to do with its remaining ordnance. A team of off-site specialists, known as a Conference Hotel , or CH, was contacted to help with continued troubleshooting. A representative from Boeing, the present prime contractor for the F-15 series, were also consulted. F-15C dumping its flares. , Tyler Rogoway A second attempt to lower and raise all of the landing gear also failed, but Rock 42’s wingman did observe a spurt of hydraulic fluid during the process and noted that the left main landing gear was also covered in it. However, the stricken Eagle’s pilot reported there were no problems with the jet’s hydraulic pressure according to their in-cockpit readouts. Based on the information available, the Boeing representative stated that they were confident that there was serious risk that the landing gear strut could collapse during any emergency landing. At this point, Rock 42 was also running low on fuel. A KC-135R tanker, with the callsign Expo 91, which had already been operating in the area, had been redirected to provide support. However, there were concerns about whether the F-15C would be able to fly fast enough with its landing gear down to successfully refuel. Rock 42’s wingman lowered their landing gear and refueled first, at a speed of 230 knots, to make sure the maneuver was safe. After that, Rock 42 also conducted a successful aerial refueling with Expo 91. Both jets linked up with the tanker a second time. 142nd Fighter F-15C refuels from a KC-135R over the Oregon Coast. , Tyler Rogoway During these refuelings, Air Force personnel had been working out a plan for Rock 42 to safely get rid of its four AIM-120Cs and two AIM-9Xs, through a combination of firing them off and simply jettisoning them into the Pacific. “They determined, and relayed to the MF [mishap flight], that they would need a 40 nautical mile (NM) long by 12 NM wide ‘shooting lane’ at the lowest possible altitude,” according to the accident report. Clouds off the Oregon coastline made it difficult for Rock 42’s wingman to conduct an impromptu “range sweep” to make sure there were no civilian or commercial aircraft in the lane or ships in the water below. Air traffic and shipping lane traffic data was subsequently used to confirm that the area was clear. It took three passes to fire all of the missiles. “On the first pass the MP [mishap pilot] selectively jettisoned the AIM-120C located on station 3 (left side of fuselage), followed by the AIM-120C on station 7 (right side of fuselage),” the report says. “The MFL [mishap flight lead] observed the missiles separate from the MA [mishap aircraft] and impact the water, marking the coordinates and observing that they appeared to break apart upon impact.” “The MP conducted two more passes firing the [remaining two] AIM-120Cs on the second pass and the AIM-9Xs on the third pass,” the report continues. “After the third pass was complete the MF proceeded to the tanker for the third and final aerial refueling, receiving fuel uneventfully.” An F-15C fires an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile., USAF The report does not give an explanation for why it was possible to jettison the two missiles under the fuselage, but not the others. However, this would have been due to external fuel tanks, which remained attached to the aircraft throughout the mishap, presenting an obstacle to safely jettisoning the missiles on the underwing pylons. It was also determined that there was no major added risk to the aircraft or its pilot from leaving the 940 20mm cannon shells in the internal magazine. Rock 42 then moved on to the emergency arrested landing at Portland International Airport. The F-15C successfully caught the wire on the arresting system on the approach end of the airport’s runway 28L. Unfortunately, after the pilot had put the jet’s nose wheel down on the runway, it had risen up again approximately one foot off the ground. This high engagement angle led the aircraft’s arresting hook to slam into the full up position after it caught the wire, bringing the cable up with it. “The [arresting] cable impacted the left horizontal stabilator, left tail cone, left engine exhaust, right engine exhaust, and the right tail internal countermeasures set (ICS) antenna,” causing damage to all of those components, according to the report. The left main landing gear, however, did not collapse as was feared might happen. Emergency crews and ground personnel met the jet on the runway, secured it and then towed the 142nd’s maintenance hangar to assess the damage. The exact cause of the landing gear malfunction and any subsequent recommendations in the report are redacted. However, the narrative and other unredacted details point to a failure in the jury link, a supporting component attached to the main landing gear strut, as a key factor. “This specific LMLG [left main landing gear assembly] was modified by Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) 1F-15-1680 on 07 Jul 2017, to receive a newly manufactured upper jury link, replacing the previous jury link that was prone to failure,” an unredacted portion of the report notes. The Air Force subsequently ruled this incident to be so-called Class C mishap, which covers accidents that result in between $50,000 and $500,000 worth of damage or a nonfatal injury or illness that put someone out of work for one or more days, or both. The report says that the official total cost of the damage to the Eagle was $418,280 dollars. All of the damaged components were deemed to be repairable. 142nd Fighter Wing F-15C in one of the barns at PDX. , Tyler Rogoway However, this figure notably and curiously does not include the cost of the expended missiles or flares. As The War Zone noted at the time , this accident directly resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of missiles that would otherwise have remained in inventory. Based on information from Pentagon budget documents , the estimated cost of each of the four lost AIM-120Cs was approximately $1 million, or $4 million in total. The accident report does not say that if the two expended AIM-9Xs were newer Block II models, which would have cost around $408,000, or older Block I missiles worth some $250,000. As of 2019, the unit price for the MJU-10/B was $184 , meaning the Eagle expended nearly $9,000 in flares during the incident, as well. The full cost of all of the expended missiles and flares would have been more than $4.5 million, at least. Of course, what matters most is that the pilot of Rock 42 made it back safely. That the jet sustained relatively limited damage itself, despite concerns about a possible belly-up landing, means that the outcome, in the end, was largely positive. If nothing else, it’s good to finally have a more complete description of the bizarre impromptu Oregon Coast missile shoot and emergency landing, overall.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 21, 2021",Blasting The Air In Front Of Hypersonic Vehicles With Lasers Could Unlock Unprecedented Speeds,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last decade, two of the most significant topics in defense research and development have been directed energy systems and hypersonic weapons . The Department of Defense and its major contractors have been pushing the boundaries of what is possible with these technologies and those efforts could someday soon literally change the face of warfare forever. As it turns out, these two cutting edge areas of defense research are beginning to converge in laboratories with the goal of enabling unprecedented levels of speed for aerial weapons. By combining advanced directed energy technology with the latest in hypersonic vehicle design, researchers in private and Department of Defense (DoD) funded laboratories have laid the groundwork for systems designed to literally sheathe an entire vehicle in laser and/or microwave-induced plasma in order to drastically reduce drag. If successfully developed, this concept may someday lead to new frontiers in speed and radical new forms of aerodynamic control and aircraft design. The Rapidly Evolving Hypersonic Landscape As the world’s military superpowers jockey for position in a new arms race , hypersonic technologies have been pushed to the forefront of defense and aerospace research. These vehicles and weapons represent a true leap-ahead capability, enabling flight speeds that can outpace even the most advanced and robust air defense systems. It’s one thing to intercept and destroy a ballistic missile falling on an arcing path, but it’s another thing entirely to attempt to intercept a projectile moving at speeds greater than five times the speed of sound while executing abrupt changes in trajectory. It’s no surprise that hypersonic systems are becoming integral to the United States’ military’s future strategy in key theaters such as the Indo-Pacific region. The need for hypersonic weapons has evolved alongside the parallel evolution of missile defense systems. As integrated sensor networks and missile defenses continue to become more sophisticated and adept, developing weapon delivery systems capable of evading or bypassing defenses with extreme speed has become paramount to ensuring global battlefield dominance and conventional deterrence. To that end, and to keep up with foreign advances , the USAF and other branches of the DoD have been investing vast sums of money into hypersonic research and development in recent years. That R&D has already led to several systems approaching operational status. The USAF and Lockheed Martin are working on the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), a boost-glide hypersonic system that is claimed to be able to achieve speeds up to Mach 20 . The wedge-shaped ARRW has been tested in captive flights on a B-52 Stratofortress and is expected to be operational by 2022. Meanwhile, the Army and Navy, in conjunction with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), have tested their own hypersonic delivery system , the Common Hypersonic Glide Body vehicle, or C-HGB. There are a number of other initiatives underway as well, including air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile designs, such as HAWC , and a multitude of classified efforts. A Lockheed Martin-built AGM-183 ARRW (Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon) hypersonic missile during a captive flight test aboard a USAF B-52. , USAF As with all hypersonic systems, drag and the resulting thermal stresses of extremely high-speed flight are two of the biggest hurdles faced by these vehicles. Even with advanced geometry, extreme levels of heat are generated by friction on the skin of high-speed craft, which can potentially degrade the structural integrity of the airframe and damage internal components, potentially even in a catastrophic fashion. One of the ways of mitigating that heat buildup is to add shielding to the external surfaces of an airframe. That can increase a craft’s weight and may, therefore, decrease its range, maneuverability, and top speed. Thermal shielding requirements can also be very restrictive for aerospace designers that are looking to push the limits of inter-atmospheric speed. Tweaking a vehicle’s geometry can mitigate drag, which can also help to reduce heat buildup. However, due to the limitations of materials science and the need to include various subsystems and payloads inside of hypersonic craft, there are restrictions on just how much the geometry can be altered. Thus, there is a pressing need for other drag reduction methods to be used in conjunction with airframe geometry. Like in many other areas of cutting-edge defense and aerospace research today, that’s where breakthroughs in directed energy may be able to lend a hand. Drag Reduction Through Directed Energy Deposition Alongside the ongoing hypersonic revolution, the Department of Defense has been investing vast sums in directed energy systems. Many huge leaps in power and miniaturization have occurred in the last decade as solid-state systems have rapidly matured, enabling them to be used for new applications. Laser weapons have been developed and tested for use aboard Naval vessels and even aircraft , while other forms of directed energy systems, such as high-powered microwaves, have been designed for power-beaming concepts , close-in defense systems , and anti-satellite technologies . While most discussions of directed energy focus on the potential to revolutionize anti-aircraft systems, missile defenses, or anti-satellite systems, it turns out directed energy could revolutionize high-speed aerospace propulsion and airframe design just as significantly. Since at least the 1980s, many leading aerospace laboratories have explored the concept of “energy deposition” in order to reduce drag. This concept involves beaming energy in the form of laser filaments, electric arcs, or microwave radiation along the leading edges or just in front of an aircraft in order to condition the air to be more conducive to high-speed flight. Similar concepts have been tested in the past for different purposes, including an electron gun aboard the Lockheed A-12 designed to reduce the aircraft’s radar signature. In a 1983 NASA-funded study conducted by the BDM Corporation and authored by Leik Myrabo, pioneer of the laser lightcraft propulsion concept , Myrabo proposed using lasers to literally explode the air in front of a high-speed craft. Myrabo’s initial concept centered on small lightcraft propelled by ground-based lasers focused on their aft section. These proposed craft would also employ internal mirrored optics to then redirect those beams forward to create a “laser-supported detonation” or “LSD wave” in front of the craft. NASA This LSD wave would create a detached shockwave “at some distance in advance of the leading edge,” which would theoretically “do the work of pushing the atmosphere out of the way and thereby suppress the formation of a strong bow shock and the associated wave drag.” The hot, pressurized gases created by the LSD wave would also theoretically then be used by the craft’s air-breathing engine, thus reducing the amount of energy required for combustion. Myrabo updated the concept throughout the 1990s in response to the limitations of high-powered lasers at the time. In a 1995 Popular Mechanics article by Gregory Pope, Myrabo claimed that pulsed microwave energy beamed from an overhead satellite could be focused in front of a craft to “blast air into plasma,” which could then be focused downward by powerful superconducting magnets circling the craft in order to create propulsion. As Pope’s article points out, “NASA officials see promise in some of the component technologies, but envision no short-term payoff.” Myrabo’s radical concept appears to have never left the ground. Other researchers continued exploring similar concepts, however. In 1999, Australia-based aerospace researcher H. David Froning conducted a study published by AIAA titled “Influence of EM Discharges on Hypersonic Vehicle Lift, Drag, and Airbreathing Thrust” that investigated creating “plasma formations by electric arcs or by laser or microwave radiation.” Using computational fluid dynamics, Froning found that “electric or electromagnetic discharges from hypersonic vehicles’ nose sections propagate downstream over the entire extent of the vehicles and through their engines – affecting not only nose drag, but temperatures, pressures, and total vehicle thrust, drag, and lift.” These were only computational studies, but they established a theoretical framework for developing these systems in the future. A figure from H.D. Froning’s “Influence of EM Discharges on Hypersonic Vehicle Lift, Drag, and Airbreathing Thrust”., AIAA Throughout the last two decades, researchers in Brazil and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Rochester, New York have built upon this theoretical research and designed experiments to test energy deposition in hypersonic wind tunnels. This concept became known as the Laser-Supported Directed Energy Air Spike , or DEAS. Leik Myrabo was once again involved with the research, this time alongside a team of Brazilian researchers. Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering In 2005, Myrabo and Brazilian researchers testing the DEAS concept in hypersonic wind tunnels concluded that “the laser-supported DEAS was able to generate a decrease in the surface pressure over the new model tested and, therefore, a considerable decrease in the aerodynamic drag” experienced by a hemispherical test model. Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering Myrabo’s concept seemed to have attracted the attention of several top laboratories. In 2010, the Journal of Propulsion and Power published the article “ Review: Laser-Ablation Propulsion ” which features input from personnel at the USAF Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), Los Alamos National Laboratory, and academic institutions worldwide. The review notes that at that time, Brazilian researchers had shown that “hypersonic drag can be cut by as much as 40%” and cites cooperation between American, Brazilian, and Australian researchers on the subject of laser-aided propulsion. By 2011, Myrabo’s team was researching the DEAS concept in cooperation with the Brazilian Air Force and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. Curiously, one of the team’s publications from that year mentions a “Brazil-USA BEP cooperation” (Beamed Energy Propulsion) program, a claim that appears to be supported by additional reporting by Wired and MIT Technology Review published around the same time. The War Zone has been unable to identify such a program. However, an AFOSR report from 2010 also mentions such a program overseen by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and the Henry T. Nagamatsu Laboratory of Aerothermodynamics and Hypersonics (HTN-LAH) located at the Instituto de Estudos Avançados (IEAv-CTA) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil. According to the AFOSR report, this collaboration “was forged by the shared research goals envisioned by both parties (RPI and IEAv-CTA), and the unique facilities and equipment made available for this AFOSR research: i.e., a) the operational T3 hypersonic shock tunnel at the HTN-LAH; and, b) RPI’s two Lumonics TEA 620 lasers that were transported to Brazil with the approval of AFOSR.” AFOSR Similar energy deposition concepts have been explored by researchers at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( Van Wie 2004 ), Rutgers University ( Knight 2008 ; Anderson & Knight 2012 ), the Laboratory of Optics Applications in France ( Elias 2018 ), and the Russian Academy of Sciences ( Fomin 2004 ), among many other laboratories. A search on the AIAA Aerospace Research Central database turns up over 11,000 results for various aerospace applications of energy deposition. Many major aircraft manufacturers are assigned patents for similar systems , including Boeing and Lockheed Martin . Department Of Defense Research On Energy Deposition The DOD has conducted its own research into energy deposition as a concept for reducing the drag experienced by high-speed vehicles. The USAF is also the assignee of numerous patents related to plasma aerodynamics . A 2004 report commissioned by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) studied “plasmas generated by electron beams and high-voltage nanosecond pulses” and explored “aerodynamic steering using plasma energy addition” using a “microwave-driven supersonic plasma wind tunnel.” As in many exotic aerospace studies, the authors note that “Of course, fundamental issues have to be resolved prior to any practical applications.” That doesn’t mean the DOD stopped trying to resolve those issues. In 2009, the AFRL published another study titled “Lines of Energy Deposition for Supersonic/Hypersonic Temperature/ Drag-Reduction and Vehicle Control.” The report was authored by Kevin Kremeyer, Vice President of Research at Physics, Materials, and Applied Mathematics Research (PM&AM) in Tucson, AZ. Kremeyer holds numerous patents for systems designed to reduce drag through the use of directed energy. In the 2009 AFRL study, Kremeyer describes using laser pulses to create ionized paths in the air surrounding an aircraft and then passing an electrical current through that path, essentially forming a miniaturized lightning bolt ahead of a vehicle. By creating these ionized paths at different angles relative to an aircraft’s motion, it is claimed that novel forms of vehicle control could be accomplished that do away with external control surfaces entirely: Reducing drag at an angle or “off-axis” steers and controls the vehicle, since it will travel along the center of the low-density tube ahead of it. This presents the alluring ability to use the vehicle’s body as the only required control and lifting surface, as it balances the moments/forces to keep the vehicle confined within the low-density path. Kremeyer claims this could allow for more effective maneuvering at extreme speeds and notes that “each of the technical elements required to implement this technology has been demonstrated individually in the laboratory, with no apparent physical limitation barring execution as a full system.” USAF The USAF isn’t the only U.S. military branch investigating energy deposition. A 2015 study by the Naval Research Laboratory titled “Guiding Supersonic Projectiles Using Optically Generated Air Density Channels” states that a “channel of reduced air density can be generated by the energy deposited from filamentation of an intense femtosecond laser pulse” and that this channel could be used to control the trajectory of flying projectiles. While the report focuses on small projectiles instead of aircraft and describes using lasers external to the projectiles as opposed to carried aboard them, the concept remains relatively identical to other research cited here: using directed energy to reduce air pressure ahead of a vehicle or projectile’s path. NASA even conducted a study in 2017 at the Langley Research Center into the “experimental determination of the drag reduction and energetic efficiency” of laser discharges ahead of simulated aircraft traveling at high speeds, and the Department of Energy (DOE) has looked into the same concept for increasing the performance of wind turbines. Physics, Materials, And Applied Mathematics Research Since 2002, Kremeyer and his firm Physics, Materials, and Applied Mathematics Research have been awarded at least 48 SBIR contracts offered by DHS, DOD, DOE, and NASA, largely focused on advanced materials, short-pulse lasers, and other directed energy applications. According to their website , PM&AM’s research largely focuses on drag reduction and hypersonic flight dynamics, and the firm claims its drag reduction technology “presents the possibility to eliminate more than 90% of the drag when flying at supersonic/hypersonic speeds.” It’s unclear how credible that claim of 90% drag reduction is, but if it turns out to be true or even remotely true, such a technology would represent a total game-changer in terms of aerodynamic performance. In a 2019 patent , PM&AM’s Kremeyer claims that his system can reduce drag, aid propulsion, and reduce the thermal effects an aircraft experiences by ionizing and heating the air immediately around the vehicle with short laser pulses. Microwave energy is then pulsed into that laser-induced plasma to further heat the air in front of the vehicle: Our proposed technology depends critically on coupling electromagnetic energy into air in a precisely defined, extended geometry ahead of a vehicle’s shockwave. Laser “discharges” or “sparks” have been researched since the 1960s with great success. Scaling relations have been obtained for various wavelengths, and contributing mechanisms such as dust and carrier-diffusion have also been identified. For our application, however, we require more than simply a spark in the air. We require a well-controlled extended swath of air to be heated as efficiently as possible. These methods can still be optimized, and one of our primary interests is the ionization and energy-deposition resulting from laser pulses propagating through the atmosphere. Similar to using electric discharges along a closed path, guided and initiated by ionizing laser pulses (such as laser filaments), energy can also be deposited further ahead of the vehicle, using more remote deposition techniques, such as depositing microwave energy, whose deposition is seeded/facilitated by creating an ionized region in front of the vehicle, again, potentially using a laser plasma. Kremeyer also claims this energy deposition system could mitigate sonic booms and other noises or resonances, as well as aid in a variety of non-aerospace industrial and manufacturing processes. In 2011, PM&AM was awarded an Air Force Phase I SBIR contract worth $99,999 titled “Laser/Microwave Energy Deposition to Improve Control/Performance of High Speed Vehicles.” The War Zone was unable to find an original listing for this SBIR offering, but one is archived on a Russian website . According to this archived version, the objective of AF103-009 is to “develop and demonstrate laser-microwave pulsed discharges to generate surface and volumetric plasma regions in high-speed aerodynamic flows to improve vehicle performance and flight control.” The description section goes on to state that using lasers, “it is conceivable with patterned slewing, that surface and volumetric discharge clouds may be sculpted and customized to have two- or three- dimensional shapes placed strategically on or over a vehicle that could have benefits for drag reduction, vehicle steering, and, possibly, heat transfer reduction.” The abstract and project benefits for the program as listed on SBIR.gov are as follows: ABSTRACT: In this effort, we will couple the energy of focused microwave bursts into the air and onto surfaces by first forming a laser plasma. The presence of the laser plasma allows much lower microwave intensities to couple their energy to the laser-pre-ionized surface or air-volume, allowing more efficient energy-transfer and the use of lower-power microwave systems to achieve the desired effect. We will use a variety of laser pulses, including ultrashort laser pulses, which can achieve the intensities required to seed surfaces and air, even with very little energy per pulse. This is a direct result of their short pulse width, and will allow very low average laser-power as the seed, relying on the more cost-effective microwave source for the bulk of the energy deposition. In this effort, our team will define energetically favorable high speed conditions, under which to implement laser-microwave discharges. We will also determine the test parameters required to test a slewing laser-microwave system that produces sculpted surface-volumetric discharges in quiescent and flowing air. Lastly, we will identify the plans for Phase II, to develop and demonstrate a laser-microwave system. BENEFIT: The benefits of this technology will increase control and performance on high speed air platforms, including military and civilian aircraft, as well as unmanned systems (including missiles and re-entry vehicles), and space access and re-entry craft. The potential absence of moving parts in the resulting control effectors stand to dramatically improve cost, risk, performance, and longevity. In 2013, PM&AM won a NASA SBIR contract worth $124,991 to “demonstrate the feasibility of depositing energy using basic, well-demonstrated techniques along the surface in supersonic flow to control/compress/forcibly-move the boundary layer fluid by creating a low-density ‘bubble-like’ region, thereby reducing the viscous skin friction.” A NASA.gov listing for the same contract states that the technology can be used “to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of a wide range of supersonic Government and industry platforms including supersonic business jets, commercial and military access to space vehicles, supersonic cruise vehicles, and high-speed delivery platforms.” In 2015, PM&AM’s Air Force SBIR moved to Phase II with a new contract worth $1,199,999. In Phase II, PM&AM planned “to develop and demonstrate a laser-microwave system capable of coupling the energy of focused microwave bursts into quiescent air without the need for a microwave cavity, resulting in configuration much more applicable for improving performance of high speed vehicles.” The contract also claimed that PM&AM’s laser-microwave system would be tested at various pressure ranges experienced by hypersonic and other high-speed vehicles. A FY 2016 DARPA funding spreadsheet found on the Executive Services Directorate website lists an identical contract number under the “Solider Protection Systems” program worth $150,000. In Kremeyer’s 2020 patent “Energy-Deposition Systems, Equipment and Methods for Modifying and Controlling Shock Waves and Supersonic Flow”, it’s claimed that the same type of laser-microwave energy deposition system could be used to protect ground vehicles from shockwaves or blastwaves produced by IEDs or other explosives. According to its website, DARPA’s Solider Protection Systems is focused on “materials and material systems that can control the energy absorption and propagation of ballistics or blasts”. The War Zone reached out to Kremeyer and PM&AM for more information on their research, but has yet to receive a response. To help us contextualize this research in terms of actual systems in development, The War Zone spoke with Dr. David Van Wie , head of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory’s Air and Missile Defense Sector. Among other aerospace and defense topics, Van Wie has published extensively on energy deposition drag reduction systems and other plasma-based aerodynamic concepts , and led AFRL’s “ Advanced Physics System Study for Future Aerospace Vehicles.” Van Wie told The War Zone that while the levels of power required for the energy deposition systems cited above are indeed possible given today’s aircraft power systems, the accompanying weight that must be accommodated into any aircraft drag reduction system would offset some of the gains that system could produce. “A one-megawatt generator riding on a turbine engine is a fairly heavy system to get integrated into any practical aircraft,” he said. “It’s not that you couldn’t do it, but it ends up being a weight challenge to generate any appropriate level of power to have a reasonable drag reduction.” He pointed out that efficiency is key to energy depositions for drag reduction, as the levels of drag reduction must be weighed against the added weight and power requirements. “The drag reduction system has to be more efficient than what you could get out of an engine or it doesn’t make sense to use drag reduction; you’d just build a bigger engine.” Van Wie is not aware of any actual flight testing of these types of energy deposition systems, as it still remains quite complex and expensive to integrate such a system into an aircraft. In addition, he noted there are “still relatively significant uncertainties about the efficiency that a system like this could operate with, even given all of the academic and wind tunnel papers that have been generated. There’s still quite a bit of uncertainty about the performance that can be realized.” Still, Van Wie said that the quite significant levels of drag reduction cited by Kremeyer and others are “not just theoretical” and have been realized in wind tunnel testing, although those tests often involve blunt test bodies and other non-aircraft shapes. “The real question is what kind of efficiency can I get on a system that’s more optimized for a flight vehicle, an aerodynamic shape, which is fundamentally designed to not have a lot of drag,” he told The War Zone. “The question of efficiency is tied ultimately to questions of shapes and such, and so you have to answer those questions together. Can I get high efficiency both in a configuration that would be typical of those that we use for flying vehicles which are highly aerodynamically efficient already?” A Possible Glimpse At What’s To Come Interest in hypersonic weapons and vehicles have exploded across the aerospace defense-industrial complex, with massive contracting opportunities popping up across the board. The Pentagon’s appetite for hypersonic weapons has grown so immense and pressing that it has issued contracting opportunities for what appears to be literally any hypersonic technology . Alongside the burgeoning hypersonic revolution, directed energy systems continue to become smaller and more powerful , and applications like the energy deposition concepts cited above seem far more possible than they were in decades past. DoD research into solid-state laser technology has made directed energy weapons much more portable, enabling them to be installed aboard surface vessels or in pods aboard aircraft . It’s no stretch of the imagination to say that directed energy systems could eventually be miniaturized and efficient enough to be used in drag reduction or flow control systems. Artist’s rendering of a future aircraft neutralizing a threat with a directed energy weapon., LOCKHEED MARTIN The energy deposition research cited above is a rare case in which two of the Department of Defense’s most cutting edge areas of research could potentially combine to form an entirely new and utterly formidable capability: hypersonic vehicles that can fly extremely efficiently at incredible speeds, a feat made possible by revolutionary new applications of lasers and microwaves that are coupled to tailored aerodynamic shapes and hypersonic propulsion. Of course, all of the research cited above is only a glimpse into what has been published publicly. There is no doubt energy deposition research at various stages in the classified world, as well. Especially now. Given that the DoD is poised to spend over $71 billion on classified programs in 2021, one can only imagine what types of undisclosed hypersonic platforms and directed energy systems are being developed given that these are two of the most strategically competitive areas of weapons development today. As these two areas of cutting edge technological research continue to merge in the form of energy deposition for aerodynamic control, entirely new forms of aircraft design, propulsion, and control may arise and unlock new frontiers in terms of velocities that are attainable within Earth’s atmosphere.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Here’s Why The Destroyer USS Kidd Was Flying A Huge Pirate Flag As It Pulled Into Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd recently returned from a cruise flying a large black pirate flag with a white skull and crossbones motif, better known as a Jolly Roger. The modern display of this flag, which traces its roots back to the 17th century, on a naval vessel, especially submarines , at the conclusion of a deployment generally reflects some kind of notable achievement. However, this particular ship has its own unique history with the skull and crossbones, which has to do with its namesake, Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd, and Captain William Kidd, a Scottish sailor executed for piracy in 1701. USS Kidd returned to Naval Station Everett in Washington State on Sept. 21, 2020, after completing a patrol focused on countering drug smuggling in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean. The destroyer had set out for this patrol in April as part of a then-new Enhanced Counter-Narcotics Operations effort led by U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). For this deployment, the ship also had an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter from Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 75 (HSM-75) and a U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) embarked. “This deployment has been extremely challenging, but Kidd set the standard for operational mission execution and readiness,” Navy Commander Nathan Wemett, the destroyer’s commanding officer, said in a statement. “I thank all the Sailors and U.S. Coast Guardsmen who overcame many obstacles in order to carry out our mission.” The Navy said that the destroyer had assisted the Coast Guard LEDET in seizing 805 kilograms of cocaine, nearly a ton of drugs, with an estimated value of $30 million during this patrol. The ship had also rendered assistance to a fishing vessel, towing it more than 200 miles to safety. The USS Kidd towed the fishing boat seen here more than 200 miles to safety during its recently completed deployment., USN Kidd also suffered an outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus among its crew, forcing it to make an unscheduled stop in San Diego at the end of April . The ship’s crew eventually got things under control and the ship headed back out to sea in June to finish its deployment. The official news item marking the ship’s return to Everett made no mention of the pirate flag or its significance with regards to the USS Kidd . As already noted, the white skull and crossbones on a solid black flag trace back to pirates operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean during the 17th and 18th centuries. Skeletons, the devil, and hourglasses, as well as red accents, such as hearts and drops of blood, were also common. You can read more about the background of these symbols in this past War Zone story . A closeup of the Jolly Roger that USS Kidd was flying when it returned to its homeport of Naval Station Everett on Sept. 21, 2020., USN The broad modern return of these flags on naval vessels, particularly in submarine communities, dates back to World War I, when U.K. Royal Navy submarine crews began flying them after returning from patrols in which they sunk enemy ships. This practice subsequently expanded to reflect a wide array of other achievements at, including successfully completing sea trials or otherwise having a “perfect” deployment. Crews would add additional symbols to their flags to mark the completion of different tasks and missions. You can read more about this in this previous War Zone story . Various symbols used on Jolly Roger flags flown by British submarine crews during World War II and their meanings., navynews.co.uk However, the crew of the USS Kidd fly the Jolly Roger for an entirely different reason, which traces its roots to Japan’s infamous surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941. At that time, Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd, Sr. was Commander of Battleship Division One and the Chief of Staff and Aide to the Commander, Battleship Battle Force. After the Japanese attack began, he made his way to his flagship, the Pennsylvania class battleship USS Arizona , and took part in the ensuing battle until the ship exploded after bombs hit one of its ammunition magazines. Rear Admiral Kidd was among the 1,177 officers and crew who died on the battleship, which still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and is now a memorial to the events of that day. USS Arizona burns and lists after Japanese bombs triggered a massive explosion that ripped through the ship during the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941., NARA In April 1943, the Navy commissioned a Fletcher class destroyer , also known by its hull number DD 661, named after Rear Admiral Kidd. Even at the time of that ship’s delivery, the crew had already adopted Scottish Captain Kidd as a mascot. The first USS Kidd ., USN That Kidd is typically referred as a pirate, but also operated at times as a privateer in service of the French Crown and hunted pirates. He was finally arrested in Boston, in what was then the British colony of Massachusetts, in 1699. He was subsequently sent to England, tried, and eventually executed for piracy and murder in 1701. Tales of his purported buried treasure became a thing of legend and served as the inspiration for songs, books, and actual real-life expeditions hoping to find it. A portrait of the Scottish Captain William Kidd by painter James Thornhill., Public Domain “The crew of the [first] Kidd … had also painted the famed buccaneer’s image high on the forward smokestack,” according to a 2013 edition of the official newsletter of the current USS Kidd . “Not wishing to dishonor the ship’s namesake, however, the crew obtained permission from Mrs. Inez Kidd, widow of RADM Kidd, first.” As it turned out, Kidd’s nickname at the Naval Academy had been “Cap” in reference to Captain Kidd, as well. With help from Mrs. Kidd, the ship’s crew obtained formal permission to both have the Jolly Roger painted on the smokestack and fly the flag. “Subsequently, the Sailors of DD 661 were known to rescue downed aviators in the Pacific Ocean during World War II and return them to their aircraft carrier, for a hefty ransom of ice cream first of course,” the 2013 newsletter says. They also became known as the Pirates of the Pacific. A scan of a contemporary photograph of the crew of the first USS Kidd with a Jolly Roger flag., USN The Navy decommissioned the first USS Kidd in 1946, before returning it to service in 1951 to serve in the Korean War. It remained in service this second time around until 1964 and was finally stricken from the rolls for good in 1974. It is now a museum ship, parked on the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 1981, the service commissioned a new USS Kidd , the first of four destroyers originally built for Iran, which were never delivered to that country owing to the overthrow of the Shah in 1979. This ship inherited the formal approval to fly the Jolly Roger. In 1998, all four Kidd class destroyers were transferred to Taiwan, where they remain in service as the Kee Lung class . The second USS Kidd in 1984., USN The Navy then commissioned the current USS Kidd , a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyer, in 2007. As the latest ship to be named after Rear Admiral Kidd, it now has the official sanction to fly the Jolly Roger. The appearance of the Jolly Roger on Kidd upon its return home comes after the Pentagon issued a new set of policies for the U.S. military as a whole regarding the display of flags and other symbols in July. There had been concerns that this could prohibit ships’ crews from flying the Jolly Roger, among other flags . It remains unclear exactly how those regulations will get applied, but the case of this particular destroyer makes clear that the Navy has the power to give official sanction to such things. The latest USS Kidd at Naval Station Everett flying her Jolly Roger in 2017., USN With all this in mind, we want to congratulate the Pirates of the Pacific on successfully completing their most recent patrol.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 15, 2020",The Air Force’s Secret Next Gen Air Dominance Demonstrator Isn’t What You Think It Is,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been a ton of press about a Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) demonstrator of some type having already been designed and flown even as the program is still supposedly in its conceptual stages. While this sounds exciting, and it is, I think there may be a chasm between reality and what is being circulated even days after the news initially hit. Most importantly, it is very unlikely that this new ‘demonstrator’ is a ‘fighter,’ at least as we would traditionally define it. The e-Plane Revolution The Air Force Wants Let’s start with where this all came from. The news originated from an address from the Air Force’s acquisition chief, Will Roper, to the Air Force Association’s main annual symposium, this year’s iteration being virtual, which was remarkably on-brand for his presentation. In it, he talked about ushering in a new era where rapid design and experimentation of new aircraft and air combat concepts, including the ‘manufacturing’ and ‘flight testing’ of them will occur primarily in the digital realm. An Air Force video presentation stated the following in regards to Boeing and Saab’s T-7 Red Hawk trainer, which has leveraged these concepts in its design and construction: “Can something fly thousands of hours before it takes off, be laid out and assembled hundreds of times before any metal is even cut? Can something be designed, built, and tested, not by thousands of people, but by fewer than 200, using leading-edge design tools across a digital landscape, connected virtually across the globe? It can. It was.” Roper stated the following recently about this concept, as well: “It’s the assembly line, where people are doing work; what work is being done; the machines that do the work; the tooling. All digitally modeled , so you can optimize it,” he said. “You can get expensive tooling out if you can find a better substitute. You can change a process from requiring an artisan with years of training to one requiring a lower skill level.” Weapon systems that use this aggressive digital design philosophy are being given the “e” prefix by the Air Force (the T-7 is now the eT-7, for instance), which is remarkably gimmicky and is likely to be transient in nature as these concepts of design, testing, and construction become widely adopted. This is all part of a larger effort to break the traditional weapons development and procurement mold in order to remain competitive in an era of peer competition from the likes of China and, to some degree, Russia. During his address, Roper went on to note that things have gone beyond the “e-Plane” digital realm for higher-end projects, in particular in regards to the service’s ongoing and notably vague Next Generation Air Dominance initiative , stating: “NGAD right now is designing, assembling, testing, and, in the digital world, exploring things that would have cost us time and money to wait for physical world results… The announcement isn’t that we just built an e-plane and have flown it a lot of times in a virtual world, which we’ve done. But if you think that we don’t care about physical-world results, we do. In fact, NGAD has come so far that the full-scale flight demonstrator has already flown in the physical world… It’s a full-scale flight demonstrator…” Roper didn’t give any other major details about the ‘demonstrator’ as he was only cleared to mention that it existed, but did add that “All I can say is that the NGAD test flights have been amazing… Records have been broken…” Regardless of the lack of details, the metaphorical bomb had been dropped on the aerospace and defense press. Will Roper speaking at a past AFA conference. , USAF The idea that you can design, construct, and test in the digital realm to a degree of fidelity that it is good enough to then leverage advanced rapid prototyping on an aircraft-sized scale to efficiently check that work in the physical world, and then quickly reiterate the process if need be, sounds great. At the same time, it’s hard not to remain at least somewhat skeptical while also questioning just how new and revolutionary this concept actually is. Aircraft and other major weapons programs have increasingly ballooned in cost and schedule over the years, in some cases taking decades to come to fruition. As a result, a number of other catchy quasi-innovations have come and gone in an attempt to transform what is seen as an unsustainable procurement cycle—fiscally, temporally, and strategically speaking. Most notably, the concept of ‘concurrency,’ where you put something into production before testing it—another idea that relied heavily on digital design and testing—has failed miserably on multiple fronts over the last two decades or so. This new “e-Series” fad the Air Force is launching takes a more of a Skunk Works-like approach , but one that puts a heavier premium on the virtual side of things and uses physical manifestations of what happens there mainly to check the digital modeling that has been done. It’s intriguing, but some would argue it is just a natural progression given the state of technology today and the clear unsustainability of traditional modes of shepherding a combat aircraft or other weapon system from a paper requirement to the battlefield. It’s also worth noting that for decades , computer-aided design and simulation have paved the way to a flying prototype. This new concept vastly accelerates the process and redistributes emphasis on digital development over physical development. Even if this isn’t exactly something that is totally new, the fact that the Air Force is making it such a big deal and is actively defining it as its banner weapons development and procurement strategy could help in seeing that it is actually implemented in a successful manner. Is it streamlined and stable enough to realize Roper’s ‘Digital Century Series’ dream , where small batches of aircraft are pumped out in short order to meet a quickly morphing threat equation? We will have to wait and see, but it’s pretty clear he is so excited to tout it that he worked to disclose that it has been used to a successful degree, at least according to him, on arguably the Air Force’s most cutting-edge program. With all that being said, let’s get back to the NGAD demonstrator. Technology Demonstrators I think people are looking at the idea of a ‘demonstrator’ a little differently than they should. Technology demonstrators are used to reduce risk and prove various technologies so that they can be incorporated into an operational system down the line. Technologies demonstrated can include everything from sensor and communications systems to propulsion systems to aerodynamic shaping to low-observable coatings to design and production methods, and more. Often times, a number of these aspects are rolled into a single demonstrator, although that doesn’t make it a prototype of the final product, by any means. We have historical examples of classified technology demonstrators, such as Have Blue and Tacit Blue , the former having paved the way for the F-117 Nighthawk and the latter was key to making the B-2 Spirit a reality and much more. There was also the Bird of Prey that informed many aspects of future Boeing designs, including new construction methods and even visual stealth. Progenitors to the stealthy Black Hawks that would eventually be used to help kill Bin Laden also existed, and the X-44 that helped bring about the RQ-170 Sentinel . There are many, many more that were born in the unclassified realm , as well. Usually, these demonstrators are built for limited flight time and to achieve highly specific goals, and in some cases, they may be part of a series of iterations that improved upon other over time. Northrop’s Tacit Blue technology demonstrator was central to the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX) program and heavily influenced the design of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. , Public Domain As you can see by the examples above, none of the aircraft listed looked exactly like the final product that would emanate from them, in fact, quite the opposite in most cases. But they would all be absolutely essential in bridging the technological divide and proving that the risk of moving forward with some of the technologies they incorporated was worth it. The fact is that there are dozens of highly classified aerospace programs ongoing out of Area 51 and a handful of other clandestine locales at any given time. Some do not involve full-up unitary test articles or flying demonstrators, some do. For the few that have been declassified, there are many, many more we will never know about, some of which are buried in unmarked graves around Groom Lake or stored away for viewing by the special few who are allowed access. It truly is the tale of America’s lost aerospace history, much of which may never be told. This has been the reality for over half a century, one which the Skunk Works ushered in initially. If this has been going on decades ago, back to an age of slide rules and metal structures lording over composites, imagine how fast we can iterate test articles and demonstrators now with the help of digital design, simulation, modern manufacturing, advanced composite materials, and rapid prototyping. Some of those manufacturing methods are as closely guarded secrets as the shape of the aircraft themselves. In fact, entire X-planes and test articles have been built primarily to better understand how to execute new types of composite construction and streamlined manufacturing that leverages advanced computer-aided design and rapid prototyping methods. In other words, just building a demonstrator using these new concepts can often be a major part of a demonstrator program’s goals. All these new methods of designing and assembling aircraft, and especially the progress that has been made in producing so-called ‘out of autoclave’ large composite structures, among other new manufacturing methods, has made producing unique flying vehicles quickly a more attainable proposition than it was decades ago. NGAD isn’t an airplane The future of air combat will be highly cooperative in nature, leveraging advanced networks and intertwined families of disparate aircraft designed to achieve tactical objectives together. It will not be about new do all missions/carry all sensors super fighters. As such, it is only logical, if not essential, that this new way of thinking about aerial warfare has found a fertile medium in the form rapidly fielded demonstrators and test articles used to prove the concepts and technologies behind it. What would be far more troubling and surprising is if there were no NGAD-related demonstrators flying, or at least a demonstrator featuring some of the technologies behind what will be an entire family of new air combat systems related to it. The death of the fighter, at least as we understand it today, is key to this. Spending years designing and building a ‘YF’ prototype of an exquisite new tactical jet, and then putting it into production many years after that prototype first flew, if it even makes it that far at all, is becoming a major enemy to America’s future claim on air superiority. It is this failing internal process that NGAD and the ‘e-Plane’ initiative is aiming at vanquishing just as much as an enemy’s fighter force or air defense network. As such, it is very unlikely that NGAD is a ‘new fighter’ as many have extrapolated it to be. Instead, it will be a system of platforms and underlying shared technologies that will work together seamlessly to break the enemy’s decision cycle and dominate future air wars. Could it include a manned, tailless, supercruising, long-range tactical jet with a relatively large payload? For the few of us that have been begging for this aircraft for many years, on its surface, this would be exciting. And yes, it is possible that something like this may work as one potential component of NGAD, but the hard truth is that capabilities have moved on, and it would serve as just a node in a larger and more diverse ecosystem that will primarily be unmanned . Once again, that is if such an aircraft were to even end up being part of NGAD at all, which seems doubtful at this point. A tailless, fast, long-range, and very stealth manned penetrator has been talked about in recent years as a new ‘fighter,’ especially under the Penetrating Counter-Air and other now-defunct initiatives. The reality is that such an aircraft could be part of a much larger family of platforms, but unmanned technologies and less ‘exquisite,’ but more diverse and plentiful platforms with distributed capabilities are likely to dominate air wars of the future. , Lockheed Martin So, seeing that we are talking about an ecosystem of networked platforms that will share modular sensors and a common communications architecture here, not a new super fighter, we should expect far more demonstrators and test articles now than ever. Even ones that have existed before the NGAD program came to be could potentially be re-roled to support the testing of aspects of the program. As far as I understand it, this type of ‘recycling’ is anything but rare. That being said, could a more mature demonstrator of a tailless, supercruising, long-range quasi-‘fighter’ (in name only, like the B-21 is a ‘bomber’ ) be flying? Yes, it’s possible. But it is unlikely to be a prototype as many have called it and other test articles or demonstrators would support other aspects of the program. Alternatively, maybe a big tailless manned jet like the one so many are projecting onto NGAD, and blindly so, already existed and was simply reused to support NGAD’s objectives, but we have zero evidence of that. Even parts of the B-21 program and other existing clandestine initiatives could have worked to reduce the risk for NGAD, both passively by porting over proven technologies, and actively by being repurposed for the program. X-47B airframe undergoing testing. , Northrop Grumman So, it is not just possible, but probable that the NGAD demonstrator is very different than what most seem to expect it to be. In fact, the entire ‘fighter’ like concept associated with it could be far more of misdirection than reality. The ‘demonstrator’ could actually be an entire family of rapidly prototyped and already developed systems, with the networking and command and control architecture, shared sensors, and weapons being far more of a focus than the airframes themselves. Above all else, it is certain that there is a ton of this type of rapid prototyping and flight testing occurring in the shadows today, well beyond the confines of the NGAD program. The secret nature of these initiatives means that people don’t see them, so it all seems new. Even lumbering testbed aircraft that would traditionally support these new fast-moving ‘system of systems’ programs are likely to be less highly modified and costly to develop compared to their predecessors. Instead of stuffing an entire tactical aircraft’s worth of systems in one surrogate airliner or a business jet, testing functions could be spread across multiple, less elaborately modified testbed platforms that can perform various other duties for multiple programs. This would accelerate the testing process and makes configuration changes far less troublesome. By testing different avionics on different test aircraft, either on flying test articles or testbeds, and then incorporating them together on a flying demonstrator, or flying demonstrators, to test different configurations, a far more flexible and streamlined model emerges. Also, as mentioned earlier, it is highly likely that any new family of airframes associated with the NGAD program will share sensors and communications systems, so integrating them together all on one aircraft would be counterproductive in some ways compared to the past when it was all about the development of a single do-all combat aircraft. The CATB testbed for the F-35’s avionics. , USAF In fact, some components of the future air combat architecture may be just flying sensor nodes or carry no sensors at all. Instead, they would rely on the network tying together distributed capabilities to provide a far richer information set remotely. In the past, this information would have been more limited and less reliable in nature, as it would have been provided organically by a smaller number of high-value platforms. This new approach allows for a far more resilient, modular, and cost-effective combat force, one in which every tactical aircraft doesn’t need a full suite of sensors installed at all times. You can read more about the migration to a distributed aerial sensor network in this past piece of ours . No Choice But To Change Using rapid iterations of test articles to define requirements and then move to a more complex family of technology demonstrators later on is dictated by the strategic issues of our time as much as it is by cutting-edge manufacturing and design capabilities. The F-35 saga has taught everyone that the old way of doing things is a losing proposition going forward, even with skipping major steps via concurrency. By the time the system is fielded, it is already mismatched to the realities of the threats that exist and too much opportunity cost has been spent on it to deem it a worthy investment. Also, betting everything on one or two fighter designs for air superiority for half a century or more has now become an almost laughable premise. So, adopting a Skunk Works-like model , which is all about getting to a prototype/demonstrator as fast as possible, for the development of this new family of aircraft seems to have offered the Air Force a potential new path forward. It’s one that is not without its own risks, but it could break the service’s damning addiction to traditional, and crippling, combat aircraft development and procurement structures. Northrop Grumman The thing is, these ideas are now becoming mainstream, but five years ago I laid them all out and much more in granular detail in this past feature of mine. The technology has not been the limiter here, it has overwhelmingly been the cultural, political, and commercial tailwinds within and external to the Air Force. So, if anything, Will Roper and the Air Force brass should be commended for aiming for a revolution in a space where few others have ever succeeded in realizing a similar breakthrough. Then again, the reality is that the sustainability of American air superiority over its peers has become so dire that there really isn’t a choice. It’s literally become a factor of change or die. So, the bottom line is two-fold. First off, the combat Air Force of the future is going to look drastically different than what it has looked like for decades past. As a result, we are likely entering into the twilight of the age in which the fighter reigns supreme within the air combat domain. Second, and most importantly, is that if the USAF wasn’t testing its best future air combat hunches and different aspects of the complex ecosystem of technologies that will support its designs on the future of air dominance with flying demonstrators, that would be highly troubling. But it’s still nice to get a confirmation of what we should already know.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Retired fighter pilot Dan Robinson and his team at Red 6 are working to revolutionize the way military pilots train for air combat, and possibly much more, by harnessing advances in augmented reality (AR). They are working to replace adversary aircraft that have to physically fly against fighter pilots—at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars an hour—with computer-generated projections displayed in front of the trainee’s eyes as they fly their aircraft through the air. If Red 6 is successful, the technology could bleed into many other areas of air combat training and move to other domains, as well, such as to the warfighter on land and at sea. In doing so, it would disrupt entire marketplaces and many traditional, long-held training techniques and procedures. The potential savings and flexibility that the Red 6 concept brings to the fight are so massive that the Air Force is already working with the small company to move the idea forward. Still, major cultural hurdles are likely to supersede technological ones, but their timing couldn’t be better. As America’s flying force is faced with having to innovate at a far quicker pace than ever before in order to counter ballooning threats from China and Russia, AR-enabled air combat training is exactly the type of technology the Air Force brass say they aren’t only interested in, but that may be key to America’s future ability to provide air supremacy during a major conflict. Dan Robinson, CEO of Red 6. , Mike Killian We talked with Dan Robinson at length to provide the most in-depth look at where Red 6 came from, what it is trying to achieve, and where it could be going in the not so distant future. Here is that interview: Ty: Can you tell us a bit about your background Dan and how you came up with this concept? Dan: I was an RAF [U.K. Royal Air Force] fighter pilot for 10 years or so. I graduated Fighter Weapons School, and I was lucky enough to be the first non-American to fly F-22s for the U.S. Air Force. And I wasn’t just the first non-American, I was one of the first kind of cadre of guys that were on the first operational squadron, so right at the very beginning of the program, which was obviously a huge privilege, but tremendous insight into an astonishing platform and the capabilities thereof. It also showed some of the real limitations associated not just with that platform, but with the broader combat air force… Namely, training, which ultimately leads us to where we are. Dan flying the F-22 Raptor. , @red6CEO So, in simple terms, every time we go fly and train, we need someone to go fly and train against, and that’s a multi-billion dollar a year problem. It wasn’t being solved back in 2006 to 2009, and it’s only gotten worse since then. It’s a problem for a number of reasons. A, the outright cost. It’s obviously extremely expensive to provide it. B, we’re critically short on guys and girls on the front line because it’s hard to find us, hard to train us, and hard to keep us. I would say that, critically, whilst we’ve been involved in conflicts in the Middle East in the last 20 years or so, two things have happened, geopolitically. You’ve seen the re-emergence of Russia onto the world’s stage as a state actor and proliferation of technology coming out of there, which is credible, particularly when it comes to IADs (integrated air defenses) and next generation airplanes . And I think most importantly of all, of course, is the rise of China and the pace of innovation coming out of China. I think China has historically been very good at copying technology and I think we’ve seen a definite shift to innovation and a systematic engagement of the industrial base around a long-term strategy… Whereas before, we didn’t really have any near-peer threats, it’s fair to say that some of the platforms and the capabilities coming out of China are certainly near-peer and in some instances are downright scary . And if we’re not scared of it, we are wrong, we should be and we should be doing everything we can to counter that. So, that’s significant because in the F-22, even if we could generate the numbers of airplanes, platforms, and pilots to do it, how do we train, truly train, against near-peer threats? The likes of J-20 or Su-57 , things like that. That was a problem that I really was passionate about solving. F-22 Raptor firing an AIM-120 AMRAAM. , USAF As it happens, life would take me in a meandering direction to Red 6. So I left, went to business school, worked in finance for a while, grew a business in the U.K., sold the business in the U.K., and kept coming back to this problem of adversary air, and how do we solve it? Now, as a happen-chance, there was a serendipitous series of events that brought me back to California and I started thinking about the problem again. Unrelated to the problem at the time, I decided I was going to build my own airplane, and I set about building an airplane, which is an experimental airplane, called a Berkut , and that’s a separate story in itself and one for over a beer maybe, but suffice to say that life was absolutely telling me to build that airplane. In the midst of building that airplane, two individuals literally walked into my life. Both with rich backgrounds in augmented reality and virtual reality. One of them, in particular, had pulled off a world’s first, I think back in 2015, in VR. Dan in his still very much under construction Berkut 540. , @Red6CEO And I should pause to ask here, do we understand the distinction between virtual reality and augmented reality? And if not I could cover it really quickly. Ty: Absolutely, but why don’t you just cover it in your own words so we can set up for what’s coming. Dan: Okay. So virtual reality, we go into an entirely different world. You and I sitting together, we put our headsets on and we could be in the Bahamas, kite surfing, or whatever it is. Think Holodeck Star Trek type stuff. Augmented reality is a much more complex problem to solve because what we try to do is put virtual entities into the real world that interact with our surroundings as if they were a part of the real world, and that’s a very difficult set of technical problems to solve. Back in 2015, going back to the guys, one of the guys had pulled off a world first in VR. They took a real race car, put a real race car driver in it, on a real race track in one location, concurrently in a separate location, they took another driver, another car, and another racetrack, and at the same time, both of these drivers went into a virtual world that was created for them and raced race cars against each other. I mean real race cars, against each other, blind, completely blind to the outside world. So they met each other in a volcanic, ashen, molten landscape and raced these real cars around this landscape in VR, which was stunning. As soon as I saw that, the light bulb went off for me. I started connecting dots and I asked two simple questions. One was, “Guys, is that possible in airplanes?” To which they scratched their heads for a little while and came back with a, “Yes, technically challenging, but we think we could do it.” The next question I asked, and the reason I explained VR versus AR is, “Okay, no one is going to allow fighter pilots to fly around in a virtual world blind to the outside world in VR. So is this possible in AR?” And they looked at me as if I was crazy and said, “Absolutely not.” And I said, “Why?” And they said, “Because augmented reality doesn’t work outdoors and it doesn’t work in dynamic environments.” Long story short, I kept asking why, until we came up with a thesis, which was a different approach to how traditional players do AR that we felt would work. I then got excited because the idea I was obviously coming up with was, if I can synthetically inject virtual entities into the real world, up in the sky, and have them maneuver in relation to airplanes, real airplanes, then why would we ever need to put another physical asset, pilot, fuel, logistics up in the sky again? Now, that’s a vision, right? That’s obviously a little ways off, but it’s a vision that is within the realms of possibility for sure. So, I knew if we could pull this off, we were gonna change the future of how our combat air forces and beyond will train. With that in mind, very quickly, I called the Air Force’s AFWERX up and I said, “Hey, you guys remember me? Well, I think I can save you billions of dollars a year, solve your Red Air training shortage and your pilot shortage as well, and allow you to train against any near-peer threats. And here’s how… ” They were obviously skeptical, but intrigued. They said, “Go speak to the Air Force Research Laboratory.” So, I called up the Air Force Research Laboratory and said, “Hey guys, this is us,” and they started telling us about LVC [Live Virtual Constructive training] and the work they were doing with the SLATE program, which was extremely encouraging. As I started studying LVC, I realized that it absolutely was aligned with what we’re doing, and it was aligned with what we’re doing because of one of the critical limitations of LVC. A Live Virtual Constructive is a 50% solution. Why is that? Because it’s a beyond visual range solution only [not for dogfighting within visual range] .. . And as soon as those synthetic entities, be they virtual or constructive, get within the sort of five to 10 nautical mile range where the pilot starts transitioning from the tactician to the fist-fighter, and he puts his or her head out the window, there’s nothing there. Then the whole training solution collapses. Why is that? Because there’s no way of synthetically putting those entities into the field of view of the pilot. Why is that? Because so far augmented reality certainly hasn’t worked outdoors or in dynamic environments and it absolutely hasn’t worked outdoors in dynamic environments at multiple hundreds of miles an hour up in the sky in three dimensions. So, when I listened to the LVC guys and I said, “Well, here’s what we’re building,” they couldn’t believe it. They said, “Guys, we’ve been looking for this for over five years, no one is doing this. Is it true?” And I said, “Well, right now it’s a… We think so. We have a thesis and we’re getting ready to build this out.” And so they partnered with us, through AFWERX and they set us up with two challenges. Firstly, just go prove that your approach toward augmented reality will work, initially in an airplane, firstly on the static environment on the ground. We had a ground demonstration back in February of 2019 where we invited a bunch of folks from the Air Force’s Test Pilot School, Research Lab, and Weapons School, they all came to see us and they sat in our airplane. This experimental airplane that I happened to be building became our test platform, and they were able to fly an augmented reality tanking sortie, and then go fight a couple of Russian Su-57s. It was a clunky prototype demo at the time, but it proved that our thesis was indeed possible. So, the next challenge they gave us was, “Okay, obviously go prove that this works up in the air.” And so that was targeted for November of 2019, and the Test Pilot School said, “Look, guys, these are big claims you’re making, so let’s do a crawl, walk, run approach. Initially what we’d like you to do is to prove that you can just fix a static object up in space and we can maneuver in relation to it as if it were a real object.” So, we became known for this three-dimensional cube that we’ve got floating around the skies of Southern California, and it’s a 500-foot by 500-foot cube and it’s framed with no sides for a reason I’ll get to here in a second. We technically actually achieved that in August of last year and whilst from a developmental test and engineering perspective, I knew that that was gonna be extremely significant to both engineers and developmental test pilots, I knew that from an operational perspective, pilots would understand airplanes flying around, and so I pushed the team really hard, and in doing so, we cracked the problem. Setting up the giant virtual floating cube., Red 6 video screencap When the guys came out for the demo in November of 2019, we took them up in a real airplane we flew them to the cube and the cube is amazing, and as we get there, it’s a big old cube floating in space. As we get closer, it gets bigger, as we fly around it we can observe aspect changing, size changing. I mentioned it was a wire-framed cube with no sides, that was for a very particular reason because I wanted to demonstrate the truly immersive nature of this technology. What that means is we were able to fly through the cube, and this cube surrounds the airplane as you go through it, and it’s so compelling that as you fly your airplane, through this virtual cube that doesn’t exist, I’m careful not to hit the wings of the airplane on the sides of the cube, which sounds ridiculous, but it demonstrates the immersive nature of the technology. So, we came off the cube and everyone was really excited. It was a big, big win for us, and then I was delighted to say, “Well, that’s not all, so now come and see this,” and we did an intercept on a virtual KC-46 tanker, and we pulled up alongside a virtual tanker flying around the sky, and it looked and felt like a real big old airplane sitting next to us as we pulled up in formation. On its wing was an F-22, and then we slid around the back, we dropped into a pre-contact position, and there was a boom hanging off the back of the tanker and we drove that boom into the airplane that I was flying. It was so accurate that I can drive the boom of that tanker into my head inside the cockpit. Dan’s Berkut 540 works as a testbed for Red 6 tech. Here is a rendering of it pulling up behind a virtual KC-46 tanker. , Red 6 screencap It was absolutely stunning. So we did the world’s first-ever augmented reality refueling training sortie. Then we came off that and we did an intercept on an Su-57 and we did the very beginnings of a dogfight against an Su-57 just flying around in augmented reality up in the sky. When they all saw that, everyone was stunned. We were transitioned immediately to a SBIR Phase II with the Air Force and then invited out to the Weapons and Tactics Conference, which is held at now in I think this was in January or February of this year. So we went out to the Weapons and Tactics Conference. We got to sit down with a new chief and a bunch of senior folks, and we took a bunch of generals flying, a bunch of colonels flying. To an individual, they were all stunned and blown away with what we’d done. So much so that they invited us out to ACC [Air Combat Command] earlier in the year and now the Air Force is transitioning us to a SBIR Phase III, and so we’re the first company in AFWERXs history to make it to a SBIR Phase III, which is extremely exciting. The Berkut 560 cockpit and the AR visor that projects imagery in front of the pilot’s eyes. , Red6CEO I should say concurrently, we were also demonstrating the technology to a bunch of industry partners, all of the big ones. I think most prominent of all was the Skunk Works out of Lockheed Martin. I think that was the most nerve-racking demo for us, as well, because we thought Skunk Works would come along with all of their tech and the programs they’re working on, and they’d look at us and laugh and pat us on the head and say, “That’s a cute demo guys, but here’s how we really do it in Skunk Works,” and on the contrary, they were blown away. They said, “No, guys. Holy Moly. This is far away ahead of anything we’ve seen out there.” And so with that, then Lockheed Martin started showing an interest in us, and after a series of about five-six months of negotiations, we just closed an investment from Lockheed Martin into Red 6, which has a number of strategic benefits, not least access to fifth-generation platforms and beyond. So, you join us right at this time now where I’ve literally just come back from Fort Worth, Texas having met with Lockheed and talking about plans moving forward together, and it’s a really exciting phase. Ty: There are very few times that I’ve seen technology, including the leading edge of consumer technology, and the needs of the military converging together for something like this. I’m a VR user myself. I try to keep up with it. Nothing, obviously, as advanced as this, but this solves so many problems that it’s kind of amazing where it could go so fast. One of the biggest air combat training issues that we talk about often is the target saturation issue the Air Force and the Navy are facing in terms of red air training. They have aircraft like advanced 5th generation fighters, and even upgraded 4th generation ones, with pilots in the cockpit that are not challenged enough with the number and capability of the adversaries they put in the air to fight against them. So, obviously, augmenting the tangible aggressor aircraft that are out there is probably a huge part of this, right? Instead of putting up a 4 vs 8, which is quite a large adversary air training mission, you could theoretically put up a 4 vs 30 and it wouldn’t cost any more money to do. Is that a major area that you’re looking at, the augmentation area, where you add additional airborne threats to those that are actually there, not just the replacement of all of them? Dan: Absolutely, because there are two observations you made, which are really astute, and one is the intersection of commercial and DoD. If I can just talk to that first before I come back to the saturation issue, it’s important because I think one of the reasons that everyone has lamented the sort of… The struggle that AR has had to be adopted is frankly, there are a bunch of technical challenges to it, but AR is fundamentally an indoor solution only. I can put a pink elephant on your table and it can dance around, it’s cool for a second, but who gives a shit? Ultimately, AR is an interesting technology, looking for a home. It’s a solution in search of a problem, and one of the key aspects to AR being adopted for a mass consumer market is it has to be mobile in nature, which means it has to work outside and it has to work on the move. There are a bunch of other technical challenges to solving that for the consumer, right? Not least of which price point, power, GPU, CPU, all that kind of stuff. But this is a big step forward, so that’s the first thing. Backing into your other point, which is the intersection of this, because even if that technology did work for the consumer, what would they truly use it for, right? And a bunch of folks, I mean VR is obvious, but a bunch of folks have applied a lot of thought to this, and what is fundamentally the use case for AR right now? It’s difficult to answer that, right? You can give generalizations, but to be very specific, it’s difficult. What we have here, and I think this is really key to what you were pointing out, is we have an incredibly compelling use case into which there is an acutely defined pain point, into which we have said that AR now finds a home because AR can solve this problem directly. I think that’s one thing that sets us apart massively. Dan flying with the AR display unit attached to his helmet. , @Red6CEO That leads directly to the second part of the question, which was saturation of the targeteering. Yeah, we can replace obviously the red air entities out there, but I think for any kind of high-intensity war-fighting, you are quite right, we need to be able to replicate that A, the technical sophistication level, but B, the intensity and saturation and numbers that are physically out there. I think it’s really important to do that because if you think about the conflicts we’ve been in in the Middle East, it’s almost as the West assumed like air dominance is our preordained natural right, and on the contrary, it’s not that at all. So whilst we’ve suffered terrible, tragic casualties on the ground in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, they would be exponentially worse if we did not have control of the air, and we’ve always had control of the air. Then you start looking at, well, what does a near-peer adversary conflict look like? Like China, let’s say in the South China Sea, somewhere like that, where we’re penetrating airspace. You bet your ass we’re gonna have to go fight and get control of the air, and we are going to be outnumbered and they’re going to be on a technical par with us. So the ability to not just emulate threats accurately that are relevant and current, but provide them in sufficient numbers is a key value proposition of this technology. So I think you’re absolutely right. Ty: Why the numerical superiority issue is so big, especially with what we’ve discussed and what I talk about a lot in terms of the China scenario, people just have no idea really what this looks like. China knows it can flood a zone with throw-away old MiG-21 and F-7 drones that are flying just to some point to crash, all in an attempt to complicate the tactical air picture. This is, in addition, to their vast numerical superiority as we would be fighting in their backyard. This is all part of their tactics base, and so a lot of times when we talk to people that are in the red air business, their eyes kind of glaze over when we discuss this because it’s such a hard threat to replicate and to actually present to fleet pilots. So it seems, as far as replacing all red air, obviously that’s a technological leap, but it may be closer than anyone wants to admit. It also sounds like you’re already pretty far on a path to showing that instead of using an F-16 to replicate a Su-57 or a J-20, you can actually build the thing in software and present it in AR and it’s going to be accurate to what we think the threat actually is, but also just saturating these pilots with confusing sets of problems in their situational picture to make it where it’s a real challenge, and it’s not just like clubbing baby seals. Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And you’re exactly right. What you’re talking about is a targeting picture. And targeting is complex in nature, especially when you’re doing high-intensity warfighting, it’s very, very difficult, and it’s an extremely perishable skill that we need to be able to train to. And you’re dead, right, the numbers problem is really, really important. Russia’s Su-57 Felon., Russian MoD Ty: Do you see your concept as a threat to the ballooning adversary air market , or do you see it as an added plus? How do you situate yourself in what is a growing market that is actually putting jets on the ramp and putting them in the air at $15,000 an hour under the banner of saving the government money? At the same time, it sounds like you’re saying, well, I can do it for the cost of software and a helmet-mounted display and some data links. Dan: Yeah, I am. So I’m keen to stay away from language like threatening, adversary, and stuff like that, but if we look at it objectively, I think right now, there is a massive market for everyone to play in, and I think the adversary air aircraft and the private contractors and all that kinda stuff have a very important role to play. But I don’t think it’s ultimately a sustainable solution, and I don’t think in any way, shape, or form they can provide the quantity or the quality and the relevancy of the training that we can do through leveraging this technology. So, it’s an extremely disruptive technology for sure, and I think right now there’s room for everyone to play in this market, but what I’m doing is playing to where I think, to quote Wayne Gretzky, “I’m playing to where I think the puck is going.” And I think my vision is this, even if we did have the numbers to put up all of these adversary aircraft, what we haven’t talked about is the opportunity cost of doing that. So every time a fighter pilot goes up pretending to be a MiG-29 or a J-20, whatever they’re doing, they’re not doing what they should be doing which is training to be blue air. When we are short of fighter pilots, that is an extreme opportunity cost that we’re incurring every single day. What I believe we should be doing is, every single sortie we fly as fighter pilots in the west, should be a blue air sortie. If we can leverage the technology to provide ample and relevant red air training, why would we ever want to put another physical asset up there in the future? Now I’m painting a vision, right? I understand that between there and that vision, there is obviously scope for everyone to play for the time being, but I am really playing to where I think the market is going. And no one understood this technology. We’re the first company in the world to pull it off. So no one was even thinking about what is within the realm of possibility. The private adversary air support market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with private contractors fielding fleets of dozens of supersonic, radar-equipped fighters for fleet pilots to spar with. Here is one of Draken International’s Mirage F-1s. , Draken International The reality of it is, I want every time I go up and fly, I wanna be doing a Blue Air sortie and then, to give you context, I was an instructor pilot on the F-22. If I wasn’t teaching, I would say 80% of my flying was providing Red Air for the guys that were going through upgrades or whatever it was. That’s incredibly frustrating because the training value… Yeah, I’m flying a Raptor, but it’s not really good training value, it’s not what we should be doing. So, if we’re limited in resources and there is capital rationing, constrained budgets and all that kind of stuff, the question is, how do we provide Red Air efficiently and I think we stand alone in our ability to be able to do that. I think that’s what’s really exciting about what we’ve cracked. Ty: Absolutely, absolutely. So, I’m an Air Force, and I think this is really cool. What do I need to purchase it? What hardware and software are required? What do I need to make this happen for my pilots? Obviously, many fighter aircraft, including dedicated aggressors , are flying with helmet-mounted displays of all degrees of complexity , some quite simple, some more advanced , that are augmented reality devices to a lesser degree than what you’re discussing. How can you fold it into the hardware that already exists or, if not, what do you need to make it happen? Dan: There are certain limitations to what I can obviously discuss about how we do it, but let’s just say the system is designed around four key modules. It is designed to be platform-agnostic and it can integrate into any system. Ultimately, what the pilot cares about is the display technology and the ability to visualize this stuff and, of course, we want this technology to sit within the OFP [Operational Flight Program] of the airplane or within the embedded training systems of the airplane, things like that, such that it integrates with the weapon systems onboard. 64th Aggressor Squadron F-16s lineup at Nellis AFB before a mission. Red 6’s technology could drastically augment existing aggressor forces and provide some capabilities they simply cannot. , USAF And then, in terms of the deliverables… We’re not delivering helmets or anything like that, but we are delivering a fairly unique display tech that has the ability to do all of the projection of all of the targeting symbology, and way better than anything out there right now that does it. But in addition to that, it’s presenting 3D holographic images, as well, because you have to remember, we’re not providing targeting solutions here. We’re not doing head-up displays. So, when people use the term AR and they’re talking about how helmet-mounted cueing systems , that’s not what we’re doing. We’re aiming to simulate human vision. The demands of human vision, it’s a harsh mistress because it’s very exacting. So, let me give you an example. The current F-35 helmet has round about a 35-degree field of view in terms of the display tech and there’s a number of technical reasons why that is the case, and the latency, frankly, is pretty crap. You have to remember it’s 10 to 15-year-old technology, as well. Our second version of our prototype, right now, is sitting at a 105 degrees field of view and the deliverable that we’re working on pretty soon is 150 degrees field of view. Now, human vision is out at 180 degrees. We are pushing it out to those realms and so, ultimately, the display tech is A, extremely difficult to do and you just look across the AR market at what’s out there, go look at a HoloLens 2 or a Magic Leap . It’s really difficult to do, but it is absolutely critical to presenting the right picture to the individual in the cockpit. And then, the other parts of the system that have to do with tracking and obviously, the game engine itself as to how it displays and does all the video. There are the simulations and all that kind of stuff, but it’s all platform agnostic. It can plug and play into any airplane. Ty: So, I’m an F-35 operator. I put on your display. There’s some other black boxes, right, like anything else? Dan: Yeah. Ty: I go out there and now, I’m not wearing my normal HMD, but I’m now able to execute these training sorties where that same symbology I would see normally in my HMD would be also presented in your forward vision. Is that correct, in your display system that you would provide? Dan: Absolutely, and not only that, the symbology would make sense. It would interact with the virtual entity. Ty: Right. Dan: In the same way that it does with LVC. Ty: It wouldn’t mean changing to a whole new symbology architecture or anything else? Dan: Yeah, no, it’d just be the same. But it would be presented in a way more compelling way, with much higher brightness, field of view, fidelity and lower latency as well. Dan wearing an earlier prototype AR visor. , Red6CEO Ty: Cost-wise, one of the issues with the AR market and the VR market, to be honest with you, is money, right? These things are very expensive to develop. Do you see the potential for the AR market at large to really make a massive leap? If the government were to say, “Hey, Red 6. Yeah, we’re gonna spend millions of dollars helping you make this thing unbelievably effective,” would those same advances trickle down into the commercial space? Dan: Yeah, I think absolutely. When you look at the consumer market for AR… I’m pretty straightforward with it. I don’t think there is a consumer market for AR right now. But I do believe the AR consumer market is coming. And when it arrives, I think it represents the single biggest inflection point in how we share and interact with our information since computers went into cellphones. So, when that explodes, it’s a trillion-dollar market. We should be paying attention to Microsoft, and we should be paying attention to Apple and Tim Cook because they’re all going for it, right? But there are a number of technical challenges to get there. So, when that inflection point arrives, it’s gonna be massive. The question is, for AR companies out there, when that inflection points arrive? A, are you still alive? B, have you got the technology that’s relevant? And C, have you solved the right problems to take your place in that overall ecosystem? And I think what we have is the right strategy through DoD largely driven by such a compelling use case that affords us an opportunity to work on technology that is absolutely leading edge for the warfighter, that directly parlays into a broader consumer vision of AR when that market opportunity arrives, which it will arrive. And so, yeah, I think you’re exactly right. DoD, as the customer, is the right way to do it, and I think you’re seeing that being reflected in the big AR players out there, like Microsoft and even Magic Leap. For all of the problems they’ve gone through, Magic Leap is way late in figuring this out because their strategy was incoherent, but Microsoft is chasing an enterprise market with HoloLens, because there’s no consumer market out there right now. How can you justify selling a headset at $3,800 to someone that’s gonna wear it once or twice, and certainly not gonna be able to use it outdoors. You can’t. So enterprise is the right route to a successful AR future, and within enterprise, I think DoD is a specific customer base that is crying out for AR, and AR can actually solve many real problems. Ty: On the many problems front, what comes to mind is, we’re talking adversary air, air-to-air combat, but you mentioned tanking, and obviously there are plenty of other mission sets that could be applicable to this technology, such as air-to-ground training. Then, as the tech evolves over time, you could probably build much more complex environments to help tailor what the mission would be down to probably the environment itself. And then there’s the ground side of things. Soldiers on the ground could potentially use this same sort of technology and probably get a lot out of it in a similar manner. Where do you see the very long-end of this going? You talk about the warfighter, is this going to be something where a soldier on the ground with a rifle is going to be using it as much as a guy flying an F-22 in the decades to come? Dan: Yeah, I’m smiling because it’s absolutely the right question to ask, and it’s indeed on our roadmap. We can talk training, for sure, but we also talk operations, as well. My vision is, yes, in the same way that we’re doing this for the aviators, we don’t go to war just as an air force, right? We operate across multiple domains as a joint force, and so, what we need to have is situational awareness, we all have to have the same situational awareness. Just let me give you an example, if there’s a special forces guy on the ground calling in an attack on, let’s say, a tank, or a farmhouse, or something like that, and it’s a training scenario, well, wouldn’t it be great if that tank was synthetically generated and the guy on the ground is in our AR system, talking to the individual up in his airplane that’s about to drop a smart bomb on that tank or something like that? Wouldn’t it be great if they could see the same common picture within the augmented world? And we’re calling that the joint augmented battlespace because you’re exactly right. We’re solving, probably the most complex challenge of all, because airplanes flying around at multiple hundreds of miles an hour in three dimensions, well, if we’ve solved it for that we’ve certainly solved it for a tank, a boat, whatever it is on the ground. The ability to connect those individuals together is something that represents a truly exciting and massive market opportunity. And it doesn’t stop there. I touched upon it a little earlier because I think whilst there are massive training applications for this, there are also massive operational applications through this technology. Let me give you an example, guys and girls on the ground fighting for their lives trying to call in close air support . For the individual in the cockpit that’s about to press that button, that’s a tremendous amount of stress, especially if they’re in a sort of danger-close scenario, right where there are troops in contact. You want to make sure that you get that right. So, we all just used the traditional ‘nine line’ to call in close air support, and stuff like that. Well, what if we were connected in an augmented world? And, we could paint targets on the ground, bad guys and good guys clearly delineated through whatever visuals you wish to use. It would take away ambiguity, it would shorten the kill chain massively, and it would absolutely save lives, and there are multiple applications that we could think of and discuss, but I think there are huge operational aspects for this tech as well. Ty: And the data link infrastructure is obviously progressing quite fast on the other side of things. Dan: Yeah. Ty: That isn’t really related at this time to what you’re doing directly, but, you can imagine them being able to plug in together to be able to send those, using a common waveform, to be able to send that information back and forth, where everybody sort of has the same picture, or at least the information that they needed at the time they need it. Dan: Yeah, you’re absolutely right. And data links in those communications are massive, massive pieces of this, but, of course, there are tons of companies out there that are doing the Lord’s work in that, and it’s just about getting the right partners. JTACs work with A-10s during a close air support exercise., USAF Ty: So the Red Air market is kind of blowing up right now, and we’re also seeing the JTAC [forward air controller] training marketplace becoming pretty hot . When you think of things, you’re mastering sort of the air realm of AR. Have you looked at JTAC training? Because, they’re also putting up aircraft that’s burning thousands of dollars an hour up, flying above them, to do something that’s fairly rudimentary compared to air-to-air combat. Dan: We are absolutely discussing it. We understand the market opportunity there, as well. It is simply having bandwidth within the existing team and obviously that requires us to bring more resources in. One of the big priorities for me this year is to go out and raise our series A round of financing. This will enable us to do that, but of course, things like the SBIR Phase III from the Air Force are immensely helpful, as well. Ty: In terms of the T-X , well the T-7 Red Hawk now , the USAF is putting a lot of money into it and really wants to fully change its training apparatus and how it works, lowering the amount of time that a pilot takes to get into an actual operational unit. A lot of that will be centered around getting the basic training down in a different manner than what existed in the old training pipeline. Do you see a student as being able to go out and learn formation keeping with a tanker via using your AR solution? What about learning the primary elements of basic fighter maneuvers (BFM, aka dogfighting)? Do you think it’s going be applicable to the primary military pilot training market too, in addition to the advanced training one? Having F-35 or F-22 pilots going-up against synthetic bad guys is one thing, but what about the lower-end training spectrum? Dan: Yeah, again, I’m smiling, because you’re asking all my favorite questions. The simple answer is yes, we are doing that. Because whilst the genesis of this was to solve red air, we immediately started figuring out very quickly that, oh my gosh, this has massive applications for how we physically produce pilots… Once you get past the, “Here’s how to fly an airplane up, down, left, right,” most of the flying done in the military is tactical, so you’re flying with someone else. T-7 Red Hawk., Boeing So, every time you go up to practice formation, you need someone to formate on. One of the scenarios we’re working on right now is tactical formation for a T-38. And we’re actually doing our first integration into an air force platform later in the year, Q4 of this year I think we commence it, into T-38s to start looking at exactly the problems you talked about. How can we get guys and girls to work with a tanker? How can we teach them basic formation, tactical formation? How can we teach them strafe patterns, things like that? Even within BFM, the ability to, for example, draw the flight paths of the bandits that their flying against, and draw turn circle entries and control zones and things like that. If you can imagine it and you can think there’s a value proposition, then it can be done because it’s simply code. And so, yeah, we’re certainly focusing heavily on that, and I think you’ll see us integrating into T-38, T-6s, and then into tactical airplanes, as well. Ty: One thing that I know readers are going to ask, especially those that are not as familiar with the VR and AR space and with the whole red air capacity situation that we’re in right now, is why can’t the Air Force just build more simulators?  What does Red 6 give you that a full-dome simulator can’t? Dan: Yeah, absolutely. So I’ll say this. I think simulators play an incredibly important role in the training of a fighter pilot. They’re very good for repetitive tasks. They’re very good for process-driven tasks. But what simulators cannot simulate or emulate in any way, shape or form is the cognitive load on an operator when they’re out there physically flying an airplane, when they can run out of fuel, pull G force, be shot at, their lives at risk. It fundamentally changes the name of the game. We always joke you can be Chuck Yeager everyday in a simulator when you know that you’re just gonna step outside, and it’s basically, in essence, a big video game, right? But when you’re flying that airplane for real and your under all of that stress, that cognitive stress, that physical duress, and you put your helmet on, we say you lose 50% of your brain capacity. And when you close the canopy, you lose the other 50%. Flying airplanes is a fundamentally different proposition to flying in a simulator. And so what we’ve done here is we’re acknowledging that live flight has to happen, and I don’t think you’re gonna get anyone that’s gonna argue that otherwise, once informed. We understand that simulators are of a big value proposition. What we’ve identified is a spot in the middle that no one has thought of yet. What I want to do is every… I come back to it as every time we fly… If we accept that we have to fly, which we do, every time we fly, we should be giving our warfighters absolute goodness of training. It should be relevant, it should be blue air, and they should be out there doing those things for real. So, I don’t think we’re replacing simulators at all, but I don’t think simulators can offer anywhere near what we can offer in terms of the physical realities of flying high-performance airplanes. Ty: What are the roadblocks? What are the challenges to getting this where it needs to be, where it’s effective? Can we get to a point where the Weapons School can say, “Hey, we wanna build a J-20 adversary,” and it’s a case of a software engineer building that aircraft to their specifications and then fighting it in AR? How do we get to that point? Dan: Look, I think there are obvious technical challenges, right? This is leading-edge technology, and it’s extremely encouraging, and we’re getting really good results. But, of course, integrations, we’re inevitably gonna come across a speed bump. That’s just a given. I think the single biggest thing that I worry about is actually a cultural issue. What I mean by that is the Air Force is making great strides through Dr. Roper and senior leadership to really embrace innovation. AFWERX is a great case in point. What we tend to find, and this will come as no surprise to you, is it’s the frozen middle where you come up against those cultural roadblocks and barriers to entry and people that are reluctant to change because we’ve always done it this way. The thing I worry about, I think, perhaps most of all is that we need to innovate and we need to innovate quickly, rapidly. We need to fail fast , learn the lesson, and move on all the time. Because that’s what the Chinese are doing and they’re eating our lunch. If we don’t have a culture that embraces innovation and incentivizes innovation at every level of the military, then we are going to leave a bunch of value on the table, and we’re never going to be a truly innovative service. I believe the service leadership at the top want it. I believe Dr. Roper, through AFWERXs and a bunch of other initiatives, is doing fantastic work. Absolutely fantastic. I believe the warfighters on the ground want it. Generally, where you find sort of roadblocks is in the frozen middle management. It’s not something that is certainly insurmountable. It can all be overcome. It’s just we want to move with the speed of heat because we need to move at the speed of heat, and so I would encourage leadership at all levels to just really embrace a culture of innovation. @Red6CEO The private sector is just able to move so much quicker than DoD. I was asked a question once by a senior general in the Air Forces, “How fast can you go with this technology?” And my answer was, “As fast as you’ll let us.” Because we’re certainly not going to be the ones that are delaying progress on this stuff. So, I think that’s the single biggest risk and thing that we have to be concerned about and make sure we get right. TR: That’s something I’ve talked about continuously, especially in the unmanned space , the resistance. With all the platitudes that exist within the Air Force about unmanned technology, there is a resistance. And in the Navy, for that matter, as well. There’s a key resistance when it comes to eliminating pilots, but not for the lower end stuff that isn’t sexy. But when you talk about potentially removing fighter pilots from cockpits in any way, it doesn’t matter if it’s AR or if it’s unmanned technology, there seems to be a massive cultural hurdle, and progress is stymied even though the technology clearly exists and maybe it’s even existed for decades. Do you see running into similar potential roadblocks, because that’s one less fighter pilot that’s flying in a fighter every day to provide red air support and the white scarf culture will resist it? Dan: It’s a great question, but I’d just throw it back to you because I don’t think it’s the right sort of thinking from their perspective. On the contrary, we’re not aiming to reduce the number of flying hours the pilots get. I’d want to double the number of flying hours a pilot can get because we’ve got so much more spare resources… Now we’re protecting our assets. We’re not beating them up doing red air. What I want them to do is every time they go flying BFM, I want them to fly BFM as an F-22. I don’t want to go up there and pretend to be a MiG-29 . So I say that this is a gross oversimplification, but I think this kind of technology gives commanders optionality, and you can think about it in this context. I can either double the amount of flying you’re getting, or I can half your training cost. Now, that’s a gross exaggeration, but somewhere in there lies that value proposition for commanders, right? And it’s scalable. You can bring it up or down depending on the operational tempos, what you’ve got going on at that time. The point is, you have that optionality. So, on the country, I don’t think it’s a threat to flying. I think it offers you the chance to fly more and more relevantly, for sure. Then coming back to the culture of people just kind of putting roadblocks in place, I think the fundamentals of this, the market decides, right? Because the fundamentals of supply and demand exist. There is a massive, massive demand signal and chronic undersupply. Given those fundamentals, this technology has massive applications. The other thing is that people move on from careers and all that kind of stuff. You can’t stop technological advancement. There’ll be bumps and hurdles and naysayers and all that kind of stuff, but it’s coming and it’s going to happen for sure.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 9, 2020","Yes, The United States Did Draw Up A Plan To Drop 80 Nuclear Weapons On North Korea","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Current nuclear war plans are among any nuclear-armed military’s most closely guarded secrets. Details of one such attack plan recently became available, however, revealing that the United States envisaged using 80 nuclear weapons in case of war with North Korea. The way this particular detail emerged is also pretty unusual — the associated passage appeared in U.S. journalist Bob Woodward’s book Rage , detailing President Trump’s administration, which was published this week. In fact, the particular quote from the book was not entirely clear: “The Strategic Command in Omaha had carefully reviewed and studied OPLAN 5027 for regime change in North Korea — the U.S. response to an attack that could include the use of 80 nuclear weapons.” This can be read two ways: a potential attack from the North could involve the use of 80 nuclear weapons, or the same number of weapons can be envisaged as a possible U.S. response to a first strike ordered by Pyongyang. An unarmed Trident II D5 missile launches from the Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska (SSBN 739) off the coast of California., U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 1ST CLASS RONALD GUTRIDGE In an interview with NPR, Woodward cleared up any confusion, noting that the 80 nuclear weapons were part of a U.S. attack plan — OPLAN 5027, which would include ‘decapitating’ the North Korean regime of dictator Kim Jong-un. “I think given North Korea is a rogue nation, they have, as I report, probably a couple of dozen nuclear weapons well-hidden and concealed,” Woodward explained to NPR. The veteran journalist confirmed that the then U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis was worried he might have to issue orders for a nuclear strike on North Korea. “The potential we’d have to shoot to prevent a second launch was real,” Mattis admitted. “You’re going to incinerate a couple million people,” Mattis told himself, according to Woodward. “No person has the right to kill a million people as far as I’m concerned, yet that’s what I have to confront.” Secretary Mattis departs an E-4B airborne command post. , DoD According to Woodward, Trump was worried that shooting down a North Korean ballistic missile (nuclear-armed or otherwise) on a trajectory headed toward the United States could prompt a full-scale nuclear attack from the “Hermit Kingdom.” Woodward writes that Trump had delegated authority to Jim Mattis to launch a conventionally armed interceptor missile to shoot down any North Korean missile that might be headed for the United States. Woodward said that Mattis confided in him that he was not worried that Trump might launch a preemptive strike against North Korea. Instead, the source of his angst was the North Korean leader in Pyongyang. In fact, such was Mattis’s level of concern that he would sleep in his gym clothes, Woodward claims. “There was a light in his bathroom… if he was in the shower and they detected a North Korean launch.” There were alarm bells set up in Mattis’s bedroom and kitchen too, and on more than one occasion during the summer of 2017 they sounded the alert, and he entered the communications room in his Washington DC residency. Woodward explains that Mattis’s car was also constantly followed by an SUV with a team equipped to plot the flight path of any incoming missile, whether it was threatening Japan, South Korea, or the United States. If Mattis considered the missile hostile, he had a mobile communications link to issue launch orders to shoot it down. Kim inspects a Hwasong-15 ICBM., North Korean State Media The book describes one particular missile alarm in particular detail. This occurred at 5:57 a.m. on August 29, 2017, when “exquisite” intelligence indicated that North Korea was about to launch another missile. Mattis was at home and entered the communications room, where he was told that U.S. interceptor missiles were ready to fire. The defense secretary monitored the progress of the North Korean missile on a geospatial map, watching it pass over Japan then come down in the sea. Woodward describes Mattis’s job at this time as “a nonstop crucible, personal and hellish. There were no holidays or weekends off, no dead time.” Clearly, the status of a nuclear-armed North Korea provided much pause for thought within the U.S. administration during Mattis’ tenure as Secretary of Defense. That a strike plan against North Korea involving 80 nuclear weapons was discussed between the president and his defense secretary isn’t all that hard to imagine. Back in September 2017, of course, North Korea conducted its sixth (and most recent) nuclear test, claiming the device in question was a thermonuclear bomb . The same year also saw considerable activity by North Korea’s strategic missile forces , including the first test of the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and several tests in which missiles passed over Japan . Amid tensions between Washington and Pyongyang in 2017, The War Zone looked in detail at the U.S. Strategic Command’s (STRATCOM) OPLAN 8010 — outlining the nuclear option for strikes against various unnamed states. One of the passages from the report we highlighted at the time is of particular interest (the authors’ own emphasis is included): While dynamic security concerns in space and cyberspace evolve, traditional threats to national security continue to be presented by sovereign states, both the peer and near-peer and those regional adversary states with emerging WMD [weapons of mass destruction] capabilities. The War Zone obtained a redacted version of the report, which does not mention North Korea by name, but which includes a section on “countries that present global threats” — more than likely coded language for North Korea. An extract from the U.S. Strategic Command’s Operations Plan 8010. , STRATCOM One of the options under consideration in Washington was OPLAN 5015, a nuclear strike to take out the North Korean leadership, which Woodward also refers to, drawing again from his extensive interviews with Trump. Specifically, Woodward mentions “updating” such a plan — after all, Kim Jong-un and his predecessors will have always been priority targets in the case of an all-out war. Kim inspects what was supposedly a thermonuclear weapon before the country’s sixth nuclear test. , North Korean State Media In one of his interviews, Trump tells Woodward he considered that Korean Kim Jong-un “was totally prepared” to go to war with the United States, and that full-blown conflict between the two nations was “much closer than anyone would know.” The U.S. president told Woodward that Kim Jong Un’s previously warlike outlook had been confirmed to him in his meeting with the North Korean leader. Trump considered that the situation was eventually diffused by the first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit held in Singapore in June 2018. While tensions between North Korea and the United States have receded somewhat since 2017, the nuclear issue remains totally unresolved, with talks stalled since the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Vietnam in early 2019. There are also signs that Pyongyang is further refining its nuclear weapons delivery systems, with claims from officials in South Korea that the North may be preparing to test a fully functional submarine-launched ballistic missile in around a year. By increasing the portion of its nuclear arsenal carried aboard submarines , North Korea could make the detection and destruction of these weapons harder. The ability of North Korea to then launch a second strike, even if the chances of success were remote, would, in turn, require another update to the U.S. nuclear attack plans — and might involve more than the 80 nuclear weapons that Woodward wrote about.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 26, 2020",Notoriously Shy RQ-170 Spy Drone Lands At Its Skunk Works Birthplace,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our July 25th report about the notoriously shy RQ-170 returning in broad daylight to its birthplace, Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works ‘ facility at the Air Force’s sprawling Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, we can report that the bat-winged spy drone has shown up there again under similar circumstances. Aviation Photographer Jeremy Smith, who goes by the handle @KPMD_Spotter on Instagram, encountered the RQ-170 on September 3rd, 2020. He describes the rare moment as such: At first, I noticed the chase aircraft in the pattern, mostly working on low approaches to Runway 25. So, I assumed it had ‘Johnny 5’ with him. I drove over there and it said on my scanner he needed to pick up a playmate ‘Johnny 05.’ Then he headed northeast to pick him up and he got the ILS for Runway 22 and landed.” RQ-170 landing at PMD on September 3rd. , Jeremy Smith RQ-170 landing at PMD on September 3rd. , Jeremy Smith The RQ-170 used the same ‘Johnny’ callsign the last time it landed at Plant 42, as well as the same chase plane, a 1981 Beech 55 with the registration N254BC. The aircraft is registered to MH Aviation , located at nearby Fox Field. According to flight-tracking data, the aircraft regularly flies support missions into the Edwards AFB and NAWS China Lake range complexes, as well as to other interesting locales like Beale AFB and Fort Worth, Texas. ADSBexchange.com The Sentinel had a light gray/cream overall color along with dayglow highlights near where some of its major features exist, such as its SATCOM ‘humps,’ its dorsal area, and around its ventral sensor area, which traditionally holds an electro-optical and infrared camera turret under a faceted window enclosure and a conformal AESA radar behind it. These types of very high visibility modifications to the aircraft exterior are intrinsic of test and development work being done, but the first clear image ever of the RQ-170, which was snapped at Afghanistan’s Kandahar Airfield in 2008, showed a similar arrangement, too. RQ-170 landing at PMD on September 3rd. , Jeremy Smith As to what the aircraft may be up to, we can’t say. There has been an explosion in flight testing over the Mojave in recent months, much of it has to do with low-observable (stealth) technologies and sensors. We also know of major integrated combat testing between various Air Force stealth assets, including the RQ-170, which has occurred recently. At the same time, the Sentinel is by no means a young aircraft or capability set. Lockheed Martin is now pitching, at least conceptually, an outgrowth of the RQ-170 design to the U.S. Air Force, which is suddenly highly interested in unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) once again. You can read about the Air Force’s bizarre and frankly troubling saga with UCAVs in this past feature of ours . The closest thing the Air Force has to such a capability, at least that is officially disclosed, is the RQ-170. So, it wouldn’t be surprising at all if it was being used for risk reduction efforts. Beyond that, the RQ-170 itself continues to evolve. We have seen and heard about it in multiple coatings configurations alone, and that doesn’t include potential changes to its mission systems over time. So, Sentinel flight testing has continued, just like any other combat aircraft. Doing it during the day, and especially landing it directly at its birthplace at Plant 42, is a whole lot more efficient than doing it from a highly remote locale and even at night. Regardless, the second appearance of an RQ-170 flying directly out of Plant 42 in just two months is another sign that the Sentinel transition from out of the shadows seems to be accelerating.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2020","From NASA To Amtrak, These Are All The Government Agencies With Tactical Teams","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, has released a new audit of “federal tactical teams,” or specialized law enforcement units, often generically referred to as SWAT teams, across the U.S. federal government. These range from better-known organizations, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Hostage Rescue Team and the U.S. Secret Service’s Counter Sniper Team , to much more obscure ones, including those that fall under the National Institutes of Health and Amtrak. The report first appeared online on Sept. 10, 2020. It is a non-sensitive version of a restricted report that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had published last month. GAO’s analysts identified 25 such teams spread across 18 different entities, as of the end of 2019, but this only reflects the total number of distinct types of units. For example, the review treats the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) SWAT teams as a single collective organization, despite there being teams in each field office across the country and on call at the national level. A 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service identified 271 individual tactical teams across the federal government at that time. This new report primarily also covers the activities of these units between 2015 and 2019, but there are added appendixes that cover some events in 2020. This includes the controversial deployments of tactical law enforcement units across the country in recent months. This has been in response to continued protests, which have at times led to violence, that have emanated from the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May, as well as other instances of police brutality that seem to disproportionately impact African Americans . Federal tactical teams have also taken part in aspects of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic . “Many federal agencies employ law enforcement officers to carry out the agency’s law enforcement mission and maintain the security of federal property, employees, and the public,” the report says in its executive summary. “Some of these agencies have specialized law enforcement teams – referred to as federal tactical teams in this report – whose members are selected, trained, equipped, and assigned to prevent and resolve critical incidents involving a public safety threat that their agency’s traditional law enforcement may not otherwise have the capability to resolve.” A table showing the various tactical teams across the U.S. federal government as of the end of 2019., GAO The bulk of the federal government’s tactical teams, 17 of the total 25, are within agencies that fall under the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice. The remaining eight are spread between the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as NASA, an independent agency, and Amtrak, a U.S. government-managed corporation . The GAO report also provides a basic overview of specialized weapons and equipment that tactical teams typically use and how many U.S. government teams have access to these assets. These general categories range from small arms and crowd control munitions to armored vehicles, small drones, and helicopters. GAO Only three tactical teams operate their own helicopters, while six utilize aerial drones, though the review does not say which units have these capabilities. Of course, many others receive aviation support from other units . The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) is one of the ones known to have its own helicopters, including a number of UH-60M Black Hawks, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece . An FBI HRT UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter, behind, and one of its Bell 407 helicopters, in front, take part in an exercise to stop a suspect vehicle and detain its occupants., GAO Another FBI HRT Bell 407 helicopter., GAO Some of these organizations are very high-profile. For instance, the FBI’s HRT is a national-level top-tier direct-action counter-terrorism unit. The U.S. Secret Service’s Counter Assault , Counter Sniper , and Emergency Response Teams, which are charged with protecting and otherwise responding to threats to the President of the United States, the Vice President, their families, and foreign heads of state visiting the United States. Members of the US Secret Service’s Counter Assault Team during training., GAO Others are perhaps less well-known by their formal names. It is generally public knowledge that most major federal law enforcement agencies, including FBI, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), have what would generally be considered SWAT teams of some kind. Members of an ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Response Team help provide security in Minneapolis, Minnesota during Super Bowl LII in 2018., ICE Many of these units are structured and trained to perform higher-risk missions, including counter-terrorism operations, protecting high profile government gatherings and other public events, and helping with disaster response. The U.S. Coast Guard, by law, straddles military and law enforcement functions, as well, and its Maritime Security Response Teams (MSRT), in particular, are closer in many respects to military special operations units. Its Tactical Law Enforcement Teams (TACLET) deploy on U.S. Navy ships and with other U.S. military elements specifically to perform law enforcement duties, especially as part of counter-drug operations. A number of these teams have also been in the news more recently as part of the aforementioned controversial deployments in response to ongoing protests around the country. GAO says the following 16 specific units or types of teams have taken part in some way in what President Donald Trump’s Administration has dubbed Operation Legend : BATFE Special Response Teams Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Special Operations Response Teams (SORT) FBI’s HRT FBI SWAT Teams U.S. Coast Guard’s Maritime Security Response Team U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Teams CBP’s Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) CBP Office of Field Operations Special Response Teams ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Special Response Teams ICE Homeland Security Investigations Special Response Teams The Pentagon Force Protection Agency’s (FPA) Emergency Response Team USMS Special Operations Group (SOG) U.S. Park Police’s SWAT Team U.S. Secret Service’s Counter Assault Team U.S. Secret Service’s Counter Sniper Team U.S. Secret Service’s Emergency Response Team Beyond the units that have been on the news lately, or those that regularly appear in blockbuster movies and popular television shows, especially procedural crime dramas, there are still more federal tactical teams that receive far less public attention. Despite their obscurity, many of these have very important functions. For instance, GAO’s report includes the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Special Response Force, which supports the safe and secure movement of nuclear material, including nuclear weapons, around the country. This includes escorting highly-modified tractor-trailers, known as Safeguards Transporters, or SGTs, which have James Bond-esque security features that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . Members of NNSA’s Special Response Force train to protect an SGT tractor-trailer. This picture offers a rare look at the inside of the armored doors on the cab., GAO There is also the oddly named Mobile Security Deployments, which fall under the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, are prepared to respond to various crises abroad and at home. This includes contingencies that require added security at diplomatic facilities overseas and helping to safeguard major diplomatic events within the United States, such as the annual gathering of the United Nations General Assembly. GAO’s review also makes mention of tactical units most Americans probably don’t even know exist, such as the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Special Response Team (SRT) and Amtrak’s Special Operations Unit (SOU). NIH’s SRT, formally established in 2005, had previously been a hazardous materials response unit, but evolved to be able to respond to active shooters and other serious incidents at the Institute’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland. NIH works with radioactive materials for medical research and infectious diseases, among other hazards, all of which present potential security risks. Members of NIH’s SRT., GAO Amtrak’s SOU, part of the corporation’s larger Police Department, is on call to respond to terrorist attacks, active shooters, and other major crises that might happen along America’s critical railway networks. It also provides security details to protect VIPs traveling by train. A rare picture of members of Amtrak’s SOU during training. Note the ladder that personnel could use to engage threats inside the train or otherwise gain access during a crisis., GAO It’s also worth noting that a not insignificant number of the U.S. government’s tactical teams emerged, perhaps not surprisingly, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The total number continues to grow, as well. Just while GAO was working on its report, it received word from DEA that it formally established a standardized tactical team organization, known as Special Response Teams, to replace more ad hoc tactical units within 20 of its 23 field divisions. You can read more about all of the U.S. federal government’s tactical teams in the GAO’s report, which a mirrored copy of which is available via The War Zone here . It is likely to continue to be a valuable resource as these units look set to be an important, but often controversial component of federal law enforcement capabilities for the foreseeable future.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Jun 1, 2021",The Plan For Making Aging USMC F/A-18 Hornets Deadlier Than Ever For A Final Decade Of Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is moving towards a streamlined fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35B and C-model Lightning IIs for all of its tactical aircraft (TACAIR) needs post-2030. While USMC leadership juggles the exact planning over the number of the stealthy fighters it will need to meet future requirements, both the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II and F/A-18A-D Hornet fleets will continue to provide Close Air Support (CAS) for Marines on the ground and air cover above the battlefield. Under current plans, the Harrier II will bow out in Fiscal Year 2028, followed by the Hornet in 2030. The aging Marine Corps Hornet fleet is composed of a range of 1980s-era F/A-18A-D models, all of which have undergone various upgrades. Now, in order to bridge the decade-long gap between now and the type’s retirement, a select batch of approximately 84 Hornets has been earmarked to make it through to the planned “sundown” despite their advanced years via a series of upgrades, the likes of which the Hornet has never seen. With the Hornet considered to be the USMC’s most potent air-to-air and air-to-ground “legacy” fighter aircraft, the so-called “best-in-breed” are now receiving High Flight Hour (HFH) inspections during depot-level maintenance that will see them out to 10,000 flight hours. Concurrently, they are being equipped with new technology that will enable them to bridge the gap to the Marine Lightning fleet of 2030-onwards. Known unofficially as “Classic” Hornets, these first-generation F/A-18s were ultimately superseded by the larger F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in U.S. Navy service. The original A-D models have now all been retired from the front line Navy fleet. Some of these aircraft have been redirected into the USMC to help prop up the fleet as the Marines’ eye a planned “sunset” of 2030 for the Hornet. The U.S. Marine Corps aims to operate up to seven active-duty Hornet squadrons with the latest upgrades., Jamie Hunter The F/A-18A-D Program Management Agency (PMA) is actively engaged in future plans for the fleet, which includes managing multiple readiness initiatives, planning an aggressive strike/store plan, and implementing re-engineered end of life Planned Maintenance Inspection (PMI) events. Twice yearly reviews are held to identify the most suitable aircraft that will ensure the Marines keep a credible fleet of Hornets on the flight line now and into the future. U.S. Marine Corps leadership has laid out the broad ambition for its Hornet strike fighter fleet in its annual Aviation Plans of recent years. Central to this is a series of upgrades that will ultimately realize up to seven squadrons-worth of best condition Hornets, all of which will receive a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar in the form of the Raytheon AN/APG-79(v)4 . This radar is based on the AN/APG-79(v)1 radar that equips Block 2/3 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers. Ambitions for an AESA radar for the Classic Hornet have been in train for a decade, as have numerous other plans. In conjunction with a new advanced self-protection system and a suite of modern precision-guided weapons, the Hornet is being made as lethal as possible in order for it to meet high-end missions over the coming decade. Speaking to The War Zone , former Hornet Weapons Systems Officer (WSO) Lt Col Michael “Sock” Pavis is the F/A-18A-D Capabilities Lead and F/A-18A-D Air Vehicle Lead for the PMA-265 Hornet Program Office at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. “The Marine Corps Aviation Plan is the foundation of the plan for U.S Marine Corps F/A-18A-Ds. That’s a “sundown” of 2030 and supporting the transition to F-35. During that transition, the Hornet is the Marine Corps aircraft that has the greatest variety of both air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons. So. we need to support that, and the National Defense Strategy, to ensure we are lethal, survivable, and ready.” The U.S. Marine Corps transition plan to the F-35., USMC “Keeping that in mind, we are looking at transitioning all our A-D squadrons to be composite squadrons , each with seven F/A-18Cs and five F/A-18Ds. [We will use] the most valuable fleet, [one that gives us] the most capability for the lowest cost of ownership. The F/A-18 was initially designed for 6,000 flight hours, and is now extended to 8,000 hours. Following a High Flight Hour [HFH] inspection, we’re able to fly those F/A-18s to 10,000 hours. That HFH inspection is expensive and time consuming, and [involves] a lot of time where those aircraft are not able to be used because they’re in the depot. The ones that have completed the HFH inspection and are compatible with capability upgrades like the AN/APG-79(v)4 radar, the AN/ALQ-214(v)5 and AN/ALR-67 electronic warfare suites — those aircraft are the most valuable as they provide the most available flying time with the least expensive depot costs. So, we are able to have our best flyers out there for the longest period of time for the lowest cost. We have a most valuable fleet mindset to reduce cost of ownership and keep the highest capability possible.” The new composite squadron plan means that the seven remaining active-duty Marine Corps Hornet squadrons will be able to support all F/A-18 mission sets. “It’s partially a manpower solution, in that we have Hornet WSOs that we have created, but we are finishing that training of new WSOs in the next few years. The career field will remain throughout the life of the Hornet as they are still valuable and they add a mission set, particularly in the Forward Air Controller (Airborne) capability and Tactical Air Control mission that only those two-seat crews can do,” Pavis explains. “By spreading those throughout the fleet, you get better usage of our WSOs throughout the squadrons. It’s a mission and a logistic solution by going to composite squadrons — it’s not driven by hours remaining on aircraft or airframes specifically.” Selecting the “best-in-breed” The USMC’s Hornet squadrons have struggled over recent years with readiness — having sufficient available airframes to meet commanders’ requirements. According to the 2018 Marine Aviation Plan : “The USMC fleet currently has eleven active squadrons and one reserve squadron. In recent years there has been an aircraft inventory shortage due to In Service Repairs (ISR) and depot maintenance backlog. HQMC has reset the force by temporarily reducing squadron flightline entitlement (FLE) to 10 aircraft to preserve future combat readiness while meeting today’s current operational requirements. As inventory continues to recover we will return to a community FLE of 12 with deploying squadrons beginning in 3rd quarter of FY17.” A pilot conducts pre-flight checks on a Hornet as MCAS Miramar., Jamie Hunter Naval Air Systems Command has conducted an exhaustive study of the overall Hornet fleet with the aid of a predictive flight hour tool to assess which of the aircraft will provide the best availability and lowest overall support cost through to 2030. “In that analysis we also looked at which aircraft are compatible with accepting our capability upgrades that we need,” Pavis explains. “That creates best-of-breed. Getting us the most flight hours for the least amount of depot cost. There’s a cut-off line at a certain production Lot [build] number, above that Lot number they’re able to accept those upgrades, below it they can’t. [That’s] Lot 15 and above F/A-18Cs and Lot 14 and above Ds. That was the initial neck down, then we look at what’s available, what’s valuable, and what’s going to give us the most hours.” “When we’re assessing aircraft, we are looking at the overall number of hours it’s flown and also the fatigue life expended.” One of the most influential fatigue factors relates to the wing root, which, if in need of replacement, drives a time consuming and expensive structural upgrade known as Center Barrel Replacement Plus (CBR+). According to the 2019 Marine Aviation Plan : “The F/A-18 Service Life Management Program (SLMP) consists of the Center Barrel Replacement Plus (CBR+) and High Flight Hour (HFH) inspection programs.The CBR+ has extended the service life of numerous Lot 17 and below aircraft and the HFH inspection has extended the life of the F/A-18A-D aircraft beyond 8,000 hours. In parallel with HFH and CBR+ maintenance, the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) incorporates a combination of inspections, repairs and a number of Engineering Change Proposals to extend additional F/A-18A/C/D to 10,000 Flight Hours. The Naval Aviation Enterprise has re-engineered the post-8,000 hour end of life maintenance plan.” According to Pavis: “We went through our fatigue life, looked at our hours, the ability to accept the capability upgrades and looked at what needs CBR and not, and we were able to drastically reduce the number of forecast CBRs we have left to the order of less than five more planned future CBR inductions. By doing that we will have aircraft and can fly them the way we need to with only a small mitigation for fatigue life to make sure they keep their 10,000 hours.” “The analogy we have been using is “the pig is passing through the python.” We have an immense number of aircraft in depot level maintenance right now getting that 8,000 HFH inspection. We’ve inducted a bunch and we’re delivering them as fast as we can, but our work in progress number right now is the highest it’s going to be. Those are the ones that are going to take us to 2030, because they have 2,000 hours left on them. There’s another inspection at 9,000 hours but it’s minor.” Composite Hornet squadrons will allow the USMC to retain the WSO career field until the final retirement of the Hornet., Jamie Hunter In addition to the active squadrons, a single Reserve unit at Naval Air Station/Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, also flies the Hornet. VMFA-112 “Cowboys” is transitioning from older F/A-18A+ aircraft to low-hour Lot 10 and 11 F/A-18Cs, which are being upgraded by Boeing to C+ configuration. This project originally included 30 Hornets but was later reduced to 19. “We have delivered seven Hornets from of our C+ program, and have 12 left to deliver to support VMFA-112 through its “sundown,” explains Pavis. The F/A-18C+ upgrade provides the F/A-18C+ with Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) digital communications, the Naval Aircrew Common Ejection Seat (NACES), Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), Tactical Aircraft Moving Map Capabilities (TAMMAC) and new full-color cockpit displays. The F/A-18C+ is also compatible with the latest AN/AAQ-28 Litening Gen4 targeting pod. New capabilities A host of individual upgrade projects over recent years have been wrapped into a succession of software “drops” known as Operational Flight Programs, or OFPs. These have included Link-16 data link functionality, the Gen4 Litening pod, and required radar navigation upgrades to meet modern air traffic control regulations. Currently being retrofitted across the selected fleet of Hornets is a suite of electronic warfare enhancements. “We are outfitting aircraft with the ALE-67(v)3 Radar Warning Receiver [RWR], plus replacing the ALQ-165 ASPJ [Airborne Self-Protection Jammer] with the ALQ-214(v)5, and those efforts are ongoing,” says CDR Bisher “Binger” Mufti, the Radar/Future Electronic Warfare Lead in PMA-265. Additional approved and funded programs coming down the pipe include an Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System ( Auto-GCAS ), which Pavis says will be added “as soon as possible.” So-called NAVWAR upgrades are funded as a new start in FY2022, for incorporation in FY2023-2024 and will be added to enable the assurance of GPS and timing, according to Pavis. This relates to jamming-resistant GPS systems that are applicable in certain operational scenarios, which you can read more about here in this previous War Zone piece . Weapons upgrades have included the addition of the AIM-9X Block II , AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) and the AGR-20A Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), which is a Hydra 70 unguided rocket with a laser guidance kit to turn them into precision-guided munitions. Combining the new weapons with a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar unlocks a whole new level of capability for the Hornet. AESA technology not only offers significant improvements in combat capability, but also greater reliability due to the reduction in the number of moving parts. The operational improvements include enhanced detection and tracking ranges, target discrimination and identification, the ability to spot low-flying reduced radar cross-section targets like cruise missiles, as well as the capability to rapidly scan huge volumes of airspace as AESA radars do not rely on a mechanically steered radar dish to do so. An obsolescence and capability upgrade to replace the existing AN/APG-73 system in the Hornet has been a long-term ambition for the Marine Corps. Raytheon initially performed a fit check in 2010 with what was known then as the APG-79(VX), also known as the Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar (RACR). However, plans did not firm up until the 2018 Marine Aviation Plan. Raytheon engineers fit-check an APG-79(v)4 on a Hornet., Raytheon Candidate radars also included Northrop Grumman’s Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), with the company undertaking a Hornet fit check in 2018. On January 15, 2019, Raytheon announced that the U.S. Marine Corps had awarded it a contract for the AN/APG-79(v)4 that could ultimately lead to the retrofit of seven squadrons worth of F/A-18C/Ds — the current budget includes 75 total radars for the Marines. Naval Air Systems Command awarded Raytheon a contract worth $30.2-million that covered the first nine production-standard sets for delivery from December 2021. Notably, Canada has also selected the same radar for the upgrade of its CF-18 Hornets, which you can read about here . This radar’s lineage in the Super Hornet’s AN/APG-79 was a major consideration when selecting the optimum candidate for a cost-effective retrofit. “The AN/APG-79(v)4 is designed to be compatible with the software that already exists in the Hornet and runs the current AN/APG-73,” says Lt Col Pavis. The commonality with the APG-79(v)1 in the Super Hornet and Growler also helps to minimise cost when it comes to future software development for the new Hornet radar. “What we really get with the AESA is supply chain streamlining,” adds CDR Mufti. “APG-79(v)1 is in our Super Hornets and the (v)4 shares about 90 percent commonality with that. This is the best way to ensure the radar is supportable and sustainable until sundown.” “The [initial] nine radars was the first procurement and designed to get the ball rolling,” Mufti adds. This was in addition to a previous contract for test sets to be delivered in order to commence Hornet integration work at Naval Air Warfare Station China Lake, California. This includes a RACR test radar and four Engineering Development Model (EDM) radars that will arrive at China Lake over the coming year. One of these is just an antenna, which will be used for test work. Pavis says hardware installations of the set itself can either be made in the depot during scheduled inspections or in the field at operational units, whichever is deemed to be the most efficient. The Hornet’s new OFP 29C+ mission software is currently in development to support the initial introduction of the new radar. The USMC is hoping to fund more Hornet upgrades including new cockpit displays., Jamie Hunter Looking further ahead, there are still some unfunded upgrades that Pavis says the Marines still require for the Hornet. This includes the improved AN/ALR-67(v)5 RWR. “We also have obsolescence and maintainability issues with our cockpit displays; the left and right digital display indicators [DDIs] and our Cockpit Video Recording System [CVRS],” he says, adding that incremental upgrades on the roadmap are in various states of funding and planning. Overall, this coherent set of plans will provide for what will arguably be the most potent set of original Hornets on the planet. As F-35 fielding plans have slipped to the right, the ability for the F/A-18 to adapt through life extensions and capability insertions has provided the USMC with an extremely useful back-up option. Despite all the new enhancements, the Marine Corps has no plans to change the designation of its Hornets. Moreover, Pavis is keen to point out that the various unofficial monikers that have been used in recent times for the F/A-18A-D fleet simply aren’t recognized within U.S. Navy and Marine Corps circles. “It is the F/A-18A-D Hornet. No “Legacy,” no “Legendary,” no “Classic,” we are the Hornet,” he asserts.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 23, 2021",Mysterious Drone Incursions Have Occurred Over U.S. THAAD Anti-Ballistic Missile Battery In Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this year, it came to The War Zone ‘s attention that a series of bizarre and highly concerning events took place in the late Winter of 2019 at Andersen Air Force Base on the Island of Guam. As we understand it, between late February and early March of last year, the massive installation experienced repeated incursions by unmanned aircraft that appeared to be extremely interested in one highly sensitive area of the highly strategic base, the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery that is tasked with defending the island from ballistic missile attacks. The incursions, which were said to have occurred in late March and early April 2019, had been observed by personnel manning guard towers that loom over the highly secure THAAD area situated towards the northern end of the air base, often referred to as “North West Field.” Andersen itself takes up the northern and western reaches of the entire island. Andersen Air Force Base takes up the entire northwestern end of Guam. The air base is located to the southwest, with the weapons storage areas and other critical sites being located to the northwest. The THAAD battery sits near where the abandoned runway-like feature exists on the northwestern portion of the base. , Google Earth The intruding craft were described as “quadcopter-like” vehicles with bright spotlights that flew from over the water and then across the North West Base area at not much higher than treetop level, about 20 to 30 feet above the ground. On a number of nights, the craft would make multiple incursions in the very early morning hours. They would show up, disappear, then come back a few hours later. The spotlight that shone down from the craft made it hard for personnel to make out a detailed description of the craft, although estimates range from being three to five feet in diameter largely based on the size of the spotlight. The craft would maneuver dynamically, appearing with the spotlight on, then disappearing, just to reappear moments later over to one side or another with the spotlight on, which was unsettling to those that witnessed it. Supposedly, there was a concerted effort to identify, track, and down the mysterious craft, but it doesn’t seem that those efforts were successful based on our understanding of events. This information was highly interesting if not downright alarming, but we had to find hard evidence that at least something similar did indeed happen during this timeframe. We got just that straight from the U.S. Air Force. The War Zone was able to confirm that at least one of the incidents described above did occur through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), by which we obtained a copy of the relevant entry from the Air Force’s 36th Security Forces Squadron’s internal crime blotter. The is unit is part of the 36th Wing at Andersen Air Force Base. The entry describes the “possible drone” as being of an “unknown color and size, [with a] bright white light.” Army personnel at “THAAD Tower #2” had radioed in at “2315,” or 11:15 PM – it’s unclear if this was local time on Guam or Zulu Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time – to report “a bright white light was seen from [their] LOCATION hovering over a field and quickly disappeared.” “Tower #2 personnel were unable to provide any further description,” the blotter entry continues. “At 2318, JET PATROLS were in the vicinity conducting covert operations. None of the JET PATROLS were able to locate the suspicious white light.” USAF via FOIA The “JET PATROLS” that are referenced in the document are not aircraft, but are Jungle Enforcement Teams of the 36th Security Forces Squadron. The Air Force describes the teams as being “tasked with preventing security breaches, apprehending poachers, and securing the perimeter around the jungle.” The team’s personnel move silently through the jungle that permeates much of the base at night and have unique human tracking skills. You can read all about this specialized security force in this official media release . Interestingly, the 36th Security Force Squadron’s blotter lists this incident as “Unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Systems/Security Incident #2019-2,” which implied that there was at least one other similarly classified drone incident at Andersen Air Force Base before this one by that point in the early 2019 calendar or fiscal year. Another FOIA request confirmed that there was a “2019-1” blotter entry, but the Air Force withheld information about that event citing privacy and law enforcement exemptions. Agencies typically withhold records for law enforcement reasons because of a potential risk of exposing sensitive tactics, techniques, or procedures, or because of an ongoing investigation. It is then doubly interesting that the March 2019 incident near the Army’s THAAD battery at North West Field was not also subject to the exemptions. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) forwarded a separate FOIA request regarding this incident, any other similar occurrences around the same timeframe, to the U.S. Army. The War Zone is still awaiting a response to that request, as well as another one to the Guam Police Department. We inquired directly to the 36th Wing and INDOPACOM, but never got a response. We found this information to be highly troubling for a number of reasons. The most important is that this craft was able to penetrate its way over an air defense system that is tasked with defending the highly strategic island from ballistic missile attacks. In other words, that THAAD battery is largely what stands in the way of a country like North Korea from holding the island at imminent risk. The system is even capable of shielding against a lower volume barrage from a peer state competitor, such as China. Guam would be near the top of Beijing’s targeting list during a conflict with the United States and its growing ballistic missile arsenal has been developed largely to deny the U.S. the utility of its regional bases during the open stages of a conflict. The island has already been outright threatened by Kim Jong Un’s regime. DoD The thing is that destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) is not defined by a platform, it is a mission. Traditionally we associate the objective of destroying enemy air defenses with standoff cruise missile attacks and ‘wild weasel’ fighter jet operations, but DEAD can be carried out by a team of special operators with some well-placed explosives or via a barrage of naval gunfire. Even carefully deployed malware that targets the software that an air defense system and its mechanical component run on could potentially be destructive enough to be considered a DEAD method. With that said, America’s preeminent adversaries in the entire region would make taking out the THAAD battery on Guam a top priority during a conflict or even as part of a limited demonstration of force. Why barrage it with ballistic missiles or attempt a cruise missile launch from a forward-deployed submarine or even a clandestine commando raid when you can just fly a drone loaded with explosives into it? And no, you don’t need some high-end drone system to do this as real-world events have highlighted many times over. Drug cartels are now whacking their enemies with off-the-shelf drone-borne improvised explosive devices and even U.S. allies are actually manufacturing hobby-like drones just for this purpose. Somewhat more sophisticated types can be launched from longer distances and can even home in on radar or other RF emissions sources, like THAAD’s powerful AN/TPY-2 Radar and data-links, autonomously, beyond just striking a certain point on a map. AN/TPY-2 radar used by THAAD., MDA Simply put, ‘shooting the archer,’ in this case an advanced anti-ballistic missile system that protects America’s most strategic base in the entire region, via a relatively cheap drone is both an absurdly obvious and terrifyingly ironic tactic—the U.S. can shoot down ballistic missiles, but the critical systems used to do so remain extremely vulnerable to the lowliest of airborne threats—cheap drones. For those that follow our work, this is not news. The U.S. military was dangerously aloof when it came to the threat posed by low-end drones. We spent years highlighting this threat while seeing the U.S. military do very little to actually counter it, that is until ISIS was constantly dropping bomblets from drones or just flying explosive-laden drones into allied positions during the Battle of Mosul, Iraq. The threat has ballooned exactly as we predicted since then, with mass drone attacks on forward operating bases , attempted assassinations of ruling figures via drone , and even a successful drone assault right at the heart of Saudi oil production a year ago. In fact, the threat has gotten so bad that top U.S. commanders in the field are saying the constant presence of nefarious drones over or near their troops and equipment is what keeps them up at night. In the meantime, it’s abundantly clear that even America’s most capable air defenses are vulnerable to the most meager of aerial capabilities—commercially available drones. If anything else, this is yet another, but possibly the biggest example of just how misplaced the U.S. military’s priorities had become when it comes to investments in air defense over the last two decades or so. You can read how the Pentagon let its short-range air defense (SHORAD) capabilities wither on the vine to an appalling degree while concentrating on higher-profile, ‘sexier,’ and drastically more lucrative weapon systems in this past feature of ours . The Pentagon’s appalling lack of vision regarding the emergence of this threat has made quickly ramping-up efforts to counter it that much more of a scramble, which is ongoing now. Still, America’s potential enemies are already a step ahead, working on swarming low-end drone concepts that will overwhelm most countermeasures currently in the works. So what is happening here? How does this all play into a rash of other troubling drone sightings , including highly similar ones that have occurred over American nuclear facilities and in other highly restricted airspace , as well as the ongoing buzz about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP)? We will tie years worth of reporting on all these issues and others together very soon in a capstone piece. In the meantime, the events on Guam in 2019 serve as maybe the most outstanding reminder of how the Pentagon’s fixation on high-end threats, and the huge gold plated weapons programs that are put into play to counter them, have left even those very capabilities remarkably vulnerable to far less advanced attacks.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you grew up having an interest in aviation, transportation as a whole, or defense technology, you probably at least tried your hand at model making. The vast majority of us were not successful in any way. What started as a dream to carefully assemble whatever the image looked like on the cardboard box, usually ended in a crudely painted thing with glue seeping through its seams. Nothing ventured nothing gained, but still, these endeavors left many of us in envy and in awe of those who actually wield the dark magic required to build models to their full potential. It turns out, that some of those folks grew up to make a career out of it—a very serious and highly impactful one—over at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA) 3-D Model Shop. Anyone who has had an interest in Operation Neptune Spear, the operation that resulted in the death of the despicable terror kingpin Osama Bin Laden, is well aware of ‘the model.’ It has been featured prominently in almost every book or other account of the events leading up to the successful raid. The 1:7 scale model allowed for everyone operationally involved in the mission, as well as intelligence specialists, to get a physical handle on the layout and the unique challenges and areas of exploitation that the bizarre compound, which at the time was potentially hiding the terror mastermind, presented. Basic illustration of the Bin Laden compound. , Globalsecurity.org Later, the tactics and planning that was greatly influenced by the model would be put to the test on an elaborate full-scale mockup of the compound at the CIA’s Harvey Point training facility, and later at a cruder one made out of shipping containers deep within the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) . The full-scale mockup of the compound at Harvey Point Defense Training Activity in North Carolina. , Bing Maps It was there that the stealth Black Hawk helicopters and the other elements of the air assault plan would be tested together, their flight plans refined, and dry-runs of the mission were shown to Obama Administration officials in order to get the approval for the high-stakes raid. So, the model, something uncannily low-tech for our time, was absolutely key to the success of the entire endgame of the decade-long fervent hunt for Bin Laden. Years after the raid, the model materialized and was put on display in the Pentagon and at the CIA’s own museum. It was an uncannily accurate subscale representation of a compound that was by then seared into the minds of Americans. Now, nearly a decade after the raid took place and on the 19th year anniversary of the horrific events of 9/11, CBS’s Catherine Herridge was able to not only view the model up close, but also visit the boutique unit where four model makers put it together. She even talked to one of the model makers who was actually part of that team. He shares that he and his teammates definitely were debating who was living at the site while the subscale facsimile was being fabricated. And yes, there is an archive of past works locked in the high-security facility, including what looks like a Soviet-era Kiev class aircraft cruiser.

It’s somewhat comforting to know that even in an era in which computer modeling and virtual reality are changing how we interpret physical spaces synthetically, this outfit is still operating, as it has for decades.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 6, 2021",How This F-117 Ended Up Nesting With An F-15 Alert Jet At Portland Air Guard Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Oregon Air National Guard’s 142nd Fighter Wing is one of the world’s premier fighter units. Flying the F-15C Eagle, their mission is strictly air-to-air. The Wing’s Eagles can be seen roaring out of Portland International Airport on a near-daily basis, oftentimes giving those in the passenger terminal a jaw-dropping surprise. With the USAF’s only F-15C/D training unit in Klamath Falls, Oregon is definitely Eagle country, which is why it was so odd to see the stunning image above. Portland Air National Guard Base, which is adjacent to Portland International Airport, gets its fair share of visitors. Often times F-16s and F/A-18s will grace the ramp there for dissimilar air combat training (DACT) with the resident Eagles. The huge ranges off the Oregon Coast offer one of the biggest playgrounds in the continental U.S. for dogfighting. Airlifters, tankers, and helicopters will also come and go from the base, and Atlantic Aviation, the fixed base operator (FBO) on the other side of the airport, gets more of the transient tactical jet traffic these days. But still, seeing an F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jet sitting beside an F-15 not just on the base, but in the installation’s NORAD alert barn, is odd, to say the least. Traditionally, F-15s sit armed and ready to take off within a few minutes at the highly secure complex on the southeastern corner of the airport. They can intercept a wide range of aircraft over a huge area, down into northern California, all the way up into British Columbia, in just a matter of minutes if called upon to do so. And those calls do indeed come more often than most realize. The alert facility at Portland Air National Guard Base. , Author The picture at top of this story comes to us from Sean Phillips, an aviation photographer that goes by @Big_Seans_Aviation on Instagram , who was given it years ago from a family member who was in the Air National Guard. Even though the F-117 is still remarkably active considering it was retired over a decade ago, the image is old. It appears to have been shot on 35mm film and the alert Eagle in the image is not anywhere near as heavily armed as what we see today in the post 9/11 era. This points to the image having been taken back in the 1990s, after the existence of the F-117 was publicly disclosed, but before the tragic events of 9/11 that dramatically changed the Air Force’s alert posture across the country. The 142nd FW color bird blasts out of PDX with the Columbia River as a backdrop. , Author Sticking the F-117 in the alert barn makes some sense for that era as it was (and still is) the most secure area capable of hosting an aircraft on the entire base, with its own security patrols and multi-row fencing. As such, it would have served as the perfect cocoon for the still highly sensitive stealth jet. We reached out to the 142nd Fighter Wing to see if they had any idea when the shot was taken and under what circumstances. Their public affairs folks along with their historian came up with an answer. F-117A. , USAF Apparently, the F-117 was the star of the 1993 Rose Festival Air Show at nearby Hillsboro Airport. At the time, the Rose Festival Air Show was one of the best in the country. The jet was staged at PDX for its flyovers due to security and runway length requirements. Here is the document the 142nd Fighter Wing dug-up about what would have been, at the time, a very special, albeit somewhat alien visitor: 142nd FW document So that is the story of this moody image of the F-117 nesting with an F-15 of the 142nd Fighter Wing. There actually may be at least one other time an F-117 visited the base, which may have been the result of an in-flight emergency while it was transitting to another locale, but that story doesn’t come with gorgeous photographic evidence.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2020",Check Out These Rare Infrared Images Of A Minuteman III ICBM Blasting Off,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released rare shots of an LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile shortly after launch during a recent test launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. This comes as the Air Force is celebrating the 50th anniversary of these missiles entering service this year and just a day after formally awarding Northrop Grumman a contract to continue development and eventually build the Minuteman III’s replacement, known as the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent . Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees America’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, which is presently made up entirely of Minuteman IIIs, released the pictures on its Facebook page on Sept. 9, 2020. A camera team at Vandenberg captured the infrared images during a scheduled test launch of an LGM-30G from that base on Sept. 2. “We just had to share these amazing shots of our #MMIII operational test launch on Sept. 2 taken by the optics camera team at Vandenberg Air Force Base!” AFGSC’s brief Facebook post read. “It’s not often you see shots like these!” USAF USAF “Not often” is something of an understatement. Official images of this quality showing one of these missiles in flight are very rare. Typically, after Minuteman III tests, the Air Force only releases pictures and video of the missile leaving the silo and streaking across the sky. Since these launches are almost exclusively conducted at night, the imagery generally does not provide much in the way of detail. However, the Air Force had already released video footage of the Sept. 2 test showing more of the initial flight than usual. It’s not immediately clear why there has been this apparent push to provide more visuals surrounding this particular launch. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rcAkrT4_SNc The Sept. 2 test involved the launch of a missile with a single reentry vehicle. The reentry vehicle came down approximately 4,200 miles away from Vandenberg at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. “These test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, providing valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent,” the Air Force said of this particular launch. This followed a more uncommon test launch in August involving a Minuteman III in a Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) configuration with three reentry vehicles, as it was originally designed to carry. All operational LGM-30Gs are presently equipped with a single reentry vehicle only as a result of various arms control agreements, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . 2020 does mark 50 years in service for the LGM-30G, the first examples of which were operationally deployed in 1970. The annivarsary has put an additional focus on these missiles. The Minuteman III was the first MIRVed ICBM to enter service anywhere in the world. In addition, on Sept. 8, 2020, the Air Force declared Northrop Grumman to be the formal winner of the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) competition, awarding it a deal worth more than $13 billion . This company had been the only remaining contestant after Boeing dropped out of the running last year. Boeing’s decision, along with the factors that led up to it , had prompted criticism, including from members of Congress who warned that having just one bidder could lead to increased costs. The total cost of replacing the Minuteman IIIs with new GBSD missiles, which have been tentatively designated YLGM-182As, is estimated to be around $100 billion , including various ancillary spending, such as infrastructure improvements. An artist’s conception of Northrop Grumman’s GBSD ICBM., Northrop Grumman This is just one part of a broader and potentially budget-busting nuclear modernization push across the U.S. military, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece . The ICBM leg of America’s nuclear deterrent triad, also known as the “nuclear sponge” since it is meant to “soak up” incoming nuclear strikes, forcing an opponent to commit multiple warheads to each silo and hardened command bunker , is already, at best, a controversial part of the U.S. defense budget, as The War Zone has explored in the past . All of this also comes as the U.S. government continues to negotiate with its Russian counterparts about the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which is set to expire next year if the two sides can’t agree on terms to extend it. The United States is looking to bring China, which is expanding its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, into any future agreement, as well. An LGM-30G Minuteman III missile in its silo., USAF The end of New START would open the door for dramatic changes in America’s nuclear arsenal, broadly. For the ICBM force, this might lead to re-MIRVing of the Minuteman IIIs or a change to the planned configuration of the GBSD. The latter missiles are slated to begin replacing the existing LGM-30Gs starting in 2029. Whatever the case, the Air Force has clearly been particularly keen recently to highlight the existing Minuteman IIIs, including with rarely seen imagery of the missile in flight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2021",How China’s Ballistic Missile And Nuclear Arsenal Is Ballooning According To The Pentagon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report from the Pentagon offers an updated public assessment of China’s ballistic missile arsenal , which shows a notable increase in its size and the scope of its capabilities. The annual review of the Chinese military also indicates that these developments are, at least in part, tied to important developments in the country’s nuclear posture and the doctrine and policies surrounding it. The Pentagon released the latest iteration of its report on the Chinese military and its capabilities, an updated version of which it is required to send to Congress every year, by law, on Sept. 2, 2020 . It warned that the People’s Liberation Army is continuing to make strides in a variety of important and advanced technologies, including, but certainly not limited to hypersonic weapons , artificial intelligence , cyber warfare , counter-space systems , air defenses , and the construction of large capital ships and advanced submarines . The review’s discussion about ballistic missiles and nuclear capabilities, including a first-ever public estimate from the Department of Defense about the size of the Chinese nuclear arsenal, was especially significant. “The PLARF [People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force] develops and fields a wide variety of conventional mobile ground-launched ballistic missiles and cruise missiles,” the report said. “The PRC [People’s Republic of China]  is developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces.” The Pentagon estimates that China has added 10 new ICBMs to its arsenal since its 2019 report, as well as 10 more launchers, including silos and road-mobile transporter-erector-launchers, to fire them. This brings to the estimated size of the country’s total operational IBCM force from 90 to 100. The most notable addition are examples of the new DF-41 ICBM, also known to the U.S. intelligence community as the CSS-X-20, which reportedly has the ability to deploy Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle warheads, or MIRVs , allowing a single missile to strike multiple targets. You can read more about the DF-41, which represents a significant technology leap over previous Chinese ICBMs and that the Chinese government publicly paraded for the first time last year, in this past War Zone piece . China has also been developing DF-5C and DF-31B variants of those existing ICBM types. There is no year-over-year change in the number of short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) and medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) launchers, though the number of total missiles in both cases have been revised. In 2019, the Pentagon said that China had between 750 and 1,500 SRBMs and between 150 and 450 MRBMs, while it simply said that the country had more than 600 SRBMs and more than 150 MRBMs in 2020. SRBMs are defined as ballistic missiles with ranges between 300 kilometers (186 miles) and 1,000 kilometers (621 miles), while MRBMs can reach distances of between 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles). The most dramatic change in the Pentagon’s assessment of the PLARF’s ballistic missile inventory between 2019 and 2020 was with regards to intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM), which have ranges between 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and 5,500 kilometers (3,417 miles). At present, China’s sole operational IRBM is understood to be the DF-26 , “which is capable of conducting both conventional and nuclear precision strikes against ground targets, as well as conventional strikes against naval targets,” according to the Pentagon. The Chinese military highlighted its long-range anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities in a recent major exercise in the South China Sea. DF-26s on parade. , Imaginechina via AP The new report says that the total number of DF-26 road-mobile transporter-erector-launchers has surged from 80 to 200, while the total number of actual missiles has risen from between 80 and 160 to over 200. The DF-26 is rapidly becoming one of the most important missiles in China’s arsenal, but there does not appear to have been any public discussion from Chinese authorities about such a significant expansion of this part of the PLARF. The Pentagon offers no context for how it arrived at this estimate. The DOD’s estimates of the size of China’s ground-based ballistic missile and ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) arsenals as of 2020., DOD Those same estimates as of 2019., DOD Adding 120 new TELs would very likely reflect a notable increase in the overall DF-26 force, as well as supporting elements and infrastructure. Experts have openly questioned whether this might be a typo, with the launcher figure being an accidental copy-paste of the missile figure, or some kind of other error. There is at least one clear quantitative error elsewhere in the new Pentagon report, with another section of the text saying the PLARF only has 200 SRBM launchers, instead of 250, as found in tables in both the 2020 and 2019 editions. In addition to the ground-based ballistic missiles, the Pentagon report also notes that the People’s Liberation Army has six Type 094 Jin class ballistic missile submarines , “four operational and two outfitting at Huludao Shipyard,” each of which can carry up to 12 nuclear-tipped JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles . The combination of the Type 094s and the JL-2s, which China also paraded publicly last year, represent “the country’s first viable sea-based nuclear deterrent.” The Chinese are also working to develop a follow-on ballistic missile submarine, known as the Type 096, as well as an improved submarine-launched ballistic missile, the JL-3. JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles on trucks during a parade in 2019., China Military The DOD report also raises the possibility that the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 055 warships , which it classifies as cruisers, rather than destroyers, may be able to carry anti-ship ballistic missiles of some kind in the future. It has been previously reported that the CM-401 short-range anti-ship ballistic missile, which the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation unveiled in 2018, might be a future armament for the Type 055. The assessment does not appear to be talking about the integration of larger ballistic missiles, such as anti-ship variants of the DF-21 or DF-26 , onto these ships. “In October 2019, China signaled the return of the airborne leg of its nuclear triad after the PLAAF publicly revealed the H-6N as its first nuclear-capable air-to-air refuelable bomber,” the report adds. “The H-6N features a modified fuselage that allows it to carry externally either a drone or an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) that may be nuclear capable.” A view of the underside of an H-6N bomber showing a semi-recessed area at the rear of the fuselage that could be used to carry an air-launched ballistic missile or other oversized payloads., Chinese Internet The report further notes that China continues work on a reportedly flying wing-type stealth bomber, known as the H-20, but it remains unclear when that aircraft may enter service. You can read more about the H-20 in these past War Zone pieces . There is no mention of a potential advanced regional bomber program, which the Defense Intelligence Agency discussed in its public report last year and is commonly referred to as the JH-XX. You can read more about that aircraft in this previous War Zone story . The Pentagon says that these developments are, at least in part, a component of broader efforts to expand the size and scope of the People’s Liberation Army’s nuclear capabilities. The 2020 assessment includes, for the first time ever, an estimate of how many nuclear warheads China has – “in the low-200s” – with the possibility of that stockpile doubling in the coming years. As many as 200 warheads may be capable of threatening the United Staes within the next five years, according to the review. A map showing the respective ranges of China’s existing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including the CSS-4 (DF-5) ICBM, CSS-5 (DF-21) MRBM, and CSS-10 (DF-31) ICBM, in addition to the DF-26 IRBM and DF-41 ICBM., DOD Another map showing the range of China’s various SRBMs, as well as the DF-26, in comparison to other conventional strike capabilities, including ground and air-launched land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles. The DF-17, a ballistic missile-type rocket booster armed with hypersonic boost-glide vehicle is notably included in the “land attack missile” ring., DOD The report offers limited detail about how the Pentagon arrived at this assessment, saying that it is due in part to the expected introduction of more MIRVed DF-41s. However, it also says “China probably has enough nuclear materials to at least double its warhead stockpile without new fissile material production,” but that it “will require increased nuclear warhead production” in order to make this a reality. The “low-200s” warhead estimate is also notably lower than past Defense Intelligence Agency assessments , as well as those from experts outside of the U.S. government, and may only reflect deployed weapons and not those held in reserve. This assessment itself is based in part in the Pentagon’s belief that China is looking to reorganize and improve its nuclear forces to better withstand a potential first strike. It says specifically: “The PRC’s nuclear weapons policy prioritizes the maintenance of a nuclear force able to survive a first strike and respond with sufficient strength to inflict unacceptable damage on an enemy. China is enhancing peacetime readiness levels for these nuclear forces to ensure their responsiveness. In addition, China insists its new generation of mobile missiles, with warheads consisting of MIRVs and penetration aids, are intended to ensure the viability of its strategic nuclear forces in the face of continued advances in U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Russian strategic ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance], precision strike, and missile defense capabilities. India also plays a factor in China’s nuclear threat perceptions.” Part of this increased peacetime readiness could include the expansion of the PLARF’s silo-based ICBM force, according to the Pentagon. With regards to this development, it says: “Commercial imagery from 2019 has revealed that China has constructed an ICBM silo at one of the PLARF’s Western training ranges that is smaller than China’s existing CSS-4 (DF-5) silos. According to state media, the CSS-X-20 (DF-41) ICBM can be launched from silos; this site is probably being used to at least develop a concept of operations for silo basing this system. There  are  also  some indications that China may be building new CSS-4 (DF-5) ICBM silos.” … “Their size precludes use by the DF-5 and may support concept development for a silo-based DF-41 or one of China’s smaller ICBMs. When taken with China’s past concerns about silo survivability and ongoing strategic early warning developments, these new silos provide further evidence China is moving to a LOW [launch-on-warning] posture.” Launch-on-warning refers to a nuclear deterrent policy to launch a massive counterstrike upon detecting incoming nuclear threats. This helps ensure that a retaliatory strike can be successfully initiated before the hostile weapons reach their targets. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) was the first to spot the silo at the PLARF’s nuclear missile training site near Jilantai in the Gobi Desert and released its own assessment in September 2019. FAS said that it was possible that this silo, which is a distinctly different design from the ones China uses for the DF-5, could be part of the development of an alternate basing option for the DF-41 or for some other future solid-fuel ballistic missile. Satellite imagery of the silo at the PLARF training site near Jilantai that DOD included in its 2020 report on China’s military to Congress., DOD However, at present, there does not appear to be any further public evidence of new Chinese silo construction for the DF-41 to further support the Pentagon’s assessment. There is also mention of possible rail-mobile DF-41s, something China reportedly tested in 2015 , but it is unclear how seriously the PLARF is exploring this capability. The Soviet Union notably did deploy a similar system during the Cold War, the RT-23 Molodets , and Russia more recently looking into bringing that capability back before shelving those plans in favor of missiles armed with nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, known as Avangard. The Pentagon also separately said that China’s nuclear arsenal could grow to include new warheads, including a potential lower-yield warhead for the DF-26, and new delivery systems. A lower yield nuclear weapon could indicate that the Chinese military may bee looking at a so-called escalate-to-deescalate policy, in which a limited nuclear strike could be used to bring a quick end to a conflict before outside powers might be able to intervene or to otherwise dissuade them from doing so. The U.S. government says that Russia has such a policy in its nuclear doctrine, but experts dispute that it exists. The U.S. government has accused China , as well as Russia , of conducting low-yield nuclear tests in violation of international agreements, which could support the development of new nuclear weapons, but has not publicly provided evidence to substantiate this. In addition, as The War Zone , among others, has pointed out in the past , so-called sub-critical nuclear testing, in which there is no actual nuclear detonation, is permitted under existing arms control regimes and the U.S. conducts such experimentation, as well. All of this comes as the United States is engaged in negotiations with Russia about extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which limits the number of nuclear warheads and various strategic delivery systems that each country can have, and is otherwise set to sunset next year. The U.S. government has been campaigning to bring China into the discussions and potentially expand the deal into a trilateral arrangement. China has expressed virtually no interest in doing so. Beyond a spike in geopolitical friction with Washington over a host of different issues, Beijing is unlikely to see any benefit in making itself a party to such an agreement in the near future given that its existing nuclear arsenal is so small compared to that of the U.S. and Russian militaries. The Pentagon looks to be making a case in its latest China assessment for getting them to accept limits now before they can expand the size of their stockpile. Chinese officials have already countered these calls by saying it would be willing to talk nuclear arms control with the United States if it agreed to reduce its arsenal to China’s level first. Whether or not the Chinese grow their ballistic missile and nuclear forces in the ways that the Pentagon expects, it is clear that the People’s Liberation Army is working to significantly expand its capabilities in both regards to better challenge the United States, as well as other potential adversaries.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2021",The Day The Royal Air Force Lost Six Jet Fighters In Just 45 Minutes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The early days of jet fighter operations were notoriously hazardous, especially when the rate of non-combat losses is compared with today’s accident rates. But even by the standards of the 1950s, the loss of six aircraft in a single peacetime mission was highly unusual. At 1050 hours on the morning of February 8, 1956, eight Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter F1 jet fighters began taking off from their base at West Raynham, Norfolk, for a routine four-versus-four aerial combat exercise that would be conducted at around 45,000 feet over the airfield. The jets belonged to the Day Fighter Leader School, part of the Central Fighter Establishment, the RAF unit responsible for the development of fighter aircraft tactics. Two of the jets were flown by instructor pilots, while the other six had student pilots at their controls. The eight Day Fighter Leader Squadron Hunter F1s lined up at RAF West Raynham before their fateful flight., TERRY FLEMING After around 20 minutes’ flying, the pilots had completed their maneuvers and, with the Hunters starting to run low on fuel, it was time for them to return to base. However, the weather over West Raynham had now deteriorated, and they were instead diverted to RAF Marham , approximately 20 miles south. At this point, the jets had sufficient fuel left for around 20 minutes of flying. Once at Marham, the Hunters were running critically low on fuel. Compounding matters, the weather at Marham had now worsened, too, with cloud and fog sweeping in from the North Sea, meaning visibility was reduced “alarmingly quickly,” and the base’s air traffic controllers were unfamiliar with the Hunter. The fighters now dropped down to around 2,000 feet and formed up in pairs separated by 30-second intervals. The first pair of Hunters emerged from the cloud to find fog and quickly lost sight of each other. The lead jet overshot the runway while his wingman touched down safely at Marham — total flying time, 42 minutes. The lead also got down safely, but it required three more circuits and the jet’s fuel tanks were empty by the time it rolled off the runway. The next pair was less lucky. The pilot of one Hunter struggled to find the runway through the fog, before making the decision to climb to altitude and then eject. The pilot of the fourth jet elected to continue his approach to the runway, but his jet crashed in a field a couple of miles from the airstrip, and he was tragically killed. Of the next two fighters, one was down to the last few gallons of fuel in its tanks and, after an aborted approach, the pilot also made the call to eject. His wingman, meanwhile, made a low approach before spotting trees in his path, forcing him to pull up. He made another circuit around the airfield at 150 feet and was on approach before the Hunter’s engine flamed out. The fighter overshot the runway and then belly-landed beyond it. The Ground Control Approach caravan at RAF West Raynham at the time of the incident. , TERRY FLEMING In the chaos that ensued, the pilots of the two remaining fuel-starved aircraft abandoned their approaches and then ejected in quick succession — from 4,000 feet and 2,500 feet. Their aircraft came down in open country, around the area of Swaffham, where local firefighters dealt with the flames. The four pilots who had ejected didn’t suffer any serious injuries and there were no civilian casualties. Questions were soon asked in parliament as to what exactly had gone wrong. Of particular concern was the fact that limited fuel loads had also been a factor in an accident the previous November, when three out of five jets, two of them Hunters, crashed in southeast England. In this incident, too, the jets had run out of fuel after poor weather forced them to divert to another airfield. A pre-delivery photo of RAF Hunter F1 WT594., THE AVIATION HISTORIAN The day after the accident, a Labour member of parliament, George Wigg, noted in the Commons that “there has always been a suspicion that [the Hunter] Marks I and II are liable to be deficient in fuel if a crisis arises” and then questioned whether the Ground Control Approach (GCA) system used to aid landings in poor weather at the two bases had broken down. The Secretary of State for Air, Nigel Birch, confirmed that it was indeed the problematic Rolls-Royce Avon -engined Hunter F1 that had been involved. “I would point out that all modern fighter aircraft have quite short flying duration, and the difficulty is that the lower they get the higher is their fuel consumption,” he noted and confirmed that all aircraft had taken off with full fuel loads. A member of parliament (MP) from the Labour Party, John Strachey, commented that “There is increasing anxiety in the House at the apparent fact that the modifications which have taken place in the Hunter aircraft have not made it capable of flying effectively in the conditions of service life.” Hunter WT680 is one of a handful of surviving F1 variants, now preserved outside a motel in Lincolnshire, England., ALAN WILSON/CREATIVE COMMONS In April 1956, the results of the inquiry into the accident were made public. It became clear that the decision to take off that morning from West Raynham, despite poor weather, was based on a forecast suggesting that “an improvement was likely.” This prognosis had been confirmed by a weather reconnaissance flight by a Hunter from West Raynham at 0930 hours. However, the co-located Air Fighting Development School had canceled its flying operations for the day. It was found that while West Raynham’s GCA was unserviceable, that at Marham was working normally. The Secretary of State for Air then recounted what happened next: “Bad weather procedure was in force from the commencement of the exercise and pilots had been briefed before the flight to return overhead West Raynham at 20,000 feet by 1115 hours. This timing took into account the endurance of the aircraft. Sufficient time was allowed for controlled descents to be completed by 1130 at the diversion airfields. By 1100 hours the weather at West Raynham had deteriorated, and it was therefore decided by West Raynham that, at the end of the exercise, the aircraft should be diverted to Marham, where visual landings were then practicable. The aircraft returned overhead 20,000 feet [at] West Raynham in accordance with their flight instructions just after 1110 hours. When they started to descend from this altitude under the control of West Raynham the weather was, in fact, still suitable for visual circuits and landings at Marham. Visibility deteriorated very suddenly during the few critical minutes when the descent and handover of ground control from West Raynham to Marham were in progress. This rapid change in the weather made Ground Control Approach landings imperative, but insufficient time was available to make the necessary change in procedure. The pilots were already approaching Marham prepared for, and committed to, visual landings, and were consequently so closely spaced that it was impossible to effect individual identification and to establish effective Ground Control Approach control. At this stage there was no time or fuel left to bring the aircraft under Ground Control Approach control in order to carry out the landings. At the time of the accidents the weather conditions at Marham were cloud base 600 feet with visibility 800 to 1,000 yards in slight rain and drizzle with fog, and deteriorating. As far as it is possible to tell, the sudden deterioration was due to the presence of an extensive sheet of stratus cloud which spread into Norfolk unexpectedly from the sea during the late morning. The evidence taken at the Court of Inquiry indicates that the accidents were primarily caused by the sudden and unexpected deterioration in the weather. The question then arises whether, notwithstanding the deterioration that had taken place at West Raynham, the decision taken to divert the aircraft to Marham, spaced for visual landings, was correct. This diversion was ordered on the assumption that visual landings would be possible. The Court of Inquiry came to the conclusion that this assumption constituted an error of judgment on the part of the Control staff at West Raynham who failed to appreciate that, because of the relative positions of the two airfields, it was probable that any deterioration in the weather at West Raynham would affect Marham shortly afterwards, thus necessitating Ground Control Approach landings there.” After a review of all the facts, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, RAF Fighter Command, decided to take disciplinary action against the officers responsible for flying operations at West Raynham at the time. One officer was removed from his position and three others disciplined. “I am satisfied that, having regard to the meteorological forecast, confirmed by a special weather reconnaissance flight, it was a proper and reasonable decision for the exercise to take place. I am also satisfied that the pilots were competent to undertake the flights; that the aircraft were serviceable and had adequate fuel for the exercise, and that the endurance of the aircraft had no direct bearing on the accidents — this factor having been provided for in the flight arrangements,” the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief concluded. The loss of six jet fighters in a single day, let alone in the space of 45 minutes, seems incredible now, even more so the fact that these Hunters were among the latest and most sophisticated equipment to have been delivered to the RAF. The reason for their loss — simply running out of fuel — makes the event all the more extraordinary. It’s a reminder, however, of a very different time in military aviation, in which the loss of aircraft — and the loss of human life — was a sadly regular occurrence.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For a company that is facing two existential crises the likes of which they have never dealt with before, keeping a 151-foot superyacht isn’t the best look. Likely with this in mind, Boeing has reportedly sold-off Daedalus , the plane maker’s blue and white corporate yacht that was built by Seattle’s Delta Marine in 1999. Yachtharbour.com describes Daedelus as such: Daedalus is a 46.03 m / 151′1″ luxury motor yacht. She was built by Delta Marine in 1999. With a beam of 9.57 m and a draft of 2.2 m, she has a GRP hull and GRP superstructure. She is powered by Caterpillar engines of 1000 hp each giving her a maximum speed of 16.5 knots and a cruising speed of 12 knots. The motor yacht can accommodate 10 guests in cabins with an interior design by Jonathan Quinn Barnett and an exterior design by Ron Holland. You can see some photos of the vessel’s interior here , although we don’t know how current they are. It was refitted in 2006. At the time of Dadealus’s delivery, Boeing was in a very different place. Air travel was expanding, especially in Asia, and the dot-com boom was nearing its peak. It was the same year that the Boeing Business Jet was officially introduced into service—private 737s specially outfitted for the swankiest of clientele. So yeah, a corporate Boeing yacht? Why not!? Boeing’s fortunes are sitting firmly at the bottom of the trough today. The 737 MAX scandal upended the storied planemaker before the COVID-19 global epidemic ravaged the airline industry unlike any time in history. To say that Boeing currently has its share of problems is a vast understatement. As such, when times get tough, the family boat is usually the first thing to go. While Boeing once built yachts —not to mention commercial and military hydrofoils —and there are even Boeing airliners made into yachts , why exactly would the Boeing Corporation of our current era even need something like this? Apparently, the yacht was a corporate toy used primarily to entertain executives and VIPs. The Puget Sound Business Journal writes: The Boeing yacht has been used for entertaining and hosting the airplane giant’s corporate customers, strengthening corporate relationships and philanthropy. In the summers, the Daedalus was often based at Vancouver Island, where its primary role was as a small floating hotel, providing a way for Boeing sales teams and airline customers to get away for fishing trips and conversations in a private setting. In the winters, it was often the setting for small luxe dinners, bought by high bidders at a variety of charity auctions. According to the Puget Sound Business Journal, Daedalus was sold for $13M in a fast transaction that forewent the normal inspections. The Lake Union-based super yacht’s new owner is an unnamed California property developer. It will reportedly undergo a refit, which will include the installation of a master suite, at its Delta Marine birthplace before heading for its new homeport of San Diego. It will supposedly accompany an 80-foot sportfishing yacht that the owner bought to sail alongside Daedalus into sealife-rich fishing grounds. Considering the company is laying off thousands of workers , many of whom are in Washington, it is probably high-time the executive yacht sets sail once and for all from the corporate balance sheet.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 15, 2023",How Israel Got This MiG-21 That Sean Connery Posed Next To Was Like A Real-Life Bond Movie,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The death of the actor Sean Connery at the age of 90 this weekend saw accolades from across the worlds of cinema, celebrity, politics, and more. Among those acknowledgments of Connery’s passing was an intriguing photo posted on the Israeli Air Force’s Twitter feed , which showed the late actor posing alongside a MiG-21 with the number “007” painted on the side, a reference to the fictional British super-spy James Bond, who the movie star had played in multiple films. The story of how the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad brought this Iraqi jet back to Israel is an extraordinary one, the result of an intelligence coup that could itself have been lifted straight from a Bond movie. Sean Connery died in his sleep on October 31, 2020, after a period of illness. The Scottish-born actor was perhaps best known for playing Bond in the first film in that franchise, Dr. No , in 1962, and other movies in the series. The British Royal Navy veteran also took on many memorable roles in war and action movies including The Longest Day , A Bridge Too Far , The Hunt for Red October , and The Rock . Other security services beyond the Israeli Air Force (IAF) also acknowledged Connery’s passing. The IAF’s Twitter post is certainly the most eye-catching, however. “In 1967,” the accompanying text read, “Connery visited Israel and took this historic picture with then IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Moti Hod with the background of an Iraqi MiG-21, numbered ‘007’ after Bond. RIP.” It’s not exactly clear why Connery was in Israel, although the visit seems to have occurred in November 1967, after the Six-Day War fought in June between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The most well-known part of the story begins with the Iraqi Air Force MiG-21F-13 Fishbed — among the very first production versions of this iconic Soviet-made jet — landing at Hatzor Air Base in central Israel, on August 16, 1966. At the controls was an Iraqi defector, Munir Redfa. When touching down in Israel, the jet still wore its Iraqi Air Force markings and carried the Arabic serial number “534” on its nose. Redfa was an ethnic Assyrian and a Christian. As such, according to the Israeli official account, he saw no future for himself amid the religious and ethnic persecution that accompanied the increasingly turbulent Iraqi politics of the mid-1960s. Redfa, it is said, requested political asylum, and in return, Israel now had one of the most capable jet fighters flown by its adversaries in its possession. Taking this evidence alone, the covert acquisition of the Fishbed — under an operation known to Mossad by the codename Diamond and to the Israeli Air Force as Blue Bird — was a success. The reality was much more complex and left a bloody trail of destruction in its wake. Operation Diamond From at least as early as 1960, Israel launched efforts to encourage Arab military pilots to defect with their aircraft, in order to fully analyze their capabilities. In Israel’s Secret Wars , Ian Black and Benny Morris record how, beginning in that year, Jean Leon Thomas, an agent working in Egypt for Israel intelligence, apparently offered cash rewards to Egyptian Air Force pilots to defect to Israel. This early plan backfired after the agent was reported to the Egyptian Air Force Police and then arrested, along with five suspected accomplices. Thomas and two others were executed in December 1962. Israel did get its hands on a defecting Egyptian aircraft in 1964, but the piston-engined Yakovlev Yak-11 Moose trainer, which first entered Soviet service in the immediate aftermath of World War II. It was hardly the intelligence windfall that it had hoped for. The pilot in question, Captain Mohammad Abbas Helmy, emigrated to South America, where he was assassinated soon after, according to the account provided in Arab MiGs — Volume 2 , by Tom Cooper and David Nicolle. Mossad then saw its opportunity to get the intelligence on the cutting-edge fighter jets that it needed when it learned that a group of Iraqi Air Force pilots were due to start training on staff courses at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, in early 1965. The tipoff came from a Mossad contact in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. His codename was “Yusuf,” and he was an — allegedly — illiterate Iraqi Jew who would play a central role in the story. In the account provided by Ephraim Kahana in Strategic Intelligence , Yusuf’s information was passed to Mossad via Iran, which at that time maintained good relations with Israel. The agency’s plan reportedly involved deploying female agents to lure the Iraqi pilots in a classic “honeytrap” operation. One of those Iraqi pilots, Hamid Dhahee, was reportedly shot to death in a Texas bar, in June 1965, after apparently refusing the defection proposal offered by one of the agents. An identical MiG-21 variant as the one Israel sought from Iraqi defectors. , USAF It seems that the Iraqi Air Force wound up its training program in the United States soon after, but not before Mossad’s agents had managed to establish “relationships” with at least three more of the pilots, and then followed them back to Iraq. One of these contacts quickly broke down, however, leading to an Iraqi Air Force captain reportedly being shot dead in a Baghdad apartment by a local Mossad informant, in July 1965. A second Iraqi Air Force pilot reportedly met a similar fate, being thrown out of a train while visiting Germany for medical treatment in February 1966. According to Iraqi Air Force accounts, this pilot was assassinated after making excessive financial demands in exchange for his defection. The third Iraqi pilot was Captain Munir Redfa. He was married, but had supposedly had an affair — with an Israeli agent — while in the United States. Redfa also had a family connection to the agent Yusuf, being married to his girlfriend’s sister. According to Israeli accounts, Redfa was the most suitable candidate for Operation Diamond as he had been passed over for promotion in the past and was unhappy at having to fly combat missions against the Iraqi Kurds, another marginalized ethnic group in the country. An alternative account points to Redfa’s appointment as commanding officer of his squadron and the fact he was trusted to attend a training course at Randolph, where the possibility of defection was real. Ephraim Kahana contends that the relationship between Redfa and the female Mossad agent was set up in Europe, where the two holidayed together in July 1966. In this account, the agent encouraged Redfa to fly with him to Israel, where he was “given VIP treatment” and offered citizenship and a reward of $1 million. If true, this seems like an extraordinary risk to have taken, should the Iraqi authorities have found out once he returned to his country. Kahana also says that during his visit to Israel, Redfa met in person with Major General Mordechai “Moti” Hod — the commander of the Israeli Air Force who was later photographed with Connery and the prized “007” jet. Other meetings that seem certain to have happened involved Redfa and the female Mossad agent that he had met in the United States. Reportedly, they met frequently in Baghdad and it seems likely that Mossad would have gathered evidence that could be used to compromise the Iraqi pilot if required. Whatever the truth of the matter, confronted by the evidence of his affair, a generous financial incentive, offer of Israeli citizenship, and with two of his colleagues apparently already assassinated, it seems that Redfa saw little option but to defect. After Mossad had helped his family members’ safe evacuation to Iran, to avoid possible recriminations from the Iraqi authorities, Redfa broke off from a routine navigation training mission from Habbaniyah Air Base, west of Baghdad, on August 16, 1966. He turned west, passing over Jordan at a high level, putting his MiG-21 beyond the reach of Royal Jordanian Air Force Hawker Hunter jet fighters that were reportedly sent to intercept him. Once in Israeli airspace, he was met by a pair of Israeli Air Force Mirage IIICJ fighters, which escorted him into Hatzor. Despite the secrecy surrounding the background of the operation, Israel was quick to show Redfa’s MiG-21F-13 to the foreign press soon after its arrival. That the country was happy to at least reference the cloak-and-dagger approach to securing the jet is made clear by the application of the “007” serial number sometime before Connery’s November 1967 visit to Israel. At some point the Fishbed received outsized Syrian Arab Air Force markings, apparently to increase the level of realism for the dissimilar air combat training sessions staged for Israeli Air Force pilots. A thorough study of the jet in the course of over 100 hours of flight testing within a 12-month period — and intelligence debriefing of Redfa — provided Israel with plenty of valuable data on the fighter’s capabilities. All this knowledge would be put to good use in subsequent air wars with the country’s Arab neighbors, beginning with the Six-Day War of June 1967. Remarkably, the MiG-21F-13 was also pressed into action by the Israelis in the 1967 conflict, at a time when the Israeli Air Force needed every serviceable aircraft it could lay its hands on. Repainted in high-visibility Israeli markings, it was armed with Israeli-made Shafrir air-to-air missiles. The jet stood on quick reaction alert duty at Hatzor, but Israeli accounts suggest it was never scrambled. Have Doughnut As well as providing intelligence to the Israeli Air Force, the ex-Iraqi MiG-21 also took part in the Have Doughnut program in the United States, for which Israel loaned the jet for use by the Air Force Systems Command’s Foreign Technology Division. According to Steve Davies’ account in Red Eagles: America’s Secret MiGs , Israel agreed to the transfer only on the condition that the United States would sell it F-4 Phantom II fighter jets in return. The “007” jet was active in the United States between January and April 1968, completing 102 flights and 77 flying hours, operating over Groom Lake, Nevada, using the designation YF-110. This clandestine program was a forerunner to Constant Peg , during which a variety of captured and acquired Soviet-made fighter jets were operated under extreme secrecy from Nevada’s Tonopah Test Range Airport in the late 1970s and 1980s. A MiG-21F-13 painted up as the famous “007.” This particular aircraft was acquired from Indonesian stocks., BUKVOED/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS While an aircraft painted to resemble the ex-Iraqi MiG-21 is now on display at the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim, very few details about the subsequent life of its pilot, Munir Redfa are available. Redfa, however, is known to have remained in Israel, where he died of a heart attack in “around 1998.” On the other hand, much like James Bond himself, the legend of the “007” MiG-21 looks set to endure.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Jan 30, 2020",Pilots Provide Fascinating Commentary On Video Of America’s Secret Red Eagles MiG Squadron,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that America flew an assortment of captured and acquired Russian fighter jets under extreme secrecy as part of a program dubbed Constant Peg in the late 1970s and 1980s. The 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron “Red Eagles” that conducted these highly classified missions, operated from the secluded Tonopah Test Range (TTR) airfield in a corner of the Nevada Test and Training Range in order to provide exposure to frontline U.S. fighter pilots of these valuable “assets.” The War Zone has previously reported on a video clip that showed extremely rare footage of a “Red Eagles” MiG-23 in action at Tonopah during the era of Constant Peg, a program founded and commanded by Colonel Gail Peck . Now, a much longer version of this footage has been published by Red Eagles book author Steve Davies , on his YouTube channel 10 Percent True . The film not only provides new insight into the operations of the “Red Eagles” during this period, but it also includes candid reactions and commentary from two of the pilots that flew these aircraft. The video gives incredible insight into the day-to-day operations of the “Red Eagles,” which operated at an extremely high level of classification. Russian MiG-21s, MiG-23s, and Chinese Chengdu F7s, are shown conducting missions from Tonopah, as they depart and recover from their sorties that were flown against U.S. military frontline fighter pilots. The missions were designed to give these aviators a taste of what it was like to meet real enemy aircraft in combat. You can watch the video and a follow-up Q&A here: The footage gives some indication of the scale of the Red Eagles’ activities at the height of Constant Peg, with one sequence showing no less than seven MiG-21s/F7s, on the flightline for a mass launch and another of a hangar packed with over a dozen “Fishbeds.” Another departure sequence shows another mass launch of MiG-23s and MiG-21s, possibly to take part in a mission in support of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. A MiG-23 Flogger on the flightline at Tonopah., YouTube Screencap The video also includes never before publicly seen footage of Red Eagles operations around the original hangars built at Tonopah for Constant Peg, and these still stand today. Three of these Red Eagles hangars are the largest on the base, with 160-foot wide hangar doors. The Red Eagles were part of America’s shadowy foreign materiel exploitation (FME) program, and dedicated towards training. The unit’s existence gave rise to the Tonopah Test Range Airport, which eventually also housed the 4450th Tactical Group’s F-117A Nighthawks , again in total secrecy . The FME program also included the 6513th Flight Test Squadron “Red Hats,” which was a unit dedicated towards the testing and evaluation of these captured assets from nearby Groom Lake, better known as Area 51. Members of the “Red Eagles” woth one of the unit’s MiG-21s., USAF Although the original 4477th TES and Constant Peg program was shut down in 1988, the Red Eagles continued on, with more advanced types, such as Su-27s and MiG-29s , flown by American pilots. Reports continue regarding the unit’s activities , indicating secretive operations to this very day at the Air Force’s clandestine flight test center at Groom Lake. Meanwhile, Tonopah continues to host the F-117s in its semi-retired state, as well as a number of other programs that are cloaked in secrecy. It is also where a significant amount of FME “assets” are stored, including everything from ballistic missile launchers to enemy radar systems. Video like this of Tonopah during its formative years and the activities of the clandestine Red Eagles remains extremely rare. It provides a fascinating insight into the lengths the U.S. military will go to in order to provide accurate, threat representative training, to its forces.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Dec 15, 2020",New Aggressor Squadron At Nellis Air Force Base Will Have Both F-16s And F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is moving forward with plans to field an increased fleet of high-end aggressor aircraft at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. It plans to re-activate the 65th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS) next year to complement the existing 64th AGRS, which traditionally flies Block 25/32 F-16Cs. The additional unit is planned to fly a mix of more advanced Block 42 F-16C/D Vipers, as well as early block F-35A stealth fighters. This confirms USAF plans announced in 2019 to draft a batch of its earliest Lightning IIs into the aggressor role. “The goal for the aggressors has always been where we are essentially matching the aggressiveness of our global competitors,” explains Lt Col Jan “Kuts” Stahl, an experienced aggressor pilot and deputy commander of the 57th Operations Group. “They are fielding technology at a rapid pace, and our goal has always been to match, and if possible exceed, that level of technological advancement. So, the threat that we are preparing the warfighter for locally exceeds anything that they’re ever likely to face in battle.” The Nellis aggressor forces are heavily engaged with presenting realistic threats to aircrews in order to better prepare them for combat. The new set-up will far better enable the USAF to train “Blue Force” aviators on how to face the most modern enemy threats. The reactivated 65th Aggressor Squadron will likely field up to a dozen F-35s , with their advanced software tailored to help accurately mimic specific advanced airborne threats. Combined with the skill of the aggressor pilots, it will represent a potent force with which to train both the latest Weapons School students, as well as aircrews visiting Nellis for high-end exercises, such as Red Flag . It will also help to properly tax the operational test community as it evaluates the latest combat air forces capabilities and tactics. The aggressor F-35As will likely be drawn from the 58th Fighter Squadron at Eglin AFB., Jamie Hunter In parallel with the addition of F-35s, internal USAF reorganization has resulted in a decision to close down the 24th Tactical Air Support Squadron [TASS], that flies Vipers at Nellis. The unit is currently a centralized location for training F-16 Close Air Support (CAS) instructors and for retaining a dedicated close air support knowledge base. This was conceived partially to help mitigate the possible retirement of the A-10 Thunderbolt II. You can read more about this arrangement in this past War Zone piece . However, with the A-10 now remaining in service and even getting major upgrades , the 24th TASS role is being dispersed to other units, which has presented an important opportunity to use these F-16s to plus-up the Nellis aggressors. “We currently have 19 pre-Block F-16s [Block 25 and 32] and the game plan is to take over an additional 11 Block 42 F-16s,” says Stahl. “Initially, when the 24th TASS shuts down, the 64th AGRS is going to become a very large squadron, but there are efforts underway to reactivate the 65th AGRS — around the summer of 2021 — when we split those assets into two units to make them a bit more manageable,” Stahl explains. On January 12, 2006, Lt Col Larry “Bo” Bruce took command of the 65th AGRS as it reformed at Nellis with F-15C/D Eagles, as part of a dramatic expansion of resident aggressor forces. However, extreme budget pressures led to the unit being axed in 2014 as part of an overall force reduction in the wake of sequestration . A handful of F-15C/Ds were initially retained under the 64th AGRS, but these were eventually dispersed to other units. “Nellis needed aggressors more than ever at that time,” says Lt Col Stahl. “As a matter of fact, the F-35 footprint here at Nellis was just beginning to get spun up at that point, as well. We were going to need more aggressors, not less. The aggressors that we did have needed that next level of capability in order to provide a challenging sparring partner to the fifth-generation fighter pilots.” Stahl says that closing down the aggressor Eagle squadron was unavoidable at the time, but that it was a decision “we are now having to deal with the after-effects of.” An F-15C of the 65th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS) flies alongside an F-16C of the 64th AGRS., Jamie Hunter “The combined fielded aggressor forces we have here at Nellis [today] is barely able to fill 70 or so percent of our optimal demand for adversary forces. That’s what led the air force to look at alternative courses of action, such as contract aggressors , as well as inviting visiting units from elsewhere to come and help us out. Because of the demands that were put on the adversaries here at Nellis, it was clear from the get-go that we weren’t going to be able to shut down a unit like the 65th and immediately replace it with something equivalent. The fielding of contract aggressor forces was always intended to be a multi-year process in which initially we put jets on the line to fill more of the demand for quantity as opposed to the demand for quality,” Stahl explains. While contract adversaries have taken some of the strain off the air force’s organic aggressor force, Stahl says that the organization is looking to stimulate companies to gradually build up to a point where they’re financially and operationally able to field airframes of higher capability. This will work in tandem with the upscaling of in-house resources. The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) directly highlighted a need to address near-peer threats. Concerns have been leveled that the USAF is losing ground in the technology battle; with a need to focus on high-end warfare, which has been eroded due to relentless combat deployments focused on counter-insurgency operations that have been such a taxing demand for squadrons. The 64th AGRS will likely retain the earlier Block 25/32 aircraft, with the Block 42s flowing over to the 65th AGRS as that unit is reactivated. “That’s when it gets really interesting, because that’s when the early block F-35s start arriving here at Nellis and moving into the 65th AGRS, which then becomes a mixed F-35 and F-16 aggressor squadron,” Stahl adds. He says that plans are still in a state of flux, but the Nellis aggressor community expects to see the first F-35s for the mission arriving at the Nevada base sometime in the spring. 64th AGRS F-16Cs return from a mission supporting the USAF Weapons School., Jamie Hunter Alongside the F-35s, the introduction of Block 42 F-16 Vipers will bring additional benefits for the aggressors. Their Link 16 data links will be an early boost for the USAF aggressors at Nellis. Some of the current F-16s with the 64th AGRS carry the SADL (Situational Awareness Data Link), which serves as an intra-flight link between the aggressors. Link 16 will enable the new 65th AGRS adversaries to make use of a full battlespace picture, and operate more independently as a coordinated team, instead of a more traditional approach of working with Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) controllers at Nellis. It’s also worth noting that the F-35A has full link 16 capability, so it can receive information from the Vipers while remaining fully stealthy and it can share information, as well, with a bit more risk of being detected. The Block 42 F-16 avionics architecture is also more readily able to support the fielding of new systems, such as the Angry Kitten pod, that was recently adopted by the 64th AGRS. This pod incorporates advanced radio frequency (RF) jamming technology that can counter increasingly sophisticated electronic warfare threats. The Operational Flight Program (OFP) in the later block F-16s is more frequently updated and readily able to accept enhancements that can help keep the aggressors relevant. An Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar is another capability that the aggressor F-16s would benefit from, as increasing numbers of threat aircraft have these advanced sensors. The USAF is already fielding new Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 AESA radars in its F-16 fleet, and Stahl says for the aggressors; “it’s a capability that has to happen sooner or later.” Instead of targeting fleetwide capabilities, the aggressors are able to dip into new areas of technology to add small niche capabilities to help them replicate specific real-world threats. One of the 64th AGRS F-16s flew with a pod very similar to the Legion infrared search and track (IRST) pod in 2013, and Stahl says experimental work has also been undertaken with Litening and Sniper targeting pods to simulate IRST capability . “Fielding early F-35s will help us close that technology gap as well.” An F-16C of the 64th AGRS at Nellis AFB., Jamie Hunter The previous 57th Wing commander at Nellis AFB, Brig Gen Robert Novotny , first broke news of a possible aggressor mission for early batch F-35s in 2019. It was subsequently detailed that this would likely include some of the air force’s earliest Lightnings, which would be transferred from a training role with the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The F-35 will transform the USAF aggressors, which have in recent years relied on some of the oldest F-16s in the inventory to provide high-end threat replication. The “mass” of contract aggressors, which are currently providing a quantity of “Red Air” to support the Nellis aggressors, is now being combined with a steady increase in capability to provide high-end threat replication like never before seen. The addition of both Block 42 F-16s and F-35s will see a transformational leap in the training offered by the Nellis aggressors. With all this in mind, reforming the 65th Aggressor Squadron next year will arguably signal the biggest advance in USAF combat training since 2005. Pressing the F-35 into the adversary role will keep Nellis at the forefront of USAF training, and will cement its position as “The Home Of The Fighter Pilot.” A full version of The War Zone’s fascinating interview with Lt Col Stahl will be published soon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh issued an alert that seemed ripped right from a dystopian action movie. A tweet from @TravelGov, an official U.S. State Department account that highlights travel and other alerts from diplomatic missions around the world, read “#SaudiArabia: The Embassy is tracking reports of possible missiles or drones that may be headed toward Riyadh today, October 28. Stay alert. If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover.” #SaudiArabia : The Embassy is tracking reports of possible missiles or drones that may be headed toward Riyadh today, October 28. Stay alert. If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover. https://t.co/RlAoK12oku pic.twitter.com/fQF4RF2mOT — Travel – State Dept (@TravelGov) October 28, 2020 While the possible threat, which was never specifically described, has now reportedly passed , the idea that the U.S. government is putting out alerts for impending drone attacks is certainly a dark sign of the times we are entering into, ones in which warfare will be dominated by so-called “ suicide drones ,” also known as loitering munitions , and lower-end cruise missiles . While this has become all too apparent in recent conflicts abroad , the idea that it is a serious threat in the Capital of a major allied city, one with some of the most modern air defense weaponry in the world, points to how hard it is to defend against these types of attacks, which can come from third-party actors , as well as enemy states. The full announcement from the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia was even more jarring, as it offered steps to take if you are caught in a drone or missile attack. It reads: Location : Riyadh Event : The Embassy is no longer tracking reports of missiles or drones headed toward Riyadh.  However, the Embassy advises American citizens to continue to exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to terrorism and the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets.  Read our full advisory here https://sa.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/ . Reminder of Actions to Take During Missile/Drone Events: If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover. If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings. If you are outdoors, immediately seek cover in a hardened structure; if that is not possible, lie down and cover your head with your hands. Be aware that even if the incoming missile or drone is intercepted, falling debris represents a significant risk. After the attack, stay away from any debris, and monitor major news outlets for official guidance. For Assistance Contact: U.S. Embassy Riyadh The embassy in Riyadh has offered similar instructions on multiple occasions in the past few years in the wake of drone and missile strikes that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen have carried out on targets in Saudi Arabia. However, this appears to be the first time an alert was issued ahead of a potential attack. Regardless, while this notice definitely has a Cold War ‘ duck and cover ‘ vibe to it, the reality is the threat from these relatively rudimentary systems has literally and figuratively exploded , just as The War Zone has warned of for years , and no Capital or population center is safe from them at this time. As to what the particular threat was in this case and where the reports about this impending attack came from, it’s unclear. Earlier today, the Houthis claimed to have struck Abha International Airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia, which they have successfully targeted in the past. However, Saudi authorities said that they intercepted a number of incoming Houthi drones before they could reach their targets. Houthi drone attacks into southern areas of Saudi Arabia, as well as Saudi efforts to intercept them, have become a regular occurrence in recent years. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7E-bHW4L7B8 The Houthis have launched drones and missiles at targets deeper inside Saudi Arabia in the past, as well, including firing ballistic missiles at Riyadh in 2018. At least one of those incoming weapons was struck by a Patriot surface-to-air missile. In addition, in September 2019, significant parts of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure came under an unprecedented attack from drones and cruise missiles. The Houthis claimed responsibility for these strikes, but U.S. officials subsequently asserted that Iran had carried them out. Whatever the case, the incident led to the deployment of U.S. and other foreign forces to Saudi Arabia, as well as the Persian Gulf , to bolster that country’s own air and missile defenses. The Saudi Arabian military is also in the process of a massive expansion of its capabilities in this regard, including starting the process of acquiring a very large number of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense systems from the United States. Whatever the possible drone or missile threat was that prompted the State Department alert, the dangers that even lower-end weapons of these types pose are very real now and will only become more so in the future. In turn, warnings of potential incoming attacks, from the U.S. government and others, which just a very short while ago were something that would have been relegated to movies or television, will be increasingly the norm.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 20, 2020",Britain’s Cold War-Era Monster Destroyer Has Finally Been Retired,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Cold War military history is full of “might-have-beens,” with canceled projects ranging from nuclear-reactor-juggling tracked mecha-robots , to electron guns that would generate invisible radar-absorbing fields around spyplanes , to name just two. When it comes to the U.K. Royal Navy, this includes its lone Type 82 destroyer, HMS Bristol , which it just retired today. In the United Kingdom, the fate of the planned CVA-01 class of aircraft carrier remains another tantalizing “what if?” While the catapult assisted take-off, but arrested recovery ( CATOBAR ) flattop was canceled as a cost-saving measure in 1966, work did still progress on its planned escorts. The mighty Type 82 class guided-missile destroyers would have provided a defensive umbrella around the carrier. So big that it was sometimes described as a cruiser, only one example of the Type 82 was ever built, after which the Royal Navy concentrated its efforts on more modest-sized destroyers — at least until the arrival of today’s Type 45 class . The one-off Type 82 destroyer HMS Bristol was, at 507 feet long, marginally longer than the current Type 45, which measures 500 feet. For much of its career, the pioneering HMS Bristol was considered a “white elephant,” but it remained in Royal Navy service until today, October 28, 2020. It had spent its last days as a training vessel confined to the dockside at Her Majesty’s Naval Base, Portsmouth, on the south coast of England. HMS Bristol , the solitary Type 82 destroyer, was originally expected to be the lead example of a class of eight ships. These were to have provided both anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) support for the CVA-01 class of carriers, four of which were also envisaged for the Royal Navy. When the axe fell on the CVA-01 as a result of the 1966 Defence White Paper, the Type 82 building program was trimmed back to a single hull, which it was decided would serve primarily as a trials platform for new weapons and equipment. Construction work on HMS Bristol began at Swan Hunter in Tyne and Wear, northeast England, in November 1967 and the destroyer was launched in June 1969. Entering Royal Navy service in March 1973, the new destroyer was characterized by its unusual three-funnel arrangement that served a combined steam and gas turbine propulsion system. This was the last Royal Navy warship design to be powered by steam, bringing to an end a period of British maritime history that had begun in the early 1820s, with the first experiments using steam-powered warships . The destroyer’s primary armament included a twin GWS Mk 30 zero-length launcher for a total of 40 Sea Dart surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). HMS Bristol was the first warship to carry this ramjet-powered area-defense weapon that had a maximum range of 40 miles and could engage targets flying at altitudes up to 60,000 feet. Weighing 1,210 pounds, the Sea Dart missile utilized semi-active radar homing guidance. The twin Sea Dart launcher on HMS Bristol after its return from the Falklands in 1982., HUGH LLEWELYN/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Twenty Ikara missiles were provided for the ASW system, based around the GWS Mk 40 launcher. Ikara was an Australian-designed rocket-powered missile that could deliver a homing torpedo, or a nuclear depth charge, out to around 10 miles from the ship. Once in the drop zone, the Ikara’s payload was released under a parachute, then either detonating, in the case of the depth charge, or, if a torpedo, beginning its search pattern to hunt for a submarine. The Ikara was supplemented by a Limbo anti-submarine mortar, the basic design of which dates back to World War II. This weapon, optimized for shallow water engagements, consisted of a three-barrel launcher that fired three mortar bombs fused to create a three-dimensional explosive burst around the target. The bombs could be fitted with a pre-programmed pressure fuse or a delayed-action time fuse. The effective range was a little over half a mile. As well as being the first Royal Navy warship to be armed with the Sea Dart and Ikara, HMS Bristol introduced other innovations in its 4.5-inch-caliber Mk 8 main gun — a weapon that remains in service today — and its computerized Action Data Automated Weapons System Mk 2 (ADAWS-2), which coordinated the various weapons and sensors. Although the warship had a flight deck at the stern, a helicopter was not usually embarked as the vessel lacked a hangar or aviation facilities, a reflection of its original role as a carrier escort, where it was expected to work in cooperation with rotorcraft embarked in the carrier. Another deficit was long-range anti-ship weaponry, again expected to be handled by other elements of the carrier group, including embarked aircraft. After entering service, HMS Bristol spent much of the 1970s undertaking trials of its various weapons and control systems, which then found themselves arming a new generation of (smaller) destroyers, as well as guided-missile frigates. After a fire in the boiler that burnt for four hours off the coast of Wales in February 1974, HMS Bristol lost the use of its steam propulsion system for two years, until repairs could be made. In the interim, it was still able to operate using its two Rolls-Royce Olympus gas turbines. By 1979, new electronic countermeasures, Corvus chaff launchers, and a pair of 20mm Oerlikon cannon had been added and the veteran Limbo ASW weapon was deleted. The former Limbo housing was thereafter used for a while as a makeshift swimming pool. Despite being mainly engaged on trials work, the HMS Bristol was more than capable of combat duty and its command and control facilities made it an ideal flagship. It also carried more extensive communications and data links than other Royal Navy warships, allowing it to serve as a “node” for other Royal Navy vessels to communicate with other NATO ships — frequently from the U.S. Navy or French Navy — that may have had incompatible communications suites. The destroyer’s value as a flagship was proven during the Falklands War of 1982 when the Royal Navy Task Force sailed to the South Atlantic to retake the Falkland Islands after the Argentine invasion. The big destroyer’s extra capacity allowed additional staff to be embarked for the flagship role and it sailed to the South Atlantic as the lead ship in a group of reinforcements, before joining the carrier battle group. HMS Bristol also fired its Sea Dart missiles in anger in the South Atlantic — among the 18 Sea Darts launched from this warship and the smaller Type 42 destroyers during the campaign — but did not register any Argentine aircraft destroyed. When the previous flagship in the campaign, the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes , departed for the United Kingdom after the British victory, HMS Bristol took on this role. A Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter loads stores on HMS Bristol at Ascension Island during the Falklands campaign., KEN GRIFFITHS/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Prior to the Falklands War, it had been expected that HMS Bristol would be retired prematurely under the 1982 Defence White Paper, but the destroyer’s usefulness had been adequately demonstrated and it was given a reprieve, including a refit based on lessons from the then-recent conflict. The light anti-aircraft weapons were boosted with the addition of another pair of twin 30mm Oerlikon cannon and a pair of single 20mm Oerlikons, and more modern SRBOC countermeasures launchers were also fitted. The SRBOC — or Super Rapid Bloom Offboard Countermeasures is a short-range mortar that punches out chaff or infrared decoys to spoof anti-ship missiles like the Exocets encountered in the Falklands. Losses during the Falklands War also provided an opportunity for HMS Bristol to remain in the frontline fleet until 1984 when it suffered a boiler explosion that required extensive repairs. While these were being conducted, the obsolete Ikara was removed and a new Type 1022 long-range air search radar was added. In 1987, HMS Bristol was adapted for a training role, receiving additional accommodation and classrooms to serve the Britannia Royal Naval College, Royal Navy’s initial officer training establishment. Officially decommissioned in 1991, HMS Bristol continued its training duties in Portsmouth, but no longer ventured out to sea. So began almost three decades in which the destroyer provided the first taste of Royal Navy life for successive generations of Sea Scouts, Sea Cadets, and members of the Combined Cadet Force, alongside other training duties. According to Royal Navy figures, the destroyer hosted up to 17,000 visitors every year, while providing “the closest thing to a sea-going experience without leaving port.” HMS Bristol as a training vessel dockside in Portsmouth in 2009., CROCHET.DAVID/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS By early 2020, however, there were reports that HMS Bristol was to be scrapped since it was too expensive to maintain and no longer fit for purpose as a training ship. Despite calls to save the unique destroyer from scrapping and instead turn it into a museum, the destroyer’s fate now seems to be set. According to the U.K. Ministry of Defence, HMS Bristol will be “released for disposal by March 31, 2021,” with “no plans” to review the decision. Although it was destined to see out its service in the relative obscurity of a dockside role, HMS Bristol nonetheless played a vital role in training officers and other recruits to serve aboard Royal Navy warships. While the successors to the stillborn CVA-01 are now entering service as the new Queen Elizabeth class of carriers, they are in turn protected by the six-strong class of Type 45 destroyers — the logical descendants of the Type 82 carrier escorts.

Robert Hopkins,"Updated on Sep 20, 2021",A Dozen Of The Most Unusual Variants Of The Ubiquitous KC-135 Family Of Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since its first flight on August 31st, 1956, there have been more than 80 variants of the KC-135A. For some of these, the differences were minor and often reflected only internal changes. For others, modifications significantly altered the appearance of the jet. In tribute to these many versions, The War Zone presents—as Rod Serling would say—for your consideration a dozen versions of the weird and wonderful. Selecting just 12 was insanely difficult, especially as the many testbed variants could easily account for twice that many. 12. It’s Just Paint. Originally delivered in natural metal, the KC-135 has had relatively few color schemes. Coroguard was eventually applied to limit corrosion, later followed by a light grey. In the 1980s, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was concerned about tankers over Europe being shot down while in support of NATO, which prompted the hideously ineffective “Shamu” scheme of dark grey-green. This might have helped hide the KC-135 when viewed from above over cloudless terrain, but it made the jet more visible in the air and played havoc with the interior heat. Today the jets wear a more effective grey. Still, there are a few KC-135s—too few, IMHO—that have sported unique paint schemes worthy of mention here. In 1976, the American Bicentennial craze resulted in special paint schemes for just about every airplane in the inventory, but the then-Commander in Chief of Strategic Air Command (SAC) General Russell Dougherty was not convinced that his bombers and tankers should take part. Nonetheless, as this airshow image reveals, KC-135A 63-8012 did manage to sneak in a colorful scheme. At least one other jet had red, white, and blue striping on the engine cowls and around the nose radome. Photo: author’s collection Never let it be said that the French don’t know how to celebrate an anniversary, as C-135FR 63-8471 attests. There’s plenty of time to start planning the 80th anniversary of USAF KC-135s in 2037, which will probably be about the time the KC-46 is declared fully mission capable and retired to the Boneyard. Photo: Pierre-Clément Got 11. Civilian KC-135s? Both the KC-135 and the Boeing 707 were derived from the company’s earlier 367-80— famously barrel-rolled by the late, great “Tex” Johnston—but each was designed for separate markets: military and civilian. Nonetheless, two civil users—well, U.S. government agencies, to be precise—did acquire KC-135As. One of these helped put men on the moon, while the other helped make global commercial jet travel safer. The original “Weightless Wonder” zero-gravity simulator was a Convair C-131, but the availability of spare KC-135s allowed for longer-duration training flights. Three different C/NKC/KC-135As were used at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, but by 1974 the Air Force wanted to divest the zero-g mission to NASA. KC-135A 59-1481 had a terrible maintenance record, which is why the Air Force offered it to NASA. That agency, not surprisingly, declined. After much bureaucratic wrangling and extensive repairs, however, it went on to fly 57,667 parabolas over its 22-year career. It would also support Space Shuttle transport flights alongside NASA’s 747 s. Photo: Bob Burns via Stephen Miller The Air Force was happy to shunt its hangar queens to civilian agencies, and, like NASA’s KC-135, 59-1518 was in pretty sorry shape when the FAA asked for a jet. Not that the FAA did much better. As N96, it suffered maintenance issues throughout its career with the agency. The airplane flew intercontinental and domestic routes at high altitudes and jet speeds to evaluate existing air traffic control (ATC) procedures and instrument approaches. Jim Morrow via Stephen Miller Along with KC-135A N98 (59-1481 which went to NASA), what it found while executing its research mission was appalling, as the procedures and how the airways operated were designed for the previous generation of piston-powered airliners. As such, today’s air travel owes its safety to the two FAA KC-135As. N96 eventually returned to the Air Force in 1979 for conversion into an EC-135K Head Dancer airborne command post. 10. In the Navy Much to the surprise of many SAC alumni, two NKC-135As served with the U.S. Navy. As part of its electronic warfare training to the fleet, the Navy operated three ex-SAC B-47 bombers carrying electronic countermeasure (ECM) pods and jammers. These soon proved too old and too small for the expansion needed as electronic warfare technology evolved, so the Navy requested replacements. In December 1977, 55-3134 and 56-3596 joined the Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group (FEWSG) operated by Douglas Aircraft in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bristling with antennae and the Tree Horn and Tree Shark jammer pods capable of simulating a variety of foreign (read Soviet) aircraft that might attack a carrier task force. Photo: Dana Potts A Tree Shark jammer pod., Photo: Stephen Miller A Tree Horn jammer pod., Photo: Stephen Miller 9. Don’t Point Those at Anyone Although SAC wanted to put ejection seats in the KC-135—Boeing said “no” because it might undermine public perception of the 707 airliner’s safety—there were never any plans to arm the tanker as it would not operate in a threatened environment. That didn’t mean the type wasn’t involved in aerial weapons tests, notably the Airborne Laser Lab (ALL), preserved today at the National Museum of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and precursor of the YAL-1A 747 . Interestingly, JKC-135A 55-3128 was involved with tests of wingtip-mounted rocket pods. Official records have yet to be uncovered that reveal exactly what these were, but they may well have been associated with test of the forward-firing AN/ALE-25 chaff rocket pods for the B-52. Photo: PM-8634 Seattle Museum of Flight 8. Everyone Else Has Them, Why Not Me? Look around at any airport and you’ll see them on just about every airplane designed and built since the 1990s. From hang gliders to 747s and A380s, winglets improve fuel efficiency and aerodynamic performance. First tested jointly with NASA in 1979 on NKC-135A 55-3129—previously a Weightless Wonder, with a bulkhead autographed by the Mercury Seven astronauts—they were never adopted for the KC-135 fleet. Results were impressive though: 6.5% fuel savings per annum—45 million gallons of fuel at $0.86 per gallon = $38,700,000 saved—not to mention improved safety due to dissipation of wingtip vortices. SAC, however, opted for a computerized fuel/flight management system that offered a mere 2% savings if the jet was flown in an atypical airline flight profile and, for the first five years, never worked. Mick Roth via Stephen Miller 7. Nuke ‘Em ‘Til They Glow Beginning with the October 31st, 1961 Tsar Bomba detonation monitored by JKC-135A 55-3127—it was not 20 miles away, but that’s another story—KC-135 variants have been used to assess dozens of atmospheric atomic tests from the United States, Soviet Union, and even France. In an effort to ensure DoD support for the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, Congress approved the purchase of three Early Day/Rivet Digger NC-135As as part of the National Nuclear Test Readiness Program (NNTRP). Each one was configured by the three U.S. atomic labs: Los Alamos Diagnostic Lab, Sandia National Lab, and the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. Each carried a variety of nuclear sensors, high-speed cameras, and technical equipment. Two—60-0369 and 60-0370—lacked all markings on the right side, while 60-0371 was unmarked on the left side to avoid flash burns to the paint from any the fireball. This proved unnecessary, but the paint scheme was retained anyway. During one program, 60-0369 carried what is believed to be an ionization sensor mounted on a long strut off the right side of the forward fuselage. Photo: Author’s collection 6. Aim Right Here As long as there’s been aerial gunnery, there have been aerial target towing aircraft, as well as target drones. Two KC-135 variants have served as “targets” for airborne laser experiments, beginning in 1977 with NC-135A 60-0371. For tests with the YAL-1 747 laser platform, big crow NKC-135E 55-3132 acted as the target, simulating an incoming ballistic missile. To make sure the YAL-1’s sensors could see the “missile” clearly, a white ICBM was painted on the black forward fuselage to simulate re-entry against an exoatmospheric background. In addition, light and heat source emitters were placed at the exhaust of the “missile.” It worked, but the YAL-1 was canceled anyway. Paul Minert via Stephen Miller 5. Rockets, Missiles, and Capsules, Oh My! During the early years of the US space program, scientists and engineers sought to understand the survivability of spacecraft as they exited and then re-entered the atmosphere. Several programs, such as the two JKC-135As that took part in Operation Skyscraper, tracked unmanned spacecraft immediately after launch and during re-entry. Beyond the pure research and “space race” benefits of these flights, there was a significant, but unmentioned, military component. Efforts such as the Radiation Monitoring Program (RAMP) and Terminal Radiation Program (TRAP) built a database of American— never Soviet—missile and re-entry vehicle (warhead) infrared signatures. This would allow targeting of Soviet ICBMs during the boost phase, including by Kelly Johnson’s proposed Low Card laser-equipped U-2s hovering around the USSR, and incoming warheads. Filled with cameras and infrared sensors mounted in a large dorsal fairing, JKC-135A 55-3134 operated from Patrick AFB, FL, unseen by the multitudes who watched rocket launches from the adjacent Cape Canaveral. Bill Sides via Stephen Miller 4. It’s Not a Tumor Long before any new electronic equipment is installed on an operational platform, it undergoes extensive testing and evaluation. As part of the 1963 Reconnaissance Strike Program, JKC-135A 56-3596 tested the performance of the side-looking radar (SLAR) for the planned RB-58 Hustler. Eventually, this was replaced by NKC-135A 55-3132 in Recce Strike II associated with the Quill satellite-based bomb damage assessment (BDA) project, designed to provide SAC with real-time re-targeting data for use in its nuclear war plan. Both aircraft had a huge fairing scabbed onto the right side of the fuselage plus a huge air intake on top for systems cooling, although this intake was later removed. Photo: Richard Sullivan via Stephen Miller 3. Does That Affect Your Gas Mileage? Although NASA had ground communications and data stations around the world to link to satellites and its manned spacecraft, there were still gaps over the southern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. For the Apollo moon missions, this was complicated by the rotation of the Earth. In 1966, Douglas received the contract to install a 7ft diameter, 700 lb steerable antenna inside a 10 ft diameter nose on eight surplus C-135A transports. These were known as Apollo Range Instrumented Aircraft (ARIA). After Apollo 17 the name was changed to Advanced Range Instrumented Aircraft. As if these were not sufficiently ungainly, four were configured to carry the Airborne Lightweight Optical Tracking System (ALOTS) pod. This allowed an operator, sitting inside a plexiglass bubble atop the fuselage, to track and film rockets, missiles, and spacecraft during launch and re-entry. One ARIA was lost in a tragic accident over Maryland during a spouse orientation flight. Photo: Bob Burns 2. You’re Joking, Right? When originally delivered, the KC-135 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney J57 engines. These used water injection to increase available thrust on initial takeoff, but were nonetheless woefully inadequate in terms of overall performance and fuel consumption. Indeed, there were some emergency situations where the KC-135 could neither climb nor accelerate after takeoff, all but guaranteeing the loss of a jet and its crew. Consequently, SAC sought to re-engine its KC-135 fleet as a cost-saving alternative to procuring hundreds of new airplanes. In one example, two additional jets were mounted in a single pod on each wingtip and used only for takeoff. Perhaps the most unusual proposal was Boeing’s KC-135ME—which stood for Mixed Engine—that, fortunately, never got off the drawing board. The outboard engines were still J57s, but the inboard engines were of the same caliber as today’s CFM-56 (F108) engines, figuring that it would halve the cost of the re-engining program. Some ideas are best left untested… Photo: Author’s collection 1. You’ll Need a Lot More Than Four Engines On the 4th of October, 1957, Americans were shocked by the Soviet Sputnik satellite. US defense planners, however, were far more concerned about the R-7 Semyorka rocket that launched it, as they quickly understood that its next payload could well be an atom bomb aimed at Washington, DC. This prompted a dedicated program to assess Soviet ICBM development, leading to specialist variants of the B-47 and RC-135 . One of these was the unique RC-135E Lisa Ann, later known as Rivet Amber. It carried a version of the massive Hughes radar installed on the island of the USS Enterprise to track incoming Soviet warheads to the Klyuchi Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and steered a Ballistic Streak Camera that filmed the event. The radar and associated equipment were far too big to fit in the jet, so the Big Safari conversion team extended the fuselage by 18 inches. No, this wasn’t the advent of the longer “hog” nose on the RC-135, but a stretch of the actual fuselage—prompting Boeing to disavow all responsibility for the airframe. Moreover, the four TF33 engines could not produce enough electricity to power the radar, so a Lycoming T55 engine was mounted in a pod beneath the left wing, and a heat exchange pod was installed under the right wing to dissipate the 1 million BTUs of additional heat generated by the radar. This gave rise to spurious claims of a “six-engine RC-135.” A fiberglass radome covered half of the fuselage over the radar, but it was not wrap-around, as some have claimed. Rivet Amber was quite successful, and during May 1969 it collected evidence that proved the Soviet SS-9 Scarp’s three warheads were not multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). Tragically, the RC-135E and 19 souls disappeared over the Bering Sea on 5th June 1969, likely the result of the failure of the vertical stabilizer following damage from severe turbulence during an operational mission the previous day.

Among the designs that were actually very real were the handguns developed as survival weapons for Soviet cosmonauts, which look like they could’ve been ripped right from a period science fiction film or James Bond movie. These fascinating weapons reflect the harsh environments that cosmonauts were expected to work in, not only in orbit but also once they had returned to Earth. These Soviet space guns weren’t intended for dueling American astronauts in a Cold War space battle, but for defense against bears and other wild animals — perhaps even tigers — once they landed back on terra firma . While guns have never been carried aboard U.S. spacecraft , the development of specialist weapons to arm cosmonauts apparently began in 1979 on the advice of Alexei Leonov — the first person to complete a spacewalk . At the end of Leonov’s landmark Voskhod 2 spacewalk mission in 1965, the capsule containing him and Pavel Belyayev drifted way off course and landed in the desolate, snow-covered forests of Russia’s Urals region. A group of first-generation Soviet cosmonauts in 1965. Leonov is far left on the back row; Belyayev is far right on the front row. , RIA NOVOSTI/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS At around the time of the Voskhod 2 mission, a cosmonaut could expect to find the following in their survival kit: • Makarov pistol and ammunition • wrist compass • 18 waterproof matches with striker • machete; fishing kit • strobe light with spare battery • eight fire starters • folding knife • antenna • three pairs of wool gloves • signal mirror • NAZ-7M type medical kit • penlight • R-855-YM or R-855-A1 radio • two Priboy-2S radio batteries • three wool balaclava hoods The NAZ-3 survival kit including a Makarov pistol., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS As the flight controllers raced to find the lost cosmonauts, Leonov and Belyayev were well aware that they would have to spend the night alone in the taiga , the domain of bears and wolves. Although they were provided with a Makarov PM service pistol and ammunition, the experience reportedly drove Leonov to advocate for the issue of a purpose-designed cosmonaut survival pistol in the future. The development of more appropriate survival weapons began in 1981 and examples of at least two were actually built. Unlike the Makarov, chambered for 9x18mm ammunition, which was wholly unsuitable for stopping a large animal like a bear, the new weapons would offer a good deal more firepower. TP-82 From the famous Tula factory , best known for producing the Kalashnikov series of rifles, came the TP-82, also known as the TOZ-82. This was a triple-barrel space shotgun that was a regular fixture of Soviet and Russian space missions from 1982, issued as a part of the Nosimyi Avariynyi Zapas , NAZ, or Soyuz Portable Survival Kit. Reportedly, the gun was also provided to some Soviet Air Force units, presumably for aircrews operating over particularly inhospitable regions. Optimized from the start for cosmonaut use, the TP-82 looked like an oversized pistol, but was actually an innovative “convertible” shotgun — or, more accurately, a double-barrel shotgun mated to a short-barrel rifle. Of the three barrels, the upper two were smoothbore and chambered for 12.5x70mm ammunition. The lower, rifled barrel fired 5.45x39mm ammunition, the same round used in the then-Soviet standard AK-74 assault rifle. A TP-82, complete with ammunition, and with buttstock fitted, preserved at the Artillery Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Three types of ammunition were provided. There were 12.5mm buckshot shells for hunting game and red signal flare cartridges to use with the larger barrels. 5.45mm rounds with soft-point bullets that were intended to bring down dangerous wild animals were also included. In addition, the gun had a detachable buttstock, to help make it easier to stow in Soviet space capsules. There was also a sharp blade hidden within the stock that could be used as a machete to cut through undergrowth or as an axe to chop wood for fire or shelter. American space journalist and historian James Oberg provides some interesting accounts from Western astronauts who had experiences of training with the TOZ-81 as part of the space survival courses after the fall of the Soviet Union. These drills included firing practice from a boat in the Black Sea. “It was amazing how many wine, beer, and vodka bottles the crew of the ship could come up with for us to shoot at,” astronaut James Voss told Oberg. “It [the TP-82] was very accurate. We threw the bottles as far as possible, probably 20 or 30 meters, then shot them. It was trivial to hit the bottles with the shotgun shells, and relatively easy to hit them with the rifle bullets on the first shot.” Oberg recalls another astronaut, David Wolf , who spent time onboard Russia’s Mir space station in 1997-98, describing the weapon as “a wonderful gun.” Wolf added: “I found it to be well-balanced, highly accurate, and convenient to use.” Illustration of a TP-82 from a Soviet-era manual., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS TOZ-81 Mars A rival to the TP-82 was the TOZ-81 — appropriately named Mars — a space revolver that didn’t make it into large-scale production. Similarly emerging from the small arms factory at Tula, it seems only one example of this weapon was ever completed for use in trials. An early study of the Soviet space revolver., TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM Exactly why the TOZ-81 revolver was rejected in favor of the TP-82 is unclear, but it might have been down to the additional complexity of the design, or perhaps the less-popular .410-bore chambering. The TOZ-81 featured a five-shot cylinder and the trigger mechanism was double-action-only. The sole TOZ-81 completed bears the serial number 00001., TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM The gun in its box together with detached sling and stock., TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM Unusually, the cylinder was located above the grip, with the gun firing from the bottom chamber. In typical revolvers , the cylinder is further forward and the top chamber in the top position is the one that gets fired with every shot. A different configuration seems to have been selected for the Mars to reduce the overall length of the weapon (useful for space capsule stowage), lower the bore-axis, and to improve balance for accuracy. Two types of barrels were ultimately provided with the gun and these could be changed manually. There was a rifled barrel for use with 5.45x39mm ammunition and a smoothbore .410-bore one that could be loaded with cartridges filled with buckshot or a single dart-like flechette. The gun is broken open for reloading., TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM A detail of the five-shot cylinder. , TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM As with the TP-82, a folding knife was also incorporated in the TOZ-81, with it being housed over the barrel. In addition, a compact radio transmitter with a folding antenna was built into the detachable aluminum stock. The TOZ-81 with blade deployed., TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM The polymer buttstock is seen fitted. , TULA STATE ARMS MUSEUM What happened to Russia’s space guns? While the TOZ-81 design was destined to be discarded, the TP-82 “space shotgun” provided space crews with a survival weapon into the early 21st century, by which time American and civilian astronauts had trained to use it for missions in Soyuz spacecraft headed to and from the International Space Station (ISS). The TP-82 seems to have been used until 2007 when it was announced that the remaining ammunition stocks had become unusable and the weapon was withdrawn. In its place, a standard pistol of unconfirmed type is again available to include in Russian space travelers’ survival kits. However, it seems not all cosmonauts, or foreign spacefarers who travel in Russian space capsules during international missions, choose to take guns with them. It’s unclear why. The Russians do have significantly improved capabilities to tell where spacecraft, even ones flying off course, will come down today than they did 40 years ago. In October 2007, it was reported that cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko launched into space aboard a Soyuz capsule armed with a “simple pistol” rather than the bespoke TP-82. Flying with him, U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson took a traditional Kazakh horse-whip. This was symbolic of her commander’s role and not to keep wild animals at bay. The issue of weapons in space — even if they are ultimately intended to defend against bears on Earth — is a controversial one. James Oberg wrote in 2014 that for years he was “needling and teasing the Russians about the presence of the guns while they were campaigning for no other weapons in space.” According to Oberg, writing in 2014, a traditional gun remains on the Russian space agency’s official list of personal kit, but crews make a vote before each mission and choose to remove it. That, at least, suggests that those flying aboard Russian spacecraft reserve the option to take a firearm with them. While a standard pistol might not be a bear-stopping weapon like the TP-82, its presence might just make the difference in the most extreme survival situations. On the other hand, it certainly lacks the science-fiction-like looks and features of the Soviet-era space guns. Hat Tip to the fantastic @Sovietvisuals, make sure to follow them here .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. They aren’t as exciting as high-tech missiles , Gatling guns , or even lasers , but the electronic warfare systems, and their associated decoys, installed aboard U.S. Navy ships are arguably the most important components on board when it comes to defending the ship from missile attacks. Now, the biggest leap in the Navy’s shipboard electronic warfare arsenal is about to be deployed for the first time. Northrop Grumman’s latest iteration of the long-running AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) family of electronic warfare systems, which are designed to defend ships against anti-ship missile attacks, provide enhanced situational awareness across the electromagnetic spectrum, and, in some cases, execute other electronic warfare functions, is about to hit the sea. The new system is dubbed the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 SEWIP Block III. An earlier variant of the AN/SLQ-32 family aboard an Arleigh Burke class destroyer. , USN SEWIP Block III follows the relatively recent fielding of SEWIP Block II. While the former greatly enhanced the situational awareness provided by the system and streamlined the hardware and software configurations that underpin it, the latter will provide cutting-edge electronic attack capability, one that is far more dynamic than what exists in earlier SEWIP iterations, including their add-on jammers, like Sidekick. You can read all about SEWIP Block II and Block III in this past piece of ours . SEWIP Block II, USN SEWIP Block III and Block II are part of the Navy’s Integrated Topside initiative that aims to reduce and streamline the numerous arrays and antennas that are scattered around a surface combatant’s deck and superstructure and integrate them into a more seamless architecture. These latest iterations of SEWIP, which has an operational lineage dating back over four decades, are critical to be able to defeat emerging threats and to leverage what has become a renaissance in electronic warfare across the services . The Navy, in particular, is working on extremely ambitious distributed concepts to dominate the electronic battlespace and confuse and blind the enemy. SEWIP Block III, with its next-generation active jamming technology, is likely to be a major part of this and will allow groups of ships to better work together to defeat threats electronically. Northrop Grumman’s press release that accompanied the photo of the system at the top of this article states: Northrop Grumman’s approach to this system is centered on a ‘software defined, hardware enabled’ open architecture that quickly integrates with other combat systems while adopting the latest electronic attack capabilities to ensure the system remains ahead of the threat and supports the U.S. Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) CONOPS. The $100.7 million base contract is for the first follow on production lot of AN/SLQ-32(V)7 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 3 electronic warfare systems. The contract has a maximum value of $1.16 billion. The system will be installed initially on Arleigh-Burke class destroyers and is scalable to other ship classes. SEWIP Block 3 is the third in a series of incremental upgrades that adds an electronic attack (EA) capability to the AN/SLQ-32 electronic warfare (EW) system to defend ships against anti-ship missiles. The program is managed by the U.S. Navy Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS). “With this follow on production award, Northrop Grumman will continue to provide game-changing maritime EW capability that will underpin future Fleet Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare operations” said Ingrid Vaughan, vice president and general manager, maritime/land systems and sensors, Northrop Grumman. “We are writing a new chapter in the evolution of the AN/SLQ-32 that will fundamentally change how the Fleet will win the fight for years to come.” It isn’t exactly clear what the final SEWIP Block III configuration will look like, although the enclosure of arrays and emitters shown in the image at the top of this post gives us at least a partial idea of what will be included with the production system. This official artist rendering of SEWIP Block III looks very similar to the image of the test unit at the top of this post, Northrop Grumman SEWIP Block III has been developed alongside a far murkier system that was rushed into service in the Pacific and has since migrated to other vessels across the U.S. Navy’s fleet. That system is known as the AN/SLQ-59, which you can read more about in this past feature of ours . It remains unclear what the relationship will be with this system and SEWIP Block III once the latter is fielded. AN/SLQ-59 aboard an Arleigh Burke class destroyer based in Japan., Hunini/wikicommons While defending a ship against anti-ship missile attacks and providing situational awareness as to threats in its vicinity are the bread and butter of SEWIP, the Block III variant is likely to be able to do other things. These could include jamming enemy communications, data-links, drone transmissions, and executing direct electronic attacks on assets such as aircraft and other ships. A communications role in the future may even be possible. The backend software and inherent adaptability of the system will also allow it to be modified with relative ease and take advantage of new electronic surveillance and attack capabilities. These may include leveraging non-organic emitters, like the powerful SPY-6 AESA radar that may be back fitted for older Fight II Arleigh Burke class destroyers and will be standard on newer Flight III ones . As it sits today, SEWIP Block III is set to debut in its initial configuration next year aboard an Arleigh Burke class destroyer. When it arrives, it will usher in a new era in naval electronic warfare for America’s seagoing service’s surface combatants. UPDATE: After this story was published, Northrop Grumman sent me this new hi-res shot showing the AN/SLQ-32V7 SEWIP Block III enclosure.

Aaron Amick,"Updated on Apr 23, 2021",How Warships Hunt For Enemy Submarines From A Veteran Submariner Who Has Been Hunted Many Times,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Anti-Submarine Warfare, or ASW, is an evolving practice that requires patience and coordination as much as skill and technique. The tools today’s navies use are much farther reaching and more capable than the simple Cold War-era sonars. Artificial intelligence helps alert operators to potential threats. Advance oceanographic modeling of sound propagation and ray trace help plan highly effective searches across vast stretches of ocean. Complex acoustic pulses at incredible power levels push back the veil of uncertainty before a fleet. It is in this ASW environment we will review the fundamentals of a basic submarine search, not from another submarine’s perspective, which you can read all about here , but from the point of view of a destroyer or another anti-submarine warfare-enabled surface combatant cruising atop the waves. Searching for a submarine happens using two basic methods: active sonar search or passive sonar search. Both ways are capable techniques, but they have vastly different strengths and weaknesses. Active ASW Search The most common search is the full spectrum active sonar that fills the volume of water around a ship for tens of thousands of yards with acoustic energy. These updates, or ‘pings,’ can be 10-15 seconds apart. Each transmission maintains a boundary of sound that detects nearly everything when two or more sources (active sonars) are employed. A single active sonar will not propagate evenly through a medium like seawater. It bends through temperature and density changes. It bounces off thermal layers as if they are solid. This creates vertical, wedge-shaped blind spots called ‘shadow zones.’ Coordinated searches with multiple active sonars can see into each other’s ‘shadow zones’ to cover an area more effectively. Also, having numerous sonar teams searching the same site increases detection recognition probability. Continuous Active Sonar (CAS) is a constant cycle of a looping active transmission. This sonar is very capable in complex littoral or coastal waters, but lacks the extreme range that traditional complex sonar waveforms can achieve. The Ticonderoga class guided missile cruiser USS Cowpens in dry dock in Japan. Note the bow-mounted AN/SQS-53B/C/D sonar., USN Due to the high accuracy of CAS, a submarine should maintain as maximum a distance from the source as possible while keeping track of the CAS source. CAS is very easy for a submarine to localize because the active sonar will provide bearing changes over time with no gaps in transmission. This gives the trained submarine crew the CAS’s position within a few minutes of transmission. The benefit of this kind of technique is that it requires a low-level of skill by the operator to conduct a successful search. If the sonar operator can locate the bright spot on a dark display, they can identify a detection. Artificial intelligence automatically marks these potential targets for further evaluation. Another benefit of active sonar is that the submarine can be detected outside of its torpedo range. Early sonar detection shifts the initiative to the warship and removes the submarine’s primary advantage, an attack from concealment . U.S. Navy Sonar Technicians inspect the locking bolt screws on a multi-functional towed array (MFTA) module during a MFTA retrieval aboard the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Mason ., USN Modern active sonars have directional modes. These modes give the sonar coordinators flexibility in their sonar search plan. It is not uncommon to have multiple active platforms, in this case, surface combatants (warships), assigned to specific sectors around a high-value vessel, such as an aircraft carrier. This gives each sonar team a narrower search field, increasing the chance of detection, at the cost of a single point of failure. Several disadvantages come with this sonar approach. Coordination between the active platforms is paramount when sonar searches overlap. This technique requires shared system timing, a “T-Zero,” and an accurate position of all transmitters so that they can plot the active propagation from another platform. Interfleet warfare system communication is a “Link”-type system that seamlessly integrates multiple sensors to help solve these coordination issues. Typically, multiple active platforms operating in the same water space will use different modes to avoid interference and unnecessary confusion due to lack of proficiency or coordination. Navies that do not have this high-level of ship-to-ship integrated communication can conduct this type of search by manually triangulating detections. Sonar Technicians stand watch in the sonar control room aboard the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Jason Dunham . , USN Triangulation is a simple method of using another platform’s sensor bearing (and range if you have it), knowing their position in relation to your own, and searching down that line of bearing. If you have contact, the tip of that triangle that crosses bearings is the submarine’s position. Manual triangulation was standard during the Cold War and is still employed today. A disadvantage here is that the target submarine can hear the active sonar platform coming at least twice the distance that its active sonar will be able to detect the return. This is because a two-way propagation of the active signal is required. While the active sonar is waiting for the return, the target submarine has already received the initial transmission and can take action to minimize detection. Passive ASW Search Passive sonar simply listens to noise as it passes the array. It collects sound signals and sorts them for the sonar operator by frequency and bearing. This helps the operator classify and track the position of the sound source. Passive sonar search is a more refined, tactical, and skillful approach to submarine detection. Modern warship construction has given the surface navy an ability to quietly prowl the seas without the concerns of long-range passive counter detection. 21st-century versions of the “Prairie” and “Masker” systems can actively hide a ship’s broadband sound signature. New towed sonar arrays, and variable depth towed capability , gives surface sonars the ability to exploit tactical advantages previously only available to submarine sonars. The combination of a quiet platform and low-frequency sonar arrays allows modern surface sonars to catch an unsuspecting submarine in open water. These passive methods are more time consuming as the area of uncertainty is always growing around a potential submerged target. Often, passive sonar will only receive a single transient sound on the bearing of a submarine. They mark a point at an estimated range often called the SWAG or ‘Sonar’s Wild Ass Guess,’ but it is officially called a ‘Datum.’ Datum Datum is a point on the chart that slowly grows in uncertainty and distance over time. It is an expanding circle that ripples out in all directions like a splash on calm water. The speed at which the Area of Uncertainty (AoU) expands depends on the type of submarine. If it is a presumed Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) submarine , the AoU grows slower than if it is suspected to be a faster nuclear sub. A German-made Type 212 class submarine at periscope depth. , Public Domain With no further information other than a single bearing of a suspected submarine, the Captain has a few options. They can maintain course and speed as not to alert the submarine that it has been detected while continuing to search. They can turn towards and pursue with active or passive sonars. The final option is turning away from the datum point and call for support if available. If the commander has ASW helicopter capability, that will most likely be employed regardless of what other actions they take. The availability of long-range ASW aircraft like the P-8 Poseidon will be more effective in cost and capability than a helicopter and could be used instead. With submerged anti-air capabilities still in an early developmental phase, today’s airborne ASW hunters can search with near-immunity of being harmed by their target. Airborne ASW Search Types Airborne ASW begins with the datum point as its destination. As the datum expands, the helicopter races towards its center. The modern ASW helicopter is equipped with dipping sonar, sonar buoys, a magnetic anomaly detector, and torpedoes. The first consideration is what loadout is best for the mission. Balancing fuel endurance with sensor loadout and attack capability must be configured before the task begins. A good rule of thumb is if the helicopter can get to the datum point within one hour, bring two weapons. Any longer, bring one torpedo and as much fuel as it can carry. Once the helicopter is en route to the datum, the contact coordinator must factor in a few key variables: Submarine speed, the speed of the helicopter, sonar buoy detection range, time since detection, and finally, the time of the arrival at the datum. Dipping sonar is the most cost-effective airborne sonar as it is not expended during a search. This makes it the most likely choice for the initial investigation. A dipping sonar will begin a series of spiral, non-disjointed dips around the center of the AoU. A Seahawk helicopter using its dipping sonar. , USN A non-disjointed sonar dip is a search technique that has a small amount of overlap from the previous submerged dipping sonar search area. This overlap compensates for the time it takes to reposition the dipping sonar from one search point to the next without the submarine slipping between the two searches. A disjointed dipping pattern has no overlap and is more efficient, but it can allow a submarine to move through coverage gaps if not performed correctly. It is ideal to employ a pattern with enough overlap to compensate for the time between dips and target speed as the helicopter spirals out from the center of the AoU. Sonar buoys (sonobuoys) give the searching platform a much better chance of detection because they stay in the water. They are not collocated every few minutes for a new search. The deploying asset does not need to remain with the deployed sensor; it can move on to the next search point, significantly increasing the chance of detection over dipping sonars because the AoU has less time to grow. Sonobuoy search fields are only limited by the number of sonobuoys the helicopter can carry. You can read all about how an airborne sonobuoy search is executed in this past War Zone feature . The 3-Ray search In many real-world encounters, the general direction of travel of the submarine is suspected.  This could be due to topography and geographical limitations in coastal waters or additional information deduced after initial contact. If the general direction of submerged contact is known, the ASW assets can employ the “ 3-Ray search ” sonar search. The center ray is the general direction of motion expected from the center of the AoU. Left and right rays are angled off-center according to the submarine’s expected speed; the higher the speed, the wider the angle between rays. Sonobuoys or dipping sonar is dropped on a vector at the estimated distance from the AoU center that matches the target speed. The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and its escorts. Destroyers are often tasked with anti-submarine screening. , USN The estimated speed is assumed based on the submarine type. Diesel submarines are expected to be slow and drop points will be near center AoU. AIP diesel submarines with energy cells are a little faster, and sonobuoys are dropped a little farther out to keep up. Nuclear submarines have the highest potential submerged speed, and the search field grows rapidly. The sonobuoy drop points are calculated on these basic estimates. The 5-Ray search The 5-Ray search adds additional search vectors to each side of the 3-Ray model. This is required if the sonar search pattern is unable to keep up with the uncertainty of the target course. It covers a wider field, but takes longer to pursue, allowing the target to potentially escape. The specific angle between search vectors is determined by target speed and variables concerning the target course. The Wedge Search The Wedge Search is similar to the Ray Search models. The Wedge Search stays focused between two ray boundaries as it moves in the target’s expected direction. Instead of centering the sonobuoys or dipping sonar around a single line of bearing and crossing it left and right as in the Ray Search, each search area has two rays forming a wedge radiating out from the center of AoU. More effort and time are spent searching the center wedge; adjoining wedges are searched afterward. A Wedge search is suited for multiple ASW assets, but can also be conducted with a single asset. NATO With 18 sonobuoys and an eight-knot target less than an hour to datum, there is about a 33% chance of detection using these techniques if there are no oceanographic advantages the submarine can use , like high sea-state, a substantial layer, and topographical shadowing. Any additional factors like the target alertness, distance from AoU, and higher than expected submerged speed only reduce that chance even further. Tom Clancy wrote, “It is wise to study the ways of one’s adversary” in his 1984 novel, The Hunt for Red October . The knowledge of these types of search models will help submariners avoid detection. Still, there is always the chance a single noise like a dropped tool or a hatch shutting may kick off a determined pursuit of your position. A submarine must look for an indication of counter detection. Warships must slow from transit speeds to deploy helicopters. If a warship is maintaining a constant range or bearing, it is time for the submarine to reposition itself or to perform a covert evasion—moving away from the active sonar as quickly and quietly as possible. South Korean sailors tour the sonar control room aboard the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS McCampbell during an exercise. , USN Successful Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) requires coordination, methodical execution, and patience. Modern sonar tools will not replace the operator’s instinct to identify and pursue suspicious detections. At sea, fleets are still defended by operators with headphones and tactical knowledge more so than artificial intelligence and algorithms. While there is a massive industry improving sensor technology, maintaining the at sea advantage relies heavily on improving the operator’s ability through better training and manpower retention. This combination of technology and technique is how modern ASW warfare is conducted. Aaron Amick is a retired U.S. Navy submarine sonarman.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Flight Deck Officer whipped down a green flag and crouched to the side of the take-off run that stretched ahead toward the “ski-jump” ramp over the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes ’ bow. Inside the cockpit of the Sea Harrier , armed with two AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles, Lieutenant Simon Hargreaves slammed the throttle lever to the stops with his left hand. Engine gauges flicked around their dials in harness with the big Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan winding up behind him. A second later, 10 tons of thrust began to overwhelm the brakes, scrubbing stationary rubber across the rough metal flight deck. Hargreaves then released the brakes and the jet leaped forward, accelerating fiercely to 90 knots in just three seconds before pressing its pilot further down into his seat as it nosed up the ramp and over the bow. As soon as the cockpit cleared the deck, he pulled the nozzle lever back to the short take-off stop then left the controls alone, allowing the fighter to arc through a ballistic trajectory as it accelerated to wing-borne flight. He could hardly believe his luck. The youngest and least experienced member of 800 Naval Air Squadron, part of the U.K. Royal Navy’s Fleet Air Arm, he’d only been out of training for a couple of months on April 2, 1982. On that date, Argentina had invaded the Falkland Islands, a small British territory nearly eight thousand miles from home. When he took off from Hermes , it was just weeks since he’d landed on the ship for the very first time. Now the ship was leading the British Task Force sent to end the occupation and he’d been scrambled to intercept an unidentified radar contact approaching from the southwest at 20,000 feet. Hargreaves’ interception of an Argentine Air Force Boeing 707 tracking the Royal Navy’s progress marked the first aerial encounter between the two belligerents. While not a single shot was fired, it would prove to be one of the most significant events of the whole air war. Fifteen minutes before he launched, the young fighter pilot was preparing to fly a training sortie. Following the order to head-off the enemy shadower, the squadron’s armorers had removed the training rounds from beneath the wings of Hargreaves’ Sea Harrier and replaced them with a pair of live AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles. When photographs taken during the 707’s reconnaissance mission revealed that British jets were armed with the latest version of the Sidewinder, the “Nine Lima,” it caused consternation inside Argentine crew rooms. Simon Hargreaves’ Sea Harrier off the wing of the Argentine 707.  The realization that the British fighters were armed with AIM-9Ls caused concern within the Argentine Air Force, VIA AUTHOR At the 1981 Junior Olympics, a 15-year-old boxer from Catskill, New York knocked out his opponent after just eight seconds in the first round to win the heavyweight gold medal. The following year, in the final of the same competition, his opponent’s corner threw in the towel in round one to spare their fighter from further punishment. That young boxer’s name was Mike Tyson. He would go on to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, cutting down all-comers with clinical speed, power, and accuracy. So fearsome became his reputation that most of his opponents expected to lose before the first punch was thrown. The AIM-9L Sidewinder had a similar effect. If the British had Nine Limas, their Argentine counterparts believed they were at a disadvantage before they had even left the ground. And with good reason. The missile had been described by one of the engineers that had developed it as “a death ray.” Simon Hargreaves after returning to Hermes following the interception of the Argentine 707., VIA AUTHOR Sidewinder origins More than three decades before the Falklands conflict, in 1951, U.S. naval aviator Wally Schirra hadn’t welcomed his new posting to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California. After clocking up 90 combat missions as a fighter pilot in Korea, he wanted to go to the U.S. Navy’s test pilot school at Patuxent River, Maryland, not a safe space for “Ph.D. types” in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Wally Schirra, during his time as an astronaut., VIA AUTHOR After all, he had the Right Stuff. A future NASA astronaut , the young naval aviator had flying in the blood. His father was a World War I pilot turned barnstormer, and, or so legend had it, his mother continued to perform her wing-walking act while pregnant with Wally. But when Schirra was shown around the lab at China Lake, his disappointment soon turned to fascination. A smoker, Schirra noticed that a device mounted inside a small glass dome attached to the front of an adapted 5-inch air-to-ground rocket, was following him, or rather his cigarette, around the room. “This,” his boss told him, “is your new toy.” The new heat-seeking missile would be christened the Sidewinder, named after the local horned rattlesnake that hunted in the desert at night by detecting the infrared radiation given off by its prey, and it was going to change the nature of aerial warfare forever. The new missile’s development flew in the face of the then state-of-the-art in air-to-air missile design. While large American aerospace companies like Hughes and Raytheon poured Air Force and Navy money into ever more complex, sophisticated, and apparently fallible radar-guided systems, the small team at China Lake tacked the other way. An AIM-9 about to hit a QF-86 drone at China Lake. , VIA AUTHOR An XAAM-N-7 Sidewinder mounted under the right wing of a Douglas AD-4 Skyraider , VIA AUTHOR A Sidewinder 1 beneath the wing of an F3D Skyknight at China Lake in 1951., VIA AUTHOR “It’s easy,” argued the team’s leader, Dr. William B. McLean, “to build something complicated; it’s hard to build it so it’s simple.” The key to success thought McLean in 1946: put the fire control in the missile instead of the aircraft . A year after the end of World War II, he set his mind on building what amounted to an autonomous robot that, once fired by the pilot, would guide itself to the target with no further outside input or direction. McLean first sketched the “heat-homing” seeker head that would make that possible on an envelope in 1947. Developed as an R&D project, without official support, the project advanced under McLean’s exacting leadership and, by 1953, China Lake test pilots were able to amuse themselves by swooping in behind trucks, trains, and Greyhound buses to see if they could get their missiles to lock on. But it was footage of an old B-17 Flying Fortress spiraling into the ground after taking a direct hit from one of the missiles in early 1954 that finally helped persuade officials in Washington to take an interest. By March 1955, the Sidewinder, which eventually received the designation AIM-9, was in full-scale production. It would make its combat debut three years later. Am AIM-9B destroys an F6F-5K Hellcat at China Lake in 1957., VIA AUTHOR Early combat In the summer of 1958, as tension mounted over the Chinese Communist bombardment of Taiwanese islands in the Taiwan Strait, American and Chinese warships stared each other down. High above them, Taiwanese F-86 Sabre jet fighters tried and failed to get within gun range of the Communist Chinese MiG-17 Fresco jets flying overhead with impunity. Capable of flying faster and higher than the Taiwanese jets, the Soviet-built MiGs were untouchable. On September 22, the Taiwanese pilots rejoined the battle with a new trick up their sleeves. By the end of the day they’d destroyed at least 10 of the high-flying Chinese MiGs and had shown that, armed with the right weapon, a fighter didn’t necessarily need to outperform its opponent. Such was the confidence in the new generation of air-to-air missiles, such as the Sidewinder that, after breaking every sort of speed and altitude world record under the sun, the U.S. Navy’s hot new interceptor, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II , entered service in the early 1960s without a gun. Yet in combat in Vietnam, the Sidewinder failed to live up to expectations. By the end of the war in Southeast Asia, just one in five Sidewinders had hit its target. As it turned out, the early Sidewinder was extremely short-ranged and it needed a clear, unbroken view of the target’s jet exhaust, so it had to be fired from behind the enemy. That required a degree of cooperation from a target that was likely to be more inclined to try hard maneuvering, flying into clouds, or pointing toward the sun. All of this worked in confounding the missile. It didn’t like wet weather, either and, at low altitude over water, it found it hard to acquire the target at all. Even the later AIM-9G version of the Sidewinder, which was piled high in British armories and magazines in early 1982, looked like a weapon that was going to be asked to perform well out of its comfort zone at low level in the grim late-fall conditions faced by the British Task Force in the South Atlantic. All-aspect AAM in the Falklands The Nine Lima was another matter altogether, though. Its design had been shaped by the experience in Vietnam to address every one of its predecessors’ shortcomings. A brand-new seeker head gave it an all-aspect capability making it the first Sidewinder that could be fired at a target from any direction, even head-on. New double-delta canards endowed it with the ability to generate 35 g loads as it twisted and turned towards its prey. No aircraft, let alone its pilot, could match it. An AIM-9L takes out a QF-33 drone at China Lake in 1975., VIA AUTHOR “When China Lake invented the Nine Lima,” a USAF colonel told one of the engineers at Raytheon, the missile’s manufacturer, “I knew it was time to get out of the fighter pilot business.” Unfortunately, when, on April 5, 1982, the British fleet set sail for the Falklands, they had just 19 examples of the new missile. Inside the Ministry of Defence in London, there were urgent efforts being made to rectify the situation. A quantity of AIM-9Ls had been raided from NATO stocks at RAF Leuchars, a Royal Air Force base in Scotland. More importantly, 100 more had been requested from the United States. The plan was to have these additional missiles air-freighted directly to Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic to await the arrival of the Royal Navy’s two carriers, HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible . It all rested on an assumption that the Sea Harrier could carry and fire the Nine Lima. It wasn’t expected to be an issue, but with just 20 Sea Harriers providing air cover for a British operation mounted only 300 miles from the Argentinian mainland, there was no room for any doubt. Five days after the invasion of the Falklands, Lieutenant Commander Tim Gedge, who only two months earlier had relinquished command of 800 Naval Air Squadron, was asked to form a new Sea Harrier squadron to reinforce the small force of jump jets that had already deployed. He was given just three weeks to do it and his unit had a Dirty Dozen feel to it. He pulled mothballed Sea Harriers out of storage, from test squadrons, and off the British Aerospace production line. Anywhere he could find them. Radars were appropriated from jets earmarked for the Indian Navy, while his pilots were recalled from foreign exchange postings in Arizona, California, and Australia. Two were borrowed from a Royal Air Force Harrier squadron in Germany. The only thing they were missing, joked one aviator, “is someone sprung from jail.” RAF Harrier GR3 ground-attack jets were fitted with Sidewinders in 1982 to give them the capability to bolster the small force of Sea Harrier fighters., VIA AUTHOR While Gedge’s priority was to make sure his pilots were given bare-bones training in flying and fighting the Sea Harrier — and some would get fewer than 10 hours in the cockpit of the jet — he was also charged with helping develop and test new weapons, software, and tactics. In his last weeks as squadron boss of 800 Naval Air Squadron, Gedge knew that the Sea Harrier’s clearance trials for the Nine Lima had been scheduled for later in the year. He now brought them forward to the end of the week. He booked time on the weapons ranges at RAF Valley on Anglesey in Wales, rustled up a chase plane from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, to observe the test firings, and directed a pair of experienced pilots to plan the various flight profiles they’d use during the trials. But when, a couple of days later, Gedge flew up to Valley himself, he was told there was a problem. The reprofiled canard fins at the front of the Nine Lima meant it no longer fit on the missile launch rails beneath the Sea Harrier’s wings. That would normally need an expensive manufacturer’s redesign and recertification to sort out. He asked the Chief Petty Officer responsible for arming the aircraft if there was anything that could be done. “Well, we could just file down rails we’ve already got to make them fit…” Gedge told him to do it, amused at the ease with which the normal sequence of things had been sidestepped. “Must be one of the cheapest modifications ever,” he thought. The trials were complete a day later. Six shots. Six direct hits. 100%. The Nine Lima was ready to go to war. A fortnight later, so too was Gedge’s reformed 809 Naval Air Squadron. A Sea Harrier test-firing a Sidewinder., VIA AUTHOR The final tally In the six-week war that followed, the Royal Navy’s Sea Harriers — outnumbered nearly 10-to-one by the Argentine fast jet force — won a decisive victory. In shooting down 23 enemy aircraft, they had not suffered a single loss in air combat by return. Twenty-one of the British kills fell to the AIM-9L Sidewinder, which finished the war with an 87% success rate. The Royal Navy’s opponent, the Argentine Air Force, included jets that were considerably faster than the Sea Harriers, such as the Mach-2-capable delta-wing Mirage III and Dagger jet fighters, plus agile A-4 Skyhawks . By any measure, this was a very credible adversary, much like the MiG-17s that had tangled with Sabres over the Taiwan Strait almost a quarter-century earlier. One of two AIM-9L Sidewinders fired by 800 Naval Air Squadron commanding officer Andy Auld at a pair of Argentine Daggers on May 24, 1982. The Nine Limas destroyed them both., VIA AUTHOR The Nine Lima didn’t have it all its own way, though. There had been a handful of occasions when the missile had refused to leave the rails. It was thought that the constant rain and mist might have borne some responsibility for the failures. And so, in order to remedy the situation, the Sidewinders’ infrared seekers were removed after each mission and dried out in the carrier’s bread ovens before being reattached as required. It seemed to do the trick. No matter what, the Nine Lima had proved to be a war-winner. This was a fact reinforced later in the year when it went into action with the Israeli Air Force over Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley against the Syrian Air Force with similar results. Way back in 1934, the British Air Ministry, worried about falling behind German technological advances, set up a Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence. Of particular concern to the committee was the prospect of some kind of electromagnetic beam being used to either disable aircraft or incapacitate their crews. Unable to figure out how to do it on their own, they offered a £1,000 prize to anyone who could build a device that could incinerate a sheep from a distance of 100 yards. With the prize still unclaimed a year later, the Air Ministry asked the country’s Radar Research Station for advice on the “practicability of proposals of the type colloquially called ‘death ray’.” The death ray turned out to be a not very practical proposition at all. Fifty years later, though, a weapon so devastatingly lethal that it had earned that label from one of its creators helped Britain win an unlikely war on the far side of the world against a skilled and courageous opponent.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first-in-class guided-missile cruiser USS Ticonderoga recently arrived in the Port of Brownsville in Texas where it will be scrapped. The U.S. Navy decommissioned this ship, the first of the service’s operational warships to be equipped with the Aegis combat system , in 2004 after just over two decades in service. The ex- Ticonderoga arrived at International Shipbreaking Limited’s yard in Brownsville in September, according to a report from the Valley Morning Star newspaper in Texas. International Shipbreaking is a subsidiary of the EMR Group, which describes its work as “ marine recycling ,” rather than scrapping. The retired Navy cruiser will be broken down in a “safe, respectful and responsible manner,” International Shipbreaking Senior Manager Chris Green told the Valley Morning Star. The “recycling” process will certainly bring a final end to Ticonderoga ‘s significant and distinguished history. Ticonderoga was laid down in 1980 in Ingalls Shipbuilding’s yard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The development of this class of ships had begun in the 1970s using a derivative of the hullform from the existing Spruance class guided-missile destroyer. The Navy determined that leveraging the existing design would be cheaper than acquiring an all-new ship design to accommodate the then-new Aegis combat system and the associated AN/SPY-1 radar. These ships were also the first for the Navy to be built in distinct vertical modules that were then linked together, rather than entirely from the hull up, a process also meant to save time and money. The USS Ticonderoga , at right, alongside the USS Spruance , the lead ships in their respective classes, both of which are based on the same core hull design., USN It is worth noting that the decision to use the Spruance class hullform as a starting place also resulted in notably overloaded ships that suffer to this day from persistent cracking in their aluminum superstructures, which is both time-consuming and costly to repair. With their Spruance DNA, these ships were originally categorized as guided-missile destroyers, rather than cruisers. However, the powerful combination of Aegis and the AN/SPY-1 radars, as well as the addition of other then-state-of-the-art systems into the ship’s design, led the Navy to determine it could serve as a flagship for surface action groups and it would become a key air warfare battle management nerve center for Carrier Strike Groups, roles you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . In turn, the service then decided to re-categorize them as cruisers to reflect their broader capabilities. The first five Ticonderoga class ships, one of which, the USS Thomas S. Gates , was built at Bath Iron Works in Maine, were commissioned between 1983 and 1987. The other three ships in this initial group were the USS Yorktown , USS Vincennes , and USS Valley Forge . USS Ticonderoga in 1983, the year it entered service., USN The main armament of these ships consisted of a pair of twin-rail Mk 26 missile launchers and two five-inch guns, one of each at the bow and at the stern, as well as two four-round launchers for Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles on the fantail. The Mk 26s were capable of firing the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) surface to air missile and the RUR-5 Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC). These cruisers also had deck-mounted torpedo tubes and a pair of Phalanx Close-in Weapon Systems (CIWS). Starting in 1984, Ingalls and Bath Iron Works began building subvariants of the Ticonderoga class that replaced each of the Mk 26s with a 61-cell Mk 41 Vertical Launch System array, allowing them to employ a much wider array of weapons more reliably and rapidly, including the Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile . These two yards ultimately built 22 more of the cruisers in this much more capable, multi-mission configuration. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Bunker Hill , the first of the subclass of ships with the Mk 41 VLS arrays, one of which can be seen between the forward gun and the forecastle., USN Still, the Navy made good use of the Ticonderoga and the other four initial cruisers in the class. The USS Ticonderoga , as well as her sister ship USS Vincennes , took part in the Tanker War sideshow to the Iran-Iraq War in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s. It was during those operations that Vincennes became infamously responsible for the tragic shootdown of Iran Air Flight 655 in 1985. Ticonderoga also supported the Persian Gulf War between 1991 and 1992. After more than a decade of additional continued service, the Navy decommissioned Ticonderoga in 2004. The service also decommissioned Yorktown and Valley Forge that year. Vincennes and Thomas S. Gates followed them into mothballs the next year. Retired ships destined for the scrap yard will first go through a process to remove any sensitive equipment, as well as salvage any items that could be reused on other Navy ships. The ex-USS Ticonderoga , a center with gray paint still on most of the forecastle, sandwiched between the former USS Yorktown and USS Thomas S. Gates , to its right and left, respectively, at the Philadelphia Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in 2016., Bestbudbrian via Wikimedia Of the original five Ticonderoga class cruisers, only the lead ship and the ex- Yorktown are still with us, for now. The former Vincennes and Thomas S. Gates have already been scrapped. The Navy sunk the former Valley Forge off the coast of Hawai as part of a SINKEX in 2006. The beginning of the end of the ex- Ticonderoga comes as the Navy is again pushing to retire more of its older warships, potentially including some of the remaining cruisers in this class, as part of a new push to modernize and expand the service’s fleets. Past attempts to retire Ticonderoga class ships have been met with pushback from members of Congress and it remains to be seen what parts, if any, of this new naval force structure plan will become a reality. No matter what, the first ship of this class, which ushered in numerous firsts in the U.S. Navy, is now finally at the hands of the scrapper’s torch.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 17, 2019",Secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport Had A Mysteriously Busy Week In September,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport , located in the northwestern reaches of the Nevada Test and Training Range , the sprawling amalgam of restricted airspace that makes up much of Southern Nevada , usually appears to be a very quiet place in daytime satellite images, but once in a while that calm is broken . This was the case during the week of September 19th. The highly secure installation hosted a number of uncommon aircraft throughout the week in what appeared to be some sort of large test or training event. Satellite imagery dated September 23rd, 2020 that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs offers a peek into just how busy the remote installation was during this time period. What are usually empty ramps, aside from a couple ‘Janet’ 737 airliners that shuttle workers to and from the installation and Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport daily, became far more cluttered on that week. A number of uncommon visitors dotted the ramp, as well as a more common one— the base’s resident F-117 Nighthawks . The F-117s spent their formative, classified, years at Tonopah and were retired there in 2008, cocooned five to a hangar. Over the last decade, a handful of them have become remarkably active in the test and aggressor role . Below is the wide-angle view of the activity last month. You will also notice that the long-running repairs to the southern portion of the base’s runway are nearly complete, but the displaced threshold is still in place. The south ramp and terminal used by the Janet jets is also still in the process being refurbished, with two of the private airline’s 737s parking in their temporary staging location towards the northern end of the ramp, the same area where the still-flying F-117s live. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION To the south, a 757, likely a C-32B , sits parked between the runway and the high-security double-row fencing that leads to the main apron. Unlike its high-profile cousin, the C-32A that serves as an executive transport, including as Air Force One and Two depending on who is on board, the C-32B is all about keeping a low profile . Those that work out of McGuire AFB in New Jersey are used primarily as shuttles for special operations and intelligence teams, while the one based at Eglin AFB in Florida is thought to be used as an on-call transport for State Department-led Foreign Emergency Support Teams. The aircraft have an advanced communications suite and, unlike the C-32As, are capable of aerial refueling via a conformal refueling slipway that is unmarked. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The center of the action lies near the central ‘canyon’ of hangars, all of which were originally built for, at the time, the very secretive F-117 Nighthawk program . A very large number of vehicles have congregated in the canyon, most near the westernmost row of hangars. These hangars seem to have some association with the special operations community and often have transport aircraft, Black Hawk helicopters, CN-235s , and other airframes associated with that community parked nearby. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION This is not necessarily the case in this instance. Instead, we see a Gulfstream V parked at the top of the hangar row. It is unclear who the aircraft belongs to, but it does have a distinctive black tail. This is not a totally unique feature, but one government contractor aircraft that has secure communications that are installed to be sufficient for continuity of government operations for a cabinet member or other top official does have a similar paint job. A 767, which most likely belongs to Omni Air International, a private charter company that is notorious for its willingness to haul nearly anything or anyone anywhere for the U.S. government, is also seen nearby. The paint scheme matches and the fact that it is at this highly secure locale at all is further evidence of its ownership. A C-17 is also seen parked on the taxiway outside of the main ramp’s double fencing that leads to taxiways and runway. To the north, we see Tonopah Test Range Airport’s most famous tenant, an F-117 Nighthawk. It’s rare to see the stealth jets in high-resolution satellite imagery at all, even though they are now very active. But in this case, we don’t only get to see one of them, it appears that a photoshoot was underway when the satellite was passing over. It looks like people are aligned in rows in a delta formation in front of the jet for the picture, with an elevated platform capturing it the front of the formation. The lighting would have been absolutely perfect for this shot and the positioning keeps the lens away from the base’s sensitive operating areas. PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION These aircraft were not transient in nature. Aside from the F-117, they were all present throughout the week, with just the C-17 moving around to a different parking space behind the C-32. As to what they were doing there? We have no idea. The small amount of evidence we have points to something special operations related. As we noted earlier, the base is a hub for some special operations training and aircraft testing, including the additions of new subsystems on existing types. For instance, Air Force Special Operations Command tested its defensive countermeasures systems aboard its then-new CV-22 Ospreys at Tonopah back in the late 2000s. The base would be the logical home of some clandestine tactical aerial assets as well, either developmental in nature or very low-density types, like say a pocket force of low observable (stealth) helicopters . Beyond that, the NTTR has been extremely busy as of late. Some publicized tests, such as those related to the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) have used the range and surrounding installations. In August, the 53rd Wing at nearby Nellis Air Force Base also notably revealed that its 53rd Test and Evaluation Group had led a massive stealth-focused Large Force Test Event involving various Air Force and Navy combat aircraft and drones, including at least one secretive RQ-170 Sentinel from the top-secret 44th Reconnaissance Squadron . But far more is going on that is not publicized. Aircraft radio interceptors have noted just how much action has been ongoing out on the ranges just in the last few weeks, which matches a huge uptick in aerial testing in other areas, namely over the Mojave Desert and off the coast of Southern California , as of late. Radio interceptor Bryan Herbet, who goes by the handle @KE6ZGP on Twitter , noted the following to The War Zone: Since the end of September, the radio traffic from NTTR went from amazing to insane. There was one night where radio traffic was non-stop until just after 3 AM. The increase in activity isn’t just limited to aircraft from Nellis. Known and unknown Groom Lake freqs have also been very active. Not just at night. They’ve been doing more flight tests during the day. My Nellis-Creech-NTTR freq list has over 100 freqs in it and in these last two weeks, I’ve found freqs in use that weren’t already in my list. Its not often you hear ZLA [Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center] working multiple aircraft above FL600, especially above NTTR, but they’ve been doing it. You can hear a couple of Herbet’s most recent radio recordings from around the NTTR below: Another recording from October 7th comes from our friends over at Dreamlandresort.com . It is of a multi-aircraft test, including the ultra-shy RAT55 signature measurement aircraft, over Area 51. You can listen to this intriguing recording here. The bottom line is that with a huge push in research and development and readiness over the last few years, places like Tonopah Test Range Airport, Area 51, and the greater NTTR, are busier than ever. Whatever was going on at the remote installation over that week in late September was unique, but as to what exactly it was remains anyone’s guess.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Sep 22, 2020",The EA-18G Growler Has Its Own Topgun School For Electronic Attack Instead Of Dogfighting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School, better known as Topgun , is world-famous for its work in teaching high-end air-to-air combat skills, its fellow Airborne Electronic Attack Weapons School, known as Havoc, tends to sit in the shadows. This elite school prepares EA-18G Growler aircrews for the rigors of modern-day air combat, following much the same mantra as Topgun. While the traditional techniques of air-to-air and air-to-ground employment of fighter aircraft are well documented, the EA-18G’s electronic attack mission remains something of a dark art. Like Topgun, the Growler equivalent at Havoc is part of the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC), and it is tucked away in the same nondescript building at one end of the long flight line at Naval Air Station Fallon, in Nevada. Despite the lack of fanfare, just like its sister organization, Havoc’s activities are at the forefront of modern Naval Aviation. Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) essentially involves the offensive and defensive suppression of an enemy’s electromagnetic spectrum, including radars and communications. AEA includes the ability to monitor hostile electromagnetic activity, as well as to evaluate, disrupt, manipulate, and even disable the related systems. These could be the nodes that typically form part of an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS), which can collect tracking data and can disseminate it to various “shooters,” such as surface-to-air missile sites, that are then able to tackle an incoming threat. The ability to confuse, and even suppress or disable that IADS means that its engagement ability can be seriously degraded or some parts of it may be even wiped out entirely. An EA-18G attached to Havoc taxying at NAS Fallon., Jamie Hunter AEA, and modern electronic warfare in general , is one of the mystical corners of aerial warfare that is often misunderstood and is cloaked in secrecy . While you can get some insight into the mission here , overall, Havoc is shrouded under a more opaque umbrella of security than its famed counterpart down the hallway. Havoc isn’t an acronym — it’s a clear reference to what its operators can cause when effectively deploying the full suite of EA-18G Growler capabilities in a complex aerial battlespace. By their very nature, these AEA platforms have the ability to operate in a high-threat environment, tackling air defenses head-on that are out to stop them and their partnering forces, in their tracks. NAWDC at Fallon is the center of excellence for U.S. Navy training and tactics development, with Havoc being a department within this large organization, and known officially as N10. Havoc has tracked the EA-18G’s path and growth in U.S. Navy service and will mark its tenth anniversary in 2021, with a decade that has been geared toward maintaining the Growler’s leading edge in the complexities of the AEA mission. USN What does HAVOC do? Havoc’s primary role lies in training Growler Tactics Instructors, or GTIs, that official NAWDC literature says “form the tactical engine” of the EA-18G community, to maximize the use of the aircraft’s sensors and weapons. In addition, it trains Intelligence Officers, which similarly receive the highest level of EA-18G tactical qualification that is recognized across Naval Aviation. “Intel shops” are responsible for providing the latest data on threat systems, so the airborne operators and their “kit” know exactly how to deal with them. According to NAWDC: “The Growler brings the most advanced tactical electronic warfare capabilities to operational commanders, creating a tactical advantage for friendly air, land, and maritime forces by delaying, degrading, denying, or deceiving enemy kill chains.” Captain Brett Stevenson, the commander of Havoc, leads an organization that is both catering for the present fight while also keeping a close eye on some big advances coming along in the future of the EA-18G. “The Growler Tactics Instructor course is run over a 14-week period, twice a year, typically for eight students at a time, and is mostly conducted at Fallon,” he explains. “We don’t “hard crew” here, the students go through individually, rather than as a dedicated pilot and Electronic Warfare Officer [EWO] team.” “The course has three main phases, we have air-to-air with an electronic attack [EA] focus, air-to-ground EA, and our capstone exercise that comes at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, when we do a month alongside the U.S. Air Force Weapons School in its WSINT [Weapons School Integration Phase , “wizz-int”]. For this, we work closely with the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense [SEAD] F-16 “Vipers,” as well as on integration with fifth-generation F-22s and F-35s, as well as a range of joint non-kinetic capabilities to suppress enemy air defenses in a holistic, coordinated manner.” This EA-18G carries three ALQ-99 pods, including the low-band variant on its centerline station., Jamie Hunter In addition to the GTI course at Fallon, the Navy has a Growler Electronic Attack Weapons School (EAWS) at NAS Whidbey Island , Washington, which is co-located with the type’s operational and training squadrons. This school was first established as the Weapons “Cage” of Attack Squadron VA-128, the “Golden Intruders,” in 1974 to provide refresher and advanced courses for Grumman A-6 Intruder ordnance personnel. This evolved into a course for weapons and advanced strike planning, including the addition of the EA-6B Prowler, the predecessor of the Growler. Capt Stevenson says: “The Growler Weapons and Tactics Programs [GWTP] is the training continuum that all Growler aircrews progress through as they attain tactical qualifications of increasing skill and responsibility in effectively employing the Growler’s capabilities.” “The GTI course consists of academic, simulator and live flight events both on the Fallon Range Training Complex [FRTC] and the Nevada Test and Training Range [NTTR],” Stevenson continues. “We put GTI candidates through a Ph.D.-level course of instruction focused on the precise execution of the latest Growler tactics, and how to integrate the platform’s capabilities with naval and joint forces. We focus on developing their instructor skills through a rigorous, structured debriefing process after each course event. This provides the basis for continual self-improvement, and gives our students the skills they will need to become expert instructors.” “Graduates of the GTI course will become instructors at Havoc or EAWS. After those two-year instructor tours, they will then return to fleet squadrons as Training Officers, where they become the connective tissue between the tactics developed at Havoc, and fleet aircrew employing the full range of Growler capabilities,” Capt Stevenson explains. The Growler’s wingtip pods house the ALQ-218 Electronic Surveillance and Electronic Attack sensors., Jamie Hunter Creating HAVOC The U.S. Navy retired its last EA-6B Prowlers in 2015 and has now consolidated its AEA effort within Carrier Air Wings, as well as in the joint expeditionary electronic attack squadrons, via the Growler. Comparing the two-seat EA-18G with its four-seat EA-6B predecessor, Capt Stevenson says workload distribution and crew coordination are far more important in the Growler. Regarding the overall AEA mission, he adds: “It’s as much about the ability to confuse and disrupt the adversary — the non-kinetic effects — as it is about the ability to conduct strikes.” Modern data links and advanced avionics mean the EA-18G is more battlespace savvy than the EA-6B, able to receive huge swathes of data and then distribute it between appropriate platforms. Where the four-person Prowler cockpit relied on reactive crew coordination to get the most from the avionics — the three Electronic Countermeasures Officers (ECMOs) relied on a lot of comms and analog systems integration — the Growler crew works in a digital world where task division is more clearly assigned, and blended avionics afford a generally more efficient working environment. “GTI candidates typically employ in a section (two-ship) or division (four-ship), but some of the more complex events at WSINT will include up to six Growlers, all synchronized in space and time to provide the kind of capacity we might expect to employ against a modern adversary. During a typical Large Force Exercise event, Growler aircrews use onboard sensors to quickly detect and locate threats, which are then neutralized with kinetic and non-kinetic effects to provide sanctuary for the strike package,” explains Capt Stevenson. The two-person cockpit of an EA-18G Growler. , USN Stevenson says HAVOC has some crossover with Topgun, especially with the introduction of the F-35C Lightning II into the Carrier Air Wing (CVW). The two organizations have different, but complementary Subject Matter Expert (SME) qualifications. One area of crossover is suppression of enemy air defenses, better known as SEAD, a mission that includes a combination of non-kinetic and kinetic effects, which may include employing advanced anti-radiation missiles at enemy radars. Growler crews also focus on battlespace dominance with an electronic attack bias, communications networking, and employment of the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), and AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), which are the primary kinetic SEAD weapons for the Growler. “Employment of live ordnance during integration exercises is rare, but GTI students do participate in a dedicated AGM-88 HARM missile shoot as part of the GTI course. This gives them the experience needed to effectively plan and safely execute similar missile shoot events during their fleet squadron Training Officer tours.” As air defense networks have evolved and matured, the AEA mission has had to similarly adapt, employing both new technology and new tactics. The Navy is pushing hard on a raft of next-generation EA-18G capabilities that build upon the initial standard of aircraft. Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band (NGJ-MB) flies for the first time on an EA-18G Growler on Aug. 7, 2020., U.S. Navy/Erik Hildebrandt Capt Stevenson says that some fundamental improvements that are coming down the pipe for the EA-18G are very much in line with the current thinking at Havoc. “The Next-Generation Jammer [NGJ] will be revolutionary,” he asserts. NGJ is a series of podded jamming systems that will herald a major step forward for the EA-18G. You can read more about the NGJ family of pods in this previous War Zone feature . For the most part, the biggest advantages the Growler brings to the fight over the Prowler is air-to-air employment capabilities, along with improved maintainability. As a means of reducing risk on its entry into service, the Growler initially retained the Prowler’s external AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods, albeit with specific modifications to facilitate the transfer to the EA-18G, which you read about here . The ALQ-99 jamming pods and the ALQ-218 Electronic Surveillance and Electronic Attack suite are actually carryovers from the Prowler, being the ALQ-218 was designed for the Growler, but integrated into the final capability upgrade to the EA-6B, known as ICAP III, to enhance the venerable jet’s capabilities and validate the system’s performance. Growler being tested with the NGJ-LB pod in September 2020., USN While the legacy ALQ-99 is a proven and capable jammer that has been able to adapt to new threats, it is now being replaced by the NGJ series of pods, beginning with the AN/ALQ-249(v)1 Next Generation Jammer Mid-band (NGJ-MB), which is under development by Raytheon. The first flight of NGJ-MB on an EA-18G occurred in August 2020, however, the project has faced a number of engineering challenges, details of which you can read here . Testing of the second new low-band (LB) jamming pod is now underway. The Northrop Grumman Demonstration of Existing Technologies (DET) prototype of the NGJ-LB pod was revealed in September 2020 and is detailed in this War Zone article . A high band pod could also be developed to complete the transition from the legacy ALQ-99. The Growler is also gearing up for the Northrop Grumman AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), which is a significant upgrade on the AGM-88E AARGM. The Navy began development of the missile in 2018 and it too will soon be fielded by the EA-18G as it further enhances the type’s kinetic capabilities. You can read more about the AARGM-ER here . An AN/ALQ-99 pod and AGM-88 HARM on an EA-18G., Jamie Hunter Growler looks to the future In addition to the external pods and weapons, the U.S. Navy is moving forward with a Block II variant of the Growler. This upgrade will provide the aircraft with a significantly enhanced electronic attack system, which includes the improved AN/ALQ-218(v)4 radio frequency receiver system, plus the AN/ALQ-227(v)2 Communication Countermeasures Set (CCS). It is also planned to build upon currently-funded features being added to the Block III F/A-18E/F , such as conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) that add 3,500 pounds of fuel — an especially important upgrade for the electronic warfare pod-lugging Growler — and new 10 x 19-inch wide-area displays in the cockpit. It’s an excellent example of how the Navy leverages commonality between the Growler and the Super Hornet. A new open architecture processor and advanced networking will also enable the EA-18G to further prepare for the future battlespace. In September 2019, the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division and Boeing demonstrated the ability for the Growler to act as a controller for autonomous Unmanned Air Systems (UASs). Air Test and Evaluation Squadron VX-23 “Salty Dogs” at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, flew a pair of EA-18Gs that simulated UASs, which were controlled from a third Growler in a series of four flights. This could pave the way for the Growler directing unmanned combat air vehicles and other advanced drones in the future. You can read all about these missions here . The tests were part of the Navy Warfare Development Command’s annual fleet experiment (FLEX) exercises, and part of demonstrating how the EA-18G is moving ahead in line with cutting edge technologies for fielding in future conflicts. EA-18Gs also could find themselves launching and controlling swarms of smaller stand-in jammers and decoy drones in the future , as well. The already complex AEA mission undertaken by the Growler is dramatically expanding as these new capabilities are added to its repertoire. How the Growler will operate alongside the U.S. Navy’s F-35C Lightning II stealth fighters, which have their own unique electronic warfare capabilities, is an important part of Havoc’s work. It means the school will work closely with the neighboring Topgun as it expands the inclusion of the F-35C in its syllabus. Read all about how the F-35C is changing Topgun in this recent feature of ours . A Havoc EA-18G on the packed flight line at NAS Fallon., Jamie Hunter Stealthy combat aircraft often rely on AEA support in the most complex IADS environments to ensure they remain fully protected. “Growler aircrews provide the optimum combination of kinetic and non-kinetic effects for each supported platform or “Protected Entity” based on that platform’s unique capabilities,” explains Capt Stevenson. “During mission planning, Growler aircrews will determine the most effective method of support, and how that may evolve during a given mission. It’s a very dynamic process that requires split-second decision making to ensure that the survivability of the strike package is maximized.” Part of Havoc’s work is to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures for the Growler to operate as part of an integrated joint force and to maximize lethality for the CVW and joint forces in the most demanding and hostile environments. This involves bringing together a full spectrum of assets and capabilities to disable an IADS in an effective manner. These considerations underline why HAVOC has been closely involved with the development and fielding of the NGJ from the outset. Looking ahead, Havoc will continue to play a critical role in training squadron-level Growler operators and elevating them to become the fleet’s electronic attack specialists. It’s part of the constant evolution of an important frontline asset in ensuring its operators have the know-how to efficiently employ a platform’s latest technologies, and how to combat the latest threats that could be faced in what is arguably one of combat aviation’s most challenging roles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Check Out How Rusty And Battered USS Stout Looks After Spending A Record 215 Days At Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s amazing what the crew of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Stout (DDG-55) has pulled off. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the world, impacting their fellow sailors on other ships in unprecedented ways , Stout sailed on… And on… And on . This ship stayed at sea for a whopping 215 days straight and she has the wear and tear to show for it. The fighting ship looks like a set from a dystopian naval thriller, streaked in rust, her hull dinged and battered from the hard deployment. The ship didn’t pull into a single port between early March and her arrival in Rota, Spain on October 3rd. In that period of time, she spent her time escorting ships, including Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD-5) and the Nimitz class aircraft carriers USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) and USS Nimitz (CVN-68), as well as executing a slew of other tasks in the 2nd, 5th and 6th Fleets’ areas of responsibilities. In that time, Stout executed three dozen consecutive underway replenishment cycles and executed maintenance that is usually done in port, while remaining at sea. The Navy stated the following in a release : “As COVID-19 made frequent port visits unsafe, Stout competed the first modern Mid-Deployment Voyage Repair (MDVR) period at sea, spending a week executing scheduled maintenance and preservation to maintain mission readiness while deployed. Throughout the deployment, Stout’s technicians executed depot-level repairs on vital engineering and combat systems equipment.” Amazing. Stout finally home, her bridge and radar arrays streaked in rust., U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Jason Pastrick The previous record for consecutive days at sea was held by the Nimitz class supercarrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS San Jacinto, both of which Stout supported on her cruise. Those ships had spent 206 days at sea due to the same circumstances. Prior to that, the record was 160 days. The weathered destroyer finally pulled into Naval Station Norfolk on October 11th, 2020, ending her historic deployment. She hadn’t been home since mid-January and traveled over 60,000 miles on her extended voyage. So, how did the crew stay sane bottled up for hundreds of days on a warship out at sea? The Navy writes: “During that period the ship conducted morale events, like swim calls and steel beach picnics … To allow the crew time to relax and reenergize, they had a ‘rest & reset’ period at sea.” A for how rough the ship looks, we asked our friend, Navy veteran, Defense News reporter , and the king of ‘running rust’ commentary, David Larter, his thoughts: “She looks like she was put through the wringer. Look, they haven’t been in port, haven’t been able to do much topside preservation, I imagine. She gets a pass. But these long deployments and 208-day underways are going to take a toll on these ships inside and out. It’s honestly impressive they kept a quarter-century old ship in running form that long! But the Navy will have to pay the piper. This is unsustainable.” He’s absolutely right when it comes to the sustainability of a fleet being pushed to the edge and beyond when it comes to deployments and operations tempo. This is especially relevant considering the service’s high ambitions of maintaining a future fleet of 500 ships , a goal that sits in stark contrast to the number and readiness of support and maintenance facilities available to maintain even the aging fleet the Navy already has, which is under 300 ships. It also speaks to the retention of sailors that are being asked to work harder and longer , and, in these latest cases, seeing little of the world in the process. Regardless of the technology available today, the Navy still runs largely on raw manpower. Pushing sailors to the brink over and over again to contend with rising threats , the need to be seemingly everywhere, and now COVID-19, could have major readiness implications down the line. Regardless, Stout’s crew deserves an extremely well-earned rest—on land. By the looks of it, so does the 26-year-old ship.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2021",Why The Destroyer USS Paul Hamilton Came Home Flying A Crescent Moon Flag And A Long Pennant,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd returned to its homeport flying a huge Jolly Roger pirate flag, something the ship is uniquely authorized to do for reasons you can read about in this subsequent War Zone piece . Earlier this week, another destroyer in this class, the USS Paul Hamilton , finished up its latest deployment flying a large blue flag with a crescent moon-shaped symbol with the word “LIBERTY” written inside, as well as a very long pennant with a stars-and-stripes motif, both of which have their own fascinating backstories. Paul Hamilton , also known by its hull number DDG-60, returned to Naval Base San Diego in California on Oct. 13, 2020. The ship had left its homeport in January and spent some nine months at sea, primarily in the Middle East and Western Pacific, traveling approximately 54,422 nautical miles, in total, according to the Navy . The ship originally left port as part of the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group (CSG), which was tasked with conducting operations in the Western Pacific. The destroyer was detached from that CSG after the crew of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt became stricken with an outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, which forced the flattop to head for an extended stay in port in Guam. A picture taken from the USS Paul Hamilton of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Pinckney and the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt somewhere in the Pacific Ocean in January 2020., USN Paul Hamilton subsequently conducted other operations in the Pacific region, including in the contested South China Sea, before moving on to the Middle East. There it served for a time as the 5th Fleet Ballistic Missile Defense Commander and in the support of the International Maritime Security Construct aimed at deterring Iran. The Navy says the destroyer spent time attached to four different carrier groups, in total, throughout the course of the deployment to these two regions, but did not identify any beyond the Theodore Roosevelt CSG. “I could not be more proud of this crew and the great work they did in support of American interests in two strategic regions,” Navy Commander Mark Lawrence, the Paul Hamilton ’s commanding officer, said in a statement. The crew “adapted to the challenges of operating in a COVID environment and performed brilliantly, demonstrating remarkable self-sufficiency and the will to fight that our nation expects from its Navy.” By the time the ship returned to San Diego, it had spent exactly 270 days, or nine months, away from home, which brings us to the long-flowing pennant that it was flying. Navy ships are authorized to hoist this streamer, known as the “ Homeward-Bound Pennant ,” after spending that amount of time, or more, deployed. The USS Paul Hamilton arriving in San Diego on Oct. 13 flying the Homeward-Bound Pennant., USN The U.S. Navy inherited this tradition from the British Royal Navy. Historically British crews returning from long voyages would fly long streamers to celebrate that they were heading for their “paying off,” meaning that were headed home, at which time they would receive their wages. The practice of flying these pennants continued among American ships unofficially through World War II , after which the Navy formally added it to the service’s regulations and defined rules for when and how the streamers could be displayed. An online copy of one Navy manual lays out these stipulations: “The homeward-bound pennant is flown by ships returning from extended overseas tours. The pennant is authorized for display by a ship that has been on duty outside the limits of the United States continuously for at least 9 months. It is hoisted on getting under way for the United States and may be flown until sunset on the day of arrival in a port of destination. The pennant is similar to the commission pennant, but instead of the usual seven stars, there is one star for the first 9 months of overseas duty and one star for each additional 6 months. Total length of the pennant customarily is 1 foot for each officer and enlisted crew member who served overseas for a period in excess of 9 months. When the number of personnel produces an unwieldy pennant, the length of the pennant is restricted to the length of the ship.” “Upon arrival in a port of the United States, the blue portion containing the stars is presented to the commanding officer. The remainder of the pennant is divided equally among the officers and enlisted crew.” This is actually not the first time Paul Hamilton has flown the Homeward-Bound Pennant. The ship’s crew has raised it at least twice before , in 2003 and in 2013, after deployments lasting 10 months and a little over nine months, respectively. The USS Paul Hamilton flies the Homeward-Bound Pennant in 2013., USN But when the Paul Hamilton entered the Port of San Diego this time, she was also flying the previously-mentioned large blue flag with crescent moon-shaped symbol containing the word “LIBERTY.” This is known as the Moultrie Flag or Liberty flag and traces its roots to the American Revolutionary War . The “moon” is actually a representation of a gorget , a piece collar armor that, at the time, was worn symbolically by officers in the Continental Army, as well as many European armies, and denoted their rank. Colonel William Moultrie, a South Carolinian and head of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment, had the banner made up in 1775. The Moultrie Flag flying on the USS Paul Hamilton on Oct. 13., USN His troops prominently flew the flag during the Battle of Sullivan’s Island in 1776, where revolutionary forces held their ground against the Royal Navy’s attempt to dislodge them, an action that is credited with saving the state’s nearby capital, Charleston, from being captured by British Forces. Moultrie went on to lead continental troops in other successful engagements with the British until his capture in 1780. The Moultrie Flag, K. Aainsqatsi via Wikimedia An image depicting continental forces raising the Moultrie Flag after the successful defense of Sullivan’s Island in 1776, Johannes Oertel via Wikimedia While in captivity, he rejected attempts by the British to turn him to their side and was eventually released in a prisoner exchange in 1782. After the revolutionary war, he became a notable politician in South Carolina’s early history. His flag became the basis for the official South Carolina state flag . The Paul Hamilton ‘s namesake was another South Carolinian who served in the Revolutionary War and went on to become the third Secretary of the Navy, as well as a notable politician in his own right. Three destroyers have been named after him, beginning with the Clemson class USS Paul Hamilton , which was commissioned in 1919 and served in the inter-war period before it was scrapped in 1931. In 1943, the Navy commissioned a Fletcher class destroyer bearing his name. There was also a Liberty Ship named after him during World War II. A portrait of the third Secretary of the Navy and American statesman Paul Hamilton., G.B. Matthews via Wikimedia The Navy decommissioned the Fletcher class USS Paul Hamilton in 1968. A quarter of a century later, the service brought the name back when it commissioned DDG-60 in Charleston, South Carolina. Based on the heritage of its namesake, this Arleigh Burke class destroyer is authorized to fly the Moultrie Flag as its battle flag. “The Navy values its heritage and traditions, and this is ever-reflected in our ship and crew,” Navy Lieutenant J.G. Tyler Kesthely, a surface warfare officer serving on the Paul Hamilton , said in an interview for an official news piece earlier this year. “ Paul Hamilton and previous ships with the same namesake help shape our identity. Our battle flag, the Moultrie Flag, dates back to the very beginning of the Revolutionary War. It’s a fierce tradition that Paul Hamilton sailors still identify with.” As with USS Kidd ‘s formal approval to fly its pirate flag, Paul Hamilton’s official sanction to fly the Moultrie flag is now additionally notable as it comes after Pentagon declared new policies for the display of flags and other symbols for the entire U.S. military in July. Though intended primarily to ban service members from displaying flags and other items with the stars-and-bars battle flag of the Confederacy, as well as other divisive symbols, there were fears that ships’ crews could be prevented from hoisting the Jolly Roger and other morale-boosting banners . Though concerns certainly remain about how the Pentagon will apply and enforce those regulations, it does not appear to have had any impact on the Paul Hamilton ‘s ability to continue flying the Moultrie flag or that of Kidd ‘s crew to raise their skull-and-crossbones banner. These instances seem to be good indications that the Navy, at least, is perfectly able to preserve its traditions within the parameters of the new flag rules. USN After nine months away from home, the sailors of the Paul Hamilton certainly earned the right to show off the Moultrie Flag, as well as hoist the Homeward-Bound Pennant, in our minds.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recently released video provides a close look at one of Russia’s lesser-known weapons, the mighty Utes coastal-defense anti-ship missile system, in action. The particular weapon is assigned to the hardened battery that protects the maritime approaches to Sevastopol, on the strategically important Crimea peninsula that was seized by Russia in 2014. It’s unclear when the footage was recorded, but it was posted online on October 14, 2020, by TV Zvezda , the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense. The accompanying report suggests the missile-firing exercise occurred after the large-scale Kavkaz-2020 maneuvers, which also took place partly in the Black Sea, in late September. According to a summary provided by TV Zvezda , the video shows a joint missile firing exercise involving the Russian Navy’s frigate Admiral Grigorovich , which is the lead ship of its class, and Sevastopol’s Utes battery. The report explains that a 3M44 Progress anti-ship missile was launched from the Utes battery and was then successfully intercepted by the frigate’s air defense systems from a distance of more than 6.2 miles. Two video shows the Progress missile’s fiery departure from the right-side of the twin-tube launcher, which then disappears back into its bunker, protected by huge metal doors.

A 9M317M missile — an advanced, containerized version of the weapon used in the land-based Buk mobile surface-to-air missile system — is seen being launched from the warship’s 24-cell vertical launch system (VLS) at around the 2:10-minute mark in the accompanying video. The missile launch is seen from various different perspectives, emphasizing the “cold launch” ejection from the VLS before the rocket motor engages. A 9M317M is launched from the Russian Navy’s frigate Admiral Grigorovich. , RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP The 9M317M launch viewed from the bow, looking back down the warship., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP To ensure safety, the maritime range in the waters off Sevastopol that hosted the live-fire exercise was closed to other maritime traffic, with more than 10 warships and auxiliary vessels from the Black Sea Fleet patrolling the area to keep out intruders. While these drills showcase some of the latest Russian weaponry, they also reveal the continued importance of the veteran Utes and its unique relationship to the Crimea peninsula. The story of the Utes, meaning Cliff in Russian, dates all the way back to 1954, according to this authoritative Russian-language account . What is claimed to be the world’s first coastal underground anti-ship missile system was installed in the mountains near Balaklava, to protect Sevastopol and the Soviet Union’s southern maritime approaches. The commanding location of the Utes site today., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP The secretive site at Balaklava was codenamed Object 100 and consisted of two identical launch sites and associated underground complexes located 3.7 miles apart and armed with first-generation Sopka anti-ship cruise missiles, with a range of around 62 miles. A former East German Sopka anti-ship cruise missile preserved at the Bundeswehrmuseum in Dresden., JAN REHSCHUH/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Buried under thick layers of concrete to protect it from nuclear attack, the complete facilities included command posts, missile storage, and workshops for preparing and refueling the missiles, which were themselves transported on special trucks, with their wings folded. To provide a degree of independent operation, the underground missile base was provided with diesel powerplants, filtration and ventilation units, plus stocks of fuel, water, and food. The initial version of Object 100 was commissioned into service in July 1957 as the Soviet Navy’s first coastal missile unit. By the early 1960s, the subsonic Sopka was showing its age and the decision was taken to replace it with the Utes system armed with a new supersonic anti-ship missile, the P-35B, which was also used in a road-mobile coastal defense system, the Redut. A road-mobile Redut coastal defense system assigned to the Russian Pacific Fleet., SERGEY KONOVALOV/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The Utes complex went online in April 1973 and also involved the installation of a new radar, identification-friend-or-foe system, as well as an updated control center, launchers, and various new ground equipment. The liquid-fueled P-35B missiles could be prepared below ground with their wings folded, before being raised to their firing position by elevating the launchers. These would then return below ground for reloading. In 1982, the Utes complex was modernized again with the introduction of a third-generation missile, the 3M44 Progress. This had an effective range of a reported 286 miles, compared to 168 miles for the previous P-35B. It also included the option of a 350-kiloton nuclear warhead. In December 1991, the Soviet Union broke up into 15 new states, each of which set about organizing its own armed forces. The Soviet-era Black Sea Fleet was divided between Russia and Ukraine, with Kyiv allowing temporary stationing of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea. Meanwhile, Objekt 100 was transferred to the Ukrainian Navy in 1996 and apparently fell out of use. However, a change in fortunes came with Russia’s illegal seizure and subsequent annexation of Crimea in 2014. The Utes was rapidly returned to combat status, with a first missile launch during an exercise occurring in April 2016. More recently, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has begun to deploy more modern and capable coastal defense assets in the region, as well. These include the K-300P Bastion-P mobile system, known to NATO as the SSC-5 Stooge. The missiles launched by this system reportedly have a range of 186 miles and a speed of around Mach 2.5. Shorter-ranged, but similarly mobile, is the 3K60 Bal coastal defense missile system, which is also in use with the Black Sea Fleet. Designated SSC-6 Sennight by NATO, the Bal is a subsonic missile, broadly similar to the American Harpoon, and has a range of 75 miles. Each Bal launch vehicle can carry eight missiles, and a pair of launch vehicles can deliver a 16-missile volley against their target. Both the Bastion-P and Bal were used during the live-fire portion of the recent Kavkaz-2020 exercise. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the missile systems were employed against a simulated enemy amphibious task force approaching the Black Sea coast in the Krasnodar region, immediately east of Crimea. Compared to the aging Utes system, the Bastion-P and Bal are harder to target, being able to launch their solid-fuel missiles rapidly before moving to another location. They are also able to receive targeting data from a wide variety of sources, including unmanned aerial vehicles, which was also practiced during Kavkaz-2020. Both these new systems have also been deployed in Crimea . These coastal defense systems are just one aspect of what is one of the largest concentrations of anti-ship missile capabilities in the world. Combined with their Black Sea fleet and Russian airpower counterparts, they can quickly transform nearly the whole of the confined Black Sea into a super anti-ship missile engagement zone on short notice. While the combat efficiency of the Utes cruise missile system is questionable, it’s clear that the Russian Navy still sees value in it. Even if it is now at least partially being used for air defense training, this Cold War warrior is still playing a useful role.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The curtain has finally come down on one of the U.S. Marine Corps’ most battle-hardened helicopters. The branch has officially retired the Bell AH-1W Super Cobra from its ranks, after over three decades of service that included combat operations during Operations Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, among other campaigns. An official final flight for the AH-1W took place at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 14, 2020, as part of the “Whiskey Sundown Ceremony.” This also included a photo sortie over New Orleans together with its successor, the AH-1Z Viper . The last “Whiskey” sortie was performed by Detachment A of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773, the “Red Dogs,” part of the Reserve Forces, based at New Orleans. As the U.S. Marine Corps’ premier attack helicopter, the Super Cobra’s career included 933,614 flight hours as of August 2020, according to a press release from the service. “The AH-1W Super Cobra has served admirably and leaves a remarkable legacy of on-time, on-target attack helicopter support for our Marines,” said Marine Corps Colonel David Walsh, the program manager for Light/Attack Helicopter Programs (PMA-276). “Although the AH-1W chapter is closing, the AH-1Z Viper stands ready with even greater capability to support our Marines for years to come.” “We are tremendously proud of the capabilities the AH-1W has brought to the United States Marines for the past 34 years,” added Michael Deslatte, H-1 Bell Program Manager. “The Super Cobra’s tremendous legacy is a testament to the excellence and dedication the men and women at Bell put into these platforms for generations and we look forward to continuing that legacy for years to come.” An AH-1W participates in a final flight during the “Whiskey Sundown Ceremony” at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, New Orleans, on October 14, 2020., U.S. MARINE CORPS/LANCE CPL.

The Marines then got the improved AH-1T version in 1976, this adding a precision weapons capability with the BGM-71 TOW (Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided) anti-tank missile. The story of the “Whiskey,” meanwhile, can be traced back to the AH-1T+ demonstrator. This version had originally been developed for Iran under the Shah. The Iranians were looking for an enhanced AH-1J that would incorporate new General Electric T700-GE-700 engines and transmission of the Bell Model 214ST helicopter. There were also plans for license-production of the 214ST, which you can read about more in this past War Zone feature , in Iran. The overthrow of the Shah in 1979 put an end to any Iranian AH-1T+ ambitions, but the U.S. Marine Corps’ plans at that time to acquire a navalized version of the U.S. Army’s AH-64 Apache would also soon run into its own problems. The T+ variant emerged as a suitable replacement after Congress refused to grant any funds for a Marine procurement of the AH-64 in 1981. Fortunately, Bell had meanwhile continued to work on the AH-1T+ on its own. The helicopter had completed a maiden flight in April 1980 powered by a pair of 1,258-shaft-horsepower General Electric T700-GE-700 engines. This is notably the same engine found on initial AH-64s, as well as early versions of the UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopter. The AH-1T+ then returned to the air with T700-GE-401s, a version of the T700 optimized for maritime environments, on November 16, 1983, at Bell’s Flight Research Center in Arlington, Texas. By that time, the helicopter was effectively serving as the AH-1W prototype and the new powerplant had been integrated under a $4.1-million contract. Besides the new engines, the prototype added a raft of other new features, most prominently bulged “cheek” fairings accommodating electronics associated with the TOW missile, relocated from their previous position in the tail boom, plus large exhaust suppressors to reduce the infrared signature. As well as the TOW, the prototype also trialed AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, both of which would eventually find places in the arsenal of the production aircraft. Other additions included an AN/ALQ-144 infrared-guided missile countermeasure device, as well as AN/ALE-39 chaff and flare dispensers. New electronics in the nose meant the new attack helicopter could undertake attack missions day or night. The first production version of this helicopter was designated AH-1W, for which the Marines had placed orders for an initial batch of 44, plus a single TAH-1W training helicopter. Bell delivered the first of these to the Marines on March 27, 1986, and delivered the final aircraft in 1999, ultimately providing a fleet of 179 aircraft. By procuring AH-1Ws, the Marines retained valuable commonality with the “Huey” fleet, an advantage that is optimized today with the AH-1Z and UH-1Y. The AH-1W went on to serve with distinction during almost three decades of combat in theaters that included Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Somalia. A succession of upgrades ensured the effectiveness of the gunship until the end of its U.S. Marine Corps career.

ROBERT BROWN Retirement may mean the official end of the AH-1W in Marine Corps service, but some of the venerable “Whiskey” airframes fly on after they were remanufactured as significantly upgraded AH-1Zs. The AH-1Z Viper that has replaced the Marine AH-1W began life as a “four-bladed Whiskey” and has been introduced together with the UH-1Y Venom, with which it shares 84 percent parts commonality, as part of the H-1 Upgrade Program. The vastly more capable AH-1Z entered U.S. Marine Corps service in 2010, and you can read all about its attributes here . True AH-1Ws will continue to serve abroad, as well, with Taiwan and with Turkey. There’s also still a chance that surplus U.S. Marine Corps “Whiskeys” could end up being transferred to one or more foreign air arms, extending this classic type’s illustrious legacy still further, perhaps with its capabilities further enhanced by additional upgrades . While the Marines announced plans to offload most of the “Whiskey” fleet in the past, so far this has not resulted in any export sales. While some AH-1Ws may continue to fly with the Marines in spirit after getting rebuilt as “Zulus,” the type’s official days of flying with the Corps are now over, after 35 years of service.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 30, 2021",This F-22 Raptor Wing Tank Storage Facility Looks Like A Science Fiction Movie Set,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. F-22A Raptor is still as much of a modern marvel as it was when it entered service a decade and a half ago, but nothing about the world’s first 5th generation stealth super-fighter, or really any modern fighter aircraft for that matter, is simple or cheap. Case in point, the place where the Raptor’s 600-gallon external fuel tanks are stored at Langely AFB in Virginia, one of the USAF’s biggest Raptor nests . Dubbed the Vertical Tank Storage System (VTSS), the indoor installation is like one of those dry cleaning conveyor racks, but it holds massive external fuel tanks, not shirts and sport coats. It was just featured in a number of cool photos from the 1st Fighter Wing’s public affairs folks. The F-22 uses massive 600-gallon wing tanks to extend its range for missions where low-observability (stealth) is not a primary necessity. For instance, Raptors that sit alert in Alaska fly with the wing tanks as their intercept missions can cross vast distances over long periods. This is in addition to having a support tanker launched during scambles. They are also used when F-22s are ferried to overseas operating locations. F-22 Raptors equipped with wing tanks at Elmendorf AFB in Alaska. , USAF The tanks on the F-22 are actually made to be jettisoned with their pylons attached. This allows F-22 pilots to ‘buy-back’ some stealthiness, as well as higher performance, on-demand. USAF Seeing as these big wing tanks are a critical part of the stealth fighter’s capability set, they need to be stored somewhere. This is where the VTSS comes in. Where traditionally drop tanks have been stored mainly outdoors laid or stacked on the ground in cradles, or in shed-like structures, bringing them indoors and hanging them vertically on an automated rack saves space, improves the condition and longevity of the tanks, makes them more accessible in any weather conditions, and above all else, it saves time and lowers the amount of airman you need to handle them. When it comes to Langley’s Raptor force, which could be called to deploy at a moment’s notice, this is clearly beneficial, but other fighter bases have also received this system, as well. 1st Fighter Wing 1st Fighter Wing A company called International Automated Systems, or IAS , makes the automated tank racks. They are fairly remarkable machines to see in action, which you can in the video below. The huge industrial setup certainly looks like a set out of a science fiction movie. For someone who doesn’t know a lot about military aviation, you can imagine how they would probably think they have stumbled upon a nuclear weapons bunker. It is simply amazing how many little-known sci-fi-like facilities the military-industrial complex has brought to life . But above all else, this setup serves as another reminder that something that seems fairly simple, like handling drop tanks for fighter aircraft, is really anything but.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Jan 26, 2021",The A-10 Warthog Is Preparing For Its Biggest Upgrade In Over A Decade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just six years ago the U.S. Air Force was on the verge of culling its entire fleet of A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, better known as Warthogs. In 2014, the then USAF Chief of Staff, Gen Mark Welsh III, said the Air Force had to retire the A-10 completely if it was to make substantial cuts to its budgets, and that it required freed-up funding and manpower to be channeled into the standup of new F-35 units. Welsh claimed divesting the close air support stalwart would save $3.7 billion across the five-year future-year defense program and another $500 million in cost avoidance for upgrades that wouldn’t be necessary. How times have changed. Fast forward to 2020 and the A-10 is not only here to stay, but it’s getting a raft of upgrades to keep it relevant for years to come. New weapons, a new cockpit layout, and an overhaul of tactics are some of the elements now in the pipeline to keep the “Hawg’s” tusks sharp and its community a meaningful contributor on the front line fight. Built to ravage Soviet tanks on the plains of northern Europe, the A-10 was designed around the General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm cannon and its seven barrels, which are able to dish out devastating punishment to armor. Over the years, the Warthog’s 11 hardpoints have evolved from carrying dumb iron bombs and rockets to hauling the latest guided ordnance. Despite carving itself a fearsome reputation during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and evolving with the times as new technology became available, the venerable ground attack jet has repeatedly come under fire from within the Air Force when it comes to cutbacks. The USAF made the case for the F-35A Lightning II to assume the A-10’s roles, emphasizing how the Warthog was no longer survivable in modern high-threat environments littered with advanced air defense systems. The A-10 community was told that the drawn-out war in Afghanistan was over and that close air support (CAS) specialists were no longer needed. All the while, A-10 supporters in Congress vehemently rejected the proposals on the grounds that it would severely impact the USAF’s ability to cover this mission, and some demanded a fly-off to prove once and for all that the F-35 could adequately replace the A-10 in this mission. An A-10C assigned to the 163rd Fighter Squadron, Indiana Air National Guard. , USAF/SSgt Corey Hook Fight against ISIS helps make the case for retaining the A-10 As talk of retiring the A-10 grew in 2014, Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), the U.S.-led mission to dismantle the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, was ramping up fast and pressure was put on the USAF to step up its involvement in the expanding campaign. Back home, the Fiscal Year 2015 spending plan included House and Senate Armed Services Committee stipulations that essentially blocked efforts to retire the A-10 fleet. It was a perfect storm that effectively saved the A-10. The Indiana Air National Guard’s 163rd Fighter Squadron, the “Blacksnakes,” deployed to the Central Command (CENTCOM) area of operations in October 2014, as part of a Theater Security Package sent to Kuwait. The unit was quickly re-tasked to Afghanistan to cover U.S. Army withdrawals from forward operating bases (FOBs) in that war-ravaged country. However, after only a month in theater, the pressure was on to move the “Blacksnakes” back to Kuwait to join the burgeoning effort against ISIS. The A-10s were immediately pressed into combat missions, a move that was to again underscore the usefulness of the A-10 to senior leaders. As time went on, a succession of Warthog squadrons were called upon to join the OIR mission, providing both CAS, as well as cover for Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) for coalition operations. An A-10C drops a flare during a mission on the Nevada Test and Training Range., Jamie Hunter New upgrades for the A-10 The scheme to retire the A-10 had started a knock-on effect with regard to support and upgrades. Operational testing for the active-duty A-10 fleet at the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and the A-10 Program Office at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, had both effectively been shut down . However, with OIR at its height, by the summer of 2016, this was all being reversed, with a renewed impetus for mission-critical enhancements for the A-10. The planned end of the A-10 briefly stalled some supply chains, but a rolling series of upgrades were soon back on track. “In 2017, the Lightweight Airborne Recovery System [LARS] V-12 was installed on all active-duty and Air National Guard and Reserve Command A-10s to allow pilots to communicate more effectively with individuals on the ground such as downed pilots and pararescuemen,” explains Air Force Major Matthew Kading, the A-10 Test Director for the 59th TES. “This was integrated in [Operational Flight Program, OFP] Suite 8, and all A-10s now have this system integrated into the Central Interface Control Unit to provide critical Combat Search and Rescue [CSAR] information.” As a community with limited funding, the active-duty test effort under the 422nd and the 59th Test and Evaluation Squadrons and that of the Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) at Tucson Air National Guard Base, Arizona, now work collectively. The USAF currently fields 281 A-10s, but there have been numerous failed attempts to reduce the fleet . The USAF’s proposed Fiscal Year 2021 budget looks to cut three squadrons-worth of jets, effectively 44 Warthogs. This too may well end up curbed and now major A-10 upgrades are moving full steam ahead. Such is the resurgence of the A-10, that a new Common Fleet Initiative is planned to keep the type in service and credible out towards 2035. Central to the upgrades for the A-10 is the need to be survivable in a contested environment. This involves Warthog pilots evading threats through the additional use of standoff weapons from longer ranges, combined with the use of updated tactics. A-10 operations will evolve to include the ability to tackle some threats with precision weapons from extended ranges. Once these threats are destroyed, the A-10s will then theoretically be able to swing into more traditional missions. “Survivability isn’t just about upgrading equipment and software, it’s about ensuring we’re going into battle with the most up-to-date and lethal tactics,” says Major Kading. “What makes the 422nd/59th TES, and the 53rd Wing as a whole, a unique organization is that we do all of these things.” An A-10C from the USAF Weapons School at Nellis AFB., Jamie Hunter “Right now, the 422 is working on multiple Tactics Development and Evaluations [TD&Es] to address an Air Combat Command Tactics Improvement Proposals, known as a ‘TIPs.’ One current example is a TIP for Night Medium Altitude Survivability and Low Altitude Tactics. Modern Night Vision Goggle fidelity has driven the requirement to re-evaluate if we can execute the A-10’s primary missions at lower altitudes at night. Other planned TD&Es include adapting CSAR tactics and engaging maritime targets with AGR-20 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System [APKWS] rockets. There are also continued efforts to enhance the A-10’s capability to operate from austere environments with minimal support. All these will allow for greater readiness and mission ability through tactics improvements,” Kading explains. The AGR-20 APKWS II is a guided version of the veteran 2.75-inch Folded Fin Aerial Rocket, which was added to the A-10’s arsenal in 2013 . “Suite 9 [fielded in 2019] brought the integration of Situational Awareness Position (SAP) into the OFP, so JTACs [forward air controllers] can report their position digitally,” says Kading. “Validation was built in to help prevent inadvertent targeting of friendly positions with inertially aided munitions. It also introduced the first phase of engaging multiple targets with precision-guided munitions. It allowed six weapons to be dropped with a single ‘pickle button’ press.” The aircraft can send weapons to different targets with one button push on one pass, whereas before it took a lot of pilot workload. A-10 pilots can employ 500-pound-class GBU-38 or 54  or 2,000-pound class GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Muntions (JDAM) and the aircraft will inform the pilot if they can all hit their intended targets on a single run. Suite 9 also included provision for an improved helmet-mounted sight, known as HObIT (Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker), which is a development of the Thales Visionix Scorpion helmet that A-10 pilots have been wearing since 2013. The improved helmet more accurately tracks pilot head movements via a new optical head tracker, consisting of a series of dots on the canopy. This pilot from the Idaho ANG is wearing the new HObIT (Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker) helmet., Jamie Hunter Biggest upgrade since the A-10C The upgrade of A-10As to A-10Cs from 2005 onwards was a huge leap for the Warthog. This essentially added precision weapons, a partial glass cockpit, and a laser designator pod. “Suite 10 will field in the spring of 2021, and it’s a foundational step in the modernization of the A-10,” says Kading. Suite 10 will include “multiple target list improvements” that will enable the pilot to engage multiple targets with three different weapon types on one pass. It also includes full AGR-20 APKWS integration, which Kading says “provides the ability to target at the maximum kinematic range of the rocket with aiming solutions designed within rocket tolerances.” GBU-31(V)3 JDAM integration brings expanded capabilities for utilizing new fuze types, and “improved JDAM feedback” will enable the pilot to have greater confidence in weapon accuracy. “Threat information can now be shared between A-10s utilizing the data link, which allows all flight members increased situation awareness for survivability.” An A-10C of the 422nd TES at Nellis AFB., Jamie Hunter “Operational testing for Suite 11 will begin when Suite 10 fields,” Major Kading continues. The developmental testing of this phase is currently underway with the 40th Flight Test Squadron, which is headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. “Suite 11 is the first A-10 OFP that will be built using agile development methodologies. This will provide a more rapid update cycle for relevant enhancements.” “Most of the improvements in this program will focus on hardware integration of a new High Resolution Display System [HRDS], GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb [SDB] integration, 3-D audio , jam-resistant GPS , and ARC-210 radio upgrades. New map software will also be added, along with further enhancements to weapons employment. Both the method of development and the result will be a major modernization for the A-10.” “We are currently working on the HRDS, which is a 11.6-inch, 1920 x 1080-pixel Multifunction Color Display that replaces [the cockpit’s central ‘six-pack” of analogue instruments] with a digital primary flight display. This will display high definition targeting pod footage and a new map engine. It is the most significant cockpit modernization since the A-10A to A-10C conversion.” The new HRDS display will replace the central pack of analogue instruments in the A-10 cockpit., Jamie Hunter “This upgrade is important because it provides modern navigation instruments to improve situational awareness when flying in IMC [Instrument Meteorological Conditions],” Kading explains. “It will make targets much more visible through a higher definition display of targeting pod ​footage and improved map imagery will allow enhanced target correlation.” “SDB testing is currently in developmental testing with the 40th Flight Test Squadron, Detachment 1, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. This will give the A-10 a four-fold increase in standoff bomb capability and allows the A-10 to provide weapons effects in much [greater] threat environments than before.” This is due to the standoff range of these weapons, which means the A-10 pilot will be able to strike from outside the range of some ground threats. The GBU-39 SDB will give the A-10 greater ability to make precision standoff strikes., USAF The USAF completed a project to re-wing a portion of its A-10C fleet on July 25, 2019. The project began in 2007 when Boeing received a $1.1-billion contract to provide 173 sets of wings. The new wings are expected to last for up to 10,000 equivalent flight hours without requiring a depot inspection and will permit the modified aircraft to remain in service through 2030 or beyond. A further project to provide 112 additional wing sets for the remaining A-10Cs was funded in Fiscal Year 2018. The service is acquiring the wing sets under the A-10 Thunderbolt Advanced-Wing Continuation Kit (ATACK) program. A long-held ambition to re-engine the A-10s isn’t included in current plans. New parts suppliers with modern techniques may help restore the original engine thrust of the General Electric TF34 engines rather than the slight de-tune that the aircraft currently operates with. Together, this host of capability upgrades will keep the A-10 at the forefront of the USAF CAS mission for at least another decade, and likely substantially longer. A lot will depend on whether or not the USAF decides to mount another attack on the Thunderbolt II fleet, but with new investments being made to recapitalize the A-10 force and with reduced interest in a successor or new Light Attack platform , all indications are that the A-10 will not be going away anytime soon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. British special forces sprung into action yesterday, storming a crude-oil tanker in the English Channel in response to a suspected hijack attempt that led to seven stowaways being detained after a raid that lasted just nine minutes. The secretive Special Boat Service (SBS), a less well-known component of the U.K. special operations community, but one with a storied history, carried out the raid. Taking down the Nave Andromeda The Special Boat Service team took control of the 42,000-gross-tonnage Liberian-registered tanker Nave Andromeda as darkness fell on the evening of October 25, 2020, after fast-roping from Royal Navy helicopters onto the deck. Reportedly landing at either end of the tanker in a pincer movement, the soldiers, equipped with night-vision devices, subdued the stowaways after they had made threats towards the crew during what had been a ten-hour standoff. According to a report in The Times , the captain of the tanker put out the lights while Royal Navy helicopters used “obscurant” tactics — flashing lights in an effort to disorientate the stowaways on board. Unconfirmed reports suggest that around 16 SBS operators may have been involved in the mission. A Royal Navy Type 23 frigate, HMS Richmond , was reportedly placed on standby nearby if backup was required. . @HMS_Richmond seen anchored in Tor Bay this afternoon before this evening's excitement #NaveAndromeda via @218goldcoast pic.twitter.com/yzI6MLuqzJ — Navy Lookout (@NavyLookout) October 25, 2020 The team from the SBS, based in Poole, Dorset, was apparently brought closer to the Nave Andromeda by a Royal Air Force (RAF) Chinook helicopter , which had been noted flying toward Poole earlier the same evening.

Both of these maritime rotorcraft types are based at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton, Somerset, in the west of England. The two helicopters that were reportedly used in the Nave Andromeda incident: a Wildcat AH1 (left) and a Merlin HC4, during deck operations in the Baltic in 2019., CROWN COPYRIGHT Yeovilton, home of the Commando Helicopter Force, keeps a handful of helicopters on a few hours’ notice for various missions, including supporting maritime counterterrorist (MCT) tasks in British waters. These typically might involve inserting assault teams from the SBS onto vessels, as was the case in the Nave Andromeda incident, or oil rigs. “Armed Forces have gained control of the ship and seven individuals have been detained,” confirmed a statement from the Ministry of Defence, soon after the incident had been resolved. “Police investigations will now continue. Initial reports confirm the crew are safe and well.” “I commend the hard work of the armed forces and police to protect lives and secure the ship,” said U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. “In dark skies, and worsening weather, we should all be grateful for our brave personnel. People are safe tonight thanks to their efforts.” The Nave Andromeda had originally sailed from Lagos in Nigeria on October 6, 2020, and was headed to the English port of Southampton, where it was scheduled to arrive on October 25, and where it would then take on a cargo of petroleum. The ship’s owner, Greece-based Navios Tankers Management, said that the stowaways, all reportedly Nigerian , had “illegally boarded” the tanker while it was docked in Lagos. Two subsequent stops were made off the Canary Islands off the coast of North Africa and off the northern French coast. However, the tanker didn’t arrive in Southampton as planned. Instead, with the vessel close to the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, its course started to become erratic, as evidenced by vessel tracking websites. “Initially, it didn’t look like this was terrorist-related nor involving WMD [weapons of mass destruction], but the erratic behavior [of the ship] was concerning,” explained Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, the body appointed by the parliament to examine Ministry of Defence expenditure, administration, and policy. “The safety of the crew was important, as is indeed any unauthorized movement towards the coast,” he added. With the 748-foot tanker around six miles off the coast of Bembridge, on the easternmost tip of the Isle of Wight — only around 60 miles east of the SBS base in Poole — local police were alerted to the situation when concerns were raised about the welfare of the 22 crew onboard the ship. While the presence of the stowaways had been discovered during the tanker’s transit, they had apparently started to become violent when the crew tried to lock them in a cabin, reportedly after they expressed their desire to leave the vessel. Navios Tankers Management added that the police were informed on Sunday morning when the captain became “concerned for the safety of the crew due to the increasingly hostile behavior of the stowaways.” By midday Sunday there was a three-mile exclusion zone around the tanker and a temporary restricted area in place over the vessel, prohibiting overflights below an altitude of 5,000 feet, to prevent any conflict with the police and Maritime and Coastguard Agency helicopters already operating around it. At this stage, there were no military helicopters on the scene and the U.K. Ministry of Defence confirmed it was not involved. However, a military response was by now clearly being prepared. 2nd Police Helicopter now arriving at the location of the tanker, probably swapping with the other Police Helicopter pic.twitter.com/GITdtnCCh4 — Air & Sea Intel (@air_intel) October 25, 2020 This year has seen a spike in migrants crossing the English Channel , with reports that 7,000 had arrived in the United Kingdom in small boats by the end of September, a more than threefold increase over the whole of 2019. While most of the vessels involved are far smaller than the Nave Andromeda , it’s a mission that is increasingly seeing involvement from the U.K. Armed Forces . Early Sunday evening, with concerns for the tanker’s crew growing, police requested assistance from the U.K. Armed Forces and that’s when the Royal Navy’s elite Special Boat Service (SBS) immediately swung into action. The operation will have been formally authorized by both Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The tanker finally arrived in the port of Southampton on the following morning, October 26. Lights from one or more helicopters in the sky around the tanker Nave Andromeda. , ISLAND ECHO SCREENCAP The Ministry of Defence maintains a very tight level of security around the work of the SBS and many of its operations remain classified. The Royal Navy’s website describes the unit very briefly as “Made up of small, highly trained teams, [specialized] in daring undercover raids that exploit the element of surprise.” As the special forces unit of the Royal Navy, its tasks include, but are not restricted to, handling terrorist and other incidents at sea. While the number of members is a closely guarded secret, estimates suggest the SBS has around 200 to 250 personnel, most of them drawn from the Royal Marines Commandos, the Royal Navy’s amphibious light infantry. Early days The SBS traces its history back to World War II, and a number of British Armed Forces units that undertook raids, sabotage missions, and reconnaissance from small boats, canoes and submarines. Among these was the Special Boat Section, created in 1940 by Commando officer Captain Roger Courtney . The unit had particular success using folding canoes on raids against railways, port facilities, and airfields in Scandinavia and the Mediterranean. Later in the conflict, their activities would extend to Burma, for operations against the Japanese. The wartime Special Boat Section also provided beach reconnaissance ahead of amphibious landings, including for landings in North Africa and Italy. By early 1942, part of the Special Boat Section had been amalgamated with a similar unit, the British Army’s Small Scale Raiding Force, to create the new Special Boat Squadron. Among the Special Boat Squadron’s notable activities were raids in the Aegean Sea, where they made use of adapted local fishing boats to operate unnoticed among the area’s shipping fleets. They also deployed teams from canoes, dinghies, and submarines. The latter method was used to deliver a team to Crete, where they blew up German aircraft and munitions before fighting their way out. Two members of the Special Boat Squadron in the Aegean theater during World War II., CROWN COPYRIGHT/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS In early 1944, the Special Boat Squadron was renamed the Special Boat Service — the name it carries today — although it was disbanded after World War II. Reestablished in 1948 as the Special Boat Section, it underwent yet more name changes during the Cold War, becoming the Special Boat Company, the Special Boat Squadron, and finally the Special Boat Service in 1987. Meanwhile, its wartime activities took it to theaters including Palestine, Korea, and Indonesia. On land and at sea While maritime work is at the core of the SBS, the unit also operates on land if required and it has seen action on the ground in Northern Ireland and the Falklands and, more recently, has been engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan. While there is no official word on the composition of the SBS, it’s assumed to include four squadrons each of around 64 soldiers. In the past, different squadrons were responsible for swimmer and canoe operations, operating small boats (including kayaks) and mini-submarines, plus maritime counter-terrorism and ship-boarding. Today, however, it is thought that these roles are rotated through the squadrons. In addition to being flown into action aboard helicopters, the SBS also trains for “boat drop” operations, in which a Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) is delivered from the rear ramp of an RAF C-130J Hercules transport, followed by the SBS team, also descending under parachutes into the water below. The SBS frogmen can also make use of the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) that can be fitted to the Roal Navy’s Astute -class nuclear-powered fleet submarines. This allows an SBS team to be inserted or picked up close to a foreign shore. The DDS, combined with a Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) used to get from the submarine to the shore, allows the SBS to perform its covert infiltration activities almost anywhere around the globe where there is a coastline. Befitting a special forces outfit, the SBS is known to be provided with a range of bespoke equipment, ranging from stealthy Fast Interceptor Craft (FIC) to, reportedly, Heckler & Koch P11 underwater pistols . The SBS was at the forefront of U.K. special forces work in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991. Surveillance and sabotage teams from both the SBS, as well as elements of the British Army’s better-known Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment, were flown by RAF Chinook helicopters surveillance and sabotage teams deep behind Iraqi lines. Another Chinook reportedly flew an SBS team into Kuwait City to retake the British Embassy there. An RAF Chinook helicopter transports a Royal Marine rigid-inflatable boat (RIB), of the type used by the SBS., CROWN COPYRIGHT In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the SBS found itself engaged in Afghanistan, where a contingent arrived at Bagram Airfield a month later. Again, they worked alongside their SAS counterparts and special forces helicopters from the RAF, including tracking al-Qaeda operatives across the country. Later in the Afghan campaign, SBS teams formed part of the U.K. Special Forces Task Force at Kandahar Airport in southern Afghanistan, from where they targeted Taliban insurgents, flying into action onboard RAF, British Army, and Royal Navy helicopters. British media outlets reported that two SBS operators took part in the planning for the 2011 raid on Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Allegedly a captain and a major from the unit — possibly exchange staff officers — arrived at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan to work on preparing for and briefing assault teams ahead of the mission. Meanwhile, the incident off the coast of the Isle of Wight yesterday has parallels with a previous event that took place in British waters. Royal Marines divers emerge from smoke during a simulated attack. Most SBS operators are drawn from the Royal Marines. , CROWN COPYRIGHT On the evening of December 21, 2018, stowaways seized the 71,000-gross-tonnage Italian cargo vessel Grande Tema in the Thames estuary, off the east of England. Once again, the military response involved an assault team from the SBS delivered by two Royal Navy Merlin HC4s, escorted by two Wildcat HMA2s. After the ship had been secured by the special forces team, it was brought into nearby Tilbury harbor in Essex where four stowaways were handed over to police. The SBS is also expected to board vessels during military campaigns too, as was the case during the British campaign to retake the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic following their invasion by Argentina in 1982. On May 9 that year, SBS soldiers were delivered by Sea King helicopters onto the Argentine intelligence-gathering vessel Narwal , a repurposed fishing trawler, after it had been attacked by Royal Navy Sea Harrier combat jets. While the full story of most of their missions will perhaps never be told, incidents like the storming of the Nave Andromeda demonstrate that the UK’s special operations community is ready to fulfil these challenging missions at a moment’s notice.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Northrop Grumman’s Plan To Replace The MQ-9 Reaper With Stealthy Autonomous Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the 2000s, semi-autonomous unmanned air combat vehicle (UCAV) technology was proving to be the greatest revolution in air combat since the jet engine, then it disappeared totally from the Air Force plans and nomenclature. It was as if the idea of stealthy, long-range drones simply never existed. Now, as the U.S. faces growing threats from peer state competitors with highly capable integrated air defense systems, environments in which the Air Force’s current fleet of MQ-9 Reaper drones cannot survive , the UCAV has suddenly become the next big item on the Air Force’s shopping list. Dubbed the MQ-Next, the exact requirements for the Air Force’s next-generation combat drone initiative remain undefined, but the service has reached out to its industry partners to see what they have to offer. Northrop Grumman, a company known for its low-observable (stealth) design capabilities and its bright history with advanced unmanned systems —namely the X-47 demonstrators and the RQ-4 Global Hawk —has thrown their hat in the ring for what will be an emerging highly-lucrative tender in the coming years. With that in mind, Richard Sullivan, a Vice President of Program Management at Northrop Grumman, talked in-depth with The War Zone not just about their own potential drone offerings under the MQ-Next initiative, but also about their shadowy Distributed Autonomy Responsive Control (DARC) advanced mission management system that aims to control not just the MQ-Next vehicles, but what will be a family of interconnected unmanned systems that will rule the skies in the not so distant future. What Sullivan describes in our discussion is exactly what the author posited half a decade ago, down to the platform-agnostic command and control software that will control future autonomous swarms and the other assets that will enable them. You can read all about that, as well as a deep examination of the mysterious disappearance of the UCAV from the Air Force’s portfolio around 2010 and the massive implications of that reality in this past War Zone feature . In fact, to understand the potential UCAVs offer and what MQ-Next truly represents, it really is a must-read. With that being said, let’s get to our peek behind the curtain of MQ-Next and into the future of air combat with Richard Sullivan: RS: You would be quite familiar with the platforms that are out there today if you’ve been staring at the unmanned environment. And you know what, I’ll say, I think the platforms that are out there have been meeting the challenges of today. But with, I’ll say the 2018 NDS [National Defense Strategy] and the potential adversaries, what’s out there today does have to adapt and it does have to change. What we see in the different contractual things going on is the customer looking at this continuum of, from bringing mass to the fight with Loyal Wingman concepts, as well as the high-end platform for these highly contested environment scenarios. We’ve got the Indo-Pacific region with the tyranny of distance. So how do you… Is that one platform? We don’t think so. We see it as a family of platforms that are gonna be solving these specific customer needs… DARC is really the foundation of adaptive autonomy that we’ve been working on, and this DARC technology integrates into things that you hear today about open mission systems and the OMS architecture. And one of the things that DARC does is it is able to build upon and do the flight management, sensor management, across a heterogeneous system of systems. What does that mean? So, DARC will optimize from an advanced mission management perspective, the mission effectiveness with all the assets that it has. And each of the assets could be different. So heterogeneous, meaning you can have different platforms with different platform performance with different sensors and different sensor performance, but what you do is you give it an objective. You say, “Hey, I want you to image this area,” and then you let the computer do what it does best, which is to optimize that parametric. So given these different variables, you optimize it with the variables you have. That’s really what DARC does. Northrop Grumman’s DARC control room Lab. , Northrop Grumman Now focusing on the MQ-Next response, which I know you’re very interested in. We’ve just provided insight on what we could do. And this was only an RFI at the time, but we just highlighted that, given whatever the customer’s emerging requirements are, we’re going to look at this with affordability in mind. Our company really prides itself on survivability and aspects of survivability. Understanding the mission set that has to do with the Indo-Pacific region, so range and endurance are key. How the mission sensors are just continuing to get better over time. Just like everything that we have, whether it’s our iPhone, our cars, all the capability, and sensor capability, is advancing over time. With this OMS architecture, we can have that, I’ll say that easy, or easier, adaptation of those sensors to these modern platforms. It’s all underpinned by having that adaptive smarts on board, which is DARC, which we talked about for a little bit. And how do we know that we have the right solutions? And really, it comes down to… Most of us are completely, I’ll say ingrained with this digital engineering, and how we can do modeling and simulation, and bring a lot of the troubleshooting and the fact-finding to the left. Through rigorous modeling and simulation, through operational analysis, we fly the platforms to validate the analysis, and then we can start working in the analytical domain, that we can show how a family of platforms can inherently work together to solve missions and objectives. TR: That’s an incredibly succinct take on it. It’s so crazy because I literally wrote this five years ago, and down to the battle management system and everything else. It’s exciting that your team is putting putting forward a nearly identical playbook… I noticed in your imagery that you guys provided to Aviation Week… That it shows an X-47B-like cranked-kite type of low-observable platform. Is that something you think is still valid going into this MQ-Next tender in the coming years? RS: Yeah, so there was a pretty good investment to find the right solution for the X-47B for what it needed to do, and so when you think about also what it was able to prototype, it prototyped aerial refueling, it prototyped what I would consider one of the most complex takeoff and landings that could ever be humanly imagined, on a carrier deck of a moving aircraft carrier… And by the way, that was, I’ll say the beginnings of DARC. That type of autonomy is what underpins DARC. And at the end of the day, Tyler, what we have to look at is, what is the customer asking for? So if they end up not asking for something that has to have as low of a signature [stealthiness], it may not look exactly the same. But we feel pretty confident, and I think we’re pretty good at our operational analysis and our mission engineering from the talent that we have, the talent that we’ve grown, that we feel like something that has survivability features like you see in the graphic is going to be something that’s very important for, in particular that highly contested environment. And then you couple that with… Then the size of the platform gives you range and payload constraints. So, we’re really ready to adapt. It could look different, but what we tried to do was provide the customer just some ideas, and making them feel like we’re not necessarily trying to reinvent the wheel, we’re trying to leverage that government investment and the technology, and I think it enables us to be, have an advantage from that perspective. X-47B high over Edwards AFB., DoD TR: And I find it extremely troubling that they have to reinvest… Where are they now, the X-47Bs? Are they just sitting in Palmdale, or are you guys still using them for tests, like risk reduction work? Does the Navy own them? What’s the deal there? RS: Well, I’ll say we can probably give you a heck of a lot more information later on, but Northrop Grumman now owns the two X-47Bs. And we have them in Palmdale, yes. TR: So, they probably would be very valuable to prove this technology and show that the risk is quite low. Would that be a good assumption? RS: With respect to… Are you saying with respect to autonomy or with respect to MQ-Next? So with respect to autonomy, I think… TR: I think both, right? It seems like a very similar platform to what you guys are proposing. RS: With MQ-Next, just as I said earlier, the big thing is the customer still has to come out with their requirements, so as we’re trying to share with them, “Hey, these are the things we think you need to do,” they’re going to come back and tell us, and that’s when we, I’ll say when we align it. Is it [the X-47B] a prototype for autonomy? Absolutely. Just as our HALE-ISR platforms are prototypes for what does it mean to have something on station working for a long time. Our experience with the B-2 too. We are end-to-end on the B-2, design, all the way to operations, all the way to sustainment. When they’re talking about striking something in denied airspace, in a highly contested environment, we’ve got the tools there for that as well. Is that what they’re looking for? We’re not exactly sure yet. Right? So we’re kind of able to leverage across these multiple spaces, and then going back to that digital engineering, I can’t emphasize how important it is to have that, say, those validated and trusted algorithms, those validated models. So that we can respond to it with the most effective solution. And I’ll just say, and you said something that I wanna say, is we wouldn’t be… You could imagine we wouldn’t be charging the government again for something that if they wanted exactly an X-47, the program would be cheap as heck. But as a customer, it has requirements that differ from that. One that’s best as a Navy carrier landing vehicle. If the Air Force doesn’t need that, we wouldn’t wanna make them pay for that. And so it all depends on what the customer comes out with, at the end of the day. A B-2 does a flyby above another B-2 during a ceremony at Northrop’s sprawling complex at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. The firm has an amazing pedigree when it comes to cutting-edge stealth aircraft design that dates back to Tacit Blue in the early 1980s. , AP TR: In regards to the DARC system, it is meant to be distributed where? Is the command and control happening on each platform? Or is it happening in a centralized manner and then you’re sending data to tell these platforms what to do? What’s the architecture that Northrop Grumman envisions? RS: Well, I’ll just say the exact architecture is something that you know I won’t be able to share, but it is… The acronym does stand for Distributed Autonomy Responsive Control, and what that does is there is some autonomy that is placed upon each of the platforms. So the platforms become independent to the… I’ll just say the dependency on comms-links, it becomes independent on the dependency of, I’ll say a changing threat environment. The threat could be IADS [integrated air defense system], it could be even harsh weather. So as the environment’s changing, we’re able to have adaptation. Of course, when the comms-links are in place, each vehicle will have, as you said, the data of what each vehicle is doing, as well as the mission management, the mission commander is gonna have that data at their fingertips as well… The autonomy is distributed amongst the entire architecture… And the key thing about DARC is it’s not about a commander who is controlling every step of the battle. It literally is, “Go and perform this objective,” within, we call it the Objective and Constraints Model. You give a constraint of, “This is what the aircraft is able to do, what it’s able to fly, this is where you’re able to fly, these are the constraints,” those constraints are given to each of the distributed vehicles. And the platforms are then given I’ll say scenarios where comms is out, GPS or whatever’s out, they can work within those constraints themselves as well. And one of the constraints may be, “Don’t go back home, go back to your other buddies, reconnect to your line of sight link,” and let’s make sure that force package is re-registered with themselves. And then that… Yeah. MQ-X concept art is just that, an idea of what it could be. Hard requirements don’t exist for the program at this time. , Northrop Grumman TR: I wrote the manual to this thing five years ago! It’s actually very exciting that you guys are talking about all this now, so openly, it’s great. Are these higher-end penetrating drones, UCAVs, whatever you want to call them, part of a family of systems ? Are you seeing HALE [High-Altitude, Long-Endurance] drones involved as well ? Are you seeing loyal wingman style drones that are attritable [optionally expendible] as part of this larger architecture that you want to build out and supply the Air Force? Or is it more like just two platforms right now, and then we’ll look at the larger architecture as we go? RS: No, no, it’s absolutely as you said. It is, we’re looking at a continuum, so it’s a continuum of platforms that is the most effective to solve the problem. Now there’s always the case of the economics, and so how we can best provide the customer with an overall affordable solution that may leverage across the entire platform space. If sensors are common, if the engines are common, if the digital underpinnings are common, we can leverage across the larger tradable space all the way to HALE UAS type of platforms. And how do they all work together? So that’s a key thing is we may not have, I’ll say DARC implemented in an existing platform, although we could, but what happens is the data coming back to the mission management, to that mission commander goes back up through that mission commander. So, the mission commander, the mission management becomes a node for which I’ll say current systems that may or may not have or do not have DARC on them yet, would be able to be part of this overall architecture. F-22’s fly in tow of a B-2. A big hurdle going forward will be integrating existing types into an increasingly automated battlespace and command and control architecture. , AP TR: Some of them would be fully integrated, they have the DARC on board, and then others would be working… You’d still be getting all that intelligence from them, you’d still be getting some datalink information, but maybe they’re not cooperative 100% with the rest of the DARC equipped fleet. Is that how you can tie in legacy platforms to this? RS: Yeah, I think and… That’s probably a fair way to put it. What I would say is, we’re gonna be able to optimize the architecture based on the type of control we have with each of the vehicles. So there’s gonna be some vehicles that have better control, like I’m not really a Mac guy, but my understanding is my wife’s a Mac person, her phone and her iWatch and her MacBook and all that, they all work as an ecosystem really well together. And I can still tie into it with my Android phone and all that kinda stuff, and it’s just not as efficient. But it’s not that I’m less efficient, I can’t tell that I’m less effective. She feels like I am, [chuckle] but in reality, is the information that I need to send is something that’s already likely in place. So how can we use that information, and it’s just the command and control that goes through its legacy path? So you can still optimize each of these different paths, but it is maybe not as advanced, the smart systems that we want to put in place really is, I’ll say coming to being today. And you highlighted some of the things that you indicated from the X-47B time frame. Some of those things are things that we’re ready to go forward with today, and it looks like the customer is really interested in it now.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 25, 2021",Russia’s Strategic Bomber Trio Poses With Nearly All Its Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A fearsome-looking array of weapons artfully arranged in front of the aircraft expected to carry them is a familiar trope of military aviation and has frequently been used for both military “shows of strength” and marketing purposes. Until now, however, there have been precious few opportunities to see Russia’s strategic bombers displayed alongside their potential payloads. That has changed with the accompanying set of photos recently released by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The three photos, part of a larger package of imagery that was published online by the defense ministry on November 6, 2020, show similarly staged head-on views of the three combat types that currently equip the Russian Aerospace Forces’ Long-Range Aviation arm: the Tu-160 Blackjack , Tu-95MS Bear-H, and Tu-22M3 Backfire-C . Each of the three bomber/missile-carrier aircraft — all of which were developed by the Tupolev design bureau — are presented with a selection of the weapons that they can carry, including rarely seen stealthy cruise missiles. There are some notable omissions, too. The supersonic, swing-wing Tu-160 sits on the runway behind two rows of subsonic air-launched cruise missiles. Nearest to the jet is a line of 12 Kh-55SM subsonic cruise missiles, codenamed AS-15 Kent by NATO. These are “legacy” nuclear-armed weapons, the original design of which dates back to the late 1970s and which has more recently served as the basis for cruise missiles developed in China and Iran . Here, the turbofan-powered missile’s control surfaces are folded away. The Kh-55SM can be fitted with two conformal fuel tanks to extend its range to around 1,864 miles and these are seen attached. Some of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ Kh-55SM weapons have reportedly been converted to the non-nuclear Kh-555 or AS-22 Kluge, but those shown all appear to be nuclear-armed Kh-55SMs since they lack the forward stabilizing fins added to the conventional version. Tu-160 Blackjack., Russian Ministry of Defense Nearest to the camera in the Tu-160 photo are another dozen examples of the more modern Kh-101/102 stealthy, subsonic cruise missile, similarly mounted on ground-handling trollies. This new-generation weapon was developed in non-nuclear Kh-101 (NATO AS-23A Kodiak) and nuclear Kh-102 (AS-23B) forms from the outset. Just like the Kh-55SM, the missiles are powered by turbofan engines. The maximum range of the Kh-101 missile is reportedly between 1,864 and 2,485 miles and the Kh-102 is said to be able to fly further. These weapons apparently entered series production in 2010-11 and the Kh-101 was subsequently used in combat during Russia’s campaign in Syria , launched by both Tu-160 and Tu-95MS bombers. The Tu-160 can only carry its weapons internally, in tandem bomb bays. Each contains a rotary launcher that can carry six missiles, for a total of either 12 Kh-55 series missiles or 12 Kh-101/102s. Like the Tu-160, the turboprop-powered Tu-95MS is currently restricted to the carriage of missiles only, although it too has now gained a conventional cruise missile capability to provide a much greater level of flexibility in the post-Cold War era. In this view, we can see the same types of weapons as arranged with the Tu-160, although the numbers are different: six Kh-55SMs and eight Kh-101/102s. Tu-95MS Bear-H., Russian Ministry of Defense This Bear-H seen in the picture is an example that has been equipped with four twin hardpoints under the wings to permit the carriage of up to eight Kh-101/102 weapons, which are otherwise too large to fit in the existing bomb bay. The Tu-95MS also features the same rotary launcher found on the Tu-160, but since it has only one bomb bay, its internal payload is reduced to six Kh-55 series missiles. Around half the fleet are Tu-95MS16 aircraft that can carry 10 more Kh-55 missiles under the wings. Finally, the intermediate-range Tu-22M3 — another supersonic, swing-wing design — is presented with exclusively freefall armament options, including a pair of enormous FAB-3000 general-purpose bombs, each weighing 6,614 pounds, followed by weapons of increasingly smaller mass, including streamlined weapons and two different types of flat-fronted 1,102-pound general-purpose bombs. Additional bombs are mounted on the Backfire’s external carriers, underneath the fixed section of the wings. All these bombs date from the Cold War period and reflect the fact that the vast majority of ordnance used in combat by the Russian Aerospace Forces is still unguided, with a resulting reduction in accuracy. Tu-22M3 Backfire-C., Russian Ministry of Defense Surprisingly, the Tu-22M3’s missile armament is not shown. The Backfire can carry a maximum of three, but more usually one or two examples, of the huge Kh-22 missile, known to NATO as the AS-4 Kitchen, which entered production back in the late 1960s. This delta-wing weapon, powered by a liquid-fuel rocket engine, can be used against both high-value fixed ground targets and warships. Accelerating to near hypersonic speeds over Mach 4 for the final run-in to the target, it remains a problem for air defense systems despite its age. It can carry a nuclear or conventional warhead and has a maximum range of 317 miles. It is now being replaced by the outwardly similar Kh-32, with its range extended to around 559 miles. While the Backfire has never launched Kh-22 or Kh-32 missiles in combat, they have dropped freefall bombs, most recently over Syria. This may be the reason for the absence of missile armament in this instance. It’s also possible that the Kh-22 is now being displaced by the more modern Kh-32, which may only be optimized for anti-shipping strikes. If that’s the case, the Tu-22M3 load-out may reflect the type’s current weapons options for use against ground targets. During operations over Syria, Tu-22M3s were noted dropping “sticks” of 10 or 12 551-pound bombs, or six 1,102-pound bombs and, on at least one occasion, a single 6,614-pound bomb was delivered. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SkJZr49dkOA Despite their age, the Russian Aerospace Forces’ three strategic bombers provide a useful capability and one that’s more flexible than the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) that make up the other two arms of the traditional nuclear “triad.” The fact that the bombers can be forward deployed and, increasingly, can employ different conventional weapons, enhances their utility. The Tu-22M3, in particular, may appear a relic of the Cold War, representing a class of bomber that has disappeared from Western inventories, although it’s notable that, unlike the Tu-160 and Tu-95MS, the Backfire is not covered by the New START treaty, which places restrictions on the maximum size of the overall bomber fleet. On the other hand, the potential demise of the treaty could see the Tu-22M3’s inflight refueling capability reinstated, to provide it with a true strategic range. Currently, modernization programs are underway for each of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ three strategically tasked types and a program has been launched to resume production of the Tu-160 and its unique NK-25 engines . These upgrades, plus new-build Blackjacks, should ensure that the Long-Range Aviation arm remains useful at least until the arrival of the promised new-generation PAK DA , although the current timeline for this seems doubtful. Coupled with high-profile foreign visits and an increasing tempo of long-range “patrol” flights by the Russian Aerospace Forces, it’s perhaps little surprise that the Russian Ministry of Defense is taking this opportunity to display at least some of the payloads of its bombers.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Apr 17, 2020",What It’s Really Like Piloting Private Jets For The Rich And Famous,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Flying privately owned aircraft gives pilots a unique lifestyle within the spectrum of aviation jobs. The set of challenges they face can be very different from those of flying airliners. Among the greatest challenges is passenger behavior. In a short period of time, pilots are all but guaranteed to experience some of the wildest interactions and witness some of the craziest behavior of their lives. Unlike on an airliner, these are not passengers boarding a flying bus usually for the lowest fare possible. They are by their very nature highly demanding VIPs that come with a whole different set of unique pitfalls and maddening roadblocks. Within the realm of flying private there is flying for charter, sanctioned under 14 CFR FAR Part 135 , and flying for an aircraft owner directly, which falls under 14 CFR FAR Part 91 . All general aviation that is not operated for hire is conducted within the rules of Part 91. Whether the aircraft you’re flying is a Piper Cub or a 747-8i , if the flight is not being conducted for hire or compensation, it’s a Part 91 flight. Charter flights are private flights where an individual or organization is paying to be flown in an aircraft they don’t own. A Gulfstream business jet takes the sky from Aspen’s high-altitude airport. , AP My experience is exclusively Part 91, in a variety of aircraft that has included small piston aircraft, turboprops, and jets. The size of most privately owned aircraft means there is no flight attendant. The pilot or pilots are often the sole steward and liaison for their passengers’ and owner’s experience. Most turboprops and light jets are certified for operations with a single, appropriately rated pilot, leaving that one pilot responsible for everything. Everything means everything . Safety of flight, flight planning and flight plan filing, passenger comfort, and often travel accommodations. Every pilot in Part 91 and 135 aviation sets out to provide the best travel experience possible. If they can’t provide that, the motivation to fly private goes away. Do you need a picture for Instagram to brag that you flew on a private jet? Pilots are happy to help. Special meal or drink requests? Sure. $100 bottles of whiskey pale in comparison to the multi-thousand dollar fuel bill for a short trip to a sports game for the day. Passenger reactions range from humble and thankful to taking advantage of the situation and behaving in ways that would get them thrown off an airline flight and potentially even arrested. Photo by ViewApart I’ve conducted flights on which passengers brought their own alcohol and became so inebriated they were screaming in the center aisle and ripping their clothes off—one in particular on the runway after landing in Las Vegas. Most airline pilots can’t say they have had to corral and manage a drunken passenger after shutdown to prevent them from running down the flightline while waiting for ground transportation. Less than two hours later I was notified that this passenger had another outburst. As a result, they had been detained, threatened with charges, and banned from the casino at which his group was staying. Being sober, my help was sought in mitigating the fallout and begging the casino to reverse the ban to save the trip as planned. I was unsuccessful. Most pilots who fly charter and Part 91 have celebrity stories. In almost all cases it is important for the industry to respect privacy. If a company or pilots were to provide tabloid media with pictures or information about the habits of celebrities it would be bad for business. Still, among friends and associates, stories inevitably get out. The proliferation of online industry forums doesn’t help, but most pilots remain tight-lipped in the public domain about their passengers. AP On private forums many years after the fact, flight crew members attested to their experiences as explosive tabloid stories broke regarding Britney Spears’ mental breakdown. They were called to the jet earlier than expected for an expedited departure and were shocked to see her arrive with a shaved head. Her entourage was eager to get her out of the public eye. All is not as it seems. Before negative news broke about Bill Cosby, a close friend related his experience having flown him. At the time Mr. Cosby’s public image was still that of a gentleman—”America’s dad.” My friend was taken aback by his aggressive demeanor and generally poor treatment of the entire flight crew. On a charter trip out of Van Nuys, a well-known actress calmly sat for an entire flight while her children scratched, cut, and drew on the entire interior of a large private jet. The cost to refurbish the interior of a cabin aircraft ranges greatly in price. In this case, the damages were over $250,000. She was sent a bill by the operator, but she refused to pay it. Litigation was determined to have the potential to have a negative impact on that charter company’s reputation for celebrity service in the Los Angeles area. The matter was not pursued and the charter company was never compensated. The CEO of a major restaurant company chartered a private jet for the extremely short flight from Aspen to Denver. His family smeared mud and pizza sauce everywhere. No, the pizza wasn’t from his chain and the cleaning bill was $2,100 dollars. Lade Gaga exits a Gulfstream—while celebrity private air travel gets the most attention, thousands of wealthy families and corporations own private aircraft or leverage private air travel. Many of these people are used to getting what they want when they want it. As such, it can be challenging to balance demands versus reality and flight safety while also keeping the guest satisfied. , AP With no gate agent to cover for them, pilots of private aircraft also bear the burden of relating news of maintenance and weather delays to passengers. Experienced passengers recognize their flight would most often be canceled had they been traveling by airline. Flying private affords the luxury of adjusting departure and arrival times within the passengers’ schedule to mitigate weather that would otherwise prohibit flight. On rare occasions, the passengers, accustomed to getting anything and everything they want at a moment’s notice, rage at their pilots about being inconvenienced. I’ve flown through weather conditions on descent that made passengers queasy. Getting assigned holding during inclement weather, which is flying a racetrack pattern in a specific place for the purpose of maintaining arrival sequence and separation, can usually make at least one passenger feel less than optimal. For passengers, holding and significant turbulence with no visual horizon reference is a combination that can take down the best of them. On one occasion flying into Hillsboro in Oregon, this exact scenario made every passenger miserable. My flight plan was carefully timed to arrive after a line of storms and before the next one was due to arrive. Pilots will tell you a thunderstorm can contain almost every significant meteorological weather hazard. When the passengers were ready to depart, a line of thunderstorms was directly over the top of the airport. The lead passenger, still sick from our arrival, was livid that I delayed our departure, even after it was explained that what we experienced on the way in pales in comparison to what we would experience with an immediate departure. Every pilot in command is the sole decision-maker and bears 100 percent of the responsibility for the safety of flight. The pilot of a privately operated flight is the focal point of the owner’s and passenger’s anger for being inconvenienced. The convenience of private air travel is like nothing else, but it comes at a high cost and those paying the bill expect far more than a seat on an airplane., Hugo3055 via Wikicommons Just as a decision to fly an aircraft requires research and forethought that is put to the test when you go fly, a decision to delay departure for maintenance or weather is frequently put to the test by your passengers. When your passengers are unhappy, and one of them pays your salary, it feels like your job is on the line, and it very well could be. They don’t teach you in flight school how to navigate situations like this. You learn from both experience and other pilots to stay calm and professional while being ready to explain and back up your decision. It’s not easy to keep your cool if someone is yelling at you. You have to remind yourself how clueless they are, and that you’re their liaison to safe flight. The fact of the matter is that a pilot might be one of the only people in a jet owner’s life to tell them no. The wealthiest among us are used to getting their way. I’ve seen extreme tantrums and even threats. If a passenger applies extreme pressure to a pilot in an effort to assert their will, and the flight results in a weather-related accident or crash, it’s never the passenger’s fault. It’s the pilot’s fault. It’s certainly isn’t all bad, but every trip is unique and every pilot in private aviation has a wild story or two. Most have many. For instance, private aviation may be the only sector where the passengers are in a position to request a low altitude flight. Reasons include seeing their property from the air or impressing their friends with jet noise, which can be underwhelming in quiet late-model jets. A Cessna Citation CJ4 business jet., Cessna Citation/Textron Within the confines of Federal Aviation Regulations, which generally prohibit flight under 1,000 feet of the surface and faster than 250 knots, you can still have a great time. Parks and wildlife preserves are off-limits too. Passengers accustomed to flight at 45,000 feet, and higher in some cases, are thrilled by a ten-mile run over their ranch at 1,500 feet and 200 knots. The future of airline flying as we knew it is uncertain, but in late 2020, the use of private aircraft is skyrocketing. Business for charter operations is booming. I have personally always found private aviation to be the most intriguing kind of flying, and my experiences participating in it were never dull.

Considering that the Junkers Ju 88 was the most versatile combat aircraft operated by Nazi Germany’s Luftwaffe in World War II, it is somewhat surprising that only two fully intact examples survived the conflict and can be seen today. One of those aircraft is the sole reconnaissance version of the Ju 88 that made it out of the war unscathed — and the story of how, aided in part by a Romanian defector, Nicolae Teodoru, it eventually made it to the United States, is a remarkable one. Teodoru, then a Sergeant in the Romanian Air Force, brought the German-made Ju-88D-1, construction number 430650, to Limassol airfield in July 1943. At the time, Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany and had acquired various combat aircraft and other weaponry from that country. By that point, the Ju 88 had been a key component of the Luftwaffe’s combat fleets for years and, despite originally being designed as a bomber, proved readily adaptable to a host of other missions. Different records state that between 14,500 and 15,000 Ju 88s, in total, were churned out by different factories between 1939 and 1945, in as many as 60 different variants and sub-variants. The twin-engine type served in almost every conceivable role: bomber, heavy fighter, reconnaissance aircraft, night-fighter, anti-tank aircraft, anti-shipping aircraft, unpiloted missile , and more. The Ju 88D-1 was a long-range reconnaissance aircraft, powered by a pair of Junkers Jumo 211J inverted V12 engines, providing 2,400 horsepower between them. The aircraft had a maximum speed of around 295 miles per hour and a range of over 1,500 miles. The D-1 had a normal crew of four and defensive armament of three MG 15 machine guns of 7.92-millimeter caliber. Although of poor quality, this is a rare photo of a Ju 88D long-range reconnaissance aircraft in Luftwaffe service., San Diego Air and Space Museum Archives The D-1 had first entered Luftwaffe service in the summer of 1940, but was also widely exported to Nazi allies, along with other variants. Ju 88s of various types also flew in the hands of Croatia, Finland, Hungary, and Italy. At the time of Teodoru’s defection, Romania had only been operating the type for a matter of months. The country received its first batch of 50 Ju 88s, including a dozen Ju 88D-1s, in the first half of 1943, and their crews were trained in Ukraine, by Luftwaffe instructors. These aircraft were part of a larger effort by the Nazis to build up the air force of its Axis partner, which was also fighting against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. A somewhat inaccurate depiction of the Ju 88 published by the U.S. Office of War Information for recognition purposes. Accompanying views show the arcs of fire provided by the defensive machine guns. , NATIONAL ARCHIVES The Ju 88D-1s were assigned to the Romanian Air Force’s 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine. Sergeant Teodoru, a civil pilot who had been called up for duty at age 28, was among the personnel assigned to that unit. Between June and July 1943, he flew 11 missions over the Eastern Front, without incident. He was, however, less than happy with military service and hatched a plan to defect to the Allies. In the words of Romanian aviation historian Danut Vlad, Teodoru was “unable to accept military discipline.” Teodoru planned an escape in one of the Ju-88s, which would involve him crossing the Sea of Azov via Novorossiysk, on Russia’s Black Sea coast, to Aleppo in Syria. There, he would refuel before taking off for the final leg of his mission, to Beirut in Lebanon, which was then a major Allied base for its naval operations in the Mediterranean. The Romanian sergeant set out on the afternoon of July 22, 1943, taking off from Mariupol, a major city in what then Germany-occupied Soviet Ukraine, in Ju 88D-1 430650. He was alone in the cockpit and carried no maps so that his plan would not be revealed if he were to be shot down or crash. The cockpit of Teodoru’s Ju 88D-1., U.S. Air Force/Ken LaRock Things were proceeding smoothly until Teodoru made his way over Novorossiysk, after which a strong easterly wind over the Black Sea began to blow him off course, towards Turkey. He eventually arrived in that country’s airspace somewhere near Anamur on the coast of the Black Sea. Whether aware or not of the error, he continued to fly over Turkish territory and then entered the Mediterranean, on a course headed for Cyprus, which was home to an important Allied air base. Four British Royal Air Force Hawker Hurricane IIB fighters were duly scrambled from their base at Nicosia in Cyprus once Teodoru’s Junkers arrived over the island. The Romanian clearly managed to signal to the RAF pilots that he intended to land and was not on a combat mission. They escorted him down to a landing at Limassol airfield, where he touched down in the early evening. After landing, Teodoru reportedly handed his aircraft over to his RAF hosts, declaring that it was a “gift from the Führer.” The Ju 88D-1 was a very useful intelligence windfall for the British and, with only 50 flying hours, was ideal for extensive evaluation. Duly repainted in RAF colors and markings, the Ju 88 was moved to Heliopolis near Cairo in Egypt for flight testing. Here, a series of trials were undertaken under the command of test pilot Wing Commander Charles Sandford Wynne-Eyton. What became of Nicolae Teodoru is unclear, but an individual with this name appears again in a CIA report on the post-war Romanian Air Force, dated April 1953. This document identifies the individual in question as commander of the 6th Bomber Regiment at Brasov Airfield, as of 1949, and that the unit was established with pilots who had “multiple-engine experience.” This could suggest that Teodoru eventually made his way back to Romania and continued his career in the Communist-era air force. As for the Ju 88D-1 he had defected in, after concluding its test campaign, the British decided to transfer it to the United States. Earlier that summer, the United Kingdom had acquired a more advanced variant, a Ju 88R-1 night-fighter, which had landed in Scotland as the result of another defection from within the Luftwaffe. After providing the United Kingdom with first-hand experience of the performance and capabilities of one of its enemy’s key aircraft, the Ju 88D-1 would now provide similar insight for the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF), which was also engaged against Axis forces in North Africa, Italy, and Western Europe. Teodoru’s preserved Ju 88D-1 restored in Romanian Air Force colors and markings. The Fritz X guided bomb between the main wheels was not part of its armament., U.S. AIR FORCE In October 1943, a USAAF crew flew the Ju 88D-1 from Heliopolis to Deversoir Air Base, near Cairo, where they then became familiarized with the aircraft, with the aim of flying it to the United States where it could be more extensively assessed. Heading up the USAAF team was then-Captain Warner E. Newby , who already had useful experience on the B-25 Mitchell , a comparable American twin-engine bomber. The Junkers required considerable modifications for its multi-leg flight to the United States, including additional external fuel tanks that were obtained from a crashed USAAF P-38 Lightning fighter, rigged up to the fuel system using pumps “borrowed” from a B-24 Liberator bomber. Meanwhile, instead of German fuel, oil, and coolant, the team used U.S.-specification equivalents. The aircraft’s machine guns and cameras were removed and an ARN-7 direction-finder added to help with long-range navigation over the route. The conversion work and subsequent flight testing were far from straightforward and on one occasion an external fuel tank was accidentally jettisoned and exploded, showering the aircraft with shrapnel and injuring several crew members. The forward fuselage of the Ju 88D-1 with its various defensive machine guns removed., U.S. AIR FORCE Now nicknamed “Baksheesh,” an Arabic word meaning a charitable monetary gift, the aircraft received its final preparations for the flight to its new home: extra-large USAAF markings, American flags on the wings, and, reportedly, a golden band around the rear fuselage. With Captain Newby again heading up the crew, the flight to the United States began on October 8, 1943, and the distance of 10,400 nautical miles was completed in seven days. Refueling and crew rest stops were made in Sudan, Nigeria, the Gold Coast (today, Ghana), the United Kingdom’s Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil (two stops), British Guyana, Puerto Rico, and West Palm Beach in Florida. There were a few problems en route, including a lack of the correct fuel on Ascension Island. The crew was forced to use the wrong fuel type, risking potential engine failure. During one of the landings in Brazil, the aircraft’s landing gear also failed to deploy properly, forcing the crew to resort to emergency manual override. In American hands, the Ju 88D-1 received the serial FE-1598, signifying Foreign Evaluation., San Diego Air and Space Museum Archives Finally, on October 14, the Baksheesh touched down at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, and began its test career with the Flight Test Engineering Division. It was test-flown there between November 1943 and March 1944, before going to Arizona for yet more trials. The huge effort required to bring the Ju 88 to Dayton shows the lengths to which the United States was willing to go to get its hands on foreign aircraft equipment for analysis and evaluation, what is known today as foreign materiel exploitation (FME). During the Cold War, these efforts would result in an ex-Iraqi Air Force MiG-21 being loaned from Israel and tested over Groom Lake, Nevada, before the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron “Red Eagles” conducted highly classified missions with a fleet of Soviet-bloc jet fighters operated from the secluded Tonopah Test Range (TTR). The aircraft at Dayton, Ohio, in the 1960s, wearing an inauthentic Luftwaffe-style camouflage pattern., U.S. AIR FORCE However, by 1946, the Ju 88D-1 had ceased to be of use, and it was decided to store it at Davis-Monthan Field (later Davis-Monthan Air Force Base ) in Arizona, which, today, is home to the Air Force’s famed aircraft storage boneyard. In the meantime, the United States had acquired at least five other Ju 88s, but it was the Baksheesh that was destined to be preserved. In 1950, it was transferred to what was then the Air Force Technical Museum, in whose hands it remains today. Despite the enormous production total, only two Ju 88 ultimately survived the war in complete condition, as opposed to having been recovered from crash sites or pieced together using surviving parts from more than one aircraft. One of those is 430650, the only remaining D variant and the only World War II-era Romanian Air Force combat aircraft in a museum collection anywhere in the world. Teodoru’s Ju 88D-1 is preserved today at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force , adjacent to what is now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. It stands testament to a unique intertwined wartime story, one that took it, and those who flew it, from Ukraine to North Africa, via the Mediterranean, and then finally on to the United States.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 30, 2020","So Long, Samurai: Japan Bids Farewell To Its Final Frontline Phantoms","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 48 years, Japan’s days of flying F-4 Phantom II fighters in a combat role are coming to an end. The landmark was formally marked today, with a send-off event for the jets. The aircraft were from 301 Hikotai, the country’s last combat unit equipped with the type, and it’s expected to cease flying operations next month. The remaining F-4EJs will, in the future, only be flown by the country’s Air Development and Test Wing. The ceremony to mark the end of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) operating the F-4EJ took place at Hyakuri Air Base, 301 Hikotai’s home base, in Ibaraki Prefecture, 50 miles northeast of Tokyo. Representatives from the base, various squadron commanders, as well as officials representing the wider JASDF attended the event. Japan’s Phantom story began in 1968 when the McDonnell Douglas type was selected for the JASDF, an order being placed for 140 F-4EJ versions, based on the U.S. Air Force’s then-standard F-4E . The production effort was of considerable significance for Japan’s aerospace industry, with all but the first two F-4EJs being completed under license by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Meanwhile, the initial pair from the production line in St Louis, Missouri, touched down in Japan on July 25, 1971. The first Phantoms to be based at Hyakuri arrived there in 1972 and were assigned to 301 Hikotai, which was declared fully operational the following year. A pre-upgrade JASDF F-4EJ of the 304 Hikotai during Exercise Cope North 89-2, a quarterly, joint JASDF and U.S. Air Force exercise, in 1989., NATIONAL ARCHIVES The Japanese production run also included the last of the 5,195 Phantoms built anywhere in the world — F-4EJ 17-8440 rolled off the MHI production line on May 21, 1981. The following year, Japan kicked off a major upgrade effort for its F-4EJ fleet, which would bring 96 examples up to F-4EJ Kai standard, with “Kai” meaning “improved.” The definitive F-4EJ Kai, which the JASDF had continued to fly in a frontline role until today, had new avionics other systems installed, including an enhanced bombing computer. It also featured an AN/APG-66J pulse-Doppler radar, based on the standard AN/APG-66 used in early F-16 Viper fighter jets. The upgraded Phantoms gained the AN/ASN-141 inertial navigation system, similar to the one found in Japan’s F-15J air superiority fighters, as well. The final special color scheme applied to commemorate the retirement of the Phantom from combat duty., JASDF/HYAKURI Two specially marked jets on the Hyakuri flight line. , JASDF/HYAKURI The 301 Hikotai retirement “special.”, JASDF/HYAKURI The 301 Hikotai “special” heads out for a farewell flight, with an F-2 in the background., JASDF/HYAKURI In the cockpit, the F-4EJ Kais received modern hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls and a head-up display (HUD). Additional avionics changes included the installation of the AN/APX-76A identification friend or foe (IFF) system and the J/APR-6 radar warning receiver (RWR) suite, while AN/ALE-40 countermeasures dispensers were fitted for self-defense. The F-4EJ Kai’s airframe was also reworked to add another 2,000 hours of flight time, while weapons options were expanded to include the indigenous ASM-2 anti-ship missile and AAM-3 air-to-air missile, and eventually the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) — all of which can be seen in the photos below, together with a towed target. The improved variant of the fighter entered service beginning in 1989. As well as the F-4EJ, Japan had acquired Phantoms for the reconnaissance role. The first of an initial batch of 14 unarmed RF-4E variants were delivered by McDonnell Douglas in 1974 to replace the aging RF-86F Sabre . Another 15 existing F-4EJs were later converted to RF-4EJ standard, but these lacked any internal reconnaissance equipment and were limited to carry external reconnaissance pods. These jets also underwent their own upgrades during their service, receiving AN/APQ-172 terrain-following radar, a new inertial navigation system, and modified RWRs. An RF-4E of 501 Hikotai at Yokota Air Base in 2003., MORIO/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS At its peak, the F-4EJ equipped six JASDF squadrons, spread across four bases. Most of these were gradually re-equipped as the force received more modern and capable equipment, chiefly the F-15J and the Mitsubishi F-2 multirole fighter. The last two operational units flying variants of the F-4EJ at Hyakuri were 301 Hikotai and 501 Hikotai. 301 Hikotai had left Hyakuri in 1985 for Nyutabaru Air Base, before returning to its original home in 2016 and operating in an air defense capacity. 501 Hikotai, the Teisatsu Kokutai, or Reconnaissance Air Group, flew RF-4Es and ceased operations in March. Personnel gather for the retirement ceremony at Hyakuri. , JASDF/HYAKURI JASDF/HYAKURI A three-ship flypast to mark the retirement of the frontline Phantom in Japan., JASDF/HYAKURI The marking on the tail of the 301 Hikotai jets shows a frog that is found on Mount Tsukuba, near Hyakuri., JASDF/HYAKURI JASDF/HYAKURI The retirement of the Phantom doesn’t signal the end for 301 Hikotai. It is now due to move to Misawa Air Base, where it will become the second JASDF squadron to be equipped with the F-35A stealth fighter. The JASDF established its first operational F-35A squadron, 302 Hikotai, at Misawa in March 2019. This squadron was another former Phantom operator that gave up its last F-4EJs at Hyakuri in 2019 before switching to its new base. As for Hyakuri, it will continue to serve as a fighter base, with 3 Hikotai scheduled to transfer its F-2s there from its current base at Misawa. The introduction of the F-35 in Japan is following in similar ways to the country’s Phantom program, too. MHI worked with Lockheed Martin to establish a Final Assembly and Check-Out (FACO) facility for the JASDF’s F-35A variant in Nagoya, Japan, after the first four F-35s for the service were built at Lockheed’s plant in Fort Worth, Texas. However, the JASDF’s F-35 fleet now looks set to exceed the peak size of its F-4 force after the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale to Japan of an additional 105 Joint Strike Fighters, worth an estimated $23.11 billion, earlier this year. The proposed contract also includes 42 F-35B Short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) jets, to conduct fixed-wing operations from Japan’s two Izumo class helicopter carriers . The State Department’s approval of this proposed deal follows Tokyo’s initial order for 42 conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A variants, deliveries of which are now well underway. One of the F-35As has been lost, in a fatal accident that occurred over the Pacific Ocean in April 2019. JASDF/HYAKURI JASDF/HYAKURI JASDF/HYAKURI JASDF/HYAKURI JASDF/HYAKURI The end of Phantom combat operations in Japan comes at a time in which the country is stepping up military spending and looking to modernize its military, as a whole, in response to increasing national security threats and challenges, especially from China and North Korea. In terms of its tactical aviation fleets, in addition to the F-35, Japan is also now embarking on its next-generation combat aircraft , which will likely be co-developed with an aerospace firm from the United States or the United Kingdom. The end of the line for frontline Phantoms in Japan also further reduces the dwindling total of F-4s still in operational service throughout the world. Surviving frontline Phantoms are now only found among the air forces of Greece , Iran, Turkey, and South Korea. Trading in the Phantom, a classic Cold War-era fighter jet, for the F-35 is the latest, and one of the more visible steps, in the ongoing modernization of the JASDF. Still, saying farewell to the iconic F-4, after almost a half-century of service, will surely be bittersweet for the JASDF.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Dec 23, 2020",America’s Elite Flying Unit That Made The Recent Long-Range Hostage Rescue In Africa Possible,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A dramatic mission conducted in the early hours of October 31, 2020, saw members of the elite SEAL Team Six rescue American citizen Philip Walton, who was kidnapped in the northwest African country of Niger and then taken to neighboring Nigeria. News of Walton’s safe extraction threw the spotlight directly upon U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) as reports, including here at The War Zone , revealed the daring mission brought together a raft of air assets, including CV-22B Ospreys and MC-130J Commando IIs , as well as  KC-135R tankers to support their long-range mission. Unconfirmed reports now indicate that the raiding party of special operators parachuted into an area near where Walton was being held, probably from the MC-130Js, with the CV-22Bs then safely recovering the assault team and the hostage. The special operations Ospreys and their MC-130J Commando II companion aircraft used in October’s mission came from the 352nd Special Operations Wing (SOW) and the KC-135R tankers came from the 100th Air Refueling Squadron, all of which are based at RAF Mildenhall, in the UK. This unique and elite team is tailored to swiftly execute exactly this kind of high-stakes mission as America’s regional “9-1-1” emergency response force for Europe and Northern Africa. A 352nd SOW CV-22B moves in to receive fuel from an MC-130J., Jamie Hunter Assembling the required assets for the rescue detail saw the activation of as many as six Ospreys and no less than four MC-130Js, which dashed from their base in the United Kingdom to Naval Air Station Rota, in Spain. Four of these forward-deployed Ospreys were subsequently launched for the clandestine long-range, round-trip to Nigeria, where Walton was being held. Four KC-135Rs joined the assault, and these were used to refuel the MC-130Js, which in turn topped-up the fuel tanks of the Ospreys in order to facilitate such a long-range rescue, that spanned at least 1,700 miles each way. The mission also included an AC-130J gunship , which was likely to have provided top cover during the actual extraction phase, along with a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon , which likely employed its sensors and communications to provide command and control and overwatch support. This mission clearly illustrates why Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) placed so much importance on procurement of the CV-22, a requirement that largely rose out of the ashes of a failed attempt to rescue American hostages held by Iranian revolutionaries on April 24, 1980. Operation Eagle Claw involved eight RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters and six C-130s, three MC-130E Combat Talon special operations transports and three EC-130E Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center (ABCCC) aircraft, which were used for an ambitious rescue attempt that ended in disaster when one of the RH-53s crashed into a parked EC-130E during a remote refueling operation deep in the Iranian desert, killing five 8th Special Operations Squadron Airmen and three Marines. Speaking at a memorial ceremony in 2017 , the then vice commander of AFSOC Maj Gen Mike Plehn said: “I would tell you that all of those who participated in that daring mission deserve our unwavering gratitude, for they changed the way American special operations forces are organized, trained, equipped, and conducted.” Lessons learned from Eagle Claw laid the foundation of future U.S. special operations forces capabilities, including the eventual introduction of the Osprey decades later. A CV-22B Osprey flies on a low-level mission from RAF Mildenhall., Jamie Hunter Mildenhall’s modern AFSOC team Today, the 352nd SOW is AFSOCs emergency service for Special Operations Command Europe ( SOCEUR ), and Special Operations Command Africa ( SOCAFRICA ). It supports all manner of covert and clandestine missions and short-notice calls to action during any number of crises, as evidenced by this rescue. A popular saying within this wing is: “If they know we are coming, we are too late.” It’s a mantra that lends itself well to its bread and butter operations, which are often conducted in some of the most hostile regions on the planet. The Bell-Boeing CV-22B Osprey entered service with the 1st SOW at Hurlburt Field, Florida, in early 2007 and its first operational deployment began in March 2010, when six Ospreys headed into battle in Afghanistan. Many of the senior officers in today’s CV-22 community are former Sikorsky MH-53 Pave Low operators. While some were initially skeptical, most will probably concede that the popular MH-53 could never perform the kind of long-range missions, which often occur in the dark of night and at low-level , that the CV-22B now takes in stride. The 352nd SOW came into being in 2015 at RAF Mildenhall when the 352nd Special Operations Group was redesignated and expanded amid a major recapitalization effort that saw Lockheed Martin MC-130J Commando IIs replace aging MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and MC-130P Combat Shadows, and CV-22B Ospreys effectively replacing the Sikorsky MH-53M Pave Low IV, which had actually been retired since 2008. The first of 10 CV-22Bs for the wing arrived at Mildenhall in June 2013 . The CV-22B and the MC-130J now provide the cornerstone for a whole new level of forward-based aerial special operations transport capability for AFSOC. The arrival of the CV-22B in Europe to join Mildenhall’s 7th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) opened up a raft of operational scenarios for AFSOC. Today’s Osprey is a battle-proven workhorse with many years of hard fighting in very harsh conditions behind it. The most obvious improvement over the MH-53 came in terms of speed and range. The CV-22B can travel up to 2,100 nautical miles (3,889 kilometers) with a single aerial refueling. This tiltrotor is tailor-made for inserting special operations teams, combining the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft, with the ability to transition into vertical flight and disgorge troops on the ground like a helicopter. The act of inserting special operators can also be achieved at higher altitude via parachute, or near the ground via fast-roping. Special operators fast-rope from a CV-22B., Jamie Hunter Versatility is a powerful attribute of the Osprey. Its cabin can be configured for up to 24 troops. The CV-22B can take all the special ops “toys” into the fight, including small tactical vehicles and motorcycles. It can even carry snowmobiles, small boats, and  jet skis, plus litter kits for humanitarian or medical evacuation (medevac) roles. The CV-22B is bristling with technology, with terrain-following radar, satellite communications, advanced countermeasures, and electronic surveillance systems. The 7th SOS routinely flies low-level training missions in the United Kingdom, and, with the current mission systems, pilots typically set the terrain-following radar and fly the aircraft manually, using the radar indications to climb or descend. Typically, one of the flight engineers will assist the pilot and co-pilot by providing a lookout during high workload sections of the mission. While the 7th SOS is not a dedicated Personnel Recovery (PR) squadron, like the HH-60G Pave Hawk Rescue Squadrons of Air Combat Command, this is an important sub-mission for the CV-22 community. Indeed, the advent of the Osprey opened up the potential to undertake long-range PR missions within AFSOC like never before. When it comes to PR missions, such as recovering a downed pilot, speed is truly of the essence. Ospreys are able to react faster to urgent taskings, arriving on-scene from farther away and quicker than traditional helicopters. Its speed and range offer additional survivability, as well. The 7th SOS has personnel on a high state of alert  to rapidly deploy, if required. The MC-130J and CV-22B work as a close team, with the Commando II able to refuel the Osprey in flight., Jamie Hunter A whole team effort As well as SEAL Team Six , it’s very possible that members of the 321st Special Tactics Squadron at Mildenhall were also aboard the 352nd SOW aircraft for this mission. This unit includes pararescuemen (PJs) and combat controllers, the latter of which can secure assault zones and provide pop-up air traffic control and long-range secure command and control communications. The PJs are highly-skilled operators and focus is on the medical side — they are known for their skills in battlefield trauma care. In-flight refueling is a critical factor in maximizing the range of the CV-22Bs. The 67th SOS “Night Owls” at Mildenhall traded their MC-130P Combat Shadows for brand new MC-130J Commando IIs. These support this type of long-range operation by Ospreys, with the Hercules’ providing fuel in flight, whilst also being able to penetrate hazardous areas to conduct infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of special operations forces via airdrop or landing on austere strips, if required. They can even be used as gas stations on the ground, providing fuel to thirsty aircraft as part of a forward arming and refueling point (FARP) , deep inside contested areas. AFSOC MC-130J crews typically consist of two pilots, two loadmasters, and a Combat Systems Officer (CSO). The CSO handles mission management, provides an extra pair of eyes while flying a low-level, and runs the in-flight refueling portion of a flight. Initially, the MC-130J lacked some of the advanced mission systems that were fielded by the MC-130H predecessor , notably a terrain-following/terrain-avoidance radar system for use while flying at low-level at night and in harsh weather conditions. Pilots had to instead rely on Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) and a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, which limits the conditions in which low-level flight can be executed. A 67th SOS MC-130J flying near RAF Mildenhall., Jamie Hunter Development of the Raytheon AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar was a priority for the MC-130J, and you can read more about it here in this previous War Zone piece. Silent Knight is a critical capability for both the Commando II and the CV-22B, and beginning in 2021, the AFSOC Ospreys will start receiving this system to replace the existing AN/APQ-186 Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) as part of the Block 30 upgrade. Trials of the Silent Knight system were conducted this summer on a CV-22B. “This capability is vital for the CV-22 mission and one of the most important differentiators between the Air Force model and the other services,” said Capt Megan Burk, team lead and flight test engineer with the 413th FLTS at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Missions like the one undertaken on October 31 are fraught with danger. Niger, where the U.S. military formally opened a new base last year, is a major hub for counter-terrorism operations in the region. Nigeria has been battling the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram , and its splinter faction, the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP), for years now, and Nigeria has also been an important regional partner for the U.S. in combating terrorism in northwest Africa. It is understood that Marine Corps special operations units deployed in northwest Africa, along with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided details as to the whereabouts of Mr. Walton that made the raid possible. Underlining the risks involved, an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship provided precision top cover for the mission. Unlike the U.S. Marine Corps, which has aspirations to enable its MV-22s to swing into a limited Close Air Support (CAS) role if required, AFSOC prefers to use the CV-22B as part of a mission package. Its primary CAS platform is the AC-130 , which is typically expected to fly overhead as the team presses into the assault area. Its massive arsenal of weaponry, advanced sensors, and ability to provide fire support with surgical precision, make it ideal for keeping any threats from interfering with the assault team. The view from the cockpit as an MC-130J prepares to refuel from a KC-135R., Jamie Hunter Illustrating the inherent risks, a similar mission on December 21, 2013, nearly ended in disaster. On that occasion, CV-22Bs were drafted in to conduct a rescue mission in southern Sudan. Three CV-22Bs from the 8th SOS flew from Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, towards the city of Bor, where fighting had trapped 30 American civilians. About to touchdown at a planned landing site, in what had been briefed as a safe location at a United Nations compound, a barrage of ground fire enveloped the Ospreys. According to a report released by the 1st SOW, the three aircraft suffered severe damage and four SEALs on the lead Osprey suffered critical injuries as rounds penetrated the cabin. The damaged CV-22Bs made for Entebbe airport in Uganda, some 500 miles away, refueling from an MC-130 en route. Air Force Major Benjamin Fingarson , who was flying one of the CV-22s, later commented: “There is not another aircraft in the world that could have done what we did that day.” Teaming CV-22B Ospreys with MC-130Js gives AFSOC a powerful ability to rapidly undertake missions such as the one conducted in the early hours of October 31. Regular training is imperative in order to ensure that when these assets come together, they can work coherently. Inside the cockpit of an MC-130J Commando II., Jamie Hunter For the CV-22B, this mission illustrates once again how the tilt-rotor has come of age. It entered service amid criticism and concerns over cost and reliability. Yet today, these awkward-looking machines show up all over the world and pull off their complex missions successfully. A changing fight The type of mission that was launched on October 31 reflects a focus for AFSOC over the past two decades, having largely concentrated on countering violent extremist organizations. AFSOC hosted a weapons and tactics conference between August 24 – Sept. 3, 2020, as part of an overall tactics review and designed around the mantra of “Competing Now and in the Next Conflict — SOF Operations in the Joint Fight.” “Pre 9-11, we were executing rapid crisis response, conducting short-duration contingency operations, and most frequently, supporting the larger joint force with specialized capabilities,” commented AFSOC commander Lieutenant General Jim Slife, adding that AFSOC post 9-11 transitioned from short-duration crisis and contingency response to sustained combat operations. “We are at another inflection point and the strategic landscape has shifted fundamentally, yet again underneath us,” Slife noted, underscoring an overall shift towards preparing for high-end, near-peer threats. Part of that shift involved AFSOC supporting other branches of the USAF such as Air Combat Command. Indeed, AFSOC has recently exercised the rapid set-up of austere locations for agile basing of fighter aircraft. A CV-22B slips away from a landing zone under the cover of darkness., Jamie Hunter At RAF Mildenhall, AFSOC has been gearing up for other major changes around plans to close in the base by 2027, with the 352nd SOW planned to relocate to Continental Europe. However, the decision has now been made to retain Mildenhall as it has been deemed as “crucial to operational efficiency” of U.S. forces in Europe. Instead, the U.S plans to close bases in Germany . Air Force Colonel Robert Horton, Vice Commander for the 352nd Special Operations Wing said recently: “One of our most important missions is to provide worldwide responsive combat airpower and support to the European theatre… Our Air commandos stay ready to support the full spectrum of SOF missions, any time, any place.” Notably, the kind of dynamic low-level flying training, which is so important to AFSOC CV-22B and MC-130 crews, isn’t permitted in Germany, where the 352nd SOW was due to relocate. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to retain this special ops team in the United Kingdom, so it can make good use of the extensive low-level and other flight training areas around the country. A pair of AFSOC CV-22Bs on a day into night mission., Jamie Hunter Maintaining readiness by effectively training together means that when the call to action comes, the CV-22B/MC-130J team is able to swing into action and swiftly deliver the kind of decisive action that was seen on October 31. Above all else, this most recent and highly-successful very long-range hostage rescue mission was really a showcase of how the special operations community can combine to pull off what just a decade ago would not have been impossible. The 352nd SOW, with its nest in Europe’s doorstep, along with its colocated KC-135R tankers, sit ready to rapidly reach out thousands of miles to deal with rapidly evolving situations in a manner that only they can. They truly provide a 9-1-1 rescue and direct action transport force for combatant commanders that are tasked with operations in Europe and Africa. As was made abundantly clear in late October, when that emergency phone rings, they certainly answer the call, and then some.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 21, 2021","The Amazing Tale Of Bravo November, The British Chinook Helicopter That Refused To Die","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the British Royal Air Force and manufacturer Boeing celebrate 40 years of the CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter in U.K. service, one of the very first of these rotorcraft that the country received is still flying operationally today and has an incredible story to tell. This Chinook, known as “Bravo November,” narrowly avoided destruction more than once during the 1982 Falklands War . Since then no fewer than four of its pilots have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on different operational missions. Bravo November was among the initial batch of 30 Chinook HC1s ordered by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1978, the first of which arrived in the United Kingdom on November 22, 1980. Yesterday the RAF, Boeing, and assorted squadrons and individuals associated with the heavy-lift workhorse over the years that have followed marked the 40th anniversary of this delivery. The Bravo November name was derived from the helicopter’s two-letter code, “BN,” though it was formally known as ZA718, according to the British military serial number system. When Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic, on April 2, 1982, Bravo November was assigned to No. 18 Squadron, the RAF’s only Chinook operator at the time, based at RAF Odiham, Hampshire, in southwest England. RAF Chinooks from Nos 18 and 27 Squadrons lined up on the Odiham dispersal. The Hampshire base has hosted the Chinook fleet for 40 years., Crown Copyright Four days later, No. 18 Squadron was called into action in support of Operation Corporate, the British military action to retake the Falklands. Five of the unit’s Chinooks were then flown to the port of Plymouth, where they were loaded onboard the container vessel Atlantic Conveyor , which had been requisitioned by the U.K. Ministry of Defense at the beginning of the conflict. The Atlantic Conveyor arrived at Ascension Island, the British task force’s staging post in the South Atlantic Ocean, on May 5. One of the Chinooks remained on Ascension Island, where it was used to shuttle stores between the island and various ships involved in the campaign. The other four heavy-lift helicopters remained on the deck of the Atlantic Conveyor , which continued toward the war zone. The ship’s other aircraft cargo comprised eight Sea Harrier fighter jets, six Harrier GR3 ground-attack jets, and another seven helicopters, a mixture of Lynx and Wessex types. The ill-fated Atlantic Conveyor approaching the Falklands in May 1982, with one Wessex visible on deck., DM GERARD/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS On May 18, the container vessel met up with the British task force and the Sea Harriers and Harriers took off to join the aircraft carriers involved in Operation Corporate, the official nickname for the British response to the Argentinian invasion. Meanwhile, it was planned that the helicopters would be delivered directly to the Falklands. Before the Chinooks could take off from the Atlantic Conveyor and head to the Falklands, the ground crew faced the tricky job of refitting the rotor blades, each weighing around 300 pounds and 30 feet long. Reinstalling the blades required raising them into position with a forklift, but then the ground crew had to lock them into place. As the ship’s deck pitched in the rough sea, the blades flexed, and this, combined with the jerking movements of the forklift, nearly resulted in the loss of several fingers. Finally, with rotor blades in place and engines tested, the Chinooks were ready to go and Bravo November was the first to launch, on the afternoon of May 25. Soon after Bravo November had departed the Atlantic Conveyor on its test flight, a pair of Exocet anti-ship missiles launched by Argentine Navy Super Etendard fighter jets hurtled toward the vessel at wave-top height, slamming into its port side. The ship was rapidly set ablaze and 12 crew were killed. The vessel was left to burn out, a process aided by the stocks of ammunition stored below decks. Six Wessex, three Chinooks, and a Lynx were all destroyed in the process. An Argentine Navy Super Etendard with a kill marking on the nose depicting the Atlantic Conveyor. , Martin Otero/Wikimedia Commons Bravo November recovered to the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes before flying to East Falkland the following day. Here, the much-reduced No. 18 Squadron detachment set up base with its single helicopter, two four-man crews, nine technicians, and 10 support personnel. The Chinook was by far the most capable helicopter available to the British task force, its lifting capacity of 12 tons equivalent to three Sea Kings. However, all the spare parts, tools, lubricants, and manuals had been destroyed on the Atlantic Conveyor , so keeping the rotorcraft flying would be an enormous challenge. At first, the crew reckoned they would be able to sustain flying operations for a couple of days, no longer, but things turned out very differently. “The aeroplane went on day after day with bits going unserviceable,” recalled Squadron Leader Dick Langworthy, boss of No 18 Squadron at the time. “But the engines kept going, the rotors kept turning and she continued to do the job.” This job at first included hauling supplies from ships positioned off the Falklands to storage areas on the islands, while Argentine prisoners captured during the battles on land were taken in the other direction. A vital role was carrying ammunition for British artillery, which involved 10-ton pallets being slung under the fuselage. More often than not, the Chinook was operated in excess of its maximum all-up weight. Bravo November’s next close call came on the evening of May 30, during a nighttime Royal Marine raid on an Argentine position on Mount Kent, East Falkland. While three Sea Kings carried the Marines to their objective, the Chinook followed with three 105-mm guns (two in the fuselage, one underslung), plus 22 more troops. Although equipped with primitive night-vision goggles (NVGs), Bravo November was flying at low-level through snow, and the resulting whiteout made the goggles almost useless. An RAF Chinook helicopter touches down on a snowy hillside in Northern Ireland while delivering agricultural aid to stricken farming communities. Today, the Chinook is much better equipped to handle operations in snowy conditions, also at night. , CROWN COPYRIGHT While the underslung gun was delivered without too much difficulty, dropping off the other two guns and the troops would require a hazardous landing. The crew had been expecting some flat ground, but instead found a sloping bog with rivers and stones on either side. On the first landing, the rear end of the Chinook sunk into the mud, and the rear ramp couldn’t be operated. The next attempt was made with the ramp already lowered, but it was a struggle to disgorge the bulky guns over the soft ground. At this point, a firefight broke out between British and Argentine troops before the Chinook’s cabin lighting failed, plunging it into darkness. The rest of the unloading operation was conducted with handheld flashlights before the Chinook departed again into the night. The return leg was more dangerous still, with heavy snow showers, and at one point, Bravo November descended so low that it struck a creek, skidding across the surface as water was thrown up into the engines, draining them of power. On the flight deck, the co-pilot jettisoned his door, preparing for emergency egress, while the pilot struggled with the heavy controls, the hydraulic system now being starved of power. “We were lucky, because if we had hit solid ground we would have been dead,” reflected co-pilot Flight Lieutenant Andy Lawless after the mission. “We hit at 100 knots. The bow wave came over the cockpit window as we settled, and the engines partially flamed out. I knew we had ditched, but I was not sure if we had been hit.” It needed the combined strength of the pilot and co-pilot on the controls to bring the Chinook clear of the water. A Chinook practices flying over water in a Mountain Flying Training Area (MFTA) in North Wales., CROWN COPYRIGHT In the rear of the Chinook, one of the other two crewmen, Flight Lieutenant Tom Jones, had his flying helmet torn off during the impact with the water. Fearing that the helicopter was now about to break up, he was preparing to jump from the Chinook when another crewman provided a spare helmet and Jones then discovered over the intercom that the aircraft was successfully climbing at 1,500 feet. The slightly more battered Bravo November made a safe landing back at its Port San Carlos base. As the pilot, Squadron Leader Langworthy was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his actions. June 2 saw Bravo November play a crucial part in the operation to secure Fitzroy settlement, an important area of high ground on East Falkland. For this mission, no fewer than 81 paratroops, twice the normal capacity, were crammed into the helicopter, together with their weapons, and, once again, the weather was dismal. With thick, low-lying clouds, the pilots relied on ground features to find their way, but the peaks of hills were obscured. The troops were successfully delivered, and the Chinook then brought in another 75 paratroops to Fitzroy to help secure the objective. In the days that followed, Bravo November continued to move artillery to wherever it was needed around the Falklands, sometimes flying as many as 15 sorties each day. Other cargo included damaged Sea Kings carried as underslung loads, and wounded troops — as many as 64 being evacuated in one flight on June 8. Another mission involved an underslung load that was described as “bloody awful” by one of the pilots involved. This was an eight-ton metal bridge that swung wildly under the Chinook as soon as the aircraft had picked up speed. The pilots were forced to decelerate to around 20 knots to prevent the bridge from flailing around dangerously below their helicopter. The bridge-lift operation took place on June 14, the same day that the Chinook detachment got the news that Argentine forces in the Falklands had surrendered. Personnel rig an underslung load for lifting by a Chinook. , Crown Copyright In the course of their campaign, Bravo November had recorded over a hundred flying hours and carried some 1,500 troops, 95 casualties, 650 prisoners of war, and 550 tonnes of cargo. Bravo November had done all that was asked of it, and more, in the effort to retake the Falkland Islands, and the crews were only left to wonder how much more efficient the British operation could have been had all four Chinooks made it off the Atlantic Conveyor in time. Since 1982, Bravo November has been upgraded several times and remains in frontline service today. Most recently it has been reworked to become a Chinook HC6A variant, broadly equivalent to the U.S. Army’s CH-47F , and which features the Boeing Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS). This latter provides pilots with improved handling and stability in challenging operational environments and increases flight safety when flying at night or in degraded visual environments — just the kinds of conditions that Bravo November battled through in the Falklands. An aircrewman from No 18 Squadron aboard Bravo November waits to take off from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal , headed for Iraq., Crown Copyright In the intervening years, Bravo November and the wider RAF Chinook fleet have played vital wartime roles in the 1991 Gulf War, as well as operations in Northern Ireland, the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq again after the 2003 invasion. Most recently, an RAF Chinook detachment has been providing much needed heavy-lift rotary support to the French contingent in Mali . On the home front, the Chinook has become a familiar sight working in support of civilian relief operations in the United Kingdom, including responses to flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic. The second DFC awarded to Bravo November crew came during Operation Telic, the British military’s component of the U.S.-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq beginning in 2003, when Bravo November became the first helicopter to land Royal Marines on the Al-Faw peninsula in the extreme southeast of Iraq. You can read a highly unique perspective of that operation in this past War Zone feature . Squadron Leader Nick Carr was recognized for his actions during the assault, flying several waves, the second of which saw a firefight break out around the aircraft. The side door gunner of an RAF Chinook surveys the southern Iraq desert landscape as it sweeps beneath him., Crown Copyright Another two DFCs followed during Operation Herrick, the United Kingdom’s contribution to NATO-led operations in Afghanistan, these recognizing Flight Lieutenant Craig Wilson’s actions during a rescue mission in Helmand province in 2006, and Flight Lieutenant Ian Fortune, who led a casualty evacuation mission on behalf of the U.S. Marine Corps and Afghan National Army, under heavy enemy fire, in 2010. Flight Lieutenant Fortune was hit by a Taliban bullet that ricocheted onto his flying helmet as the injured soldiers were being extracted. An RAF Chinook kicks up sand and dust as it comes in to land at Camp Bastion, Helmand, Afghanistan following a mission., Crown Copyright The RAF’s continued reliance on the Chinook is reflected in its fleet of 60 examples (eight HC5, 14 HC6, and 38 HC6A variants), making it the most numerous helicopter type in the U.K. Armed Forces inventory. However, there are plans to buy yet more Chinooks, with another 14 on the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s shopping list. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced on October 19, 2018, that US State Department approval had been granted for the sale of 16 H-47 Chinook (Extended Range) helicopters, a number that has since been trimmed back to 14, required to replace the RAF’s oldest Chinook airframes. These new rotorcraft will be in a special forces configuration similar to the U.S. Special Operations Command’s MH-47G Block II. Once completed, the next U.K. Chinook order will likely mark the end of Bravo November’s career. There’s a high chance the airframe will be preserved, however, after which this remarkable survivor will see out a well-earned retirement.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",New Insights Into Mysterious Soviet ‘Dome Of Light’ Phenomenon In Declassified Documents,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, The War Zone published a piece exploring a bizarre, unexplained, superweapon-like phenomenon referred to as the “ Dome of Light ” associated with launches of the Soviet Union’s RSD-10 Pioneer intermediate-range ballistic missile, also known as the SS-20 Saber, in the 1980s. Now, we have obtained previously classified intelligence documents that show U.S. intelligence analysts were equally perplexed by these rapidly expanding walls of light, which could have been intended as a countermeasure against early warning satellites and missile defense systems . They look to have been concerned about it becoming a feature of other Soviet ballistic missile launches, as well. The War Zone received the documents, which the Air Force’s Foreign Technology Division (FTD) produced, through a Freedom of Information Act request. FTD was established in 1961 as a component of Air Force Systems Command and quickly became the service’s premier Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) unit, charged with analyzing and evaluating foreign aerospace technology, including various flyable and non-flyable foreign aircraft. FTD was notably responsible for maintaining a working fleet of Soviet bloc and Chinese-made combat jets, which were later turned over to the storied and secretive 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron, better known as the Red Eagles, at Tonopah Test Range Airport , which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . FTD, which has since evolved to become part of the Air Force’s present National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), was the go-to entity within the service to try to explain the Dome of Light, which was also referred to in some of the documents simply by the abbreviation DOL. A heavily redacted section of one 1986 report describes the basics of the phenomenon as follows: “Although reports differ, most observers describe the phenomenon as a small white sphere on the horizon that expands uniformly outward and upward while maintaining its dome-like shape. It is initially opaque, but as it expands it becomes transparent, and the stars can be seen through the center of the dome. As it begins to fade, the outer boundary remains brighter forming a rainbow-shaped arc. At full extent it has been reported as being tremendously large, filling more than half of the sky. Approximate calculations [redacted] indicate is is on the order of 1,900 km [approximately 1,180.6 miles] wide, with its center 1,000 km [approximately 621 miles] high. Most Domes of Light are visible for around 20 minutes but events lasting up to 100 minutes have been reported. In almost all cases the Domes of Light have been seen while observers were in darkness or twilight [redacted]” This fits with the first-hand account of the Dome of Light that Robert Hopkins, a veteran Air Force pilot and author of The Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker : More Than a Tanker , who flew the RC-135S Cobra Ball missile tracking aircraft, among other types, shared with The War Zone last year. An RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft., USAF Hopkins described what he saw in 1988 as follows: “As we looked for traffic, we noticed what appeared to be a translucent, milky white wall moving from the left, over the USSR, to the right, toward the Northern Pacific Ocean. It covered the entire sky from ground level to as far up as we could see looking out the front windows of the airplane. It moved very quickly—far faster than crossing airplane traffic—and rapidly approached us. The wall of light passed across our flight path and then continued eastward, leaving the empty and dark night sky in its wake. Our programmed turn time arrived and we began our bank to the left to collect on the RVs. Once we rolled out southbound the wall of light was no longer visible to the east.” It’s not clear when the Air Force, or any other branch of the U.S. military or element of the Intelligence Community, first encountered the Dome of Light or how many total instances American analysts and other personnel observed or were otherwise aware of. However, the unredacted portions of FTD’s 1986 report describe a relationship between the phenomenon and the road-mobile RSD-10/SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). First deployed by the Soviets in 1976, this was that country’s most advanced IRBM design, with the final versions having a range of 4,700 miles and up to three Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle warheads, or MIRVs. A transporter-erector-launcher for the RSD-10/SS-20 IRBM., George Chernilevsky via wikimedia While FTD saw a clear link between the RSD-10/SS-20 and the Dome of Light, its analysts, scientists, and engineers struggled to define exactly how the two were related. Every recorded instance of a Dome of Light at the time the 1986 report was written had been associated in some way with an RSD-10/SS-20 launch, but not all launches of this missile featured the phenomenon. On top of that, in some cases, the light show appeared before there was a launch, while other sightings were reported to have occurred after the missile blasted off. “To date. no satisfactory explanation exists that does not conflict with some portion of the reported observations,” the 1986 FTD report states bluntly. “Speculations range from a naturally occurring phenomenon as a result of venting unused rocket fuel to the release of ion clouds to simulate a post-nuclear attack environment for the purpose of communication experiments.” “Observations of the dispersion can then be used to calculate physical properties of the upper atmosphere such as density, temperature, and particle flow rates,” the unredacted portions of the report continue, offering additional details about the ion cloud theory. “These experiments differ from the reported Domes of Light observations in several respects, most importantly in appearance, size, and observed duration. The domes do not appear to contain charged particles since there is no striation or tendency for the particles to follow the magnetic field lines as in ion release experiments. Additionally, the domes are much larger and are visible for a longer period of time than any known ionization experiment.” A passage detailing a “second explanation” is entirely redacted. However, an uncensored portion of the report that follows refers to a computer model a Russian mathematician developed to predict the formation of “an ethylene cloud of spherical shape created at an altitude of 141 km [approximately 87.6 miles]” and that was the subject of an “unclassified article.” A heavily redacted page from a 1986 FTD report discussing the Dome of Light., USAF via FOIA One of the documents that The War Zone received via FOIA was a copy of FTD’s official translation of this article, titled “Stochastic Mathematical Model of a Chemiluminescent Artificial Cloud in the Upper Atmosphere,” which was published in a Soviet scientific journal in 1983. The work is attributed to Ye. G. Slekenichs of the Obninsk Branch of the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. “A prevalent method of studying the upper atmosphere today involves observing the behavior of artificial luminescent clouds in it,” Slekenichs wrote. “Specifically, observations of artificial chemiluminescent clouds allow determining the concentrations of the minor components of the atmosphere.” The first page of the translation of Ye. G. Slekenichs’ paper. It’s unclear why the author’s name appears to be redacted here, but is unredacted on the cover sheet., USAF via FOIA However, the paper notes that creating these clouds is difficult and requires significant preparation, making it valuable to use mathematical modeling to work out various particulars in advance. “This article examines a stochastic mathematical model of a spherical chemiluminescent cloud formed by ejection of a reagent at an altitude of over 120 km [approximately 74.5 miles],” Slekenichs explained. In addition to describing, theoretically, how one would go about creating this cloud, Slekenichs notably mentions that “this probability algorithm was used to calculate the radiance brightness of a chemiluminescent ethylene cloud, the prototype of which was obtained experimentally.” That sentence includes a footnote that cites another report, dated 1974. The portion of the translation of Slekenichs’ paper discussing an apparent test of a chemiluminescent artificial cloud in 1974., USAF via FOIA “Unfortunately there is no discussion of any possible purpose for the [1974] experiment,” FTD said of Slekenichs’ paper. It’s also interesting to note that there were reported sightings in Afghanistan of Dome of Light-like phenomena, emanating from what was then the neighboring Soviet Union, as early as 1976. One of the most compelling theories, of course, remains that the Dome of Light was some kind of countermeasure against American early warning or anti-ballistic missile capabilities, a possible explanation for the phenomenon that was publicly discussed in newspapers and other publications in the late 1980s. It’s certainly very plausible that the cloud could blind or otherwise confuse early warning satellites watching for missile launches or make it hard to spot and track incoming re-entry vehicles for a possible interception – or at least that the Soviets hoped it would be able to do these things. The RSD-10/SS-20’s range and MIRVed warhead already presented a major challenge for NATO and had prompted the United States to deploy Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) and BGM-109G Gryphons , a ground-launched derivative of the Tomahawk cruise missile, to Europe in response. Getting rid of the RSD-10/SS-20s was a key objective of the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), which the two countries signed in 1987. Pershing II MRBMs, DOD Still, while the INF did lead to the destruction of the RSD-10/SS-20s, save for a small number of them that were decommissioned and put on display, the U.S. military clearly had concerns that the Dome of Light, whatever it was, would become associated with other Soviet ballistic missiles. In 1990, FTD published an engineering memorandum titled “SS-25 DOL Flights.” The copy of this report that The War Zone obtained via FOIA is heavily redacted, but appears to discuss computer modeling of flights of the road-mobile SS-25 Sickle intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), also known as the RT-2PM or RS-12M , as well as by the name Topol, producing a Dome of Light-like effect. “The computer model used [redacted] in this memo has been prepared to generate performance estimates of the SS-25 system for various scenarios,” one unredacted passage reads. A transporter-erector-launcher for the RT-2PM/RS-12M/SS-25 ICBM., Vitaly Kuzmin “This phenomenology [the Dome of Light] has been the center of much discussion, and various researchers have attempted to explain it with varying degrees of success,” this document also noted. “By folding in sun and moon angular data, as well as weather data, one should be better prepared to unravel more of the DOL associated mystery.” We don’t know if FTD or any other element of the U.S. military or Intelligence Community was aware of any actual sightings of a Dome of Light associated with an RT-2PM/RS-12M/SS-25 launch at that time or has been made aware of any such event since then. This ICBM is in increasingly limited service in Russia, but has been publicly used to test new countermeasures against ballistic missile defenses as recently as 2017. You can find the full copies of the three Dome of Light-related documents we obtained via FOIA here . These documents, taken together with what had already been known, certainly offers more insight into the Dome of Light, though a conclusive explanation, at least publicly, remains elusive. The 1990 memo also raises interesting questions about whether the Soviets, or subsequently the Russians, continued to experiment with chemiluminescent clouds or other such phenomena after dismantling the RSD-10/SS-20s. When we at The War Zone initially wrote about this last year, we raised the possibility that, if the concept was indeed a countermeasure against ballistic missile defense systems and was at all viable, that the Russians might be interested in revisiting it in light of new early warning and other missile defense efforts that the United States is pursuing now. The Kremlin has certainly shown a proclivity for exploring other “superweapon”-esque concepts in recent years . In the meantime, we are continuing to dig into this absolutely fascinating mystery.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2021",MIT Lincoln Lab’s Storied 707 Military Testbed Jet Is Now At The Boneyard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, a very unique and heavily modified Boeing 707 aircraft arrived at the U.S. Air Force’s famous boneyard at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. For nearly three decades, Lincoln Laboratory had operated this aircraft, most recently nicknamed Shashambre , as a flying testbed for various advanced sensors, electronics, and more, as part of a collaborative effort with the Air Force. Shashambre touched down at the boneyard on Oct. 26, 2020. The Lincoln Laboratory , a Department of Defense-funded research and development center housed within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and first founded in 1951, had previously announced that the aircraft, which also carried the U.S. civil registration code N404PA and has been referred to in the past as the Lincoln Multifunction Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Testbed, or LiMIT, had flown its last test mission on Sept. 15. The War Zone has now obtained pictures, seen at the top of this story and below, of the aircraft as it appears now at Davis Monthan AFB. One of the jet’s two distinctive cheek fairings, which could hold radars, as well as other sensors and payloads during testing, is still prominently visible in the photos. N404PA at the Boneyard., USAF The nickname Shashambre is visibly painted on the nose of N404PA., USAF However, a large dorsal hump at the rear of the fuselage, typically associated with wideband satellite communications systems , and a smaller dome on top of the fuselage above the cockpit, as seen in the videos below, which had been fitted the aircraft on and off since at least 2009, are now missing. Multiple platter-type antennas that had been fitted on various occasions to each side of the center of the fuselage, and which are also commonly associated with ultra-high-frequency satellite communications systems, have notably been removed, as well. The aircraft does still has various other smaller antennas on top of and below its fuselage, as well as one on the tip of its tail. A picture of N404PA prior to the installation of the two dorsal radomes, but with three of the six platter-type antennas on the side of the central part of the upper fuselage visible., Lincoln Laboratory The Lincoln Laboratory first acquired this aircraft in 1988, in order to support a specific program “that explored electromagnetic influences” on electronics, according to an official news item about Shashambre’s retirement. “The Boeing 707 platform was chosen because of its size, availability, low purchase cost, and the extensive experience on the part of the Air Force and others in modifying the airframe,” according to a separate Lincoln Laboratory document . The laboratory subsequently found a suitable example in a Florida boneyard, where it had been sitting in storage for some time. The jet in question had first rolled off Boeing’s line in 1965 and was among the first batch of 707s to be powered by Pratt & Whitney JT-3D turbofan engines, also known as the TF-33. This is the same engine still found on the Air Force’s B-52 bombers and also powered various variants of that service’s C-135 family , including certain KC-135 tankers and RC-135 spy planes . The evolution of N404PA, from its service with Pan Am, at top, to the Florida Boneyard, in the center, and then to its time as flying testbed, at the bottom. The picture of the aircraft at the bottom was take in 2009 and shows the two major dorsal radomes, as well as four patter-type antennas on the side of the fuselage, along with various other antennas. The rear dorsal dome would eventually find its way onto the Navy’s fleet of E-6B Mercury TACAMO aircraft., via the Lincoln Laboratory It initially entered service with Pan American airlines with the name Clipper Seven Seas . Before its retirement from airline duties, “the aircraft had been leased by several regional carriers, shuttling college students to Daytona Beach for spring break, among other duties,” according to the Lincoln Laboratory. “There are lots of stories about the overhaul process: we discovered cracks in the wing spars that needed repair; the engines were from an airline in China, so all the service data and manuals were in Chinese, forcing us to strip the engines down and essentially ‘zero time’ them [start from scratch],” David Kettner, who headed up the program the aircraft was initially purchased to support, said in the Lincoln Laboratory’s piece on its recent retirement. “I sometimes wondered if we were ever going to get all the work done.” The jet eventually made its way to E-Systems in Greenville, Texas, a firm well-known for its involvement in various Air Force intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) projects and other specialized aircraft modification and conversion programs dating back to the 1960s. E-Systems has changed hands multiple times since then and is now a division of L3Harris. This Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy plane emerged with an unusual dorsal antenna from L3Harris’ facility in Greenville, Texas last year, underscoring the kind of specialized modification and conversion work that still goes on there., Dan Stijovich The final converted 707 finally arrived at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts in 1991. The Lincoln Laboratory had established a small flight test center at the base, which remains there to this day, and at the time, it was also home to the Electronic Systems Division of Air Force Systems Command. The following year, that unit was redesignated as the Electronic Systems Center and became part of the restructured Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). The jet, originally nicknamed Paul Revere , after the famous Revolutionary War patriot and Massachusetts icon, continued to support the electromagnetic research effort until 1999. After that program ended, the Lincoln Laboratory decided to continue operating the jet together with the Air Force to support various other test programs. Over the years, a number of additional improvements and modifications to the aircraft were made. “An extensive fiber-optic network backbone was installed along with two workstation tables, each capable of hosting six operators with computer access to the network,” according to the Lincoln Laboratory. “The power system was upgraded, several additional radomes were installed to handle communications antennas, and a liquid-cooling system was installed to cool power-hungry electronics.” The aircraft, which subsequently received the nicknames and Hannah and then Shashambre , the exact origins of which are unclear, also got upgrades focused on giving it an increasingly more modular, plug-and-play architecture to allow for different test payloads to be more rapidly installed and removed. “We like to think of this flying laboratory as a Mr. Potato Head,” Dr. Joe Chapa, a Lincoln Laboratory researcher, said in 2004. “We can put a different nose or a different eye on.” The interior of N404PA as of 2017, showing various modular equipment racks., USAF All told, “N404PA has capabilities not available in other test aircraft, which allow the laboratory to rapidly prototype and demonstrate solutions to the hard communication and ISR challenges facing the nation,” Stephen McGarry, a member of the laboratory’s senior staff and former assistant leader of its Tactical Networks Group, said in the official story on the aircraft’s retirement. A full list of the projects the former airliner took part in is unknown and many likely remain classified. “In 2001, the aircraft was assigned to an Air Force–sponsored program that was developing and demonstrating an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform that would be interoperable with other aircraft,” which “contributed to the modernization of military airborne command and control flight platforms that are still in use today,” according to the Lincoln Laboratory. In 2002, it supported work “to develop and demonstrate a next-generation multi-sensor command and control airborne test platform.” It’s not clear what that program might have been, but the following year, a team consisting of Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Raytheon received a contract from the Air Force to begin development of what would become known as the E-10A Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A), which was to be based on the Boeing 767-400ER. An artist’s conception of the E-10A Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A)., USAF This was an ambitious effort meant to eventually replace the service’s E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) radar planes and E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battle management aircraft, as well as its E-4B Nightwatch “doomsday” command and control jets and RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy planes. In 2007, the Air Force canceled the project. Boeing sold the E-10A prototype to Bahrain, after which it was converted into a VIP aircraft. In the early 2000s, N404PA supported a program to test new software algorithms designed to improve Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data processing in support of Discoverer II space-based radar program, a program the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) conducted together with the Air Force and the secretive National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). “GMTI from space brought on challenges beyond those for airborne systems because of the very high velocities of satellites (approximately 40 times that of airplanes),” according to one Lincoln Laboratory document . “The Laboratory developed and optimized the performance of a set of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms specifically for space radar,” it continued. “However, without a space-based radar, it was difficult to carry out two key steps in the Laboratory development approach: field testing and demonstration of operational utility.” Lincoln Laboratory personnel subsequently installed a “scaled system [that] consists of a small multichannel antenna, similar to the antenna architecture for the space radar” in the nose of their modified 707. ” In this role, LiMIT has participated in a number of enterprise-level field exercises to demonstrate the ISR potential of space-based radar.” A picture of the radar that was installed in the nose of N404PA in support of the Discoverer II program inside an anechoic chamber, at top, and an image showing the Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) tracks the system collected during one of the subsequent tests. , Lincoln Laboratory In 2004, in cooperation with the Air Force, the aircraft also demonstrated various communications and data-sharing capabilities during a Joint Forcible Entry Exercise (JFEX). A previous Air Force news item described the plane’s participation in that event as follows: “Task Force Paul Revere, an airborne battle management command, control and communications application, helps makes testing machine-to-machine capabilities and global communication experiments possible by sending and receiving data between other airborne and space sensors and the Combined Air and Space Operations Center. This capability could allow United States and coalition warfighters from all services to simultaneously communicate from around the globe.” “Currently, aircraft such as the Rivet Joint, Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, U-2 or Airborne Warning and Control System take in information that is saved on disks, analyzed and manually sent to warfighters and planners. Today’s output bandwidth from these aircraft is limited. Task Force Paul Revere experiments with the capability of taking in information from ground, space and air assets and simultaneously and instantly sending the information back out on a global network that includes the CAOC.” “During JEFX, Task Force Paul Revere is connecting information to Washington and routing it back through the base here.” The aircraft also supported work on in similar veins in the mid-to-late 2000s, all of which notably took place around the time of the development of the Air Force’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) communications gateway. You can read more about BACN in this past War Zone feature . In 2004, the modified 707 had played the role of an airborne radar with synthetic aperture and ground-moving-target indicator capabilities during a U.S. Navy exercise nicknamed Silent Hammer, which helped prove out various concepts of operation related to that service’s converted Ohio class guided missile submarines. You can read more about those specialized boats in detail, as well as that transformational exercise, in this past War Zone feature . A diagram showing how N404PA supported the Silent Hammer exercise., Lincoln Laboratory Starting in 2011, the modified 707 began supporting Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center projects, including the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight Terminals communications program, as well. The Lincoln Laboratory says that the jet has also been involved in the testing various radars, including phased arrays and a laser radar called Jigsaw, over the years. A logo for the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight Terminals program seen on the nose of Shashambre at the Boneyard., USAF “The teams who work through this test bed [sic] have truly put some of the best technology in the hands of the warfighter, and we really appreciate what you all have done,” Eric Evans, the Lincoln Laboratory’s Director, said at a retirement ceremony at Hanscom for N404PA in October. “We achieved things with that aircraft that… definitely advanced both our understanding and our appreciation, and helped raise the spirit of why we do what we do each and every day,” Niles Cocanour, a retired Air Force Colonel who had worked with the Lincoln Laboratory team operating N404PA, also said at the event. Despite Shashambre’s retirement, the Lincoln Laboratory will continue to provide flight test support for U.S. military programs with its other aircraft, a fleet that presently includes Dassault Falcon 20 and Gulfstream business jets, DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops, and Cessna 206 single-engine plane. The MIT research center also works with other U.S. government agencies on flight test work, including experiments utilizing NASA’s unique WB-57F aircraft, which you can read about more here . Of course, none of the Lincoln Laboratory’s remaining aircraft are nearly as eye-catching or uniquely capable as its now-retired heavily modified Boeing 707.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though people often get the two mixed up, Veterans Day is a time for honoring those who have served in the armed forces, while Memorial Day is a time for tributes to those who paid the ultimate price during their service. Sometimes, though, the line between the two can get a bit blurry when talking about individuals who were clearly willing to give up their lives, and almost did, to save their brothers and sisters in arms. Case in point, the story of Jacklyn “Jack” Lucas , who threw himself on not one, but two grenades to shield his fellow Marines from the blasts during the Battle of Iwo Jima in the Pacific Theater during the latter stages of World War II. For this monumental act of heroism, Lucas was awarded the Medal of Honor , becoming the youngest recipient of this honor since the Civil War. The U.S. Navy is now set to get an Arleigh Burke class destroyer named after him. Lucas, the son of a North Carolina tobacco farmer, had first enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves on Aug. 8, 1942, just over eight months after the United States entered World War II following the infamous Japanese attack on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. He was 14 at the time and was only able to sign up with the Marines after forging his mother’s signature on a parental consent form, which said he was 17, and bribing a notary to sign it. “My father died when I was 11 years old and I became kind of a tough kid after that to handle,” Lucas said in a recorded interview decades later, which you can watch in its entirety below. “My mother couldn’t handle me [and] sent me off to military school.” “I was kinda devastated when we got the news that all those people suffered there at Pearl Harbor,” he continued. “That very day, a cold chill ran down my spine and I just became obsessed that I had to do something.” With the Marines, unaware of his true age, the teenager, who had just recently completed eighth grade, quickly went to boot camp at the famous Marine training base at Parris Island in South Carolina. After being assigned to a succession of training units, where he was ultimately qualified to be a heavy machine gun crewman, Lucas was eventually sent to join the 6th Base Depot, part of the V Amphibious Corps, at Pearl Harbor in 1943. In the recorded interview, Lucas says that prior to leaving for Hawaii, he had become frustrated with not being able to get into combat and had broken ranks to join other Marines heading first to California. “They gave me orders, along with nine others, to stay at the base to relieve older cadres and to send them out” into combat, Lucas said. “That wasn’t my cup of tea.” An official Marine Corps historical profile makes no mention of this . However, this spirit was certainly present after he arrived at the 6th Base Depot. On Jan. 10, 1945, then-Private First Class Lucas donned a khaki uniform and, with nothing but a pair of dungarees and an extra set of shoes, stowed away on board Haskell class attack transport ships USS Deuel . That ship was carrying the 1st Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment, part of the 5th Marine Division, and was headed to take part in the invasion of Iwo Jima. The Haskell class attack transport ships USS Deuel that Jack Lucas stowed away on and that ultimately took him to Iwo Jima., USN “I didn’t even know where the ships were headed,” Lucas said. “I’d never heard of Iwo Jima in my lifetime. I knew I was going away to war and that’s where I wanted [to be], that was my obsession.” The Marine Corps had declared Lucas Absent Without Leave (AWOL) and a deserter and put a reward out for bringing him back. The service demoted him to the rank of Private in the process. This was the predicament he found himself in when he surrendered to Captain Robert Dunlap, commanding officer of C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines while the ship was still underway. However, beyond the reduction in rank, Lucas received no further punishment for his actions. Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Pollock, the commanding officer of 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, promptly sent the teenager to join Dunlap’s company as a rifleman. The Marine Corps says that Lucas was technically assigned to Headquarters Company, 5th Marine Division, but he landed on Iwo Jima with the rest of C Company on Feb. 19, 1945. He had turned 17 just six days earlier. The invasion of the island and the subsequent campaign to capture it from Imperial Japanese forces was a brutal undertaking. The initial landings were a particular slog given the volcanic sand on the beaches, which was soft and hard to traverse on foot and was virtually impossible to dig into to help provide any kind of immediate cover against fire from the heavily fortified Japanese positions ahead. Marines land on Iwo Jima in February 1945., USMC “Thank goodness I didn’t have to go in the first wave, but when we went in it was like all hell broke loose about [sic] artillery, just tearing people up,” Lucas said. “It was just a continuation from night and day for the rest of that battle.” More than 5,000 American service members had died on the beaches of Iwo Jima. Around 1,800 more were killed in the course of recapturing the entire island over the next month or so. Marines famously raised the American flag on the island’s Mount Suribachi on Feb. 23, marking a major victory against the Japanese. The Battle of Iwo Jima was declared officially over on Mar. 26. The famous photo of the raising of the US flag on Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima., Public Domain However, Lucas’ participation in the fighting ended the day after the initial landing. He and three other Marines were advancing inland with other American forces when, after passing through a twisting ravine, they came under fire from enemy fortifications. Lucas and two other Marines jumped into a nearby trench, while the fire team leader scrambled to another, only to find it occupied by Japanese troops. “Well, all hell broke loose and we opened fire on the Japanese. I opened fire, I shot two. The second shot, my rifle, of all things, my rifle jammed,” Lucas said. “When I reached down to unjam my rifle, I saw two grenades. How long had it been down there? I didn’t know. Two seconds?” “If my rifle hand not jammed it would have probably wounded all of us, not killed us, but wounded us,” he continued. “Then those Japs we were supposed to be killing in front of us would have finished us off.” Lucas dropped onto one of the grenades and pulled the second one underneath him. Only one went off, severely wounding him in the right arm, wrist, leg, thigh, and chest. The soft sand on Iwo Jima may have helped save his life by absorbing much of the explosion. However, his fellow Marines, who were left unscathed, believed he was dead and moved on. Another unit subsequently noticed that Lucas was still alive and attended to his wounds before getting him back to more serious medical care at the beachhead. He was eventually transferred to the hospital ship USS Samaritan and made his way through various field hospitals before eventually returning to San Francisco. Doctors performed a total of 21 surgeries on Lucas and left more than 200 pieces of shrapnel inside of him, some large enough to set off airport metal detectors during his travels later in life. In August 1945, at which time he was still a patient at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Charleston, South Carolina, the Marine Corps scrubbed the charge of desertion from Lucas’ record and reinstated his former rank of Private First Class. He was formally discharged from the Marines due to disability on Sept. 18, 1945, just over two weeks after the official end of World War II. On Oct. 5, 1945, President Harry Truman presented Lucas with the Medal of Honor for his actions on Iwo Jima. Three sailors and 10 other Marines, including Captain Dunlap of C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, also received Medals of Honor during this ceremony at the White House for their own heroics. Jack Lucas, center, with President Harry Truman at the Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House on Oct. 5, 1945., YouTube capture The official citation for Lucas’ award is as follows: “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the First Battalion, Twenty-sixth Marines, Fifth Marine Division, during action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands 20 February 1945. While creeping through a treacherous, twisting ravine which ran in close proximity to a fluid and uncertain front line on D-plus-1 Day, Private First Class Lucas and three other men were suddenly ambushed by a hostile patrol which savagely attacked with rifle fire and grenades. Quick to act when the lives of the small group were endangered by two grenades which landed directly in front of them, Private First Class Lucas unhesitatingly hurled himself over his comrades upon one grenade and pulled the other one under him, absorbing the whole blasting force of the explosions in his own body in order to shield his companions from the concussion and murderous flying fragments. By his inspiring action and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice, he not only protected his comrades from certain injury or possible death, but also enabled them to rout the Japanese patrol and continue the advance. His exceptionally courageous initiative and loyalty reflect the highest credit upon Private First Class Lucas and the United States Naval Service.” Lucas after being awarded his Medal of Honor., USMC Though Jack Lucas remained a civilian for years afterward, his “obsession” with serving his country returned in 1961, when he re-enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1961, eventually training to be a paratrooper. He is said to have miraculously survived a training accident in which both his primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy properly. He was subsequently assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, but was not sent to Vietnam, despite volunteering to do so. His second stint in the armed services came to an end in 1965. A profile on Lucas on the website of the National World War II Museum in New Orleans says that he also escaped a house fire and attempt by his then-wife to have him murdered. His memoir was, perhaps unsurprisingly, titled Indestructible : The Unforgettable Story of a Marine Hero at the Battle of Iwo Jima. When the keel of the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima was laid down in 1997, Lucas placed his Medal of Honor citation inside, where it remains sealed to this very day. In 2016, eight years after Lucas’ death, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that a future Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer would be named the USS Jack H. Lucas in honor of the late Marine. That ship was laid down last year and is expected to be commissioned in 2023. An artist’s rendering of the future USS Jack H. Lucas ., USN One can only imagine the traditions the ship’s eventual crew may form around the memory of the indestructible Jack Lucas, a true American hero with a self-described obsession to serve his country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 7, 2020",The Army Tried To Turn Nerf Footballs Into Hand Grenades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Few things are as quintessentially American as football and most people in this country have probably played it in some form at least once in their life. This was what the U.S. Army was banking on when it developed an anti-tank grenade using an explosive charge jammed into a hollowed-out Nerf football in the early 1970s. The Army’s Land Warfare Laboratory (LWL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland concocted the “football device,” something I wrote about briefly years ago now, as part of a broader effort to develop a hand-thrown anti-tank weapon of some kind that began in July 1973. The Army had originally established LWL in 1962 to develop, test, and evaluate any and all weapons or other technology that might be applicable to counter-insurgency campaigns, a type of warfare that was emerging around the world at the time. This included in various countries in Southeast Asia, such as South Vietnam and Thailand, where the United States was already becoming increasingly embroiled at that time. In 1970, LWL was renamed the Land Warfare Laboratory, a switch that kept its acronym intact, and it began exploring systems that be might useful to a broader set of conflict types. One of these efforts was the anti-tank grenade project, a requirement driven by concerns about the utility of existing infantry anti-armor capabilities, especially in an urban environment, such as the ones the U.S. military expected to be a primary setting for any major conflict against the Soviets in Europe. “Current standard US Army antitank weapons have been designed to provide maximum practical stand-off range,” a 1974 final test report on the football grenade, as well as the other types LWL evaluated, explained. The primary infantry anti-tank weapons in Army service at the time were the BGM-71 TOW and FGM-77 Dragon anti-tank guided missiles and variants of the M72 Light Anti-Tank Weapon (LAW), a shoulder-fired rocket launcher. The issue with these weapons, as LWL’s report noted, was that firing them would often reveal the location of the shooter. The Dragon was a particularly notorious offender in this regard, putting the person that fired it immediately at risk and making it difficult for them to quickly re-engage if the first shot missed. In addition, the missiles, as well as the M72s, could not be employed safely from within confined spaces, such as from the inside of a building. On top of that, to protect those firing them from getting caught in the blast, these missiles and rockets had to travel certain minimum distances before arming themselves. In a cramped urban setting with fighting that could be in very close quarters, this would also have limited the ability of troops to employ these weapons. At the time, the Army trained troops to engage heavily armored vehicles under these conditions using a variety of improvised means, including ponchos filled with oil and gasoline and explosive charges packed into empty ammunition cans. They were to, whenever possible, exploit the lack of situational awareness that armored vehicles crews have when they are “buttoned-up” inside with all their hatches closed. A low-quality scan of a page from a comic book-style Army manual from 1972 describing improved explosive means for damaging tanks in close quarters., US Army via FOIA This is very much how the service had done things since World War II. Steven Spielberg’s famous 1998 film about that war, Saving Private Ryan , notably includes the use of improvised “sticky bombs,” consisting of socks full of explosives dipped in thick oil, against Nazi tanks in its climactic final battle. https://youtube.com/watch?v=evVpplhgFS4 “A hand-thrown short-range device appeared to overcome the deficiencies of standard weapons in an urban environment,” LWL’s 1974 report said. “A hand deployed device which will give the infantryman in urban warfare the capability to disable a ‘buttoned-up’ tank is desired.” LWL decided to focus on hand-thrown weapons containing a shaped charge, a warhead design commonly used in anti-tank missiles and rockets. A shaped charge, also known as a hollow charge, features a large open cavity inside between the main explosive charge and the front of the projectile. An inverted cone-shaped metal liner, typically made copper, is inserted into the explosive charge. When the charge goes off, it expands outward, turning the liner into a high-speed metal dart of sorts that then punches through the target. The video below shows the basic function of such a shaped charge, using a high-explosive anti-tank shell as an example. This is a technology that dates back to the late 19th century and is still in use today. It works, but its effect is greatly diminished if the full force of the resulting projectile isn’t directed at the target at an optimal distance or angle. Countries around the world have added a wide array of spaced armor, slats and nets , and even small bricks of explosives to the side of armored vehicles to prevent shaped charge weapons from detonating as intended. LWL then determined that the optimal methods of attack for a hand-thrown anti-tank grenade using a shaped charge at close range were dropping it out of a window on top of the vehicle, lobbing it on top of the vehicle from cover, or otherwise trying to hit the top of the vehicle from the furthest distance away possible. Typically, the top of the turret or the rear hull of a tank or another heavily armored vehicle is where its armor is the weakest. Furthermore, killing crew members inside or severely damaging or destroying the engine compartment could be enough to achieve a mission kill. It’s interesting to note that when LWL started its work on developing a weapon that would meet these requirements and be usable in one or more of those scenarios, many other countries, including America’s European allies and the Soviet Union , had already fielded anti-tank grenades decades earlier. By the 1970s, some nations, especially the Soviets and their allies, were still using them. Personnel at the Army laboratory identified multiple foreign types that informed its work, primarily so-called “potato masher” grenade designs with stick-like handles for throwing. Anti-tank versions of these grenades almost universally had some kind of retarding device, such as cloth strips or even a small parachute , which would help stabilize the grenade. The idea is that these features would help the grenades fall near vertically on top of a vehicle to maximize the effect of their shaped charge warheads. Rather than timed fuzes found on typical hand grenades, these hand-thrown weapons often had impact fuzes that would only go off when they struck something. A Cold War-era Polish-made Soviet-designed “potato masher” style RPG-43 anti-tank grenade. When thrown, the cone at the base of the handle would drop off, extending two cloth strips in the process to stabilize the grenade., International Military Antiques Not surprisingly, LWL crafted two of its own potato masher grenade designs, including one with a magnet at the front to help it stick to the target before going off. It also built two experimental dart-shaped designs, one with fins and another with a cowling of some kind, both designed to stabilize them after they were thrown. Sadly, there do not appear to be any pictures readily available of either of these apparent anti-tank lawn darts. The basic idea sounds similar in some respects to the British World War II-era No. 68 anti-tank grenade . It also sounds broadly reminiscent of the U.S. Civil War-era Ketchum hand grenade , a Union weapon that featured an egg-shaped explosive body with a wooden tail fin and that has its own visual similarities to a modern vortex football . A deactivated No. 68 anti-tank grenade., Arundel Militaria A Ketchum hand grenade., Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield And then there was the football device. “Since a regulation size football weighs 14 ounces, it was considered feasible to make a shaped charge grenade within this weight limitation,” according to LWL’s 1974 report. “In addition, most US troops are familiar with throwing footballs.” LWL made at least one experimental model using a hollowed-out Nerf football with a metallic container and a conical fin at one end that held the shaped charge inserted in the middle, but it’s not clear if this was a functional prototype. Parker Brothers had launched its brand of now-iconic foam balls in 1969, but there is no indication that they were in any way directly involved in the project. Nerf has since gone on to become a cultural institution better known for its foam dart-shooting guns . The football device., US Army In a way, this idea makes perfect sense. Footballs are intended to be thrown across relatively long distances in a manner that stabilizes them in flight making them more accurate. The Army says that it expects an average soldier to be able to throw a standard fragmentation grenade out to a distance of 35 meters, or just under 115 feet, while standing. NFL quarterbacks routinely demonstrate their ability to throw footballs much further than that. It was not necessarily out of the realm of reason to believe average soldiers, while not professional football players, would still be able to get more range and accuracy out of a football-shaped grenade. It’s not the first time the Army had used this kind of logic, either. During World War II, the service, together with the Office of Strategic Services , the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, had experimented with fragmentation grenades that were the exact same size and weight as regulation baseballs for similar reasons. Those grenades, designated the T-13 and nicknamed the “Beano,” never entered service owing to their use of a dangerously sensitive impact fuze that killed two people and injured 44 others in the course of testing. A cutaway schematic of the baseball-shaped T-13 Beano grenade., US Army They did, however, inform the design of the spherical hand grenades that the Army subsequently adopted to replace its French-derived World War I-era Mk 2 “pineapple” grenades . To this day, the service uses a similar design with a slightly more ovular shape as its standard fragmentation grenade. It’s not clear how many football grenades LWL made in total and what the ultimate configuration might have been, but the design never came close to being field operationally. As perfect as the idea probably sounded in the heads of the engineers who came up with it, it’s probably just as obvious to anyone who has ever seen a football bounce after hitting something as to why it didn’t work. It proved to be virtually impossible to ensure the grenade’s shaped charge detonated at the correct moment to reliably penetrate any armor. The weight distribution of the Army’s “device,” unlike a regulation football, which is uniformly hollow inside, made it unstable in flight, too. Here is how LWL’s 1974 report explained the results of the tests: Test on the football shape indicated it also had a low tendency of nose-on impact. In addition, both the spring wire and soft aluminum placed on the nose to cause the “football” to rotate upon impact, so the nose would be perpendicular to the tank surface, did not work as envisioned. The “football” would bounce away before the nose rotated any significant amount. In addition, the “football” never attained a stable trajectory. This was apparently caused by the mass of the grenade type “football” being near the longitudinal axis while a real football has all its weight in the “skin.” The football shape was not considered practical for further development. LWL testing also showed that none of the anti-tank grenades it developed, including the football type, could be practically employed at distances over 10 meters, or just under 33 feet. One has to imagine that it could not have been easy to ensure that the football grenade would come down on a target, at all, and, even if it had worked as intended, it seems unlikely that drilling it into the side of a tank or other heavy armored vehicle would have produced the desired result. The 1974 final report’s one-sentence conclusion on the entire project, which cost the Army a paltry $12,167, is curt. “The lightweight (1 1/2-lb.) ‘potato masher’ grenade with parachute showed some promise that it could be developed into a useful antitank weapon if a 10 meter average range could be tolerated.” The Army shuttered LWL entirely the same month the report came out, amid post-Vietnam War drawdowns, and ultimately decided not to pursue any of the designs, or an anti-tank grenade of any kind. It, along with the U.S. Marine Corps, also passed on the curious spherical-shaped Rifleman’s Assault Weapon (RAW), a rocket-propelled weapon intended to be fired from a standard M16 rifle. That weapon had come from the Brunswick Corporation, a major manufacturing company that had gotten its start making bowling balls and pool tables. An M16A1 rifle equipped with a launcher for the Rifleman’s Assault Weapon. One of the rocket-propelled weapons is seen loaded underneath the muzzle., DOD The service ultimately fielded high-explosive dual-purpose rounds , which have some anti-armor capability, for its 40mm grenade launchers . Versions of the M72, as well as its successor in Army service, the M136 , have since been developed with features allowing them to be safely fired from enclosed spaces . In contrast, the Soviets continued to field anti-tank grenades, as well as export them. Insurgents were still using 1950s-era RKG-3s, a potato masher anti-tank grenade with a small parachute in the handle, against American forces in Iraq to significant effect in the 2000s, especially against lightly armored Humvees and even early Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. In 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned one Iraqi militant group, Jaysh Rijal al-Tariq al-Naqshabandi, specifically citing its use of the RKG-3, among other things. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7OBBOs6DNRY It’s not clear what happened to any examples of the football device that LWL built, but anyone who’s ever played with a Nerf ball knows that they’re not exactly designed to stand the test of time. The author knows of only one picture to exist of a prototype, which is seen in this story, but there is always the hope that more are hiding, yet to be discovered, in an archive or attic somewhere. The idea of a literal football grenade has appeared in popular culture at least once, 25 years after the LWL’s real-life project ended, in the 1999 film Three Kings , a sort of action heist movie with the aftermath of the first Gulf War as a backdrop. Spike Jonze’s character uses electrical tape to tie C4 explosive charges and detonators to brightly-colored Nerf-like footballs out of boredom and Ice Cube’s character eventually uses one to blow up a helicopter toward the end of the film. All in all, the football grenade may not have worked out, but it certainly one of, if not the most distinctly American weapons to ever be developed on any level.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 9, 2021",All The Crazy Proposed Variants Of The B-70 Valkyrie Super Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s supersonic B-70 Valkyrie bomber, designed and built by North American Aviation, already holds a place of great prominence in discussions about advanced military aircraft that never made it into service and what might have happened if they did. Now, the service has published a fascinating review of proposed variants of the B-70 for use in various roles, including as a reconnaissance platform, an aerial refueling tanker, a supersonic transport, and as a mothership for launching ballistic missiles, hypersonic test vehicles, and to help get payloads into space , among others. Air Force Material Command’s (AFMC) History Office released the document , titled NAA B-70 Valkyrie Variants: A Future That Never Was… , on Nov. 23, 2020. This office regularly publishes works that provide a more in-depth look at past advanced aviation developments and other historical topics . USAF “Like flying cars, human colonies on Mars and so many other futuristic ideas, the 1950’s vision of the tomorrow was filled with grand ideas that are just now coming to fruition,” the B-70 variant historical monograph offers by way of introduction. “As expected, aircraft engineers of the time had similar visions as they began taking their ideas from their minds, placing them on paper, then asking manufactures to bend steel and other exotic materials to create the planes of the future.” “Engineers hoped that one vehicle, one that they perceived as the last manned bomber, could change the future of aerial bombardment,” it continues. “Yet, politics, money, and technological advancements put an end to the B-70 Valkyrie, a Mach 3+, nuclear-capable super-bomber. Those varying factors killed the dream even before the first vehicle rolled out of the North American Aviation assembly plant.” Some of the concepts the Air Force historians put into their compendium were put forward in support of the B-70’s primary mission as a long-range strike platform. One of these is a self-contained “Alert Pod” that go underneath the rear fuselage and obviate the need for various heavy ground equipment to get the aircraft started ahead of a mission. This would have been useful, as the name implies, for aircraft sitting on short-notice alert or if Valkyries were to be dispersed to other locations with more limited support assets. USAF There’s artwork included in the document of a B-70 fitted with an Alert Pod and also armed with a pair of Skybolt air-launched ballistic missiles, a weapon you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . Another concept shows a Valkyrie carrying no less than 14 “General Purpose Missiles,” a proposed common missile design that looks like a mini-B-70 and that could have accommodated different kinds of warheads optimized for different target sets. There’s a diagram showing a B-70 fitted with rotary bomb racks in its bomb bay, something that became standard on Air Forces bombers , including the B-52 , B-1 , and B-2 , decades later. This same proposed variant, dubbed the RSB-70, with RSB standing for “reconnaissance/strike bomber,” would have also had an integral reconnaissance camera package, enabling it to collect bomb damage assessment imagery itself after striking a target. USAF Another graphic depicts the installation of a terrain avoidance system for B-70 bombs “as surface-to-air missile capabilities of hostile countries improved, the high and fast mission of the bomber fleet became obsolete. Low-level terrain-following missions had become the new standard,” according to the document. This shift in bomber concepts of operation very much went on to inform the development of the subsequent B-1 . The document also has a picture of a wind tunnel model of a B-70 fitted with a retractable parasail, a device that the Air Force, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, explored as a way to improve the short takeoff and landing capabilities of various aircraft. The parasail in this case looks much like a wing-shaped parachute, which would have provided extra lift at low speeds. USAF The document covers a number of non-bomber variants, as well. Some of these make good sense, at least in principle, such as a tanker version, which would have been able to top up other fuel-hungry B-70s during missions. Robert Hopkins, an Air Force veteran, author, and contributor to the War Zone , with flying time on numerous C-135 variants , including KC-135 tankers , tweeted out “Not sure, however, if I’d want to try A/R [aerial refueling] at M=3.0 [Mach 3]” after seeing this new Air Force history. “Remember Pitch X Mach = VVI [Vertical Velocity Indicator], so a sneezing while refueling would be catastrophic!” There were also proposals for passenger and cargo transports, including a medical version “configured to include a nurses station along with patient litters for forty-eight wounded personnel.” This is hardly surprising given the interest in supersonic airliners and similar aircraft at the time, which eventually gave rise to various commercial projects, including Boeing’s SST and the Anglo-French Concorde . USAF USAF AFMC’s historians note that it’s not clear if the technology at the time would have made it cost-effective to turn the B-70 into an airlifter. “In an attempt to sell a pure cargo variant, engineers truly embellished their findings by attempting to show that the cargo capacity of their supersonic transport was equal to, or better than, larger transports such as the C-133 or KC-135,” the document says. “Loading of cargo through a swinging nose similar to a Lockheed C-5 or Super Guppy , or the use of access doors in the bottom and sides were just some of the problems to be overcome. The use of a detachable pod appeared to be the most logical solution.” USAF The document also notes that the B-70 was proposed as an engine testbed to support the development of other supersonic transports or other advanced designs. One graphic shows how various kinds of engines could be mounted in the bomb bay, ranging from ramjets and pulsejets to solar, ionic , and even nuclear-powered jet engines . USAF The Air Force monograph also covered a number of more radical proposed variations of the B-70 design that were focused on turning into a mothership for launching various kinds of payloads inside modified bomb bays, underneath the fuselage behind specialized fairings, on top of the fuselage, or under the wings. One such concept envisioned turning the bomber into an airborne launch platform for the Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). USAF It’s worth noting that the Air Force actually did a real-world test of this basic idea in 1974, dropping a Minuteman missile out of the back of a C-5 Galaxy airlifter. After the missile left the C-5’s cargo bay, parachutes caused it to fall into a near-vertical orientation, at which point its rocket motors fired in midair and sent it hurtling on its way to a mock target in the Pacific Ocean. The B-70s could have been used to launch multiple kinds of hypersonic vehicles, including test platforms, such as variants of the X-15 . At the same time as the Valkyrie was in development, the Air Force was also looking at hypersonic aircraft designs, such as the X-20 Dyna-Soar , that it hoped would be capable of performing various mission types in an actual operational environment. One of these mothership proposals was interestingly referred to as the M-70 Hypersonic Experimental Launch Platform (HELP), a nomenclature similar to the M-21 version of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. Lockheed developed the M-21 to launch the D-21 high-speed spy drone, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . USAF USAF USAF The air-launched mothership version of the B-70 was also considered as a way to potentially launch payloads into space, a concept also known as two-stage-to-orbit, a role that was also proposed for the SR-71’s predecessor, the A-12 Oxcart . You can read more about this general concept and the proposed AP-12 variant of the Oxcart in these past War Zone pieces , respectively. The AFMC monograph includes artwork showing modified versions of the Valkyrie launching rockets carrying spy satellites, as well as a Gemini space capsule. USAF USAF USAF “Some fanciful proposals went so far as to propose launching NASA’s Gemini manned missions from the Valkyrie mothership,” the document says. “It appears engineers were desperate to come up with a mission for the aircraft and if a space-bound vehicle was small enough to be carried in this fashion, then a report was created to launch it from the B-70.” It’s worth pointing out that there have been persistent rumors for decades that some form of follow-on aircraft to the B-70 was also developed for this role. This is something the War Zone has previously explored in depth . AFMC’s History Office also notes that the B-70 appears to have had at least some influence on various supersonic transport designs that came afterward, as well as other proposed hypersonic vehicle or space-launch motherships. The document highlights very broad similarities between the B-70 and concept art of an unmanned hypersonic aircraft that Boeing released more recently . North American Aviation had merged with Rockwell in 1967 to form North American Rockwell, which eventually morphed into Rockwell International. Boeing acquired various components of Rockwell International, including its aviation division, in 1996. USAF USAF USAF The Valkyrie program, as already noted, was ultimately canceled due to a wide array of factors, including technological challenges, cost growth, the Soviet Union’s expanding surface-to-air missile arsenal, and subsequent changes in Air Force bomber doctrine. The Air Force only ever acquired two prototype examples of this impressive aircraft, officially designed XB-70As, one of which was infamously lost in a tragic fatal midair collision with NASA F-104 Starfighter . The remaining aircraft was subsequently used for experimental aerospace research by both the Air Force and NASA, before its retirement in 1969. It is now on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Altogether, this historical monograph is a fascinating overview of the high hopes and ambitious plans the Air Force, as well as North America’s engineers, once had for what has gone down as one of the most fascinating aircraft of all time, the B-70.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 17, 2021","First AH-64E Apaches Arrive In UK, Will Serve As New Carriers’ Other Strike Capability","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first pair of AH-64E Apache gunships have been delivered to the United Kingdom, kicking off a long-awaited modernization of the British Army’s attack helicopter capability. The initial pair of E-models, also referred to as Apache Guardians, boasts a host of new features and will start replacement of the United Kingdom’s legacy Apache fleet. The first two AH-64Es for the British Army were transported by road to Wattisham Flying Station, Suffolk, eastern England, on November 26, 2020, after being flown to the United Kingdom onboard a Royal Air Force C-17 Globemaster III airlifter. They were accompanied by their maintainers, aviation technicians from the Army’s 7 Aviation Support Battalion, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. “The arrival of the first Apache E-model attack helicopter to be delivered to the British Army over the next two years marks the beginning of a significant uplift in capability to enhance the Army’s contribution across the spectrum of military operations,” said Major General Jez Bennett, the British Army’s Director of Capability. British serial number ZM704, one of the first two new British Army Apache AH-64Es to arrive in the United Kingdom., Crown Copyright The United Kingdom is in the process of acquiring 50 of the latest AH-64Es as part of a plan that calls for the final retirement of the legacy British Army WAH-64D Apaches , also known as Apache AH1s in U.K. service, in 2024. The British Army Apache AH1s have seen considerable combat experience, beginning with a first deployment to Camp Bastion, Helmand province, Afghanistan, in 2006. Among the most dramatic missions flown in Afghanistan was an attempted combat rescue in January 2007, when Royal Marines strapped themselves to the outside of an Apache. Although they were only able to recover the body of their fallen comrade, Lance Corporal Ford, it was a powerful demonstration of the Apache’s versatility under fire. A British Army Air Corps Apache AH1 landing at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan., Crown Copyright The last British Apache unit to deploy to Afghanistan flew top cover for the final withdrawal of British troops from Camp Bastion in October 2014. In the meantime, the British Army Apaches also went to war in Libya in 2011, as part of the NATO-led coalition. In May 2017, the United Kingdom placed a $488.1-million Foreign Military Sales (FMS) order with Boeing, a modification of an existing deal, to remanufacture 38 Apache AH1s to AH-64E standard as part of a wider Lot 7-11 production run, as well as to procure three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares. This work was scheduled to be completed at the Boeing plant in Mesa, Arizona, by May 31, 2024. Although there were rumors they might be dropped as a cost-saving measure, the remaining final 12 AH-64Es for the United Kingdom were eventually covered by a separate $565.5-million contract issued in December 2019, another modification of an existing FMS award, which included the rework of a total of 47 aircraft, including others for the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates. The estimated completion date for this work is March 1, 2025. By mid-2019, 16 Apache AH1s had been delivered to Mesa for the AH-64E remanufacture program and the first British E-model was flown from Mesa, Arizona, to the US Army facility at Redstone Army Airfield, Alabama, to begin testing, last summer. The British Army AH-64Es will be in the Version 6 configuration, which the service describes as the “most advanced variant of Apache,” and is one that The War Zone has examined in detail in the past . It’s unclear, as yet, if the AH-64Es will receive the British military designation Apache AH2, although some sources have reported this is the plan . A schematic diagram of the AH-64 components that have received an upgrade under Version 6. , US ARMY VIA @MIL_STD Version 6 offers notable advantages over the initial blocks of AH-64Es and its emphasis on over-water combat is something that the British Army will likely have paid particular attention to. Among official plans for the future air wings of the Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers is a so-called Littoral Manoeuvre setup that combines Apaches with a variety of assault transport and support helicopters. Since it’s also planned for the air wings to be tailored for combinations of Carrier Strike and Littoral Manoeuvre capabilities if required, it’s also possible that the new Apaches will eventually go to sea alongside the F-35B Lightning jet fighter, to provide a two-pronged offensive-oriented air complement. The latest avionics in the Version 6 include a fire-control radar with extended range, thought to be around 10 miles, around double that of the previous Longbow . The radar also has a new maritime mode, which will be critical for littoral missions, including from the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. In the Libyan campaign in 2011, British Army Apache AH1s also flew from the deck of a warship, launching missions from the amphibious assault ship HMS Ocean and engaging regime targets on 39 occasions during its first month of combat in Libya. A British Army Air Corps Apache AH1 takes off from HMS Ocean during Operation Ellamy, the UK’s contribution to the Libyan campaign in 2011., Crown Copyright Compared to the British Army’s WAH-64Ds, meanwhile, the basic AH-64E already offered significant benefits, including both performance and avionics advantages over the D-model, of which the 67th and final example was handed over to the British Army in 2004. Under a rolling program of updates, the E-model already offered Link 16 data links , Mode 5 identification friend or foe, new communication and communication relay systems, and the ability to operate as a manned-unmanned team with drones. It’s unclear exactly what degree of interaction with drones the British Army AH-64E will be capable of, initially at least, with an official press release stating only that “Link 16, Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and, in time, manned-unmanned teaming [will] bring theatre entry-standard equipment fits and vastly increase crew battle-space awareness.” Aircraft performance improvements in the E-model are secured through the use of new engines , drivetrain, and main rotor blades. One of the first two new British Army Apache AH-64Es inside an RAF C-17 at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, after flying in from Kansas City., Crown Copyright An AH-64E is offloaded from a C-17, with its main rotor blades visible in the foreground., Crown Copyright The ability to carry external fuel tanks to extend the helicopter’s range was introduced in the AH-64E too, but it’s notable that this is something that the British Army had already added to its WAH-64Ds as a unique local modification. The addition of 125-gallon external tanks carried on the inboard stores pylons increased the gunship’s endurance by around 90 minutes. Despite the advances inherent in the AH-64E, all of which have been allocated new British military serial numbers, there remains some commonality between the WAH-64D and the new British Army AH-64E. The program makes valuable cost savings in that it reuses many important components from the original Apache AH1s. These are harvested from the old helicopters and then combined with new airframes, engines, rotor blades, and avionics. Parts that are recycled in this way include the mast-mounted assembly for the fire-control radar, Lockheed Martin’s Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor ( M-TADS/PNVS ), the main rotor hub and other transmission elements, plus some structural elements. The nose-mounted M-TADS/PNVS is among the components on the AH-64E that have been reused from earlier Apache AH1s., Crown Copyright The resulting aircraft will offer commonality with U.S. Army and other allied AH-64E fleets and the British Army anticipates the aircraft will be easier to maintain and more reliable, “so that it will be more straightforward to sustain in any operational environment.” Aircraft availability will be aided by embedded system-level diagnostics to alert maintainers to potential technical problems. The British Army won’t actually start flying its new attack helicopter in the United Kingdom until July 2021. In the meantime, it will have to be determined that the AH-64E is fully safe to operate and meets all the airworthiness requirements. The helicopter’s documentation, simulators, training, and instructors all similarly require local certification. A series of flight trials will then commence, followed by the training of instructor pilots on the new model. Then, full-rate conversion training will be launched for 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, with the aim of achieving full operating capability alongside the Wildcat AH1 light helicopter in 2023. The British Army’s plans call for the AH-64E to operate as an Attack Reconnaissance Team (ART) with the Wildcat AH1 within 1 Aviation Brigade. The Wildcat AH1 is the battlefield reconnaissance version of the Leonardo AW159 helicopter, 34 of which are in service and which can act as airborne forward air controllers, or FACs, directing fire from fast jets, naval and field artillery, as well as attack helicopters. A British Army Air Corps door gunner poses alongside a Wildcat AH1 helicopter fitted with a 50-caliber Browning M3M machine gun., Crown Copyright Co-operative exercises involving Apache AH1s and Wildcat AH1s have included 2018 maneuvers at Aberporth, Wales, in which a Wildcat laser-designated a target for a pair of Apaches, which then engaged it using two Hellfire missiles and without using their own laser designators, helping prove the ART concept. A year later, five Apache AH1s deployed to the Baltic region for a three-month period as part of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence, or eFP, in the region. Here, they operated together with four Wildcat AH1s from Ämari Air Base, including participation in Estonia’s annual Exercise Spring Storm maneuvers. A British Army Wildcat AH1 and an Apache AH1 at Ämari Air Base in Estonia., Crown Copyright As well as working alongside the Wildcat AH1, the British Army has suggested a future role for the AH-64E teamed with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). “From supporting hostage rescue missions to countering an adversaries’ anti-access, area-denial platforms, the Apache E outstrips the outgoing Mark 1 aircraft by increased platform digitalization, improved weapons and avionics, and the ability to use the latest and future technology to enable teaming with semi-autonomous systems such as UASs,” said Brigadier Paul Tedman, Commander 1 Aviation Brigade. The reference to manned-unmanned teaming, which is a key part of the overall Version 6 package, suggests the British Army Version 6 AH-64E may be fitted with, or have provision for, the U.S. Army’s Manned-Unmanned Teaming-Extended (MUMT-X) system, which increases the range at which the helicopter can share data with drones. The United Kingdom is increasingly looking to expand its UAS capabilities, including swarming drones . Recent trials conducted by Leonardo may also provide an indication of the types of UAS that the British Army’s AH-64E may be adapted to work with in the future. The British AH-64Es could also harness their manned-unmanned teaming ability to cooperate with the Royal Air Force’s forthcoming Protector drones , essentially mimicking the way that U.S. Army Apaches and MQ-1C Gray Eagles work together . Following engineering acceptance and crew training, the new AH-64E seen here will replace the battle-proven Apache AH1, which reaches its out of service date in 2024., Crown Copyright While smaller in number than the Apache AH1 fleet, the AH-64E will also benefit from changes to the British Army Air Corps force structure, which is now tailored for rapid deployment to support the army’s reaction force and high-readiness brigades, for example sending deployments to the Baltics, or elsewhere, at short notice. With the promise of improved performance and capabilities, including cooperative missions with other manned and unmanned aircraft, the British Army’s frontline units will no doubt be eager to get their hands on the newly arrived E-model Apache, and it will be interesting to see how the gunship’s maritime attributes are melded into the future carrier air wings.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 1, 2020",Everything We Know So Far About The Assassination Of ‘The Father Of Iran’s Nuclear Bomb’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A top Iranian nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who has been described in the past as the “ father of Iran’s nuclear bomb ,” was assassinated today, reportedly by Israel’s top intelligence agency Mossad, in a complex attack on the car he was traveling in. This follows reports that President Donald Trump’s Administration has been considering striking facilities related to Iran’s controversial nuclear program before President-Elect Joe Biden takes office next year. The Biden camp has expressed interest in rejoining a multi-national agreement regarding nuclear activities, which is controversial in its own right and that Trump had withdrawn from in 2018. The attack that killed Fakhrizadeh took place in the city of Absard, situated less than 50 miles east of the country’s capital Tehran. The exact chain of events is not entirely clear, but a report from the semi-official Far News Agency, linked to Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), said witnesses had reported hearing an explosion followed by a burst of gunfire. Videos and photos that have now emerged on social media show a black Nissan, which appears to be the vehicle Fakhrizadeh was traveling in, riddled with bullet holes and with a pool of blood on the ground near the car. Other images show the hulk of another vehicle that appears to have been hit with an explosion, as was initially heard, and this looks to be how the ambushers brought the Nissan to a stop before shooting at it. It’s not clear if the car that got blown up was a vehicle-based improvised explosive device or if the apparent bomb had been placed along the side of the road. Fars reported that three to four people had died in the attack, including the perpetrators, but it has been difficult to independently verify who died or the total body count. It’s also unclear if Fars included Fakhrizadeh, who appears to have succumbed to his wounds sometime after the attack, or any other subsequent fatalities, in its figures. This also explains conflicting initial reports that the nuclear scientist was still alive. Iranian authorities have since confirmed via state media that he is, in fact, dead. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. To say that Fakhrizadeh’s death is significant, both from a practical and a symbolic perspective, would be an understatement. U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have put him at the top of Iranian nuclear efforts tied to the development of an atomic bomb that first began in 1989. He is said to have run Project Amad , the country’s overarching nuclear weapons program, which officially came to a halt in 2003. Since then, Fakhrizadeh, who was also an IRGC officer, has been in charge of a number of other nuclear research and development efforts that Iran has claimed are ostensibly oriented toward peaceful, civilian applications. The U.S. and Israeli governments have asserted that these programs are dual-use and serve as a cover for continued nuclear weapons development. Most recently, Fakhrizadeh was said to be head of the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, also known by its Farsi acronym SPND, which the United States had sanctioned over ties to nuclear weapons work. In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu focused significant attention on him in a 2018 public presentation of a literal warehouse-load of nuclear-related documents that Israeli intelligence operatives had then recently extracted from Iran. The United Nation’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said after Netanyahu’s press briefing that it has seen no evidence that Iran continued work on nuclear weapons after 2009, six years after the official end of Project Amad. At the same time, IAEA reports on the matter catalog multiple instances where the Iranian government denied the existence of nuclear activities that it then either admitted to or were otherwise conclusively proven to have taken place. The Iranian government has also often denied the IAEA access to certain sites and individuals, including a facility with reported ties to nuclear work in Parchin, which U.N. investigators only visited for the first time in 2015. Evidence obtained during that inspection included particles of uranium, which the IAEA said were of negligible significance, but which President Barack Obama’s Administration reportedly determined pointed to past atomic work at that site. It remains unclear when any such activity at Parchin might have taken place. The New York Times has reported that the Israeli intelligence Agency Mossad was behind Fakhrizadeh’s killing. It’s important to remember that Mossad is also linked to four successful assassinations and one attempted assassination of other Iranian nuclear scientists between 2010 and 2012. Two of these killings involved bombs attached to the victim’s car via magnets, while another involved a bomb attached to a nearby motorbike. A third was carried out by gun-wielding assassins on a motorcycle. Mossad may have also killed another nuclear scientist in 2007. Iran claimed to have thwarted another assassination attempt on a nuclear scientist in 2015, but did not identify that individual who had been targeted or any other details about the plot. Iran’s nuclear program was also notoriously hit by the Stuxnet computer virus , a reported joint U.S.-Israeli operation, in 2010. It’s also worth noting that Mossad was tied to a reported assassination of a senior Al Qaeda terrorist, Abu Muhammad Al Masri, in Iran in August. Al Masri, alleged to be one of those responsible for planning the attacks on U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, was reportedly living in the country under an assumed identity provided by the Iranian government, which was protecting him, but also appears to have been keeping him effectively detained as leverage over the international terrorist group. There were also a string of mysterious explosions and fires at various sites in Iran earlier this year, including a blast at a facility containing advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges in Natanz. There were subsequent reports that at least some of these incidents had been attacks carries out by Israeli operatives , possibly with the assistance of American intelligence agencies . Separate from its nuclear program, Iran, as well as its proxy groups in the Middle East, have been the target of multiple other assassinations and other operations, many linked to Israel , in recent years. The most notable of these was the U.S. drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani , then head of the IRGC’s Quds Force, its primary arm for conducting activities outside of Iran, outside Baghdad International Airport in Iraq in January. Killing Fakhrizadeh would certainly remove one of Iran’s most seasoned nuclear experts from any ongoing nuclear weapons work, though the country’s nuclear program is much bigger at this point than any one person. It would also send a message that even the most senior nuclear and other officials in the country are not safe from attack. There are also concerns now that the Fakhrizadeh’s death may have an impact on future negotiations between the incoming Biden Administration and Iranian officials over the U.S. government’s possible return to the so-called Iran Deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which representatives of the United States, as well as China, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, had signed in 2015. Iran has steadily rolled back its compliance with the JCPOA since the Trump Administration withdrew from the deal in 2018, including the restarting of uranium enrichment above previously agreed levels. The U.S. government under Trump has continually sought for the remaining participants, especially its European allies, to drop out of the deal, as well. If Israel was indeed behind to assassination, as seems very possible, if not plausible, it could also simply reflect the desire of the current Israeli government to conduct these kinds of covert operations now, while the United States is more likely to acquiesce to them being carried out, or even support them, directly or indirectly. The Trump Administration has been a particularly vocal supporter of Israel and has taken a very hard-line approach to Iran, which seems very likely to change in many ways after Joe Biden takes office. The assassination also comes just days after a report from Axios that said Israeli officials were worried about the potential of a U.S. strike of some kind against Iran’s nuclear program before Biden takes office next year. The New York Times had reported earlier in November that Trump had at least recently inquired about the possibility of launching a military strike on Natanz. On Nov. 21, two U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers, using the callsigns Warbird 1 and Warbird 2, flew a long-range, round-trip mission to the Middle East and back from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, in what looked to be a signal aimed squarely at Iran. For their part, the IRGC has already threatened to retaliate in some fashion against whoever is behind this assassination. “In the last days of the political life of their … ally [understood to mean President Trump’s Administration], the Zionists [Israel] seek to intensify pressure on Iran and create a full-blown war,” Commander Hossein Dehghan, an advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and a former Minister of Defense and IRGC office, Tweeted out following Fakhrizadeh’s death. All told, the killing of the Father of Iran’s nuclear bomb could have serious ramifications well beyond the country’s nuclear ambitions. More such attacks, or other kinds of covert operations, may well be yet to come in the eight or so weeks between now and Biden’s inauguration.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2020",This Soviet Twin-Rotor Helicopter Design Was A High-Speed Rival To The Mi-24 Hind,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The V-50 helicopter, on which the Soviet design bureau Kamov began work in the late 1960s, was a radical concept for a multirole combat helicopter that was ambitiously pitched to both the army and the navy. With tandem twin rotors, gunship-style cockpits, and modular weapons options, the V-50 was designed to swoop into battle at speeds far in excess of most of its rotorcraft contemporaries. Helicopters had only really emerged as trusted weapons of war during the 1950s, before coming of age during the U.S. conflict in Southeast Asia and, in parallel, in French hands in that country’s campaigns in North Africa. For much of the Cold War, rotorcraft development, with a few exceptions, tended to be fairly conservative, with designers sticking to proven concepts and creating enduring families of interrelated types, like the U.S. military’s iconic Bell H-1 Huey and Sikorsky H-53 series. In the Soviet Union, meanwhile, this rotary-wing conservatism expressed itself in a long line of fairly conventional, albeit increasingly larger and more capable, transport helicopters for the ground forces from the Mil design bureau. Meanwhile, Kamov developed a family of more compact types tailored for the Soviet Navy, with coaxial contra-rotating rotors that helped reduce their “footprint” on the flight decks of smaller warships. An official company model of the proposed V-50, in Soviet Navy markings. , PIOTR BUTOWSKI Kamov, however, also proposed a very different and far more radical helicopter design, the V-50, as a “universal helicopter” that would be able to serve both the ground forces and the navy and that was expected to reach a speed of almost 250 miles per hour. In contrast, the now-iconic Mi-8 Hip , which was then entering service as a standard assault transport for the Soviet Army, had a maximum speed of 155 miles per hour. Meanwhile, in the United States, manufacturers were also looking at ways of increasing the speed of military rotorcraft, leading to the remarkable Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne , a gunship that adopted a compound design, with conventional main and tail rotors backed up by a pusher propeller in the tail. Despite problems that eventually led to the cancelation of the production contract in 1969, the Cheyenne demonstrated a speed of 247 miles per hour in level flight, putting it very much in the same performance bracket as the planned V-50. The Sikorsky-Boeing SB>1 , a new compound coaxial helicopter design first flown in early 2019, is planned to achieve 290 miles per hour but hasn’t hit that speed yet. The idea of a common airframe for both land-based and maritime applications was novel, too, since, up until this point, most helicopters had been developed to fulfill the requirements of either the army or the navy, since the operating conditions, mission spectrum, avionics, and weaponry for these services were so different. With the V-50 design, however, Kamov sought to overcome this challenge, with an airframe that could be adapted for roles as diverse as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), reconnaissance, or anti-tank operations. In another example of forward-thinking, equipment would be provided in modular packages for each specific mission. For the assault role, the eight paratroops could embark and disembark via twin doors in the fuselage side. , PIOTR BUTOWSKI Significantly, Kamov also broke with its in-house tradition of coaxial contra-rotating rotors, the technology for which had been developed by Nikolay Kamov himself soon after the end of World War II. Instead, the V-50 design utilized a pair of tandem rotors, arranged like those of the American CH-47 Chinook, among other contemporary designs, aligned with a very narrow fuselage. The tandem twin rotors were almost certainly the brainchild of Igor Erlikh, who led the design team and who, in the late 1950s, had designed the Yakovlev Yak-24 Horse , the first mass-produced Soviet helicopter to adopt a tandem-rotor arrangement. Meanwhile, the V-50’s narrow fuselage was intended to ensure the V-50 would reach its planned high operating speeds. A preserved example of the Yakovlev Yak-24 Horse at Monino, outside Moscow., Alan Wilson/Wikimedia Commons The chosen powerplant was a pair of the new Isotov TV3-117 turboshafts, which were also selected for the Mi-24 Hind assault helicopter that was first flown in prototype form in September 1969. These engines were rated at 1,900 shaft horsepower at takeoff and were later also used to re-engine the Mi-8/17. Kamov’s helicopter design was to be flown by two pilots seated in tandem, below separate glazed canopies. In a land-based assault role, the V-50’s narrow fuselage could accommodate eight paratroops, while offensive armament would be carried on external hardpoints under long stub wings attached to the forward fuselage. The anti-armor missiles proposed for the land-based version would have been replaced with anti-ship missiles, or other naval weapons, on the maritime V-50. While the ground-based version had provision for a gun turret under the nose, this was switched for a search radar in the naval equivalent. A close-up of the anti-tank guided missile armament. , PIOTR BUTOWSKI There is no record of what type of missiles the production V-50 might have carried, but available official models of the design suggest it would have been fitted, initially at least, with four 9M17M Falanga-M manually controlled anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), known to NATO as the AT-2 Swatter . These first-generation air-launched ATGMs were replaced in the early 1970s by the 9M17P Falanga-P, which introduced a much more effective semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) guidance technique. The V-50 project continued until a fairly advanced stage, including wind-tunnel tests, but the Soviet Army ultimately decided not to order it, since they considered the Mi-24 would fulfill their requirements for an assault-transport helicopter. As it turned out, the Hind would actually require a complete overhaul before it was a genuinely satisfactory aircraft and, in the process, it would lose its original “greenhouse” cockpit glazing for the stepped-tandem seating arrangement that was chosen for the V-50 and almost every other assault helicopter/gunship. The original Mi-24 Hind configuration, with the angular “greenhouse”-style cockpit seating the flight crew and, optionally, a technician. , Riyaah/Wikimedia Commons With the Soviet Army unconvinced by the V-50, the idea of a modular helicopter to serve the requirements of both ground and naval forces evaporated. The Soviet Navy also decided to follow a more conservative path for its new ship-based ASW and search and rescue rotorcraft. It opted for the Ka-27 Helix , which was externally very similar to its Ka-25 Hormone predecessor, albeit with the new TV3-117 engines that had been pitched for the V-50. The potential of the V-50 had, however, alerted the Soviet Navy’s attention to the idea of a maritime assault helicopter, a class of rotorcraft to which it had not previously devoted much attention. It would be several more years, however, until the navy actually put these plans into action and developed the Ka-29 assault helicopter on the basis of the Ka-27. Overall, this was far less ambitious than the V-50, essentially being a minimum-change version of the Helix with a crew cabin and armament. Series production of the Ka-29 was only launched in 1984. A Russian Navy Ka-29 assault helicopter., Dmitry Ryazanov/Wikimedia Commons Ultimately, in the absence of a production V-50 “universal helicopter,” the Mi-24 and Ka-27 were destined to continue as the mainstays of the Soviet Union’s army aviation and ship-based helicopter fleets, respectively, until the end of the Cold War in 1991. In its final configuration, with stepped tandem cockpits, heavy armament carried on stub wings, and a cabin with accommodation for a squad of soldiers, the Hind ultimately shared some broad design similarities with the V-50 concept, and its success as a troop-transporting gunship means that it remains in production today. An upgraded Russian Aerospace Forces Mi-24PN helicopter., Igor Dvurekov/Wikimedia Commons As it was, Kamov would have to wait a while longer to finally achieve success with a combat helicopter for the ground forces. This was the Ka-52 Hokum , for which the company stuck with its tried and tested coaxial contra-rotating rotors, combined with an unorthodox side-by-side crew seating arrangement. The Ka-52’s path to frontline service was protracted, however, and although the helicopter first flew in 1982, the program was interrupted by the demise of the Soviet Union, and it didn’t begin to be operationally fielded by the Russian Air Force until 2011. Today, the development of high-speed, multirole military helicopters is also very much on the agenda in the United States and elsewhere, with major programs including Future Vertical Lift that promises to provide the U.S. military with a family of future rotorcraft to replace its entire fleet of legacy types. In Europe, Russia , and likely in China, too, armed forces are also starting to look at future helicopter designs that stress speed and versatility, and potentially harness exotic propulsion concepts. With an eye once again on high-speed rotary-wing flight, Russia’s Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, also known by its Russian acronym TsAGI, has recently been looking at different concepts for a compound helicopter, apparently intended for rescue and light utility roles in the Arctic region, which you can read more about here . PIOTR BUTOWSKI While today’s Ka-52 may be a suitable successor to the stillborn V-50 in the gunship role, we will never know whether Kamov’s radical tandem-rotor concept from the late 1960s would have fulfilled its promise had the program continued.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 24, 2019",Taiwan Is Finally Set To Build The New Diesel-Electric Submarines It Desperately Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan has moved one important step closer to building its first indigenous submarines, with the opening of a shipyard intended to construct this new class of boats to help overhaul the Republic of China Navy’s existing, aging fleet. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony, declaring that the program “demonstrates Taiwan’s strong will to the world to protect its sovereignty.” The inauguration of the submarine-focused shipyard in Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan on November 24, 2020 , sets in motion plans to construct eight new diesel-electric submarines under the Taiwan National Non-Nuclear Submarine Design and Construction Program, which is being run by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) with technical assistance from the United States. The first of these boats is expected to enter service by 2025 and all eight will be built by Taiwan’s China Shipbuilding Corporation (CSBC). “Submarines are important equipment for the development of Taiwan’s navy’s asymmetric warfare capabilities and to deter enemy ships from encircling Taiwan,” said President Tsai at yesterday’s ceremony. As well as making a strong signal to Beijing about Taiwan’s ability to defend itself, the submarine-building project also serves to boost the island’s defense self-sufficiency. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen gives the thumbs-up at the opening of the new submarine-focused shipyard in Kaohsiung., Ministry of National Defense, ROC Compared to the rapidly expanding People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which operates a large submarine fleet with increasingly modern and capable types, and that has recently been notably active in the Taiwan Strait, the underwater fleet of the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is currently decidedly outmatched. Taiwan’s submarine fleet today includes just two Chien Lung class submarines and two Hai Shih class submarines based at Tsoying Naval Base in Kaohsiung. A floating drydock in Kaohsiung Harbor, where the Taiwanese submarine-construction program will soon get underway. , CEphoto, Uwe Aranas/Wikimedia Commons The Hai Lung class diesel-electric attack submarines were built in the Netherlands in the mid-1980s. A modified version of the Dutch Zwaardvis class design, they are 219 feet long, can travel at a reported speed of 20 knots, and can carry up to 28 torpedoes. A mid-life upgrade for the Hai Lung class was launched in 2016 with the aim of keeping these boats in service for another 15 years. It’s worth noting that the Dutch Navy retired its Zwaardvis class boats in the mid-1990s. Taiwanese sailors salute aboard the Hai Lung class submarine Hai Hu , commissioned into ROCN service in 1988., AP/Chiang Ying-ying Even older than the Hai Lung class submarines are the Hai Shih class boats, comprising Hai Shih , built as a Tench class submarine, and Hai Pao , originally completed as a Balao class submarine. Both of these underwater veterans were constructed during World War II and transferred to Taiwan from U.S. Navy stocks in 1973 and 1974, respectively. With a speed of just 15 knots when submerged, the two Hai Shih class submarines are hardly adequate for modern warfare and are reportedly used mainly for training. The boats are apparently no longer capable of diving below 328 feet and there have been reports of warped pressure hulls and metal fatigue. For some years there have been calls to withdraw these submarines, which in most other circumstances would have become museum pieces by now, from service entirely. Hai Shih is the former USS Cutlass , a Tench class submarine that was originally launched in November 1944 and which still serves the ROCN today., CPJ2028/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS At the ceremony marking the opening of the new shipyard in Kaohsiung, CSBC chairman Cheng Wen Lung noted that Taiwan’s new submarine development program had faced considerable difficulties to get to this point, reflecting on “external forces hindering the development of this program.” This included repeated failures to secure foreign submarine technology in the face of opposition from Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must eventually be reunited. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration had refused outright to sell submarines to Taiwan, since they were considered offensive weapons and therefore outside the scope of the arms sales to the island that were permitted under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Instead, Taiwan had also considered building submarines on the basis of designs acquired from either Argentina or Norway, but ultimately didn’t follow through on either of these options. In 2001, President George W. Bush authorized the sale of a major arms package to Taiwan, which included eight diesel-electric submarines, as the United States revised its stance on arms transfers in the face of what it saw as an increasingly belligerent government in Beijing. However, since the U.S. Navy’s last conventional submarine had been completed the better part of a century ago, the eight subs for Taiwan would have to have been of a foreign design, built under license, with Germany or the Netherlands being seen as the most likely sources. Both those European governments refused to provide submarines, or their plans, to Taiwan. The Dutch stated that they would no longer supply arms to either Taiwan or the government on the mainland, while the German stance was based on the “one-China policy,” which it shared with the United States. With no diesel-electric submarines in production in the United States, the U.S.-backed plan shifted instead to securing for Taiwan surplus submarines from another operator. Although Italy agreed to sell eight Sauro class boats in 2003, with plans to refurbish them before delivery, Taiwan rejected the offer, demanding new-build boats. Now retired as a museum boat, the Nazario Sauro is one of the class of eight Sauro submarines that Italy offered to Taiwan in 2003., gaetano56/Wikimedia Commons As of 2004, the U.S. proposed constructing a new class of diesel-electric submarines for Taiwan at the Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi, most likely again using foreign plans, but this plan fell through, as well. The ROCN was left to soldier on with its existing four boats. In the meantime, the issue of new submarines increasingly became a political football in Taiwan, as different government agencies argued over whether the future vessels should be brought from a foreign country or manufactured locally. In 2005, the country’s Industrial Development Bureau director, Chen Chao Yi, said that Taiwan was “almost able to build submarines without large-scale investment in its shipbuilding equipment.” The same official admitted, however, that the United States would still be required to provide “submarine blueprints and submarine weapons systems.” Finally, by 2014, Taiwan decided to launch its indigenous submarine production program, with a view to having the first of eight examples in ROCN service by 2025. In 2017, President Tsai oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the construction of the submarines. “Under the strategic concept of effective and multi-layered deterrence, subsurface combat ability is what Taiwan’s defense is most in need of strengthening,” Tsai said on that occasion. “This is a problem that everyone is aware of but which in the past we were never able to resolve.” The major breakthrough in Taiwan’s plans to build submarines itself seems to have been the 2018 decision by the U.S. State Department to license the related technology for the island, which apparently included the boats’ combat management systems, as well as other technical assistance, but there have been no details as yet of which U.S. companies are involved. Taiwan’s submarine-building program will also draw upon experience gained with the Dutch-built Hai Lung class, plans for which have been studied thoroughly by the ROCN. However, other foreign know-how will likely be required, too. In particular, it’s been reported that Taiwan requires assistance in manufacturing pressure-resistant hulls. Not surprisingly, models of the new domestic submarines show clear influences from the Dutch Hai Lung class. However, details about the planned features for Taiwan’s new boats remain limited and it’s unclear if they will include advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems , which would greatly increase the time they can stay submerged and make them harder to detect. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen checks out the future submarine model., AP/Chiang Ying-ying Even with a force of eight boats, plus the upgraded Hai Lung class, the ROCN submarine fleet would still be dramatically outnumbered by the PLAN’s submarine force. However, modern conventionally powered submarines have repeatedly proven their worth in multinational exercises, and there’s no doubt that a well-trained force of boats, even if it’s small, could have a disproportionate value in a conflict scenario, helping create a defensive buffer zone in the Taiwan Strait . A beefed-up submarine force would reinforce Taiwan’s defenses that are optimized toward protecting the island from PLAN warships and amphibious assault, and which, in the future, may also include plentiful Harpoon anti-ship missiles combined with the ROCN’s stealthy mine-laying catamarans . The very presence of the submarines would also potentially have a deterrent effect on the PLAN, which has traditionally lagged behind in anti-submarine warfare capabilities, although this is now changing, too. Few submarine forces anywhere in the world are in quite as drastic a need of modernization as that of Taiwan, and the opening of the country’s submarine-production facility is the next meaningful step on the path towards the ROCN’s long-awaited new subs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 7, 2021",Oil Tanker In Red Sea Struck In Mine Attack With Similarities To Past Iranian Strikes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Maltese-flagged oil tanker was the victim of an attack in the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia earlier today. The damage was attributed to a naval mine , but breached the ship’s outer hull above the waterline, which might point to a limpet mine . Limpet mines were employed in a series of attacks on tanker ships that Iran or its regional proxies carried out in the Gulf of Oman last year. So far, no group has claimed responsibility, but Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have targeted commercial ships in the Red Sea in the past. The MT Agrari , which is flagged in Malta, but operated by a Greek shipping company, TMS Tankers , came under attack early on Nov. 25, 2020, local time. Ambrey , a private maritime security company based in the United Kingdom, said that the tanker had originally set sail from Rotterdam in the Netherlands carrying an unspecified cargo, which it had unloaded at the Shuqaiq Steam Power Plant prior to the attack, according to the Associated Press . Shuqaiq is situated on Saudi Arabia’s southern Red Sea coastline around 60 miles north of the city of Jazan and less than 80 miles, at closest, from the Yemeni border. A map showing the location of the Shuqaiq Steam Power Plant, which is close to where the attack on the MT Agrari occurred in the Red Sea., Google Maps “Their vessel was attacked by an unknown source,” the Greek shipping company operating Agrari said in a statement to the Associated Press . “The Agrari was struck about 1 meter [~3.28 feet] above the waterline and has suffered a breach. It has been confirmed that the crew are safe and there have been no injuries.” “The explosion took place in port limits and punctured the hull of the vessel,” Ambrey said in its own statement, appearing to refer to the port facilities at Shuqaiq. At the time of writing, the ship was still afloat and there were no official reports of oil or anything else leaking out into the Red Sea. Satellite imagery has emerged on social media showing what could be Agrari still at Shuqaiq’s dock and indicators of a potential fluid leak of some kind. It’s worth noting that the Houthis in Yemen have employed locally-made naval mines , as well as anti-ship cruise missiles and remote-controlled unmanned suicide boats in attacks on both warships and commercial vessels in the Red Sea in the past. In 2018, Saleh Al Samad, then head of the group, had threatened the idea of “cutting off the Red Sea and international navigation” among other “strategic options” targeting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. A coalition airstrike killed Al Samad, among other Houthi leaders, that year. An infographic that the US military previously released showing an Iranian-made explosive-laden unmanned suicide boat supplied to the Houthis in Yemen., DOD Just yesterday, the coalition fighting the Houthis issued a statement that it had neutralized five Iranian-made mines in the southern Red Sea, blaming the attempted attacks on the Yemeni rebel group and decrying it as “a serious threat to maritime security in the Bab Al Mandab strait.” The Bab Al Mandab Strait links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and is a highly strategic passageway for oil tankers and other commercial shipping. There has been a growing threat posed by naval mines in the area, which we detailed some time ago . However, the detail about the reported mine causing damage to the ship above the waterline is interesting. Typical naval mines detonate at or below the waterline, which, as noted, could indicate that a limpet mine was employed in this attack. Limpet mines are manually emplaced on a target, typically using large magnets. Limpet mines of apparent Iranian origin were used in a series of attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman in 2019. The United States subsequently accused Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of carrying out those attacks. It is possible that Iranian proxies in the region, such as the Houthis, with support from the IRGC, may have also been responsible. An annotated image the US Navy released in 2019 showing damage to the oil tanker M/V Kokuka above the waterline from a likely limpet mine attack, as well as what a second apparent mine that failed to detonate. , USN Damage above the waterline could also potentially be the result of an attack using some kind of projectile, such as an anti-ship missile. At high speed, the bow of an unmanned suicide boat may rise out of the water, leading to damage to the target ship above the waterline, as well. However, these possibilities seem to be less likely given Ambrey’s report on the incident. It’s also worth noting that the M/V Saviz , a cargo ship, is seen in the video below. The vessel is tied directly to the IRGC. Saudi Arabia, among others, has accused Iran of using this ship to support smuggling and other activities in support of the Houthis and it has operated in the southern Red Sea in the past in the same general area where the attack on Agrari took place. That vessel could potentially serve as a mothership for teams tasked with deploying naval mines or attaching limpet mines directly to other ships. All of this comes just days after the Houthis targeted a facility belonging to the Saudi Aramco oil company in Jeddah, another city on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast further to the north of the Shuqaiq Steam Power Plant. The Yemeni rebels claimed that the strike involved a previously unknown ground-launched cruise missile, potentially related to an earlier Iranian-supplied design . The Houthis have been launching various kinds of cruise and ballistic missiles , as well as unmanned “ suicide drones ” at targets in Saudi Arabia for years now. At the same time, Saudi Arabia’s monarchy appears to be finding itself under increasing pressure from President Donald Trump’s Administration in the United States to normalize relations with Israel. The country’s foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, has denied that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman secretly met with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , as well as Yossi Cohen, the director of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, in the Red Sea coastal resort town of Neom, much further to the north, over the weekend. The Crown Prince, also referred to simply as MBS, did meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Neom. This is part of a larger U.S. government push that has already seen the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain sign their own deals with Israel and that is also aimed, in no small part, at further isolating Iran. Attacking ships in and around the Bab Al Mandab Strait would certainly be one way for the regime in Tehran, either directly or via proxies, such as the Houthis, to apply its own pressure in response. If nothing else, the attack on Agrari underscores that the very real threats to commercial shipping in the Red Sea that the Houthis and their Iranian partners pose and how both parties might further escalate things if they feel sufficiently pushed to action by other geopolitical developments in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 8, 2020",This Is Our First Look At A B-1 Bomber Carrying A Stealthy Cruise Missile Externally,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released images of a B-1 bomber carrying an inert AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile cruise missile on a pylon under its fuselage for the first time. This was part of a demonstration program that the service hopes will lead to these aircraft being certified to carry up to 12 JASSMs, or AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile derivatives, externally, in addition to 24 more of either of those weapons in its internal bomb bays . The Air Force has also said in the past that it looking at integrating hypersonic weapons onto the B-1 in the future using external pylons. A B-1 assigned to the 419th Flight Test Squadron, part of the 412th Test Wing that serves as the Global Power Combined Test Force, conducted the demonstration flight over Edwards Air Force Base on Nov. 20, 2020. The inert, captive carry variant of the AGM-158 was attached to the aircraft using an external pylon that typically carries an AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod . This pylon is attached to one of six external hardpoints that the aircraft has and that were initially intended to be used to carry special launch racks, each of which could hold two nuclear-tipped AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM). After the Cold War, the Air Force stripped all of the B-1s of their nuclear weapons delivery capability and bombers stopped using the external hardpoints. An “extensive engineering review will help the Air Force understand areas where we need to focus in order to maintain the B-1B as a multi-mission weapon system, potentially laying the groundwork for integration of future weapons on the aircraft,” Air Force Major William Russell, a spokesperson for Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees the service’s bomber fleets, among other assets, told The War Zone . “Following the captive carry mission, engineers will review the data gathered from the flight before moving on to the next phase of the demonstration, an external weapons release.” USAF The 419th Flight Test Squadron carrying an inert AGM-158 JASSM during the recent demonstration flight., USAF USAF USAF “This was a combined AFLCMC [Air Force Life Cycle Management Center] and Boeing corporation effort to demonstrate the B-1s ability to safely release an externally mounted AGM-158 weapon,” Russell added. “No major modifications were needed.” The Air Force had previously shown a B-1 carrying an inert AGM-158 on this pylon at an invite-only gathering last year. The service had also shown how it could reconfigure the aircraft’s internal bomb bays to accommodate larger and longer missiles, including future hypersonic types, at that event. Air Force personnel and industry representatives stand in front of a B-1 bomber with an inert AGM-158 JASSM missile loaded on an external pylon at a gathering in September 2019., USAF “Since the long bay demo last year this has really been our key focus point in 2020; getting ready for this external weapons release demo as kind of the next step in that progression towards external weapons carriage and hypersonic capabilities for the B-1,” Air Force Major Bret Cunningham, a B-1B test pilot with the 419th Flight Test Squadron, said in a subsequent official news item on the demonstration flight. “We’re pretty close to the culmination of this demo event and reaching that next milestone.” “For us, we’re looking to do this safely, since this is the first time we will release a weapon from the external hard point in over 30 years,” Agustin Martinez, the project test lead, added. “So we pretty much focused on doing a safe build up approach…to make sure the JASSM and the B-1 are communicating correctly; the JASSM has correct surface deployment timelines so once it does get released it will safely separate.” It’s worth noting that the B-1s can already carry AGM-158A JASSMs and AGM-158B JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) missiles, as well as the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) derivative, internally. Some of these bombers notably fired JASSMs in anger during the U.S.-led missile barrage against chemical weapons-related sites in Syria in 2018. JASSMs or JASSM-ERs in the bomb bay of a B-1 bomber at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam., USAF The Air Force is now in the process of developing an “extreme range” version of the JASSM, or JASSM-XR , also known as the AGM-158D, with B-1s being among the likely future launch platforms. The Air Force, as well as Boeing, has also made clear that it sees these bombers as potential launch platforms for hypersonic weapons in the coming years, as well. “Adapting a small number of our healthiest B-1s to carry hypersonic weapons is vital to bridge between the bomber force we have today, to the force of tomorrow,” Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of AFGSC, said in a statement. “This is a major step forward in our global precision fires capability and it is important we pursue these technologies to remain ahead of our competitors. My goal is to have a limited number of B-1s modified to become the roving linebacker of the western Pacific and the North Atlantic.” Boeing artwork showing a B-1 bomber carrying high-speed air-breathing cruise missiles on external pylons and in one of its bomb bays., Boeing Major Russell, the AFGSC spokesperson, had made clear to The War Zone that this demonstration program, successful or not, is not expected to have any impact on the service’s plan to retire 17 B-1 bombers by the end of the 2021 Fiscal Year, which would leave it with just 43 of these bombers assigned to combat units, as well as two set aside for test and evaluation duties. The B-1s have been a notable workhorse in America’s conflicts in recent years, especially in Iraq and Syria, the Air Force had struggled to keep the fleet healthy, as a result. The service has more recently improved the readiness rates of these aircraft, but perhaps not as much as it might like . These planes are also simply becoming older and harder to maintain and the plan remains to eventually replace them entirely with new B-21 Raider stealth bombers, starting in the mid-2020s. In the meantime, this recent demonstration flight underscores how the Air Force is working hard to ensure that its remaining B-1s will continue to be able to contribute to future combat operations, including by carrying various kinds of existing and new air-launched weapons on external pylons.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video of Russian-supplied Su-24 Fencer combat jets operating in Libya has emerged online. It was posted by the Information Office of the General Command of the Libyan Armed Forces, also known as the Libyan National Army, or LNA. U.S. Africa Command has said in the past that it believes that shadowy Russian private military contractors with direct ties to the Russian government, are flying these aircraft, which now appear to have Libyan insignias on them, as well as a small fleet of MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, on behalf of the LNA. With support from Russia, among other countries, the LNA has been engaged for years now in a civil conflict with Libya’s U.N.-backed Government of National Accord, or GNA. The clip showing the Su-24s is part of a longer video showing a live-fire exercise in the Libyan desert by the LNA’s 106th Armored Brigade. The pair of Su-24s is seen releasing infrared decoy flares as they fly low along the coastline. While the video description says that the maneuvers involved “airstrikes by warplanes,” the Fencers are not seen in the video carrying or dropping any weapons. Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunships are seen firing rockets as they accompany advancing tanks and other light vehicles. The Fencers seen in the video still wear the typical gray and white Russian Aerospace Forces colors, rather than the camouflage that was applied to six Fencers that were delivered to Libya in 1989, or those sold to Syria. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) has said that Russia supplied at least 14 combat jets in total, a mixture of Su-24s and MiG-29s, starting in May, sending them first to its Khmeimim Air Base outpost in Syria, where they had their Russian markings removed . The only markings visible on the jets in the video, seen below, appear to be Libyan ones. The Fencers appear in the footage at around the 2:10 mark in the runtime. It’s unclear how many Su-24s the LNA has operational now. AFRICOM has assessed that at least two of the MiG-29s have been lost in crashes . Satellite imagery The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs of Al Jufrah Air Base in central Libya showed two Su-24s there as of July 13. AFRICOM had previously released imagery showing a Fencer landing at this base on June 18. Another image indicated there might have been as many as four of these jets at Al Khadim Air Base in eastern Libya in late May and early June. The exact disposition of the complete fleet of Su-24s and the MiG-29s remains unclear.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A Su-24 landing at Al Jufrah Air Base., AFRICOM Exactly how, where, and when the Russian jets had arrived in Libya was initially unclear, but satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone showed that six MiG-29s and five Su-24 Fencers were at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in western Syria on May 18, 2020, just days before the same jets were spotted in Libya. In another high-resolution image of that base taken on May 25, the aircraft were gone. As already noted, AFRICOM subsequently confirmed that the jets had stopped in Khmeimim before heading to the north African country. Russian Aerospace Forces Su-24Ms, including one armed with freefall bombs, lined up at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria., AP Photos of the MiG-29s at Khmeimim had also previously emerged on social media showing at least one unmarked Fulcrum , supporting AFRICOM’s assertion that the Russian national insignia had been painted over after their arrival at that base. This was likely the case for the Su-24s, too, which now appear to have received Libyan markings sometime after they reached their final destination. As for who was flying these jets in the new LNA video, the U.S. government has consistently maintained that all of the Russian-supplied aircraft, both MiGs and Sukhois, are being operated by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Wagner is at least closely tied to Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, also commonly referred to by the Russian acronym GRU.

Reprinted by permission. The jets had first arrived in Libya at a time when the LNA, which has its main hub in Tobruk and receives support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as Russia, had seen its latest offensive against the GNA, which operates out of the country’s internationally recognized capital in Tripoli, turned into a rout . This was in no small part thanks to increasing support for the GNA from Turkey, which included deliveries of armed Bayraktar TB2 drones . TB2s had already proven themselves instrumental in protecting Turkish interests in northwestern Syria during a relatively brief skirmish with Russian-backed forces aligned with the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. More recently, TB2s, among other unmanned aircraft, were a critical factor in Azerbaijan’s defeat of Armenian and Armenian-backed forces in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region . In October, the LNA and the GNA agreed to a new ceasefire and have been conducting negotiations on a potential end to the conflict ever since. Earlier this month, both sides agreed on Dec. 24, 2021, as the date for a future national election . At the same time, while we don’t know the exact operational state of the LNA’s fleet of Russian-supplied combat jets, this new video footage shows that at least two Su-24s are still airworthy and that the group has significant other military assets that it could throw back into battle against the GNA if the current peace talks were to fail.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2021",U.S. Navy Denies Russian Warship Forced Its Destroyer Out Of Disputed Pacific Waters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says that the crew aboard the Udaloy class destroyer Admiral Vinogradov , which has been involved in at least one near-collision in recent years, threatened to use a “ramming maneuver” as it ejected the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS John S. McCain from what it claims are its territorial waters in the Peter the Great Gulf in Sea of Japan. The U.S. 7th Fleet has confirmed that the Navy ship was conducting a rare so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrol , or FONOP, to challenge Russia’s “excessive maritime claims” in the area, but denies it was forced to leave. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that the apparent altercation between Admiral Vinogradov and John S. McCain occurred at 06:17 AM Moscow time, or 03:17 AM GMT, on Nov. 24, 2020, in the Peter the Great Gulf, according to state-run media outlet TASS . This body of water extends from Russia’s border with North Korea to Cape Povorotny on the Sea of Japan in Russia’s Far East. Lying on the gulf is Vladivostok , the largest city in the region and home to the headquarters of the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet. Russian authorities claim that the American destroyer sailed across the country’s maritime border and continued for approximately two kilometers, or just under 1.25 miles, before the Russian Navy’s warship arrived to block it from proceeding any further. “The Pacific Fleet’s Admiral Vinogradov anti-submarine destroyer used an international communication channel to warn the foreign vessel that such actions were unacceptable and the violator could be forced out of the country’s territorial waters in a ramming maneuver,” the Russian Ministry of Defense’s statement said. “After the warming was issued and the Admiral Vinogradov changed its course, the USS John S. McCain destroyer returned to international waters.” The destroyer Admiral Vinogradov underway while conducting operations in the Gulf of Aden in 2009., U.S. Navy/Mass Communications Specialist 2nd Class Jason R. Zalasky The USS John S. McCain transits through Peter the Great Bay while conducting routine underway operations., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Markus Castaneda According to TASS , the Russian Ministry of Defense said the John S. McCain did not make subsequent attempts to re-enter Russia’s territorial waters, but added that the Russian Pacific Fleet’s Steregushchy class corvette Sovershenny had also been dispatched to the area. The U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet issued a swift rebuttal of the Russian claims, with spokesperson Lieutenant Joe Keiley telling The War Zone : “The Russian Federation’s statement about this mission is false. USS John S. McCain was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory. McCain conducted this FONOP [freedom of navigation operation] in accordance with international law and continued to conduct normal operations in international waters,” Keiley said. “The operation reflects our commitment to uphold freedom of navigation and lawful uses of the sea as a principle, and the United States will never bow in intimidation or be coerced into accepting illegitimate maritime claims, such as those made by the Russian Federation.” It’s worth noting that the Navy, as well as U.S. military aircraft from various branches of the U.S. military , routinely conduct FONOPs and otherwise challenge Chinese territorial claims in the Pacific, especially in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait . Activities targeting Russian claims are far less common, but there has been a notable uptick in such operations this year, including Air Force bomber sorties into the Sea of Okhotsk , which is surrounded on three sides by Russian territory. Ensign James Bateman scans the horizon utilizing the ‘big eyes’ while standing watch on the bridge wing as the USS John S. McCain conducts routine underway operations., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Markus Castaneda The 7th Fleet’s Public Affair Office subsequently published a longer statement online reiterated that the John S. McCain was asserting its navigational rights and freedoms legally in the vicinity of Peter the Great Bay and also pointed to Russia’s “excessive maritime claims” in the region. The point of contention, as far as the U.S. government is concerned, relates to maritime claims that date back to 1984, when the Soviet Union, also referred to by the acronym USSR, declared a system of “straight baselines” along its coasts, staking claims to certain bodies of water, such as the Peter the Great Bay, as “internal” to the country’s sovereign borders. The 7th Fleet’s statement goes on to explain in more detail the objection American officials have with the maritime claims regarding the Peter the Great Bay, as well as the practical measures that are undertaken to uphold international law, which you can read in full below: “This 106-nautical mile (nm) closing line is inconsistent with the rules of international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention to enclose the waters of a bay. By drawing this closing line, the U.S.S.R. attempted to claim more internal waters — and territorial sea farther from shore — than it is entitled to claim under international law. Russia has continued the U.S.S.R. claim. By conducting this operation, the United States demonstrated that these waters are not Russia’s territorial sea and that the United States does not acquiesce in Russia’s claim that Peter the Great is a ‘historic bay’ under international law.” “U.S. forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis, as they have for more than a century. They routinely operate in close coordination with like-minded allies and partners who share our commitment to uphold a free and open international order that promotes security and prosperity. All of our operations are designed to be conducted in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows — regardless of the location of excessive maritime claims and regardless of current events.” “The international law of the sea as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention provides for certain rights and freedoms and other lawful uses of the sea to all nations. The United States upholds these rights and freedoms as a matter of principle to preserve the freedom of the seas that is critical to global security, stability, and prosperity. As long as some countries continue to assert maritime claims that are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention and that purport to restrict unlawfully the rights and freedoms enjoyed by all States, the United States will continue to defend the rights and freedoms of the sea guaranteed to all.” The Navy has, so far, not specifically confirmed or denied the threatened ramming. However, it would not be the first time in recent years that an American warship has had a near-collision with one of its Russian Navy counterparts in the Pacific. In 2019, the Navy said that Admiral Vinogradov , the same ship involved in this latest incident, came dangerously close , within 50 to 100 feet, to Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chancellorsville while it was sailing in the Philippine Sea. The Navy said the crew aboard the Chancellorsville had to fully reverse the ship’s engines to avoid a serious accident. A video of that previous encounter, after which the two sides also issued competing claims about what had happened, is provided below. That near-miss was just one of a number of recent altercations between Russian and American forces around the globe. In June 2016 , for example, the Russian Navy claimed that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Gravely cut off its Neustrashimy class frigate Yaroslav Mudry in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Later, it became apparent that the Russian warship had, in fact, been trying to interfere with the activities of the Truman Carrier Strike Group. Earlier this year, the Navy revealed that a Russian Navy spy ship “aggressively approached” the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Farragut in the North Arabian Sea. One of two Project 18280 Yuriy Ivanov class spy ships reportedly got within 180 yards of the US warship, according to CNN . In recent years, there have also been increasingly aggressive responses to FONOPs targeting Chinese claims from the People’s Liberation Army Navy and other elements of that country’s military. There have also been more indirect tit-for-tat challenges between the U.S. and Russian forces in the Pacific, as well. In August, the Russian Navy’s submarine Omsk , a Project 949A guided missile submarine, or Oscar II class boat, surfaced relatively close to St. Matthew Island, part of Alaska that is situated in the Bering Sea, prompting a rare official statement from the Navy. That submarine had been part of a massive Russian naval exercise in the region that had itself caused a major stir . Earlier in the year, Russian Tu-142 maritime patrol planes also flew relatively low over a temporary base camp that the Navy had established to support an Ice Exercise (ICEX) in international waters off Alaska. Sailors observe from the fo’c’sle as the USS John S. McCain approaches the dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Alan Shepard prior to a replenishment-at-sea, in the South China Sea, October 22, 2020., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Markus Castaneda The USS John S. McCain also has an unfortunate collision in its recent past, having struck the oil tanker Alnic MC east of the Strait of Malacca, near Singapore, in August 2017. The collision, which you can read about in detail here , and here , resulted in the deaths of 10 U.S. Navy sailors. Of course, as well as maritime encounters and close calls, the U.S. military has routinely accused its Russian counterpart of conducting unsafe maneuvers near American military planes and ships in Europe and the Middle East. In Syria meanwhile, an incident last August saw the crew of a U.S. armored vehicle injured after running into a Russian military convoy in the northeast of the country. This was just one of several tense encounters between the two forces, and apparently the most serious so far. With tensions between U.S. and Russian forces already at a relative high in different potential flashpoints around the world, the latest encounter in the Pacific is a reminder that territorial disputes can rapidly develop into more serious situations. In this case, however, the two sides appear to have stepped back from any further escalation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Here’s Who Bought Paul Allen’s Pristine MiG-29 Fulcrum Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our feature on Paul Allen’s estate selling off his mint MiG-29UB fighter, we now know who the jet’s proud new owner is. At the time of writing our original piece, we mentioned how this aircraft would have a limited number of potential buyers, regardless of how immaculate the late Microsoft co-founder kept the jet while it was part of his sprawling collection of warbirds. It turns out that the person who bought the jet was almost too logical of a possibility—none other than Jared Isaacman, the young business phenom who created his own private air force. The highly successful entrepreneur made his original fortune in the credit card processing business that focused on the hospitality sector, creating a company, now called Shift4 , in his parents’ basement as a 16-year-old back in 1999. Just over a decade later, he put together Draken International , which is now one of the largest and most prolific private adversary support contractors in the world with a fleet of military jet aircraft that far surpasses the size of those of many entire countries. He became an aggressor pilot himself, flying in major exercises alongside Draken’s cadre of some of the most experienced fighter pilots on earth. In 2019, Isaacman sold his interest in Draken International for tens of millions of dollars to an investment firm and is now concentrating on his credit card processing business that has since gone public. So, what do you do when you are a stunning success, but are no longer the CEO of the world’s largest private air force? You buy the world’s nicest MiG-29 Fulcrum as a personal jet, that’s what! Jared in front of his prized MiG-29. , Jared Isaacman The War Zone reached out to Isaacman about the acquisition. As a side note, I had exchanged emails with him numerous times back around 2011, when Draken was just getting off the ground. At the time, he shared some of his plans with me. We were kindred spirits as I knew full well the private adversary air support marketplace was going to explode (I even wrote all about it back then for Combat Aircraft Monthly ). But in retrospect, even though some of it sounded like quite a reach, what is so interesting is that Jared did everything he said he was going to do and more . Reconnecting years and many articles on Draken International later, Isaacman told us the following about his MiG: In terms of the Mig-29, as you know Paul Allen’s estate put the aircraft up for sale last year. Having inspected and purchased a lot of fighter jets over the last decade at Draken, I definitely can spot a gem. Paul’s team spared no expense taking care of that Mig-29. I feel fortunate to have been able to purchase it. This is a personal aircraft, so it has nothing to do with Draken, and it is really for my own personal enjoyment, but I certainly plan to bring it to airshows so others can view the performance of this unique bird. Isaacman also helped establish the Black Diamond jet team, which served as something of a developmental staging ground for Draken International, so he is no stranger to the air show community. On flying what is basically the highest performance aircraft in civilian hands: It’s really incredible. Tons of performance. It’s always flown slick, no tanks or pylons, and the temperatures are quite cold in Bozeman this time of year. An AB takeoff is a real rocketship. The stability augmentation system makes it a real smooth ride also. It’s definitely the most impressive aircraft I have flown. That is quite the endorsement from a guy that built his own air force of aggressor jets. The cockpit of Jared’s MiG-29UB., Jared Isaacman I don’t think Allen’s MiG-29 could have found a better home and, hopefully, far larger audiences will be able to marvel in the air than ever before.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Say They Struck Saudi Oil Facility With New Type Of Cruise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery shows what looks to be damage to an oil tank at a facility belonging to the Saudi Aramco oil company in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on the Red Sea. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen had earlier claimed to have fired a ground-launched Quds-2 cruise missile, a weapon the group claims it put into service just recently, at that site overnight. The strike certainly seems to have been meant to send a signal and came amid reports that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had secretly met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the head of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad in the Red Sea coastal resort town of Neom, much further to the north. The strike, which occurred on the night of November 22nd, 2020, underscores the Houthis’ ever-increasing ability to hit targets deeper inside Saudi Arabia with cruise and ballistic missiles , as well as so-called “ suicide drones .” Jeddah is more than 390 miles from the Yemeni border, at closest, and the Yemeni militants claimed the Quds-2 flew just over 400 miles to reach its target. This group has been launching cruise missiles at targets much closer to the Saudi-Yemen border since at least last year. Cruise missiles were also a notable feature in the unprecedented strikes on Saudi oil infrastructure in the northeastern portion of the country in September 2019, which the Houthis claimed responsibility for, but which the United States has accused Iran of carrying out directly. Though this strike on Aramco’s facilities in Jeddah appears to have been much more limited in size and scope, it does appear to have some important similarities to the ones last year. Most notably oil tanks were also targeted with significant precision in those previous strikes, something that appears to have now happened again. Available satellite imagery, as well as video purportedly shot on the ground after the strike, indicates that at least one missile hit the side of the oil tank, penetrating it and causing a fire. What looks to be residual fire-fighting foam, used to extinguish oil fires, is visible in the satellite images. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5GH5oZIR0 It’s also interesting to note that Jeddah is roughly the same distance away from Yemen as the Aramco sites in Abqaiq and Khurais, the facilities struck in September of last year, are from southern Iraq and northwestern Iran. Reports had indicated that, if Iranian forces, or some of that country’s other regional proxies, not the Houthis, had carried out those strikes, those would have been among the likely points of origin . Quds-1 cruise missiles , along with drones, were employed in those strikes, as well. The Quds-1 is a design tied to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is in part responsible for arming, training, and otherwise coordinating with Tehran’s proxy forces across the Middle East. The missile also shares some general similarities in form and function to the Iranian Soumar , which is derived from the Soviet-era Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile. A Quds-1 cruise missile on display, along with various Houthi suicide drones, at left, and a ballistic missile, at right., YouTube capture A wind tunnel model seen in an Iranian state television broadcast regarding an exhibition at the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s Imam Hossein University in 2018 that is similar, if not identical to the Quds-1 cruise missile the Houthis have been firing at Saudi Arabia since at least 2019., YouTube capture Based on its designation, the Quds-2 missile sounds very likely to be related, at least in some way, to the Quds-1 design, potentially with upgraded capabilities, such as greater range and improved reliability. Three of the seven Quds-1 missiles known to have been fired at Khurais last year crashed before reaching their target . It’s important to note that the Houthis have targeted Jeddah in the past and have ballistic missiles that can reach Saudi Arabia’s capital , Riyadh, far to the north. At the same time, demonstrating the ability to carry out what appears to be a relatively precise strike on a fixed target some 400 miles deep inside Saudi Arabia sends its own kind of message. The War Zone had already pointed out at the time how the September 2019 strikes were especially significant development as they showed how even a non-state actor could hold sensitive and otherwise important facilities and infrastructure at risk using lower-tier cruise missiles, as well as suicide drones. The Houthis, in particular, are among the most capable groups in this regard, something we underlined again recently when the U.S. State Department issued a warning to Americans in Riyadh about a potential incoming drone or cruise missile strike, which thankfully did not occur, and how to protect themselves if it had. The Houthis said they carried out the strike in Jeddah in response to the Saudi Arabian-led coalition’s continued operations in Yemen and that residents in that city should be warned that their “ operations will continue .” However, the strike also notably came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, better known simply as MBS, in Neom, something that was publicized and that the Yemeni rebels would have been aware of. While the Houthis have not demonstrated an ability to launch cruise missile or drone strikes that far north in Saudi Arabia, the strike on Jeddah certainly shows that the group is working to increase the areas that it can hold at risk within that country. Saudi authorities are certainly well aware of the potential threats, from the Houthis, as well as Iran’s other proxy forces in the region and the regime in Tehran itself , and a Patriot surface-to-air missile battery reportedly watched over the meeting with MBS and Pompeo. Israeli media outlets have reported that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Mossad chief, Yossi Cohen, also secretly flew to Neom to meet with MBS, either together with Pompeo and his entourage, or on the sidelines of that meeting. Saudi Arabia’s Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud has denied that anyone besides Pompeo met with the Crown Prince in Neom. If true, this, of course, still leaves open the possibility that other Saudi or American officials met with Israeli officials. President Donald Trump’s Administration has been actively pushing various countries to normalize relations with Israel and has succeeded in brokering such deals involving the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain , both of which are important Saudi partners. There are also reports that the Saudis, themselves, may be adding to the pressure on certain countries, such as Pakistan , to do the same, in order to “normalize normalization” before officials in Riyadh strike their own accord with their Israeli counterparts. One of the Trump Administration’s clear hopes is that this increased engagement in the region with Israel could help further isolate Iran , as well as its proxies. The Houthis, among others, would undoubtedly be looking for opportunities to spoil such plans, as well as simply exert their own pressure on the Saudis and other opposing regimes. No matter what, this recent cruise missile strike on Jeddah, using what may at least be a new variant of an existing weapon, shows that the Houthis continue to present a very real threat to Saudi Arabia, as well as other parties in the region, and are still expanding their capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 25, 2020",The Navy Has Started Naming Its Submarines After Sea Creatures Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the past two months, Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite has announced the names of three future Virginia class attack submarines. In a departure from the established convention, which the lead boat in the class had set, all three will be named after fish. The Navy’s boss says these monikers, all of which honor past submarines, will help the members of its Silent Service restore a link to important history and heritage after decades of sailing in boats primarily named after U.S. states and cities. On Nov. 17, 2020, Braithwaite had revealed that two future Virginia class submarines, with the hull numbers SSN-805 and SSN-806, would be named USS Tang and USS Wahoo , respectively. The month before, he had announced that the forthcoming SSN-804 would receive the name USS Barb . All of these will be Block V boats with the additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which has four large-diameter launch tubes that will be capable of firing various weapons and potentially deploying other systems, including unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). You can read more about these boats and their enhanced capabilities in this past War Zone piece . As already noted, the Navy’s established naming convention for Virginia class boats is to name them after U.S. states. When it came to attack submarines, before that there had been the Los Angeles class, all but one of which, the USS Hyman G. Rickover , originally to be called USS Providence , were named after American cities. In between those two classes, the Navy also acquired three Seawolf class attack submarines. The service had originally planned to buy 29 of these highly advanced boats, but growing costs together with defense spending drawdowns after the end of the Cold War led to that purchase being severely truncated. The first-in-class USS Seawolf , which was commissioned in 1997, is named after a fish, but the trio does not follow any real naming convention. The other two are the USS Connecticut , which presaged the Navy’s naming decision with regards to the Virginia class, and the USS Jimmy Carter . The Seawolf class submarine USS Jimmy Carter ., USN These boats, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story , have since been leveraged heavily for intelligence-gathering and other specialized missions, including extended operations under the Arctic ice . Jimmy Carter is notably a unique subclass unto itself with the addition of a 100-foot-long Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) module in the center of the hull. The highly modified boat is now America’s top underwater espionage and special missions submarine. Beginning in 1981, the Navy also began commissioning its newest ballistic missile submarines, the Ohio class, all but one of which, the USS Henry M. Jackson , are named after states. Henry M. Jackson was a long-time member of Congress from Washington state. Four of these were subsequently converted into guided missile submarines that also featured advanced command and control capabilities, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone feature . “Naming Virginia class submarines is a unique opportunity to reclaim submarine names that carry inspirational records of achievement,” Braithwaite said in announcing the future USS Tang and USS Wahoo . Previous submarines with those names, as well as past USS Barbs , certainly have storied histories. The USS Tang The first USS Tang was a Balao class submarine that served during World War II in the Pacific. She sank a total of 33 ships, including Japanese warships, as well as freighters and tankers, over the course of five patrols in 1944. She also helped save downed airmen. The Balao class USS Tang ., USN Her service came to an unceremonious end on Oct. 25 of that year, when she was sunk by one of her own torpedoes that went off course and came circling back at her. Of her crew of 87, only nine, including her captain at the time, Commander Richard O’Kane, survived and ended up in Japanese captivity. O’Kane subsequently received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Tang ‘s final two engagements against the Japanese. O’Kane became something of a legend in the Navy’s submarine community and his cribbage board, which survived the sinking of the Tang , now goes into officer’s wardroom aboard whatever the oldest attack submarine on active duty is at present. The honor is now held by the Los Angeles class submarine USS Chicago , after the previous oldest boat, the USS Olympia , another member of the same class, left active service last year. Navy Commander Benjamin Selph, the commanding officer of USS Olympia , plays cribbage using O’Kane’s board against Commander Chance Litton, the captain of the USS Chicago in October 2019., USN A second USS Tang was commissioned in 1951 and was the lead boat in her class of diesel-electric submarines. This boat conducted operations in the Pacific region in the 1950s and 1960s, including patrols in the South China Sea during the Vietnam War. Starting in 1972, the submarine underwent a major overhaul, which extended the hull-length by 22 feet and increased its displacement by 600 tons. A new passive sonar system was installed along with a Prairie Masker acoustic signature reduction system. Afterward, this Tang returned to the Pacific until it underwent another overhaul in 1977 and was sent the following year to Groton, Connecticut, where it took up a new role, training sailors from the Imperial Iranian Navy. It also provided other training support to Navy units on the East Coast. The plan had been to eventually transfer the submarine to Iran, but those plans were halted after the Islamic Revolution in that country in 1979. The ex-USS Tang was eventually passed to the Turkish Navy in 1980, where the boat served with the new name Pirireis until 2004. It is now on display in the Turkish port city of Izmir. The second USS Tang , the first in her class, at Pearl Harbor., USN The USS Wahoo The original USS Wahoo , on which Commander O’Kane had served for a time as Executive Officer, was a Gato class submarine that also served in the Pacific during World War II. This boat sank 20 ships across seven patrols between 1942 and 1943 and became one of the most decorated submarines in the Navy at the time, earning six battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation, which is given in recognition of “extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy.” Wahoo sank in the La Pérouse Strait in the Sea of Japan sometime in October 1943 in the wake of a Japanese aerial attack. There were no survivors and the exact location of the wreck was not confirmed until 2006. The Gato class USS Wahoo ., USN The Navy tried twice to name a Tench class submarine Wahoo , but that never came to be amid a raft of canceled submarine orders late in the Second World War and immediately afterward. The service did eventually name one of the 1950s-era Tang class submarines after this storied World War II-era boat. As with the first submarine in that new class, this second USS Wahoo also spent most of its career in the Pacific, including conducting patrols in support of the Vietnam War. Just like the first-in-class USS Tang , this boat relocated to the East Coast in 1977 ahead of what was supposed to be a transfer to the Imperial Iranian Navy. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran upended those plans, Wahoo was decommissioned in 1980 and was used as a source of spare parts for other Tang class submarines until it was finally stricken from the rolls for good in 1983 and subsequently sold for scrap. The Tang class USS Wahoo at sea in the 1950s., USN The USS Barb The Navy’s first USS Barb was a Gato class submarine that served in both the Atlantic, as well as other bodies of water around Europe, and the Pacific. She is credited with sink 17 ships over the course of 12 patrols, in total. Barb ‘s first patrol was in support of the allied invasion of North Africa, nicknamed Operation Torch, which began in late 1942. She then conducted four more patrols around Europe hunting Axis blockade runners during which she sank one German ship. The Gato class USS Barb ., USN The submarine was then sent to the Pacific, arriving in Pearl Harbor in September 1943. The boat’s seven subsequent patrols in that theater left it with an impressive combat record, including the sinking of the Japanese escort carrier Un’yō in September 1944. On the night of Jan. 22-23, 1945, Barb managed to penetrate inside what was then known as Namkwan Harbor on China’s Hainan island, which the Japanese controlled at the time. The submarine sunk or damaged multiple ships sitting at anchor before withdrawing to safety, despite having no charts of the shallow and heavily mined waters inside what is known today as the Port of Yangpu. This action earned the boat a Presidential Unit Citation. Before her final patrol, which began in June 1945, Barb was fitted with an array of five-inch rocket launchers on the deck, which the boat’s crew subsequently used to bombard multiple coastal towns in the Japanese home islands. During this patrol, the crew also sent a raiding party ashore that is credited with blowing up a train. Barb ‘s battle flag at the end of World War II, with markings denoting ships sunk or damaged and other notable actions, including attacks on land targets using rockets, as well as its three-inch deck gun, and the destruction of the train. Notable awards given to the ship and its crew are also denoted at the top., USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park Barb survived the war, having destroyed the most Japanese ships by tonnage, and was placed in reserve status in 1946, before being decommissioned the following year. The Navy recommissioned the boat in 1951 and it operated in the Atlantic until it was decommissioned again in 1954. The service then put it through the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion program. Gato , as well as Balao and Tench class submarines, received the GUPPY upgrades, which were derived from features found on captured German Type XXI U-boats and offered extra speed when sailing submerged, as well as improved maneuverability and greater endurance. The Navy again recommissioned Barb in August 1954, but decommissioned her for the last time less than four months later and transferred her to the Italian Navy. The Italians operated the boat for some time after that, having renamed it the Enrico Tazzoli , and subsequently sold it for scrap in 1972. In 1963, the Navy commissioned a second USS Barb , a nuclear Permit class submarine. The Permit class had been known as the Thresher class until the USS Thresher was lost in an accident in 1963, an incident that remains a source of controversy . The Permit class USS Barb ., USN This second Barb operated in the Pacific right up until the last years of the Cold War. She was notably responsible for reporting unusual Soviet naval activity in April 1968, which subsequently turned out to be search efforts for the stricken Golf-II class ballistic missile submarine K-129. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) famously mounted a highly-classified effort to recover that sunken boat, nicknamed Project Azorian . The Hughes Glomar Explorer , a modified drillship, built at the direction of Howard Hughes in cooperation with the CIA, was ultimately only able to pull a portion of K-129 up from the bottom of the ocean in 1974. This submarine also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for rescuing survivors of a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber that crashed in the Pacific near Guam in 1972 as Typhoon Rita slammed the area. In 1977, the boat was selected as a test platform for the submarine-launched version of the Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile . The Navy decommissioned this USS Barb in 1989. Fish names are back Before Braithwaite’s announcement about the future USS Barb , Seawolf had been the last Navy submarine named after a fish. Before that, the Sturgeon class had been the last Navy submarine class where the formal convention had been to name them after denizens of the deep. The Navy decommissioned its last Sturgeon class boat, USS Parche , a heavily modified spy submarine akin to the USS Jimmy Carter that followed it, in 2005. The Navy also operated a unique diesel-electric research and development submarine, USS Dolphin , until 2007. USS Parche in 2004., USN It’s also worth noting that exceptions generally prove the rule when it comes to Navy ship naming conventions. There are already two Virginia class submarines set to be named after notable Americans, rather than states. These are the future USS John Warner and USS Hyman G. Rickover . The Los Angeles class USS Hyman G. Rickover was decommissioned in 2006. John Warner was a long-time Senator from Virginia who also served as Secretary of the Navy under President Richard Nixon. He had also fought in World War II and the Korean War with the U.S. Marines. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover , a Polish Jewish immigrant who first joined the Navy in 1922, is described as the “Father of the Nuclear Navy” and ran the service’s Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for just over three decades after its creation in 1949. Rickover, who eventually became something of a controversial figure, was forced into retirement in 1982, at the age of 82, and died in 1986. He remains, by far, the longest-serving director of the Navy’s main nuclear office, also commonly known simply as Naval Reactors. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover onboard the submarine USS Nautilus , the world’s first nuclear-powered vessel. , USN “Fish don’t vote!” It’s perhaps somewhat amusing that the future USS Hyman G. Rickover will share space with at least three other Virginia class submarines named after fish. Rickover is said to have been responsible for ending the convention of naming submarines after denizens of the deep. Admiral James Watkins, who was Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy’s top officer, from 1982 to 1986, said that the head of Naval Reactors had once declared to him “ Fish don’t vote! ” The idea, at least in theory, was that establishing a more visible link to specific American constituencies, even land-locked ones, would create a sense of attachment to individual boats, which in turn would help sway members of Congress to approve funding for new submarines. A similar logic appears to have been applied to the Navy’s two subclasses of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), the bulk of which are also named after U.S. cities. It’s not entirely clear if the Braithwaite truly intends to continue naming new submarines after fish, or if the names of other notable, now-decommissioned submarines that have nothing to do with undersea fauna may also make comebacks. For instance, for a time, the Navy had named ballistic missile submarines after notable Americans, including multiple Presidents, and even foreign historical figures. The Benjamin Franklin class USS Simon Bolivar , named after the Venezuelan revolutionary hero who led multiple Latin American countries to independence from Spain in the 19th century, is perhaps one of the more interesting examples. Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite speaks with sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Milius in Japan in October., USN The latest edition of the Congressional Research Service’s (CRS) report on ship naming , which is dated Nov. 16, the day before Braithwaite announced the future USS Tang and USS Wahoo , does not say that there has been any formal change in the naming convention for the Virginia class. It also says that the Navy has yet to state publicly how it plans to name its Columbia class ballistic missile submarines, despite the general belief being that these will be named after states, just like the Ohio class. Congress may well have their own opinions on all of this and ship naming can often be a politically-charged issue on the Hill, which is the reason CRS’ report exists in the first place. World War II-era submarines, all named after fish, are among the most likely to have had the “inspirational records of achievement” that Braithwaite says he is now looking to honor. There will definitely be more submarines in need of names in the future, too, with the Navy’s current highly ambitious force plan calling for between 70 and 80 total boats to be in service by 2045. Right now, the service is planning to acquire Block VI Virginia class boats ahead of the planned future introduction of an all-new attack submarine, presently referred to as SSN(X) . That design is expected to be based, at least in part, on the Columbia class and have features carried over from the Block VI Virginias . If nothing else, the Secretary of the Navy has made clear that any formal or informal prohibition the service had on naming new submarines after fish is gone, at least as long as he is in the post.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s new carrier onboard delivery platform, the CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor, has landed on an aircraft carrier for the first time. The landmark mission took place aboard the flight deck of the Nimitz -class nuclear aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson underway in the Pacific Ocean, and photos have now been released. The Vinson was conducting what the U.S. Navy described as “routine maritime operations,” when a CMV-22B assigned to Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron 30 (VRM-30), the “Titans,” paid a visit to the carrier on November 20, 2020. The CMV-22B, which is an adaptation of the MV-22B used by the U.S. Marine Corps as its standard medium-lift assault support aircraft, is destined to replace the Navy’s existing C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery (COD) aircraft, a design that first entered service in the mid-1960s. Currently, C-2s play a vital role in providing COD to the Navy’s supercarriers, shuttling personnel, spare parts, mail, and other supplies to and from the ships and bases ashore. U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith The Navy signed a deal to buy 39 of the new tilt-rotors in June 2018. The CMV-22B purchase was part of a larger Osprey buy , worth a total of $4.2 billion to the Bell-Boeing joint venture that makes the aircraft, and also included 19 additional examples, a mixture of MV-22Bs for the U.S. Marine Corps and Japan and CV-22Bs for the U.S. Air Force. The first CMV-22B unit, VRM-30 stood up at Naval Air Station North Island in California, on October 1, 2018. Meanwhile, training of the initial Navy CMV-22B crews is being carried out by the Naval Aviation Training Support Group (NATSG) at Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, overseen by Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron Two Zero Four (VMMT-204). Eventually, the Navy plans to create a new wing-sized unit at North Island that will oversee both VRM-30 and the second operational CMV-22B squadron, VRM-40. Finally, VRM-50 will arrive at the base to serve as third a dedicated fleet replacement squadron, taking on the responsibility for training crews. U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith Prior to going aboard the Vinson , the Navy used the MV-22B to demonstrate the ability of the tilt-rotor to use rolling landings and takeoffs to touch down on an aircraft carrier’s deck and then get airborne again with large loads, including tests aboard the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush . This kind of ability is essential for the CMV-22B, which will be tasked to transport particularly bulky items, including spare F135 engines for the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter . However, the CMV-22B’s ability to move the F135 engine does come with some important caveats, as The War Zone discussed in this previous article . There have been other concerns voiced about the CMV-22B’s suitability to the COD mission, too. These are discussed at length here , but they include lack of cabin pressurization, and the space required by the tilt-rotor to take off and land from a carrier, as well as maneuvering around the flight deck, and how this might affect the launching and recovering process. While the MV-22B has stood in for the Navy’s COD variant of the tilt-rotor in the past, the CMV-22B configuration does incorporate some important differences for its role, including additional fuel capacity in the fuselage and wings to increase its overall range, extra communications equipment, a public address system in the main cabin, and special lighting to help with loading and unloading cargo at night. U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith The carrier trials of the CMV-22B come as the Navy seeks to declare initial operational capability for the type before the end of this year. The tilt-rotor COD fleet is expected to become fully operational four years after that, which would allow the last of the C-2s to be retired by 2026. As well as replacing the fixed-wing C-2, it’s possible the CMV-22B could also change the way that the Navy moves cargoes around within the Carrier Strike Group. Under the current “ hub and spoke ” method, C-2s bring cargo or personnel to the carrier deck, before helicopters ferry them to individual vessels, where required. The tilt-rotor’s ability to carry underslung heavy loads could see them take on this role, too. In recent weeks, the USS Carl Vinson has also hosted the Navy’s first operational F-35C squadron for flight-deck qualifications. Since F-35C operations require the Osprey’s ability to haul its F135 engine, it’s possible that the CMV-22Bs will accompany the fighter jet’s first operational cruise aboard the carrier, planned for 2021 . U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron T. Smith While there have been questions asked about the CMV-22B’s suitability for the COD role in the past, a rapid development path shows there’s little doubt that the US Navy is fully backing this variant of the Osprey as a replacement for the C-2. The first appearance of the new aircraft aboard a Navy aircraft carrier is the next milestone toward getting the CMV-22B into operational service. If everything goes as planned, the Navy’s Osprey will become a fixture of the carrier air wing, just like its fixed-wing predecessor.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 27, 2021",The A-10 Warthog Demo Team Executed A Huge Flare Dump To End Its Air Show Season,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With a highly peculiar and challenging air show season wrapping up, the Air Force’s tactical jet demonstration teams converged on Fort Lauderdale last week to mark the end of two of the four teams’ seasons. For the F-22 Raptor and A-10 Warthog demo teams, this Florida show would be their last. We reported on the spectacular over-water photo flight featuring all four teams’ jets that occurred late last week, now we have video of the A-10 demo team marking its last show of the season, and the last demo of its show pilot, Cody “ShIV” Wilton , by doing something exceptionally rare for a U.S. air show— dumping a bucket of flares at low altitude across show-center. Fort Lauderdale’s air show is a ‘remote show,’ taking place along the city’s sandy beachline with the aircraft flying over the water for their displays. This reality likely played into getting clearance to execute the dramatic and firey maneuver. In the past, flares have been used by U.S. military aircraft at a handful of air shows—almost always mega open houses at huge military installations. Even then, the flare releases usually occur over a sparsely populated end of the airfield and when the aircraft is in a high-climb. The A-10 demo team definitely broke the mold by doing it at low-level and show center on what I believe was the last pass of the demonstration. Unfortunately, the Instagram post isn’t embedding at this time, but you can see the video here . It seems that the day prior the team also used flares throughout its act, but without the huge flare dump at show-center to end the season (fast forward to 3:29 for the A-10 display if the player doesn’t do it automatically): Check it out from inside the Warthog’s cockpit at this Instagram link here. If you are wondering what those flares cost, we have the answer for you in this past special feature. It was quite a way to say goodbye. Having spent some time with these teams in years past, the experience of traveling the country, and even beyond, as ambassadors for their perspective fast-jet communities, and for the Air Force overall, is an absolutely amazing experience. Getting something akin to the ‘movie star’ treatment wherever they go is also a nice perk, as well. While the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels definitely get the most attention, the solo tactical jet demo teams are, in a way, a bit more relatable and even approachable than their higher-profile counterparts. When it comes to recruitment, a young person may see becoming a Thunderbird as a pipe dream, but flying or maintaining a ‘gray’ Warthog or Viper, that’s more realistic. In addition, these teams not only cost a fraction of what the big demo squadrons cost to sustain, but they also touch areas where those big teams rarely, if ever, visit. They are also made up of front-line crews flying front-line jets. They can be tasked into combat operations very quickly if need be. And of course, the pilots would be getting the hours and the jets would be in the air even if the teams didn’t exist. Overall, they are an incredible value to the Air Force. Regardless, congrats to the ‘Hog demo team for completing their highly irregular season. Hell of a way to go out guys!

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 11, 2020",F-15E Strike Eagle’s New Electronic Warfare Suite Put To The Test In Major Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The sophisticated new radar warning and electronic warfare suite for the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle is a step closer to becoming operational after being put to the test in a recent large force test event. The Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS, promises nothing less than a full electronic warfare overhaul for the Strike Eagle, significantly increasing its survivability. The F-15E’s EPAWSS was one of the “prioritized tests” conducted during a major exercise called Large Force Test Event (LFTE) 20.03 that recently took place at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The Nellis’ 53rd Wing released details and photos from the event, including the rare shot of an EPAWSS-equipped F-15E, on November 20, 2020. LFTE 20.03 took place over the Nevada ranges three days earlier and, in addition to the F-15E, it involved nine other aircraft types from the Air Force and Navy: F-35, F-22, F-16, A-10, E/A-18G, HH-60G, EC-130H, KC-46, and KC-135. LFTE 20.03 was designed to validate tactics in a contested environment, refine electronic attack tactics using new capabilities, and optimize large force interoperability between fighters and standoff electronic attack platforms. “Prioritized test” status was given to portions of the event that focused on EPAWSS, as well as the F-16’s new AN/APG-83 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , and counter-tactics against enemy passive detection systems, a category that includes infrared search and track (IRST) sensors. F-22s, F-15Es, and F-16s from the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron fly alongside a KC-46 over the Nevada Test and Training Range on November 17, 2020, for Large Force Test Event 20.03., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt Savanah Bray With the deployment of EPAWSS in LFTE 20.03, the program appears to have moved to the next phase of testing, inflight evaluation. The F-15E fitted with EPAWSS in the picture from the event is seen taking on fuel from a KC-46 aerial refueling tanker and it wears the ‘OT’ tail code associated with the Air Force’s 53rd Wing, which is responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems, including electronic warfare suites. Developed by BAE Systems , EPAWSS replaces the Strike Eagle’s legacy, obsolescent AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS). Compared to the standard F-15E configuration , jets with the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS, feature beefed-up tailplane supporting beams, each of which has a pair of rounded antenna fairings at their ends. A detail view of the EPAWSS-equipped F-15E refueling from a KC-46A during LFTE 20.03., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt Savanah Bray The new system is intended to ensure the F-15E’s survivability in the kind of contested airspace environments in which the Air Force might expect to find itself fighting in the future. It’s a vital element in keeping the Strike Eagle viable until beyond 2040. Designed to sample the electromagnetic spectrum, identify threats, prioritize, and allocate jamming resources against them, EPAWSS is described by its manufacturer as follows: “Providing both offensive and defensive electronic warfare options for the pilot and aircraft, EPAWSS offers fully integrated radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness, and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats in signal-dense contested and highly contested environments. Equipped with advanced electronic countermeasures, it enables deeper penetration against modern integrated air defense systems, providing rapid response capabilities to protect the aircrew.” For the Strike Eagle aircrew, this means a more timely and accurate warning of ground-based radio-frequency (RF) threats, including their specific type and location, as accurate bearings for airborne threats, both RF and infrared in nature. Armed with this additional situational awareness, the crew should be able to avoid, engage, or negate the threat. As well as alerting the crew to the threats as a defensive system, EPAWSS is able to target these threats offensively , employing countermeasures. EPAWSS is something that the Strike Eagle community needs desperately. Unlike the existing AN/ALQ-135, it will take into account the huge developments in air defenses, and especially high-end surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), that have occurred since the F-15E began to enter service. Jon Danner, F-15 Division Test Manager at Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, explained in an Air Force press release that the F-15E’s current TEWS “uses 1970s analog technology designed for combat operations in environments defended by 1980s-era radar-based ground and air threats.” In particular, the kind of ground-based air defense threats that the F-15E might now be expected to encounter from a peer or near-peer threat include very long-range, AESA technology, counter-jamming capabilities, and a high degree of mobility. What is more, the increasing affordability of such systems means they are not necessarily beyond the reach of operators that weren’t previously able to offer a contested airspace environment. The F-15E currently relies on the obsolescent AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) for electronic warfare self-protection. , U.S. Air Force/Senior Master Sgt. Ralph Branson Since it’s fully digital, EPAWSS is not only physically smaller than previous systems, but it can also be rapidly and more easily updated to add new capabilities to keep abreast of developing threats. It’s also promised to be less maintenance-heavy and more reliable than legacy equipment, bringing down costs. Exactly how EPAWSS works, and what kinds of threats it can defeat is, not surprisingly, a closely guarded secret, but Ed Sabat, Project Development Lead and Civilian Director of Operations, 772nd Test Squadron, explained in an Air Force press release that the system “takes advantages of today’s computing, receiver and transmitter technologies to provide a quicker, smarter response to the threats and better actionable information to the pilot.” Additional testing of EPAWSS is being conducted by the F-15 System Program Office (SPO) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, the 96th Test Wing’s 46th Test Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, the 412th Test Wing’s 412th Electronic Warfare Group’s 772nd Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base in California, as well as Boeing and BAE Systems. EPAWSS is just one of several important upgrades for the F-15E in recent years, including the new Raytheon AN/APG-82 AESA radar, plus certain niche capabilities, such as the AN/ASQ-236 “Dragon’s Eye” radar pod that you can read about in this previous feature . Once fielded on the F-15E, the EPAWSS will then appear as an integral part of the avionics of the Air Force’s forthcoming F-15EX fleet. The service’s full F-15EX fleet is set to eventually comprise 144 jets, sufficient to replace most of the Air Force’s remaining F-15C/D Eagles, but possibly substantially more. You can read more about the new jets here . At one time, it was expected that EPAWSS would be added to the Air Force’s F-15C/Ds, too, but this is on hold and seems to have been overtaken by plans to replace them with the F-15EX. An artist’s impression of the Air Force’s future F-15EX., Boeing Beyond replacing the “Golden Eagles” there’s also the possibility that EPAWSS-equipped F-15EX could eventually supersede the existing Strike Eagle fleet, too. That proposal is not without its critics, however, as The War Zone explored here . After a first flight onboard a test F-15E in April 2019, in April 2020, the Air Force announced that the first of “multiple test phases” for the EPAWSS at the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB had been completed. The BAF is the largest known RF anechoic chamber in the world, and you can read more about this unique facility here . These tests were intended to collect the data on the integration of the EPAWSS radar and missile warning capabilities and electronic countermeasures on the F-15E platform.

This work is essential to ensure the various systems can coexist, communicate, and operate without interfering with each other. As of December 2019, three of the six F-15E test jets inducted into the EPAWSS modification line were complete, and work on the last two was scheduled to begin later in Fiscal Year 2020. At that point, a tailored Milestone C decision, which paves the way to move from engineering and manufacturing development to the production and deployment phase, was expected in October 2020, but has not been announced so far.

Ultimately, it’s planned that 217 production F-15Es will receive EPAWSS, plus the new-build F-15EX fleet. The F-15E is already one of the Air Force’s most in-demand tactical assets, and the forthcoming capabilities offered by EPAWSS are set to make it even more effective in a threat environment that’s becoming ever more diverse, complex, and unpredictable.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2021",Check Out These Navy Special Operators Deploying An Underwater Scout Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. special operators recently participated in an exercise in Sweden with members of that country’s armed forces and Home Guard, which involved a variety of assets in the air, on the ground, and at sea. This included the deployment and recovery of an unmanned underwater vehicle from a small Zodiak that itself was deployed by one of the U.S. Navy’s stealthy Combatant Craft Medium special operations boats. The drone enables maritime special operations forces to scout out areas to safely come ashore, hunt for mines and other hazards, and otherwise collect important data about what’s going on underneath the waves. U.S. Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR) did not say where the various components of the exercise took place specifically, but the maritime portion involved training in the Baltic Sea near the Swedish city of Karlskrona on Nov. 6, 2020. In addition to the underwater drone, which is a member of the Iver family , and the Combatant Craft Medium (CCM), Swedish Navy Visby class stealth corvettes, as well as the support ship HSwMS Trosso and various other smaller watercraft, also took part. US Navy special operators work with an Iver drone during the recent exercise in Sweden. The stern of the Combatant Craft Medium is visible at the right., USN There was also an air assault component to the training that involved U.S. Air Force CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor, MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker-transport aircraft, and F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets, as well as Swedish Air Force Gripen fighters and C-130 Hercules transport planes. The MC-130Js and F-15Es may have been from contingents that deployed to Denmark earlier this month as part of a separate exercise in the Baltic region that also included Dutch, Danish, and Belgian forces. “This exercise provides the opportunity to train with SOF [special operations forces] partners, as well as U.S. and Swedish conventional forces across all warfighting functions and domains. This allows us to train how we will fight, while also highlighting the credibility and capability of our combined forces,” Air Force Nathan Owendoff, head of the 352nd Special Operations Wing based in the United Kingdom and the commander of the Joint Special Operations Task Force that went to Sweden for the exercise, said in a statement. “The additive benefit is the critical value of building trust and strengthening relationships between commanders, element leaders, and special operations forces across multiple echelons.” A US Navy Combatant Craft Medium (CCM), in the foreground, sails with a Swedish Navy rigid-hull inflatable boat during the recent exercise., USN When it comes to training like you fight, the Baltic is an extremely important area for U.S. special operations and conventional forces to train in. It is a relatively small, but immensely strategic body of water that would be highly contested in any major conflict in the region, especially by Russia , for which it is a critical route between its warm water ports at one end and the North Sea at the other. Special operations forces on both sides of such a conflict could be called upon to conduct raids on small islands and critical coastal infrastructure, search for potential hazards ahead of larger, conventional forces, and otherwise perform various reconnaissance and intelligence gathering missions. Stealthy special operations boats, such as the Navy’s CCMs, would be important tools to support any of those activities, but the use of underwater drones, such as the Ivers, would offer additional, more discreet means of doing so, especially in areas where the exact location and composition of enemy defenders might not be entirely clear. We don’t know the exact configuration of the Iver that Navy special operators employed during the recent exercise in Sweden, but it appears to be an Iver3-series type, one of the latest generations of the design. OceanServer, now a division of L3Harris, introduced its first Iver models more than 15 years ago. The torpedo-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), which has a single shrouded propeller at the rear, is made up of modular sections that make it easier to tailor its capabilities to a user’s specific mission requirements. OceanServer’s website says that Iver3s are typically between six and seven feet long and are generally under 100 pounds, depending on the configuration. The weight and other factors also impact its endurance, which the company says is between eight and 14 hours with the drone cruising along at around two and a half knots. USN The Navy says that the primary mission of its Iver-series drones is “battlespace awareness” and “intelligence preparation of the environment,” that is to say finding out what’s going on underneath the waves around a particular area or objective and gathering information that could help in the planning for upcoming operations, respectively. To support these missions, the undersea drones are typically equipped with side-scan sonar that can generate images of the seafloor and anything that might be sitting down there, for underwater mapping and survey purposes. They also have bathymetric sensors that can collect depth data that is also used to help create underwater maps. The video below shows side-scan sonar images taken using an earlier Iver2 UUV, which offers a look at the kind of general capabilities the improved Iver3s provide to the Navy. https://youtube.com/watch?v=soaw3FuqSCk The drones can navigate semi-autonomously along a predefined route on the surface using passive sonar, or underwater, at depths down to 300 feet, using a depth sensor and corrected compass combined with something known as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). DVL provides an estimate of the drone’s velocity in relation to the sea bottom as determined by the depth sensor. With the heading from the compass, the UUV’s onboard systems can determine its position and steer it along the desired path. The Iver3’s standard method of communicating with its operators is wireless Ethernet, via an antenna on a small mast. OceanServer also offers Iridium satellite communications and acoustic communications links for these UUVs. The Iver’s antenna is seen here poking out above the waterline., USN For Navy special operations forces, as well as conventional units, UUVs such as the Iver-series can help provide a valuable understanding of what the ocean floor below looks like and what else might be down there, including hazards ranging from mines to purpose-built obstacles to innocuous debris or even just large rocks. Having this information would be especially useful for naval special operators planning to infiltrate into a particular area, either above the water in small watercraft or below in miniature submarines or using various kinds of personal diving equipment . They can also pass this critical data along to conventional forces planning larger-scale amphibious operations. Using an unmanned platform also means that Navy personnel do not have to be as directly involved in these activities, allowing this information to be collected in a manner that limits their vulnerability to enemy forces. Relatively small underwater drones are also more difficult for an opponent to detect and allows for more discreet operations that could be particularly important to special operations forces operating in denied areas. Conventional Navy forces also employ Ivers as part of more traditional mine-hunting operations, as well as explosive ordnance disposal duties , including routine sweeps of ports for potential hazards, including those that a hostile actor may have emplaced covertly . In 2017, Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One (UUVRON 1), the service’s first dedicated underwater drone unit, sent three Ivers, as well as a larger Bluefin 12D UUV, to join the search for the lost Argentinian Navy submarine ARA San Juan . The wreckage of that boat, which reportedly suffered a battery fire days before it sank and imploded, was finally found in November 2018. Navy explosive ordnance disposal personnel launch an Iver3 in the Gulf of Aqaba off the coast of Jordan in 2015., USN It’s not clear whether the Iver3s that the Navy’s special operations community uses may have additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors or other capabilities. In 2010, Naval Special Warfare Command did acquire two smaller, earlier generation Iver2-series UUVs with multi-beam imaging sonar, in addition to the standard side-scan sonar. It is interesting to note that the captions of the pictures showing the Navy special operators using the Iver in Sweden identify them as “Special Reconnaissance Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) operators,” further underscoring this particular mission set. “ Special reconnaissance ” in U.S. special operations parlance typically refers to missions that take place in denied or otherwise sensitive areas. In addition, in December 2014, the Naval Special Warfare Command, which oversees the Navy SEALs and the services other special operations units, renamed its Special Warfare Support Activities One and Two as Special Reconnaissance Teams One and Two. This was to “more accurately reflect the mission” of these units, which is to “conduct preparation of the environment, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, special operations, and combat support for supported commanders, inter-agency and host nation partners.” It seems very likely that the UUV operators the Navy sent to Sweden were from one of these two teams. OceanServer also now offers an improved Iver4 series, the first model of which was the Iver4 900 , with a standard length of just over eight feet and a weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on the configuration. In June, the company unveiled a smaller Iver4 580 , similar size-wise to the earlier Iver3s, but various improvements carried over from the larger UUV, including GPS-assisted navigation on the surface and an inertial navigation system (INS) coupled with DVL for underwater operations. The Iver4 580 is also faster than the Iver3s, able to cruise at up to four knots, or make dashes at up to five knots, depending on their configuration. Improved battery modules, which are also hot-swappable in the field without special tools, enable the drones to sail for up to 36 hours, giving them serious standoff and loitering capability. https://youtube.com/watch?v=a12bgzvBSag In January, OceanServer announced that the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) had purchased an Iver4 900, as well as various associated equipment, on behalf of the Navy to support work on that service’s Next Generation Small-Class Maritime Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (MEMUUV) program. This prototype system will be able to “detect, classify, localize, and identify targets on the ocean floor and in the water column [suspended underwater]” using sensors including “real aperture and synthetic aperture sonars,” according to a company press release . The improved capabilities that the Iver4 900 and 580 models offer certainly seem like that would be broadly attractive to the Navy for various conventional and special operations missions beyond just mine-hunting, in the same vein as its existing Iver types. The broad benefits that special operators, as well as conventional forces, get from having access to these kinds of small, lightweight, but increasingly capable UUVs were certainly on display during the recent exercise in Sweden. It underscores how unmanned systems are only becoming more and more ubiquitous in military operations at sea, as well as in the air and on land, a trend this is showing no signs of slowing down.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 24, 2020",The Navy Wants To Stand Up A New Fleet Aimed At Deterring China In The Indian Ocean,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite says he is looking to establish a new naval command with a particular focus on the Indian Ocean and adjacent areas of the Pacific. This announcement comes as elements of the U.S. and Indian Navies, as well as those from Japan and Australia, are taking part in a major maritime exercise in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. military, as a whole, has also been working to strengthen ties with its Indian counterparts , as well as other countries in this general region , in order to challenge China’s growing geopolitical ambitions. Braithwaite publicly called for setting up the additional fleet on Nov. 17, 2020, in remarks at the Naval Submarine League’s annual symposium, which is being held virtually this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. He added that the plan is for this new unit to be designated U.S. 1st Fleet, which previously oversaw American naval operations in parts of the Western Pacific from 1947 to 1973. When the Navy shuttered 1st Fleet nearly 50 years ago, it established U.S. 3rd Fleet in its place. That fleet remains active today with its headquarters in San Diego, California. Decades later, the service further redrew its operational boundaries in the Pacific, limiting 3rd Fleet’s responsibilities to naval activities in the Eastern Pacific, while expanding the role of U.S. 7th Fleet , which is forward-deployed in Japan, to cover more of the Western Pacific. The 7th Fleet is also presently responsible for overseeing operations in the Indian Ocean. A map showing the approximate boundaries between the areas of responsibility for the Navy’s fleets in the 1980s, including 3rd Fleet (3F) and 7th Fleet (7F) in the Pacific., via Wikimedia A general overview of the distribution of responsibility between the US Navy’s fleets circa 2009, showing the realignment of the boundaries between 3rd and 7th Fleets in the Pacific. It’s also worth noting that 2nd Fleet was inactivated in 2011, before being reactivated in 2018., via Wikimedia “We want to stand up a new numbered fleet,” Braithwaite said. “And we want to put that numbered fleet in the crossroads between the Indian and the Pacific oceans, and we’re really going to have an INDOPACOM footprint.” “We can’t just rely on the 7th Fleet in Japan. We have to look to our other allies and partners like Singapore, like India, and actually put a numbered fleet where it would be extremely relevant if, god forbid, we were to ever to get in any kind of a dust-up,” he added. “More importantly, it can provide a much more formidable deterrence.” It’s not clear how far along the Navy is in the process of establishing this new fleet. USNI News reported that Braithwaite, who was been serving as Navy Secretary since May, had come with this plan “several months ago” and had been in discussions about implementing it with former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who was President Donald Trump fired last week. Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite., USN It’s also not clear where the 1st Fleet headquarters might eventually be situated. “We’re going to put it, if not Singapore right out of the chocks, we’re going to look to make it more expeditionary-oriented and move it across the Pacific until it is where our allies and partners see that it could best assist them as well as to assist us,” Braithwaite said. The Navy has had a presence at the Singaporean Navy’s Changi Naval Base since 1990 and now had Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) forward-deployed there under the operational control of 7th Fleet. One possible route the service could take to quickly establish 1st Fleet in Singapore could be to repurpose and expand, or otherwise leverage a portion of the 7th Fleet’s Logistics Group Western Pacific , also known as Task Force 73, which is based in that country now. Singapore’s Changi Naval Base, which the US Navy has access to already., Google Earth At present, Logistics Group Western Pacific/Task Force 73 oversees the activities of all Military Sealift Command and other Navy auxiliary ships in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. It also manages all repair work on Navy ships in these regions outside of Japan and serves as the “principal logistics agent and Theater Security Cooperation (TSC) agent for Southeast Asia,” according to the unit’s website . Another option might be to create a more “expeditionary” command element, as Braithwaite also suggested, that could be temporarily deployed to Singapore, or other countries in the region, such as Australia or even the British Indian Ocean Territory of Diego Garcia , at least initially. It’s not clear how such a unit might operate, but it could potentially make use of the kind of rapidly deployable temporary command and control facilities , and associated concepts of operation , that other services are now experimenting with . This could provide the Navy with valuable experience in conducting distributed operations in the Pacific, as well. It might be possible, at least for a time, for the 1st Fleet’s commander and their staff to operate from a ship, such as the first-in-class command ship USS Blue Ridge . It’s worth noting that the U.S. military’s Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) ran its operations from Blue Ridge ‘s sister ship, USS Mount Whitney , for some six months between 2002 and 2003 before moving into facilities ashore at Camp Lemonnier in the East African country of Djibouti. The command ship USS Blue Ridge ., USN However, Blue Ridge is also 7th Fleet’s flagship and that command may be less than eager to relinquish control of that highly specialized vessel even just for a matter of months. The Navy could also look to utilize one of its new Lewis B. Puller class expeditionary sea bases or a smaller Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport, but these ships would not be nearly as capable as fleet command ships. No matter how they are deployed, many personnel assigned to 1st Fleet may well be seconded from other units in 7th Fleet and elsewhere in the Navy, at least to begin with, as well. This would be very similar to how the U.S. 2nd Fleet has operated since its re-establishment in 2018 to oversee naval operations in much of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic region . As with that unit, 1st Fleet is unlikely to have any ships permenantly assigned to it, instead exercising temporary command and control of ships and other naval units deployed to whatever areas it ultimately gains responsibility over. Regardless of its initial size and scope, the planned 1st Fleet would provide a valuable command element focused on U.S. activities in the southwestern Pacific and the Indian Ocean, as well as expanding ties and improving interoperability with allies and partners in the region. The fleet’s commanding officer and their staff would also give the Navy a dedicated voice for naval issues in this part of the world, which is already of great strategic importance, during higher-level discussions on topics such as operational requirements, policy, and budgeting. The 1st Fleet plan also underscores the U.S. military’s growing focus on the “Indo” part of what it is now broadly referring to as the Indo-Pacific region. This increased attention to engagement in and around the Indian subcontinent, and with India specifically, was already visible during President Barack Obama’s Administration and continued into that of President Donald Trump’s. In 2018, the Pentagon notably renamed U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) as U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) as part of this broader push, which is aimed, in no small part, at challenging Chinese geopolitical maneuvers and influence across Asia and beyond. Right now, the Navy, together with its counterparts from India, Japan, and Australia, a grouping known as “ The Quad ,” are holding the latest iteration of the Malabar naval exercise in the Indian Ocean’s Bay of Bengal. This is the first time in 13 years that Australia has taken part in Malabar, another example of growing military cooperation between the United States and its allies and partners in this region. Ships from the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, including the first-in-class aircraft carrier USS Nimitz , seen to the left of the submarine at center, and the Indian aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya , to the right, sail together during the Malabar 2020 exercise., USN USN Though much of the discussion about China’s assertive maritime activities center on the country’s expansive and widely disputed claims in the South China Sea , Beijing has also been looking to step up its naval presence in the Indian Ocean. This has been of particular concern to Indian authorities, especially given the Chinese government’s long-time relationship with India’s chief adversary Pakistan . In January, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy and its Pakistani counterparts conducted a major exercise together in the Arabian Sea further the west. On land, India and China have also seen some of the most serious skirmishes in decades along disputed portions of their shared border this year. At least 20 Indian soldiers died and dozens more were injured in a particularly violent altercation in June, with China also suffering dozens of casualties, according to various reports . Since then, India and China have sought to deescalate the situation , but significant friction remains. The United States, as well as many other countries in East and Southeast Asia , share many similar concerns about China’s increasing willingness to adopt very aggressive postures on a host of foreign policy issues. “Most recently I was on a trip to the Far East. Every single one of our allies and partners are concerned about how aggressive the Chinese have been,” Secretary of the Navy Braithwaite said at the beginning of his remarks at the Naval Submarine League symposium. China itself has established a naval base on the Horn of Africa in Djibouti, which provides valuable support for its own maritime operations in the Indian Ocean, as well as in and around the Middle East and beyond . There have also been persistent reports that the Chinese government may be looking to set up additional bases in the Maldives and Sri Lanka . Russia recently announced plans for a naval base in Sudan, which could also help expand that country’s naval activities in the Indian Ocean, among other areas. All told, while the Navy seems to be in the early stages of establishing the next iteration of 1st Fleet, creating this unit would seem to be a high priority for the service as it seeks to expand its own presence in part of the world and better engage with key allies and partners, including India, to head off growing challenges from China.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",Navy Maritime Patrol Planes Flying From Cold War Base In Bermuda For First Time In Decades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bermuda, the British island territory in the North Atlantic best known for its pink sandy beaches, has a U.S. Navy maritime patrol aircraft presence for the first time in a quarter-century. This comes as the service looks to counter an increased level of Russian submarine activity in the region. The recent deployment of a detachment of two P-8A Poseidon submarine-hunting aircraft from an unspecified squadron was confirmed by Bermuda’s Royal Gazette . The planes will remain in Bermuda together with around 40 personnel and will conduct “reconnaissance operations” from the island’s L.F. Wade International Airport, which was previously the site of a U.S. naval air station. “A P-8 Poseidon detachment arrived in Bermuda on October 30 to support operational requirements in conjunction with other US naval assets in the Atlantic Ocean,” Navy Lieutenant Marycate Walsh, a spokesperson for the U.S. 2nd Fleet, told the Royal Gazette . “The Navy frequently conducts exercises and operations in the Atlantic Ocean to maintain readiness, refine tactics, and support homeland defense.” “The detachment is scheduled to operate out of Bermuda for the next several months,” she added. The deployment does not appear to part of a larger move toward reestablishing Naval Air Station Bermuda, which regularly hosted detachments of U.S. Navy anti-submarine warfare aircraft during the Cold War. It’s also not clear if this will mark the beginning of regular rotational deployments of detachments of P-8s to the island, but it is very possible. An aerial view of U.S. Naval Air Station Bermuda from 1993, two years before the Navy departed., National Archives A P-3 Orion from Patrol Squadron 16 (VP-16) returns to Naval Air Station Bermuda from an anti-submarine tracking mission. The squadron, based in Jacksonville, Florida, was deployed to Bermuda in 1985., National Archives However, Bermuda’s location, situated in the Atlantic around 650 miles at its closest point from the East Coast of the United States, would significantly extend the reach of the Navy’s Poseidons that operate throughout the region. Flying from the island would allow the aircraft to reach points further out in the Atlantic or remain on station over certain areas for longer periods. It could also reach those stations faster, being able to more readily react to time-sensitive intelligence. This all makes good sense given that the deployment appears to be under the auspices of the 2nd Fleet, which the Navy reactivated in 2018 in response to a ramp-up in Russian submarine activities in the Atlantic. The unit is headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, and oversees naval operations in parts of the North Atlantic and in the Arctic region. While it doesn’t have ships or aircraft permanently assigned to it, it exercises temporary command and control of naval assets deployed to areas over which it has responsibility. The Russian Navy Sierra II class nuclear attack submarine Pskov , which belongs to the Northern Fleet., PSKOV.RU “Our new reality is that when our sailors toss the lines over and set sail, they can expect to be operating in a contested space once they leave Norfolk,” 2nd Fleet commander Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis earlier this year . “Our ships can no longer expect to operate in a safe haven on the East Coast or merely cross the Atlantic unhindered to operate in another location.” “We have seen an ever-increasing number of Russian submarines deployed in the Atlantic, and these submarines are more capable than ever, deploying for longer periods of time, with more lethal weapons systems,” he continued. “Our sailors have the mindset that they are no longer uncontested and to expect to operate alongside our competitors each and every underway.” A Naval Air Crewman assigned to VP-46 “Grey Knights” takes imagery of surface contacts onboard a P-8A during intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drills., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Austin Ingram With Russian submarines, including new-generation designs , presenting a renewed threat along the U.S. East Coast and in the Atlantic, the Navy has been working to counter them in various ways, including through the 2nd Fleet and the development and implementation of new tactics, techniques, and procedures. This latest deployment to Bermuda is well in line with those efforts. As well as having submarines increasingly patrolling in the region, Russian Navy activities are taking place above the waves, as evidenced by an incident in 2019 when the guided-missile destroyer USS Mahan encountered the Russian Vishnya class intelligence collection ship Viktor Leonov allegedly operating unsafely off the East Coast. Last year also saw a Russian Navy surface combatant sail into the Caribbean region for the first time in many years, when one of its newest warships, the frigate Admiral Gorshkov , arrived in the region together with three support ships, visiting Havana, Cuba. The first-in-class Russian Navy Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshko v was sailing in the Caribbean in June 2019., Alexander Galperin/Sputnik via AP It’s not just the Russian Navy that’s increasingly operating closer to American shores. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy is also beginning to establish naval activity in the Atlantic. Although Chinese activities are still far outnumbered by those of Russia, the nature of these operations will also be a cause for U.S. Navy concern. Beijing’s apparent growing interest in the region was also recently underscored by a series of mysterious incidents in which several Chinese students were arrested for taking pictures of U.S. Navy facilities on Key West, Florida. More generally, the Caribbean region is becoming an increasing focus of Chinese interest, with a series of initiatives that look to increase its influence in the area, including significant investments in port facilities and maritime infrastructure. While there’s no clear evidence that any of these projects have a military application, Chinese-funded infrastructure projects do routinely prompt concerns about their dual-use capabilities , whether or not there is any clear intent to use them in this way. P-8’s core missions are anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, in addition to various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft has an anti-ship capability, presently in the form of the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. Being able to operate these aircraft from Bermuda would allow the Navy to conduct potential anti-ship strikes further out into the Atlantic, as well. An ATM-84J Harpoon anti-ship missile training round released from a P-8A during the RIMPAC 2018 exercise., Australian Defence Force/CPL Nicci Freeman The Navy plans to expand the P-8’s arsenal in coming years, as well. With the planned introduction of the stealthy AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, and potentially also various air-launched naval mines, precision-guided bombs, and the Miniature Air Launched Decoy , or MALD, the Poseidons are set to become a much more multi-purpose platform. Based in Bermuda, the Poseidon would then be able to extend its capabilities farther out into the Atlantic without relying on aerial refueling, keeping a watch on Russian and Chinese vessels of all types — and having the ability to strike if need be in new ways. It will also be in a better position to support U.S. Navy vessels operating in the vast region. “The opportunity to operate out of Bermuda will improve multi-domain cooperation while furthering the special bilateral relationship between the United States and Bermuda,” said Lee Rizzuto, the US Consul General in Bermuda, as reported by the Royal Gazette . With Russian naval activities in the North Atlantic showing no signs of diminishing, and Chinese interest in the region also increasing, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the U.S. Navy call upon the Bermudan authorities again in the future. Ultimately, it’s possible that deployments of the advanced maritime patrol aircraft could again become a regular occurrence on the island, reviving yet another element of the Cold War in this new age of geopolitical turmoil.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 25, 2021",New Report On U.S. Military Aircraft Reliability Is Downright Miserable,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Congressional watchdog, says that only three types of U.S. military aircraft reached annual average mission capable rate goals during most of the years between Fiscal Years 2011 and 2019. The Air Force’s UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter was the only type to hit its target rate every single year during that period. Of the 46 types across the services covered in a new report, 24 of them never met those yearly readiness milestones. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its report on U.S. military aircraft mission capable rates, which also covers fluctuations in operations and maintenance costs, on Nov. 19, 2020. This notably comes just over two years after former Secretary of Defense James Mattis underscored concerns about this issue in a memorandum calling for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy to do everything in their power to get the mission capable rate of their various fighter jet fleets up to 80 percent . “Average mission capable rates for the selected Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft have fallen since fiscal year 2011, while average mission capable rates for the selected Army aircraft have slightly risen,” GAO noted. “Program officials provided various reasons for the overall decline in mission capable rates, including aging aircraft, maintenance challenges, and supply support issues.” It’s important to note that the GAO examined annual mission capable rates across different aircraft fleets, rather than full mission capable rates. The difference is that an aircraft is deemed to be mission capable when it can perform at least one of its assigned missions, rather than all of them, which is full mission capable, also referred to as “Code One.” Mission capable rates are also different from basic availability rates, which only cover whether or not an aircraft or helicopter can fly at all. It’s also worth noting that the different services track mission capability differently in some cases. Some services were not able to provide GAO with annual mission capable rate targets for each fiscal year between 2011 and 2019 for some aircraft types. The chart below shows the report’s core findings: GAO The obvious standout is the Air Force’s UH-1N Twin Huey fleet, which hit its mission capable rate goal every year. These helicopters, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , help provide security across the service’s Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fields, as well as VIP transport and other training and support roles at bases around the world. In 2016, the Air Force began a competition to replace these aging helicopters, citing availability and sustainment concerns, something that seems somewhat curious given the data presented here. In 2018, the service picked the MH-139A , now nicknamed the Grey Wolf , as the UH-1N’s successor. The other two types that hit their annual mission capable rate targets for the majority of the fiscal years in question were the Navy’s EP-3E Aries II intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) planes and the U.S. military’s fleet of E-6B Mercury jets, which serve a critical role in the country’s nuclear deterrent architecture. The E-6Bs have specialized equipment for communicating with submerged Ohio class ballistic missile submarines and Minuteman III launch control centers and can even command the launch of the latter weapons from the air, if necessary. You can read more about these “doomsday” planes and their function in America’s nuclear command and control architecture in these past War Zone pieces . An EP-3E Aries II., USN An E-6B Mercury , USAF The Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets, one of the service’s most in-demand platforms for actual combat operations around the world, got close to meeting its yearly mission capable goals more than 50 percent of the time between the 2011 and 2019 Fiscal Years. Another 17 types, including the Air Force’s B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress bombers and the Navy’s EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft and MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, hit their annual targets at least once in that same time frame. The Air Force’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and the Navy’s F-35Cs both met annual mission capable rate goals in two of the nine years in question, while the Marine Corps’ F-35Bs reached the milestone just once. This is perhaps not surprising to regular readers of the War Zone who will remember that details emerged in 2019 that showed very poor mission capable rates in recent years for all three types. This included a period lasting more than two years where the full mission capable rate for the Navy’s F-35C fleet never rose above two percent . Left to right, the US Navy’s F-35C, the US Marine Corps F-35B, and the US Air Force’s F-35A., Lockheed Martin Then there are the 24 types that never met these goals. Some of these entries are not surprising, such as the Air Force’s overworked B-1B Bone bombers or its F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, both of which have been the subject of much public attention over extremely poor readiness rates in recent years. The same goes for the Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18C/D Hornets and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . That the V-22 tilt-rotors that the Marines and Air Force operate struggle with mission capable rates is also something that is well known. That the Air Force’s F-16 Viper fleets have not met annual mission capable rate targets since Fiscal Year 2011, even before Mattis set that goal at 80 percent, is perhaps more notable. That all three of the Army’s primary helicopter types – the AH-64 Apache , the UH-60 Black Hawk , and the CH-47 Chinook – did not once hit this milestone in nearly a decade is significant. It’s worth noting that some aircraft fleets that failed to reach the set annual goal may have been close to doing so and may have had periods within a single fiscal year at or above the target rate. GAO said that in the 2019 Fiscal Year, six types were short of their goal by five percent or less. Another 18 were between six and 15 percent short of hitting the target. However, 11 types failed by a margin of 25 percent or more. As noted, a wide variety of factors impacted mission capable rates, as well. GAO’s report included another chart, seen below, that covers the most common issues that services cited and which ones applied to which aircraft fleets. GAO These myriad factors help explain, at least in part, the multiple instances where newer aircraft have worse mission capable rates than older types, which generally become increasingly more costly and time-consuming to maintain as time goes on as a rule. It also speaks to the effort required to operate and maintain increasingly more complex higher-end modern combat aircraft, especially stealthy types. GAO also took this opportunity to examine how much it cost the services to operate and maintain all of these different aircraft types, finding that some costs went up and down, while others stayed relatively consistent, again depending on a host of factors. “The total fiscal year 2018 O&S [operations and sustainment] costs for the aircraft we reviewed ranged from a low of $118.03 million for the Navy’s fleet of KC-130T Hercules to a high of $4.24 billion for the Air Force’s fleet of KC-135T Stratotankers , with a key factor being the size of the fleet,” GAO’s report said, as an example. “Maintenance costs also varied widely across the aircraft, due to the size of the aircraft fleet and the particular challenges associated with the aircraft. For example, maintenance costs ranged from $43.91 million for the Navy’s fleet of KC-130T Hercules to $2.02 billion for the Air Force’s fleet of C-130H Hercules in fiscal year 2018.” The chart below offers an interesting breakdown of the annual costs to operate and maintain different aircraft across the U.S. military for the 2018 Fiscal Year. GAO What immediately leaps out in the chart above is the whopping $85 million it cost in Fiscal Year 2018 to operate and maintain each one of the Air Force’s four E-4B Nightwatch airborne command post aircraft, another kind of doomsday plane that you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . This goes a long way in helping to explain why the service is looking to replace these Boeing 747-based aircraft. It’s also very interesting to see that the per aircraft costs associated with the Air Force’s E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), around $60 million, are higher than those for the B-2 stealth bomber , somewhere between $40 and $50 million, which is notoriously expensive to operate. Some of that may have to do with the larger size of the overall E-3 fleet, as well as the increasing age of those aircraft, which the service has also been looking into replacing . It’s notable that the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets also cost more per aircraft to operate and maintain than the Legacy F/A-18C/D Hornets it, as well as the Marine Corps, operates. This may well have to do, in part, with the dwindling size of the overall Legacy Hornet fleet, as well as the larger and more complex nature of the Super Hornet design, which is now in the process of receiving major additional upgrades . US Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets., USN It’s fascinating to see how cheap the Army’s helicopter fleets are to operate and maintain compared to the rest of the U.S. military’s aviation fleets, too. While there are many different reasons why certain aircraft fleets might see a drop in mission-capable rates or why services might see changes in how much it costs to operate and maintain certain types, this data is still a significant indicator of just how available and how efficient the U.S. military’s various aviation assets actually are. It’s also very valuable when looking at how the services, as well as Congress, decide where to make additions or cuts in the defense budget to try to increase readiness rates and improve overall capacity for certain mission sets. “The Department of Defense (DOD) spends tens of billions of dollars annually to sustain its weapon systems in an effort to ensure that these systems are available to simultaneously support today’s military operations and maintain the capability to meet future defense requirements,” GAO’s report said. “Operating and support (O&S) costs historically account for approximately 70 percent of a weapon system’s total life-cycle cost — costs to operate and sustain the weapon system from initial operations through the end of its life — and include costs for repair parts, depot and field maintenance, contract services, engineering support, and personnel, among other things.” The Air Force and the Navy, in particular, are both in the midst of major efforts that could transform and revolutionize their aviation fleets . Much of the debate over how best to proceed is predicated on the costs required to keep existing aircraft, especially certain aging types, going now and how it might be possible to do things differently in the future. Operational and maintenance costs are a particularly serious area of concern with the F-35 fleets. The Joint Strike Fighter program, as a whole, is presently projected to have a total lifetime cost of nearly $1.2 trillion through 2070. Defense budgets may well stagnate, or even contract, in the coming years, which will only increase the pressure on services to find a way to balance the need to provide mission-capable aircraft now and the need to modernize their aviation fleets. If this report is anything to judge by, those challenges only look to be increasing in scope and complexity.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 24, 2021",Everything We Know About The United Kingdom’s Big New Defense Spending Plan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. government has announced plans for a major increase in defense spending , adding a projected total of nearly $22 billion to the budget over the next four years. Details about the complete plan are still emerging, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the U.K. Ministry of Defense have said that the additional funding will help support the acquisition of a new class of warships, known as the Type 32, and the development of the Tempest stealth fighter , as well as the creation of a new dedicated Space Command and National Cyber Force, among other lines of effort. Prime Minister Johnson made an initial statement to the U.K. Parliament’s House of Commons regarding the defense spending plan on Nov. 19, 2020, and the U.K. Ministry of Defense issued its own statement on the same day. It’s worth noting that this additional funding is on top of a previous commitment to add $2 billion more to the country’s defense budget, with the combined planned increase being approximately $24.1 billion through 2024. The United Kingdom’s total defense spending across this period is expected to be just under $253.3 billion. This will also keep the United Kingdom well above the defense spending target set out for members of the NATO alliance, which is two percent of a country’s gross domestic product. “For decades, British governments have trimmed and cheese-pared our defense budget and if we go on like this, we risk waking up to discover that our armed forces – the pride of Britain – have fallen below the minimum threshold of viability, and once lost, they could never be regained,” Johnson told Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. “That outcome would not only be craven, it would jeopardize the security of the British people, amounting to a dereliction of duty for any Prime Minister. So I refused to vindicate any pessimistic forecasters there have been by taking up the scalpel yet again.” So far, details about exactly how the extra defense funds will get used are limited, but here is a basic breakdown of what we know so far: Commits the United Kingdom to buy an unspecified number of Type 32 warships, the exact design and capabilities of which are presently unknown. Will help fund the continued construction of the planned eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates for the Royal Navy. Will help pay for the “future solid support ships that will supply our Carrier Strike Group ” and new multi-role research vessels. Adds approximately $1.98 billion for research and development efforts across the U.K. military. This includes additional funds for the United Kingdom’s Future Air Combat System (FCAS) effort, which includes the Tempest stealth fighter , and should not be confused with the Franco-German effort of the same name. Prime Minister Johnson specifically highlighted drone swarm technology , directed energy weapons, developments in artificial intelligence, and improved networking for U.K. armed forces as other areas of focus that could receive additional funding. Pays for the creation of a new U.K. Space Command. This Space Command will oversee the first launch of a U.K. satellite onboard a U.K. rocket from a site in Scotland , which is scheduled to take occur in 2022. Includes funding for a dedicated National Cyber Force to be operated in cooperation between the Ministry of Defense and the country’s General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which is analogous to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Funds the establishment of a new Artificial Intelligence Center for the U.K. armed forces. Help create up to 10,000 jobs in the U.K. defense sector each year over the next four years. While there is clearly still much to learn about the U.K. government’s plans for this defense spending plus-up, this list is already notable in a number of ways. The announcement of plans to buy new Type 32 warships are particularly interesting. It’s unclear if this nomenclature reflects some kind of relationship to the Type 31 class, which will be variants of the Babcock Group’s Arrowhead 140 frigate design, itself derived from the Danish Iver Huitfeldt class . It is possible that these ships may be an improved, more capable subvariant of the Type 31. Regardless, there have long been questions about whether the Royal Navy will have sufficient escorts for its Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers in the coming years based on the total number of Type 26s and Type 31s it presently plans to acquire and with the expected steady retirements of its exiting Type 23 frigates . This is an issue that The War Zone has highlighted on numerous occasions . These additional ships could potentially help address this potential shortfall in the country’s surface fleets. It’s also worth noting that the U.K. parliament released a report just last week raising concerns about how a lack of funding could hobble the Royal Navy’s new carrier strike capabilities . It’s perhaps less surprising that there is a desire to provide additional money for FCAS and drone swarm developments . The U.K. government has laid out an ambitious plan for the Tempest stealth fighter, in particular, which you can read about in this previous War Zone feature , but questions have remained about where the necessary funding for that project might come from. It’s also not clear yet how this defense spending increase may impact how many F-35 Joint Strike Fighters the U.K. Royal Air Force ultimately receives . Leonardo The creation of a U.K. Space Command is also well in line with what the country’s allies, especially the United States, which has created an entirely new branch to oversee space operations, are doing in this regard . Still, it does underscore how vital, and contested , space is for military operations already for the United Kingdom and its allies and partners. This domain is only set to become more important as time goes on. The same goes for the announcements relating to cyber warfare and artificial intelligence . The U.S. military first established its Cyber Command in 2010, which is commanded by the same individual who serves as the director of the NSA, the exact same kind of structure the United Kingdom now says it is looking to adopt with regards to operations in cyberspace. The Pentagon also established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) in 2018 to serve as a focal point for work in this increasingly critical arena across the U.S. military. It’s also worth pointing out that there is virtually no mention of funding for capabilities focused primarily on the British Army. Experts have already raised concerns about whether this might, despite Prime Minister Johnson’s pronouncements, point to cuts in planned modernization efforts for the country’s land forces, including new tanks or other armored vehicles. It’s worth noting that the British Army, as well as the the Royal Marines , have been steadily shrinking in size for years now. “We shall reshape our army for the age of networked warfare, allowing better equipped soldiers to deploy more quickly, and strengthening the ability of our Special Forces to operate covertly against our most sophisticated adversaries,” Prime Minister Johnson told Members of Parliament. Of course, no matter what the U.K. government’s current defense spending plans are, it remains very much to be seen whether they will be able to implement them in full, or even in part, over the next four years. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the United Kingdom and has already had a highly negative impact on its economy, amid a global economic downturn . At the same time, the U.K. government is still pursuing its departure from the European Union , possibly without formal agreements on trade and other issues with that bloc in place, which threatens to cause further economic uncertainty, at least in the near term. There is political uncertainty, too. Johnson is the third U.K. Prime Minister to take office since the country’s 2015 general election and assumed the role after his predecessor, Theresa May, stepped down in 2019 after Parliament rejected her proposed withdrawal agreement with the European Union three times. May had been leading a minority government since 2017, but had managed to survive two votes of no confidence. “Next year represents a huge opportunity for this country, and Defense will be at the forefront of creating the jobs and business opportunities that will help us build back from the pandemic,” U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said of the increased defense spending plan. “Over the next few months, I will set out in more detail our ambitious agenda for Defense.” It will be very interesting to learn more about what the United Kingdom expects to do with this defense spending increase and how the country plans to implement those initiatives. Though definitely ambitious, the plan, as we understand it now, certainly focuses on a number of key areas that reflect broader military trends around the world.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 12, 2021",Iran Unveils Its New Sea Base Warship That Looks Like A Floating Arms Bazaar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has unveiled an unorthodox new multirole warship that it says is armed with anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles and is capable of carrying helicopters, drones, and fast attack boats. Described by local media sources as an “oceangoing warship capable of carrying aircraft,” the Shahid Roudaki is reportedly named after an Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy commander who was assassinated, continuing a recent convention of naming new weapons systems after “martyrs” of this kind. Reportedly measuring 492 feet long, and with a displacement of 4,000 tons, the Shahid Roudaki is a former roll-on/roll-off ship that’s been adapted for military use. It joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy (IRGCN) fleet today in a ceremony attended by IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami and several senior military officials. According to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim News Agency , the IRGC plans to use the Shahid Roudaki as a “marine city,” able to carry out a wide range of missions including combat, reconnaissance, and logistics, “with the purpose of ensuring sustainable security in maritime routes and rescuing trade vessels and fishing boats of Iran and regional countries.” The same report adds that the IRGC Navy has “already expressed readiness to dispatch vessels to international waters.” This suggests that the Shahid Roudaki is envisaged operating outside Iran’s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and could instead potentially range as far as the Red Sea. The various weapons and other systems that are seen on the deck in pictures from the ceremony at least visually reflects the warship’s purported mission spectrum, as a multipurpose vessel for long-range operations. From bow to stern, the weapons visible on deck comprise eight anti-ship cruise missiles in four twin container launchers, six Ababil-2 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a single Bell 412 helicopter, four speedboats, and a 3rd Khordad surface-to-air missile system on a road-mobile transport-erector-launcher plus what appears to be an associated command vehicle. Iranian media reports that the vessel is also equipped with a three-dimensional phased-array radar, plus “advanced communication systems for electronic warfare.” While the type of anti-ship cruise missiles the ship is seen carrying has not been officially announced, there has been speculation on social media that these could be Qader or Qadir weapons, to which Iranian sources attribute a range of 124 miles and 186 miles respectively. These are reportedly derived from the Noor anti-ship missile , which is an Iranian copy of the Chinese C-802. Four twin container launchers for anti-ship cruise missiles are located toward the bow., IRAN PRESS SCREENCAP The Ababil-2 UAVs, which are launched from fixed stands on the ground, are ostensibly designed for surveillance missions, but can also carry explosive warheads and function as “suicide drones.” The Ababil series, and variants and derivatives thereof, has become something of a signature weapon in various conflicts that Iran has been involved with, in recent years, including the Yemeni civil war. Iran has other types of smaller unmanned aircraft, many of which can be used as suicide drones, that it could potentially launch from this ship. Aside from these larger drones, images taken over the bow of the Shahid Roudaki reveal a pair of quadcopters, small-scale UAVs that could be used for surveillance in the vicinity of the warship, or potentially delivering lightweight weapons. These drones pose very real threats, as evidenced by the unprecedented strikes on oil-related infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in 2019, which also involved several land-attack cruise missiles . The U.S. Navy also notably knocked down at least one Iranian unmanned aircraft after it came within “ threatening range ” of the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer in the Strait of Hormuz that same year. An Ababil-2 UAV is displayed in front of the Bell 412 helicopter., IRAN PRESS SCREENCAP The 3rd Khordad air defense system, the last of the weapons visible on Shahid Roudaki’ s deck, is a variant of Iran’s Raad, or Thunder. This surface-to-air missile system is itself analogous to the Russian Buk (SA-11 Gadfly) and came to wider prominence after reportedly being the weapon used to shoot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator drone, or BAMS-D, flying over the Gulf of Oman, in June 2019. The 3rd Khordad surface-to-air missiles atop a road-mobile transport-erector-launcher., IRAN PRESS SCREENCAP The ship’s relatively large open deck could possibly accommodate other weapon systems, as well, including fixed or road-mobile cruise and ballistic missile launchers , or large caliber rocket artillery. Other kinds of mobile surface-to-air missile systems, as well as the radars associated with them, might also fit onboard. An aerial view of the warship Shahid Roudaki. , IRAN PRESS SCREENCAP At least in broad strokes, the Shahid Roudaki appears to be a much smaller version of the U.S. Navy’s Expeditionary Mobile Base concept . Those American ships are variants of the modified Alaska class oil tanker design, which you can read about here . Their role is to provide a persistent and capable maritime presence nearly anywhere on the high seas, and the IRGCN may hope to achieve something similar with its new warship, albeit on a much more modest and regional scale. This wouldn’t be surprising as the Iranians have gotten a very close look at one of these hulking vessels in action in the Persian Gulf , along with other U.S. sea base concepts that have called those waters home over the years. In concept, the Shahid Roudaki also seems to have major parallels with the MV Ocean Trader , a highly modified Special Warfare Support vessel operated by the United States Military Sealift Command and which is able to operate helicopters, jet skis, drones, and various fast boats and Zodiac inflatables. It also uses the roll-on, roll-off cargo ship arrangement as its foundation. However, while there is little to give away the Ocean Trader ’s military mission, the function of the IRGCN’s new warship is made abundantly clear by the assortment of weaponry arranged on deck during its unveiling, at least in the initial photos that have been released by the Iranian state media. In a similar vein, it may also represent a further development of the concept explored by Iran with its covert operations ship MV Saviz , a modified cargo vessel that has reportedly been used for offshore surveillance, command, and liaison duties in the Red Sea in support of the Houthis in Yemen. You can read more about that ship in this previous War Zone piece . There’s also a possibility that this new warship could serve as a “mother ship” for various kinds of discreet or asymmetric operations by the IRGC or other Iranian forces, such as the high-profile attacks launched against tankers in the Gulf of Oman in 2019. These included the use of limpet mines, presumably delivered by combat divers of the type that could be launched on raids from a vessel like the Shahid Roudaki . More generally, there is a noticeable trend toward navies looking to introduce special operations “motherships”. The British Royal Navy, for example, is eyeing a vessel in this class that would be able to support a wider range of operations, including crisis response and disaster relief. The whole idea of leveraging roll-on, roll-off type ships and adapting them to become multi-mission naval platforms is clearly a growing trend, one that Iran has taken note of. MV Ocean Trader packing special operations fast-boats while docked in Norfolk, Virginia. , DAVID KOZDRON Overall, the utility of a floating platform able to accommodate different weapons and surveillance assets as required, depending on the mission, is clear, especially for Iran, whose surface combatants otherwise mainly comprise warships dating from pre-revolutionary times or smaller, indigenous vessels. The versatility of the Shahid Roudaki lies in its modular design, in which weapons and sensors, or other equipment, can be installed as required, potentially at short notice. The value of an Iranian expeditionary sea base, forward-deployed to the Red Sea, could include supporting the Iranian-backed Houthi militia operating in Yemen. It could also serve as a platform for more directly challenging the country’s regional opponents, including Saudi Arabia. It’s worth noting that the exact point of origin for the strikes on Saudi Arabia, which Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed, remains unclear . The United States subsequently accused Iran of carrying them out directly. A question mark remains, however, over how viable the Shahid Roudaki actually would be for any kind of long-endurance, high-seas operation. A cursory examination of the vessel doesn’t seem to reveal drone-launch equipment, missile reloads, helicopter maintenance/refueling facilities or hangarage, or even an obvious means of rapidly deploying and recovering the four speedboats. Furthermore, as currently configured, the various weaponry is all simply placed on deck, seemingly not even lashed down. As such, it is exposed to the elements and potentially at risk from the effects of a deck pitching and rolling in rough seas. In an operational environment, much of this kit would instead have to be stowed in the hold below deck. There’s also the very real problem of the survivability of this type of vessel in a conflict scenario. It’s unclear how resistant the design might be to hostile attacks and, at least in the configuration that Iran has displayed so far, it appears to have limited air and anti-ship defenses. This would hardly be the first time that Iran has made questionable boasts about the capabilities of its warships. Prime examples are the Sahand “stealth destroyer,” a missile corvette type vessel that has no stealthy features, and the Kharg , a fleet tanker with a helipad that has been repeatedly and credulously described as a “ helicopter carrier .” None of this is to say that the Shahid Roudaki might not still offer a useful platform for conducting the kinds of asymmetric and otherwise limited operations that Iran regularly engages in, directly or through proxies, in the Middle East, at least in littoral scenarios. At the same time, until the ship is actually employed on a real-world operation, or in a realistic exercise scenario, it’s hard to know to what degree it is a genuinely capable “oceangoing warship,” or whether it is more of a propaganda exercise intended to show off the IRGC’s missile and drone technologies and to provide an enhanced presence in the littorals near Iranian shores.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 5, 2021",Navy MH-60R Seahawks To Get Magnetic Anomaly Detectors To Help Hunt Enemy Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Navy MH-60R Seahawks are set to get magnetic anomaly detectors , or MADs, which will give them another tool for hunting down enemy submarines. The MH-60R had replaced the earlier SH-60B, which had a MAD system, but this capability was not carried over onto the new helicopters. The decision to add this equipment onto these newer Seahawks comes as Russia and China continue to develop and field new , more advanced submarines and step up their underwater activity in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , as well as the Arctic region . Canadian defense contractor CAE announced on Nov. 18, 2020, that Lockheed Martin had hired it to integrate its MAD-XR system on the MH-60R for the Navy. In September, that service had awarded Lockheed Martin, now the parent company of Seahawk-manufacturer Sikorsky, a contract worth just over $28.5 million for “Phase 1” of the development of a MAD system for these helicopters. CAE’s MAD-XR was the obvious choice. Starting in 2017, the company, together with Lockheed Martin and the Navy, had conducted flight tests of an MH-60R fitted with this system as part of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). A CRADA a non-traditional research and development mechanism by which elements of the U.S. military can pool resources with private companies and other organizations to pursue mutually-beneficial work without a typical contract or even money necessary changing hands. The MAD-XR system., CAE A picture CAE previously released of an MH-60R Seahawk from Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 48 (HSM-48) that was equipped with the MAD-XR system and flight tested as part of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. It’s not clear where the system might be fitted to this helicopter, but it does feature a fairing under the tail boom that is painted bright orange, a color often used to denote the installation of temporary equipment for testing. , CAE “Over the past several years we have conducted several trials with the U.S. Navy to confirm the capabilities of the MAD-XR system on the MH-60R helicopter,” Thomas Kane, Lockheed Martin’s Director of Naval Helicopter Programs, said in a statement regarding its latest deal with CAE. “Adding this to the MH-60R’s sensor suite will further advance the capabilities of the world’s most advanced anti-submarine warfare helicopter.” CAE says that MAD-XR has the same capabilities as its previous AN/ASQ-508 Advanced Integrated Magnetic Anomaly Detection System, or AIMS, but in a much smaller package. The core AIMS equipment weighs just under 60 pounds (27 kilograms), while MAD-XR is only 3.3 (1.5 kilograms) pounds. The Canadian firm has said that its new system, production of which began in 2019, opens up the possibility of adding this system onto a wide array of helicopters, as well as smaller unmanned platforms. The AIMS is in service on a number of larger maritime patrol aircraft, including India’s P-8I Poseidons , Canada’s CP-140 Auroras , Japan’s P-1 , and variants of the P-3 Orion in South Korean and Brazilian service, among others. CAE MAD systems of any kind use a magnetometer to detect discrepancies in the Earth’s naturally-occurring magnetic field, which denote the presence of a metal object, such as a submarine. “The range of the MAD system varies, but will generally detect anomalies at approximately 1,200 metres [~1,312 yards],” according to CAE’s MAD-XR product sheet. Once the system has spotted something, it alerts the crew of the aircraft or helicopter carrying it and provided additional information about the contact and its location. “CAE developed new software that allows for submarine location in the form of lateral and vertical separation (left/right indication) at the closest point of approach (CPA),” the company’s MAD-XR brochure adds. “This new algorithm opens the route for recommended tactical flight path to optimize target localization and detection. The inclusion of high bandwidth frequency to digital conversion provides better detection due to reduced background noise in higher frequencies as well as potential classification on the signature of the submarine.” Additional sensors, such as air-dropped sonobuoys and helicopters equipped with dipping sonar, can be in concert with MAD to further investigate and continue tracking the contact. You can read more about how aircraft and helicopters, as well as ships, go about using MAD and other sensors to spot and track submarines in this War Zone feature . Under its existing contract, Lockheed Martin will now integrate MAD-XR onto six MH-60Rs for further test and evaluation. The clear plan, however, is to add this capability to a significant portion, if not all of the service’s MH-60R fleet. These helicopters already have the ability to launch sonobuoys and dipping sonar, among other capabilities, as seen in the video below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=J1RLKPiS24c However, a MAD system offers an additional method of detecting submarines that isn’t based on the sounds they make. Submarine design philosophy, broadly, is based around making them as quiet as possible in order to make it difficult for opponents to spot and track them. Newer Russian and Chinese designs , unsurprisingly, have features intended to further reduce their acoustic signatures compared to older designs. Modern military submarines often carry expendable acoustic countermeasures , as well, and Russia announced earlier this year that it planned to give its boats expendable sonobuoy jammers , too. While countermeasures also exist for MAD, a mixture of sensors would only give the Navy’s MH-60R helicopters more options for hunting enemy submarines. As noted, this was a capability that the previous SH-60Bs had in the form of their towed AN/ASQ-81 MAD system, another CAE product. The service had also notably declined to include MAD equipment on its new P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes. At present, India’s P-8Is, with their AN/ASQ-508s, are the only Poseidons in service anywhere in the world with this capability. An SH-60B Seahawk, in front, flies with an SH-60F Seahawk. The SH-60B’s red-and-yellow-painted AN/ASQ-81 towed MAD system is visible in its stowed position on the side of the tail boom. The MH-60R replaced both of these helicopter types in US Navy service. , USN It’s not necessarily surprising that the Navy has reversed course now. In recent years, the service has been regularly sounding the alarm about the threats and challenges posed by increased submarine activity among potential adversaries, especially Russia and China . It has engaged in a host of other developments aimed at improving its capabilities to track submarines and otherwise monitor underwater activity, especially in the increasingly strategic Arctic region and the broad expanses of the Pacific Ocean, as well as around Europe . Anti-submarine warfare, in general, is seeing something of a renaissance within the U.S. military, with the Marine Corps also now looking to get into that particular fight, as well as in other countries around the world. With regards to the integration of MAD-XR on the MH-60R, this is a development that could have significant international appeal among other countries that operate Seahawk variants now or are set to receive examples in the near future. At the time of writing, 14 countries, in addition to the U.S. Navy, operated versions of the Seahawk or had MH-60Rs, specifically, on order. As CAE has noted, MAD-XR’s compact size would make it ideal for integration on unmanned platforms, as well. This could make it an attractive addition to the Navy’s MQ-8B Fire Scout drone helicopters, or the larger, more capable MQ-8Cs that are entering service now. Other drones, like those that the Marine Corps may operate in an anti-submarine warfare role, could also leverage this miniaturized MAD technology. An MQ-8C drone helicopter., USN No matter what else might happen, restoring a MAD capability to the Navy’s Seahawk community will give it another important tool in the anti-submarine warfare arena.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has unveiled two new missiles â€” a Â surface-to-surface ballistic missile and a naval cruise missile â€” that could offer the country significant new capabilities. The missiles are notably named after Iranian General Qasem Soleimani , who had been commander of the countryâ€™s Quds Force, and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, both of whom were killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq on January 3, 2020.Â Details of the weapons were revealed by Iranian state TV on August 20, 2020, which is also the countryâ€™s National Defense Industry Day. ğŸ¥ Ù†Ø®Ø³ØªÛŒÙ† ØªØµØ§ÙˆÛŒØ± Ø§Ø² Ù…ÙˆØ´Ú©â€ŒÙ‡Ø§ÛŒ Ø­Ø§Ø¬ Ù‚Ø§Ø³Ù… Ùˆ Ø§Ø¨ÙˆÙ…Ù‡Ø¯ÛŒ Ú©Ù‡ Ø§Ù…Ø±ÙˆØ² Ø¯Ø± Ù…Ø±Ø§Ø³Ù… Ø¨Ù‡Ø±Ù‡â€ŒØ¨Ø±Ø¯Ø§Ø±ÛŒ Ø§Ø² Ú†Ù†Ø¯ Ø·Ø±Ø­ Ø¨Ø²Ø±Ú¯ Ø¯ÙØ§Ø¹ÛŒ Ø§ÛŒØ±Ø§Ù† Ø§Ø² Ø¢Ù†Ù‡Ø§ Ø±ÙˆÙ†Ù…Ø§ÛŒÛŒ Ø´Ø¯ pic.twitter.com/65nnJU2Swd — Ø§Ù†ØªØ®Ø§Ø¨ (@Entekhab_News) August 20, 2020 Iranâ€™s semi-official Fars news agency said the Martyr Hajj Qasem is a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a range of 870 miles. An Iranian state TV report claimed that the missile had been tested against an undisclosed air defense system, successfully evading interception, and itâ€™s also said to be accurate enough to fall within 16 feet of its designated target.

Its appearance suggests it is a two-stage weapon, perhaps the result of mounting an existing shorter-range missile, in modified form, atop a new solid-fuel main stage. The upper stage appears as though it could be derived from one of Iranâ€™s existing short-range ballistic missile designs, some of which already offer a degree of precision capability, as weâ€™ve discussed before here .

Photos apparently depicting the Martyr Abu Mahdi missile show it being launched from a truck-mounted container, suggesting its test campaign is being undertaken on land or that it could also have a coastal defense role against enemy ships.

Hoveyzeh itself appeared visually similar to the ground-launched Soumar, which Iran first presented in public in 2015.Â A Kh-55 missile on display at the Ukrainian Air Force Museum., GEORGE CHERNILEVSKY VIA WIKIMEDIA Both Soumar and Hoveyzeh bear a strong resemblance to the Soviet-designed Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile, examples of which were acquired by Iran from Ukraine in 2001. In the past, Iran has claimed that the Hoveyzeh has a range of nearly 840 miles, considerably more than the new Martyr Abu Mahdi missile and the reason for this discrepancy is unclear. You can read more about the complex history behind these earlier cruise missiles â€” and the subsequent appearance of similar weapons in the hands of Houthi rebels in Yemen â€” in this previous War Zone article . https://youtube.com/watch?v=jJIXPdi-ZLQ Iranian land attack cruise missile – martyr Abu Mahdi (in honor of deputy of head of Iraqi PMU that was killed together with Iranian general Qasem Soleimani) If I understand correctly, this is a variant of the Howeizeh missile for the Iranian Navy, but while it's tested on land. pic.twitter.com/uMX6098xVv — Yuri Lyamin (@imp_navigator) August 20, 2020 Providing the range figures released by Iranian media are accurate, both the ballistic missile and cruise missile would have the ability to hit U.S. bases across the Middle East, as well as Israel and other regional opponents, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Should they enter full-scale service, they would provide a potentially more flexible option than Iranâ€™s longer-range ballistic missiles. In particular, the Martyr Hajj Qasem ballistic missile has been highlighted for demonstrating the considerable progress made by Iran in this field of weaponry. Fabian Hinz, a Research Associate at the Â James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, provided a photographic comparison of the new missile alongside the original Shahab 3. Hinz described the Shahab 3 as a â€œhorribly inaccurate copy of the North Korean liquid-fuel Nodong, itself basically a scaled-up version of the Soviet Scud ,â€ while the new weapon boasts an indigenous solid-fuel motor and precision guidance. A comparison of the original Shahab 3 and the Qasem Soleimani (both of which have about the same range) really shows you how much Iran's missile industry has advanced in the last two decades. pic.twitter.com/XWrDsXkh3q — Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) August 20, 2020 Solid-fuel rocket propulsion seems to be an area in which Iran is particularly proud of its recent developments. Earlier this year, for instance, the countryâ€™s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was keen to highlight the advances itâ€™s made in solid-fuel technology, including its applications for space launch systems . Itâ€™s certainly a possibility that the Martyr Hajj Qasem ballistic missile shares some of this new technology. The appearance of the new MRBM also comes soon after Iran released footage of a test of what was purported to be a newer version of its medium-range Khorramshahr surface-to-surface ballistic missile. Originally unveiled by the IRGC in September 2017, the liquid-fueled Khorramshahr has much in common with the North Korean BM-25 Musudan (also known as the Hwasong-10) design. According to the IRGC, it has a range of around 1,250 miles and can carry multiple warheads, although the latter feature hasnâ€™t yet been independently verified. The latest video, released by the Fars news agency on August 16, 2020, apparently shows the Khorramshahr being tested with a small re-entry vehicle (RV), which could serve to extend its range and potentially enhance its accuracy. The War Zone covered the Khorramshahr in detail in this previous article .Â Prior to the Khorramshahr, Iran also introduced another type of solid-fuel ballistic missile, the Sejjil , apparently with a similar range to the Khorramshahr, and with a two-stage motor. A Sejjil missile is seen on the left as part of a display of IRGC ballistic missiles during Sacred Defense Week in 2011., AP PHOTO/VAHID SALEMI https://youtube.com/watch?v=g1-pzkLjeE0 The significance of these two new weapons â€” and the Martyr Hajj Qasem in particular â€” should not be understated. After all, Tehran has already employed ballistic missiles against American objectives in the region. Iran has also demonstrated its willingness to use short-range ballistic missiles against the forces of the Islamic State in Syria in the past . Tehran also undertook unprecedented missile and drone attacks against oil installations in Saudi Arabia last year, which The War Zone covered in depth here . On January 8, 2020, a barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles struck the airbases at al-Asad and Erbil in Iraq, injuring more than 100 U.S. troops, but not killing any. That missile attack was launched in response to the killing of Soleimani and al-Muhandis.Â Itâ€™s grimly ironic, therefore, that the names of these military commanders now find themselves attached to this new generation of Iranian weapons.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 3, 2021",Enlisted Airmen Can Now Get A Taste Of Air Force Flight Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is poised to overhaul the way it recruits its pilots by opening the very first door in the process to enlisted personnel. The goal is to help fast-track individuals onto a path to becoming pilots, navigators, and other crew members into aircraft cockpits, as well as operating unmanned aerial vehicles, or, at the very least, expose them to the Air Force’s core mission—flying. The new initiative was brought to our attention by Oriana Pawlyk at Military.com . It is an extension of the Rated Preparatory Program (RPP) that the Air Force set up in 2019. “The Rated Preparatory Program provides Department of the Air Force officers and for the first time enlisted applicants, who are interested in cross-training to a rated career field the opportunity to gain and strengthen their basic aviation skills,” explained Colonel Scott Linck, Aircrew Task Force deputy director, in a news release . “This program will allow them to enhance their knowledge through developmental modules and acquire valuable flight time in order to increase their competitiveness as candidates for future undergraduate flying training boards.” While the RPP was, in the past, open to Air Force officers, this is the first time that entry has been extended to enlisted airmen. Candidates, including those who have passed through a separate Space Professional Development Program , who think they have what it takes to earn their wings have until December 31, 2020, to apply for the next course, beginning at Denton Enterprise Airport in Denton, Texas, in spring 2021. The aim of RPP, which the Air Force runs together with the Civil Air Patrol, is not to produce newly minted aviators, but to essentially introduce flying roles to those who attend the program, providing them with a first taste of flight training with a view to hopefully continuing this track as a student until they can eventually become a pilot, navigator, or other aircrew. It’s more about providing experience to inspire a future career path than it is about providing a full-blown flight training syllabus. Aircrews head to Civil Air Patrol aircraft at West Houston Airport prior to flying missions. , U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Lance Cheung “For me, the RPP has been a great opportunity,” Captain Alex Johnson, a combat systems officer who also works in tactical air control, explained in a separate Air Force release . “Just having the ground school and the instruction that you receive from the instructors here … has helped me learn my place in the air and not having to drink so much from a fire hose.” According to Military.com , by the end of Fiscal Year 2020, which came to a close on Sept. 30, the Air Force expected to have a shortage of 1,480 new pilots from its existing training pipeline. With that in mind, the RPP expansion can only be good news. The Air Force’s pilot shortage has been a long time in the making, of course, and previous attempts to address it have had mixed results, at best. Back in 2016, the problem began to be discussed more widely within the service, which had identified a particular problem in pilots being lured away by commercial airlines that could pay them more. Potential fixes were identified, including retention bonuses, enhanced recruiting, and even bringing retired pilots back into service. At the same time, the Air Force has sought to train more pilots to fill the gaps, but the training pipeline has not been producing the numbers of new aircrew needed. With that in mind, the service has looked toward a major overhaul of its flight-training programs to address pilot shortage issues, too. Meanwhile, in the first two years of the RPP, which have not involved enlisted personnel, the program has provided flight experience to 93 individuals, 52 in 2019 and 41 in 2020. This year’s reduction has been attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Air Force, around 90% of officers who completed RPP and applied for Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) in 2019 progressed to become pilots, system operators, or pilots of unmanned aircraft systems. The service also notes that the RPP has been particularly effective in securing pilot ranks for underrepresented communities, including women and minorities. A T-6A Texan II crew prepares the trainer for a flight at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas. , 12th Flying Training Wing Public Affairs/Randy Martin It’s important to note that, despite the new change to the RPP, the Air Force still doesn’t allow enlisted pilots, so successful candidates from enlisted ranks would still need to go through an officer candidate pipeline first before they could even start pilot training. The RPP could still help spark interest in flying among these individuals, but there would be at least an added delay in the process and enlisted personnel aren’t guaranteed to make it through the officer training. The Air Force actually makes clear in its revised RPP application requirements that any enlisted individual looking to sign up has to be eligible right now for commissioning as an officer through Air Force Academy, Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Officer Training School. What else is needed from an enlisted airman, or indeed an officer, to apply for next spring’s RPP 2021 class? The Air Force has provided a checklist of requirements for those thinking of taking part: 1. Any active-duty officer who meets UFT board requirements. 2. Any active-duty enlisted airman or space professional who meets UFT board requirements and qualifies for a commission through one of the three commissioning sources (Air Force Academy, Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Officer Training School). 3. Be a U.S. citizen. 4. Be of high moral character and personal qualifications (members currently having open law violations or criminal investigations, previously convicted by court-martial or having received an Article 15 are ineligible to apply). 5. Have the unit commander’s approval and endorsement. 6. Have a current passing Physical Fitness Test score. 7. Have a Pilot Candidate Selection Method score prior to the RPP class start date. 8. Have less than five hours of total civilian flight time (applicants with greater than five hours of civilian flight time may apply but will only be considered on a space-available basis). 9. Officers: Obtain a U.S. Air Force Initial Flying Class I, 1A, Ground-Based Controller or III flight physical prior to entry into the RPP. 10. Enlisted: Obtain an FAA Class III physical prior to entry into the RPP (Reference PSDM 20-96; consult a local Aviation Medical Examiner). 11. Complete an online self-paced ground course that will be provided prior to the class start date. 12. Be prepared to retake the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test and Test of Basic Aviation Skills at the first available opportunity upon completion of RPP, preferably within two to four weeks. Applicants selected for the RPP will complete the online self-paced ground course first, after which they will embark on a one-week in-resident course to introduce them to aviation fundamentals. “Program participants will garner approximately seven to nine flight hours, ground instruction, and additional training time in a flight simulator,” the Air Force says. It remains to be seen just how successful the new-look RPP will be, especially bearing in mind the time it could take for personnel from enlisted ranks to one day become officers and then make it through the existing pilot-training pipeline. Still, this gives any airman a taste of what flying is like and far better awareness of the basics of the service’s primary mission. It could also help pave the way for enlisted airmen to one day have their own pipeline to become a pilot without attending college or the academy. Bringing back enlisted pilots has long been a hotly debated issue within the Air Force—Chuck Yeager himself was an enlisted pilot in the Army Air Corps. Beyond the enlisted aspect of the program, the initiative should inspire more of the Air Force’s personnel to become pilots and any initiative that can help address the Air Force’s longstanding pilot shortage is sure to be welcomed by its various commands.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020","Missile Defense Madness: Myth Of Perfect Patriots, Magic THAAD, And The ICBM Shield","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With peer state competitors China and Russia in the periphery, along with an emboldened Iran , the looming threat posed by North Korea’s long-range ballistic missiles has resulted in a frenzy of missile defense messaging that is often as wrong as it is in fashion. Emanating from the very tip-top of America’s government, the notion that missile interceptors are some sort of perfect panacea to ballistic missile wielding foes, even rogue states with relatively limited resources, is a lie. And despite the inaccurate claims made by the President on down the line, these systems do offer some form of defense against limited, low volume attacks and the more advanced the enemy missile is, the less reliable American interceptors would likely be under real-world conditions. The War Zone has gone into detail about just how challenging shooting down a long-range ballistic missile is, and how rickety America’s defenses really are when it comes to counter such an attack. But as we enter into a new political environment where hawkish rhetoric is en vogue, the misunderstandings surrounding missile defense and its limitations are snowballing, and the mainstream media isn’t innocent in this phenomenon either. Just today Reuters published a highly circulated article about the possibility of installing a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor battery at a new site on America’s west coast. The report states in part: The U.S. agency tasked with protecting the country from missile attacks is scouting the West Coast for places to deploy new anti-missile defenses, two Congressmen said on Saturday, as North Korea’s missile tests raise concerns about how the United States would defend itself from an attack… …West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack… …Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off… …When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill‎ said in a statement: “The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.” The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department. Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are “competing” for the missile defense installations… …Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites… …In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed. A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company “is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.” He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision.” Big problem here—THAAD isn’t capable of defending the country against incoming ICBMs. It is a system developed to counter theater ballistic missiles. In other words it is meant to swat down short to medium-range missiles, and at the high-end of its envelope, intermediate-range ballistic missiles, not long-range, fast and high-flying ICBMs. The first test of THAAD against a simulated IRBM occurred just last July , and its developmental past had plenty of issues . Additionally, THAAD isn’t capable of defending continent sized areas like America’s high-flying Ground Based Missile Defense (GMD) interceptors. THAAD batteries based on the west coast of the U.S. would be nearly useless as they are built to intercept less capable missiles during their terminal phase of flight. If eventually future iterations of THAAD become capable of swatting down fast and high-flying intercontinental ballistic missiles as they make their final descent towards their targets, such a system may be able to protect key cities on the west coast. But considering North Korea’s latest missile, the Hwasong-15, is capable of hitting anywhere in the United States, and its range is likely to only grow greater in the future, deploying some sort of advanced THAAD battery that doesn’t even exist now to the west coast would mean the North Koreans would just target somewhere else. Really, the whole report is likely based on a misunderstanding of America’s BMD capabilities by head lawmakers and on Reuters and other outlets not having anyone with the knowledge base to question those statements. Sadly, this is an all too common occurrence. US Army THAAD battery troops in front of a launcher and interceptor. , US Army The Pentagon and the Trump Administration look to expand America’s Alaska-based GMD arsenal from 44 interceptors to 64. Those missiles are claimed to be capable of providing a midcourse intercept screen for the U.S., supposedly including Hawaii . Vandenberg AFB in California also has GMD capability, but for testing purposes, and it is not an active ballistic missile defense site. If anything, more GMD interceptors deployed to Vandenberg AFB in an operational format would seem like a much better investment than deploying useless THAAD batteries to locations on the west coast. Regardless, the fact of the matter is that none of these systems have been proven effective in combat. Even their testing conditions remain questionable and likely don’t really simulate real-world conditions where a missile can be fired at a moment’s notice. This is especially true in regards to a situation where multiple enemy missiles are launched over a short period of time. All told the complexities of America’s missile defense systems, and especially of its long-range GMD system and the rickety command and control, communications, and sensor architecture that goes along with it, make its effectiveness outside of scripted test scenarios questionable.” Even the long-running MIM-104 Patriot missile system, which has a controversial past dominated by false statements and metrics as to its anti-ballistic missile effectiveness, has once again turned into a perceived missile shield with almost mythical powers. The PAC-3 variant of the system, which is specially adapted for intercepting short-range tactical ballistic missiles, along with the earlier PAC-2 variant has seen success in Saudi Arabia as of late. UAE has also used the Patriot to swat down incoming missiles. Israel, another operator of the Patriot, has had positive results with the system in recent years as well, even against diminutive drones. But a New York Times article published today paints a different and likely far more realistic picture of the Patriot’s effectiveness when it comes to intercepting increasingly more capable missiles fired by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in western Yemen. A February 12th, 1991 Patriot missile launch targeting Iraqi Scud short-range ballistic missiles. At the time the Patriot was described as one of the biggest successes of Desert Storm, but it turned out the missiles intercepted few if any enemy targets. , Israel Government Analyst Jeffrey Lewis noted in the piece exactly what we at The War Zone have been saying about the Trump Administration in particular for some time now: “Governments lie about the effectiveness of these systems. Or they’re misinformed… And that should worry the hell out of us.” The bottom line here is that missiles of all types, even the finest the West can produce at any cost, fail for a variety of reasons. These can include manufacturing faults, software glitches, environmental factors, wear and tear, and especially operator error. And in many cases multiple missiles are fired at a single target in hopes of overcoming the odds, but even then there is no guarantee they will work, especially if the malfunction is not in the missile itself. And this inconvenient reality isn’t just present in super high-end anti-ballistic missiles, but also in those that are deployed in the air on a daily basis around the globe. Take the AIM-9X Sidewinder failure during the shoot down of a Syrian Su-22 by a US Navy Super Hornet over Syria last June. Reports of the failed Sidewinder missile were turned into ridiculous conjecture by even seasoned defense writers. It seemed as if many people just couldn’t believe that a heavily tested and widely deployed AIM-9X could be a dud or could have failed due to the engagement parameters of the incident or other unforeseen circumstances. Talk of “dirty flares” used by Russians and a story from decades ago about an anomaly with the AIM-9L/M, which has a totally different class of seeker, ran rampant. The whole reaction was surprising as people’s basic understanding of expendable ordnance seemed to have changed entirely over the past two decades. The idea that a missile costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions each, and hundreds of millions or even billions to develop, could fail to accomplish its mission in the age of iPhones may sound unbelievable to many. But it isn’t a strange phenomenon, although it may be attributed somewhat to the greater trust we place in technology and the assumptions that go along with it. The air-to-air missile technology that the USAF bet on big ended up having miserable probability of kill metrics during the Vietnam War. These have slowly improved since, but even in Desert Storm, highly evolved variants of the same missiles used in Vietnam proved far from highly reliable. The quest for reliability of missiles of all types has continued over the last 25 years, and great improvements have been made, but no missile is totally reliable even against canned targets, let alone an enemy who is doing everything they can to survive. You can read a recap of air-to-air missile reliability during Vietnam and Desert Storm here . , USAF The public sees military technology usually in its most sensationalized form—in big Hollywood movies, video games, or flashy Department of Defense and defense industry paid for commercials. Through this unrealistic lens, one missile means one kill. But in reality, that just isn’t true. Often times people will argue about the air-to-air effectiveness of say the F-22 Raptor, stating that it can take down eight aircraft with its eight missiles, versus say and F-35 that can take down four aircraft with its four missiles. Once again, this isn’t accurate. Depending on the situation, two missiles or more would be fired at a single target in order to help up the probability of a kill. With this in mind, the magazine depth of an aircraft or an air defense battery, whether it is shipborne or land-based, looks much smaller. Even during the anti-ship missile attack on US Navy ships patrolling the Red Sea off Yemen, multiple missiles were fired at the incoming anti-ship missile, including supposedly two SM-2s and a RIM-166 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile , in addition to advanced decoys. Even after all these munitions were expended, the Navy still didn’t know if the ship actually shot down the anti-ship missile or if it just crashed on its own accord. Keep in mind that this was a relatively low-threat environment where a non-state actor had possession of rudimentary anti-ship missiles, not a high-end threat environment where a layered missile barrage was possible. Soaring talk of the Patriot’s successes in Saudi Arabia, which could be at least partially inaccurate, has helped lead to the sale of more Patriot batteries to new customers including Poland, Romania, and Sweden. Other Arabian Gulf countries and Japan are also looking to upgrade or greatly expand their missile defense capabilities. Most notably Japan is moving forward with two Aegis Ashore sites stocked in part with SM-3 Block IIAs to help protect from incoming North Korean missiles. But in the meantime, Japan’s key population centers and military installations are being guarded by PAC-3 Patriot missiles. The PAC-3 can provide defense against short-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight, but North Korea could unleash long-range missiles that fly a steep parabolic arc to overcome these defenses, which are imperfect even when targeting missiles flying within their core engagement envelope as we have already discussed. Arleigh Burke class destroyer firing an SM-2 missile., USN Considering what is at stake, both journalists and our political leadership need to separate myth from reality when it comes to the limitations of our ballistic missile defense capabilities. Shooting down a “bullet with a bullet” is a very complex task, and although the American defense-industrial complex has improved the chances of success of doing this across multiple platforms in recent years, the cold and honest truth is that the “ballistic missile defense” concept still remains very much a work in progress. There are some anti-ballistic missile concepts being developed on the dark horizon of defense technology that could add new “layers” of more effective ballistic missile defense, and thus increase the chances that an enemy missile will be neutralized before it can execute its dastardly deed. These include the possibility of introducing a long awaited “airborne laser” capability , albeit in unmanned form, aimed at busting ballistic missiles during their vulnerable boost stage. This is more or less the “holy grail” of BMD as it doesn’t rely on costly interceptors, relies on less infrastructure to work, and it acts as a deterrent in its own way as the missile would fall back down on the country it was launched from. It can also be redeployed with ease. The possibility of a space-based anti-missile layer is also enticing. But these capabilities remain largely conceptual or partially experimental at best, and it will take years to mold them into an operational form, and there is risk that they will never make it to that point at all even after great investment. Considering the finite dollars available for missile defense, competition for bolstering existing capabilities or developing new ones will be intense to say the least. What is important is that the myth of a “missile shield” gives way to realistic talk about the benefits and shortfalls of the systems that make up such a notion. This is especially important when it comes to policy makers and critical decision making. We have discussed this in the past when it comes to President’s Trump’s chronically inaccurate blustering on the subject: “Nobody is saying that the President needs to be a weapon systems expert, but when it comes to missile defense it is critical that he or she comprehends the basic capability types, including their real-world limitations, and how they fit into a larger strategic picture. Just thinking that America is protected by some nearly impenetrable ballistic missile shield and that we can sell something similar to our allies will result in a poor understanding of the overall strategic equation in an entire region. Most importantly it will give a false sense of security to the worst person possible—the individual that will be making major policy and military calls—potentially on very short notice. Metaphorically speaking, throughout history, in many cases when a commander’s troops are equipped with heavy armor, that commander is likely to have them take more risks on the battlefield. But if that armor is far less effective than the commander understands it to be, what would seem like well balanced battle plan can end up being a massacre. The same applies in this case. When you think there is only a three percent chance an ICBM can hit the US, making risky foreign policy and military decisions in regards to the country with the ICBMs is simply more palatable. These chronic misstatements are also a credibility issue. Why delve into the details if in doing so you are always inaccurate? Whether this is a flaw that can be blamed on the President’s advisors or a personal one is immaterial, but the fact that it exists is undeniable. “ A Ground-based interceptor is launched during a test. Roughly three dozen of these missiles are operational at Fort Greely in Alaska. That number is slated to rise to 44, with a request for another 20 missiles being on the table. , AP In the end the best missile is the one you never actually have to use. Avoiding conflicts and relying more heavily on diplomacy and strategic compromise, backed by a well equipped and highly trained military, is a far better solution than a myopic march to war that is backstopped by a extreme reliance on questionable defensive systems that are supposed to keep thousands, or even millions safe from incoming missile barrages. And if a war were to occur with North Korea in the coming months or years, the public will be furious over the failed missile shield that they were told was near perfect when it comes to stopping North Korean missiles. What people should know is the truth, which is that these systems offer some form of defense from small-scale attacks, but they represent anything but an impervious barrier. And it’s very unlikely that a near perfect system will be available anytime in the foreseeable future. This is not just due to technological or financial limitations. It’s also because it is so easy for the enemy, even one with highly limited resources, to effectively counter. Kim Jong Un inspects the monstrous HS-15 ICBM., North Korean State Media Simply put, it is far easier and cheaper for the enemy to simply build more missiles of advancing capabilities than it is to build an anti-missile architecture to counter all of them. Look how fast North Korea’s ballistic missile program has moved along. Within the span of roughly five months, the rogue state went from a highly impressive first iteration of an ICBM to one that is far more capable and imposing, and features a huge nose section that could very likely be filled with multiple warheads and decoys in the not so distant future. These are things our missile defense system isn’t really ready to deal with, and it isn’t clear how many more billions of dollars will be required to make defending against a higher-end threat, and especially a more numerous one, a real possibility. Even North Korea’s evolving submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) capabilities could potentially outmaneuver the THAAD battery deployed to the Peninsula and put other targets in the region at risk on short notice. Based on the rumor chain, we should expect big developments in Pyongyang’s SLBM program in the coming year. So once again we come back to the reality that diplomacy and even compromise is a far better counter for an existential threat like an ICBM armed North Korea than endlessly trying to perfect a missile shield that will feature diminishing returns as North Korea’s capabilities rapidly evolve. Not just that, but there are other ways of delivering nuclear weapon to US shores than atop an ICBM. None of this is to say that building better missile defenses is a useless cause, not in the least. For certain applications and scales the technology can be very useful, even if it is imperfect (Iron Dome for instance). But it must be looked at and relied upon as a temporary therapeutic treatment for our strategic ills and not a cure.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 4, 2021",New Images Of China’s Elusive Catapult-Capable J-15T Carrier Fighter Emerge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently revealed video provides, for the first time, a clear, up-close look at China’s future carrier-based multirole fighter, the Shenyang J-15T, which is derived from the Russian-made Su-33 Flanker-D . Unlike previous Chinese carrier variants of the Flanker, this one importantly features the modifications required to operate from its future catapult-equipped carriers. The video appeared on China’s Weibo social media platform around November 17, 2020, before being fairly quickly removed, and was brought to wider attention by Andreas Rupprecht, an expert on Chinese military aerospace and friend of The War Zone who tweets as @RupprechtDeino . It originates from a Chinese TV news report from an unnamed naval air station, which Rupprecht subsequently identified as Huangdicun. This is the shore base for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-15 fleet, where its carrier aviators undergo training and qualifications. The short report shows three J-15 carrier fighters, two of which appear to be prototypes for the long-awaited catapult-capable J-15T version. The two aircraft in question are both painted in operational PLAN gray colors. Interestingly, they are also powered by indigenous engines, the WS-10 turbofans that also power other Chinese advanced Flanker derivatives, as evidenced by the different appearance of the exhaust nozzles. Previous J-15s utilized Russian-supplied AL-31 engines. A still from the Chinese TV news report showing three J-15s, apparently including a pair of J-15T versions partly covered with camouflage tarps., Chinese TV screencap Another still, this time with a J-15 in the pattern overhead the airfield., Chinese TV screencap A closer view of the J-15T nose landing gear and its launch bar (in the background)., Chinese TV screencap A crudely annotated still from the news report highlighting the WS-10 engines on a J-15T., Chinese TV screencap Outwardly, the J-15T can be readily identified by its strengthened nose landing gear, which is of a distinctly different design from the standard J-15. It has a longer and wider shock-absorbing oleo strut, plus a launch bar to hitch it up to the catapult. The aircraft’s main landing gear is also beefed up. All of this is required to cope with the stresses of catapult launch and arrested recovery on a flattop. Rupprecht assesses that the two gray-painted aircraft are both J-15Ts, but only one can be confirmed as such from the video and they remain in the background of the clip throughout the report. They are parked next to each other and both have the black-and-white circular photo-calibration markings used to help determine test data during trials. Until now, only one J-15T prototype was known to exist, but there were also rumors that a second had been built. Meanwhile, in front of the two gray jets is one of the better-known early prototypes of the J-15, which retains its yellow primer that now looks extremely worn. The presenter states that one of the aircraft seen in the video has been retired from flight-testing and training activities, but doesn’t say which one. It is presumably this older jet. Prototype number 552 was one of two J-15s that performed the first official landings and take-offs back in November 2012 aboard the PLAN’s first aircraft carrier, the revamped Soviet-era carrier Liaoning , which was originally acquired by Beijing from Ukraine. J-15 prototype number 552, apparently now retired from use, with a J-15T in the background., Chinese TV screencap Work on a new version of the J-15 adapted for catapult assisted take-off but arrested recovery, or CATOBAR, configured carriers was first reported in late 2014. The Liaoning , in contrast, has arresting cables for aircraft recovery, but no catapults, and is instead equipped with a “ski jump” take-off ramp on the bow. The first prototype J-15T reportedly took to the air for the first time in July 2016. In November 2016 it was reported that a J-15 — perhaps a second J-15T prototype — launched successfully for the first time from the ground-based electromagnetic catapult facility at Huangdicun, a Chinese equivalent to the troubled Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class carriers . It seems that parallel tests were also conducted using the steam-powered catapult that’s also found at Huangdicun. A satellite view showing a J-15T prototype at the end of the runway at Huangdicun in 2017. , via Andreas Rupprecht It’s unclear when the CATOBAR-compatible J-15T will enter production for the PLAN, but, so far, there have been three batches of standard-series J-15s, with work on the last of these ongoing, to provide the backbone of the air wings for the Liaoning and sister vessel Shandong , a locally-built derivative of the original Soviet design, which also lacks catapults. With that in mind, it seems likely that the fourth production block will comprise CATOBAR aircraft, which will perhaps be designated J-15B. While the latest “reveal” of the J-15T must have been approved by the PLAN and, therefore, can be considered at least “semi-official,” it’s interesting to compare the progress made by this variant with construction work on the Type 003 aircraft carrier. This will be the PLAN’s first carrier with catapults, very possibly the electromagnetic types, and it’s currently taking shape at Shanghai’s Jiangnan Shipyard. Providing China can master the technology involved, an electromagnetic launch system would offer several benefits to the PLAN’s burgeoning carrier air power. When working correctly, the launch system should help increase the number of sorties the carrier can generate and reduce the physical strain on aircraft, reducing demands on maintenance and logistics, as you can read about here . An electromagnetic launch system also makes sense when taking into account reports that China’s Sharp Sword stealth flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) will be deployed aboard PLAN carriers in the future . This type of launch equipment is better able to handle far lighter aircraft, such as drones, compared to traditional steam catapults. Whenever the CATOBAR-compatible J-15 appears in service, it’s clear that the PLAN is eagerly awaiting new fighter equipment. While this is a further development of the existing naval Flanker, rather than an all-new design, the fact it will launch from a catapult, rather than a ramp, promises to significantly increase the payload — fuel, weapons, and other stores — that it will be able to carry. Currently, the basic J-15, and Su-33 from which it is derived, have to operate reduced weapons and fuel loads to be light enough to get off the deck safely. An inflight view of the first prototype J-15T, showing the beefed-up landing gear and catapult launch bar., via Andreas Rupprecht Amid reports of several aircraft losses, in the past, there have also been concerns about the safety of the baseline J-15, which The War Zone addressed here . As such, the new version may incorporate changes to help alleviate those reported shortcomings, which are rumored to relate primarily to an “unstable flight control system.” In 2018, it was reported that the PLAN was seeking a successor to its J-15. While there were some suggestions that this might take the form of a navalized version of the stealthy Shenyang FC-31 , this may well be the CATOBAR type now being tested in J-15T prototype form. If anything else, the new J-15s could make up a mixed air wing with stealthy fighters and drones. There is also a two-seat J-15D version of the PLAN’s carrier Flanker that has been tested, apparently with electronic warfare jamming pods on the wingtips, similar in broad form and function to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler . While the status of this aircraft is unclear, it’s likely that any production version would feature the same CATOBAR changes introduced on the J-15T. A rear view of the first prototype J-15T., via Andreas Rupprecht Potentially, production versions of the J-15D and/or J-15T for the PLAN could also incorporate some of the advanced new features that have been noted on land-based Chinese Flankers, including a possible anti-radiation missile for the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) mission, and an ultra-long-range air-to-air missile . These, or other weapons, could greatly increase the aircraft’s versatility, and lethality, compared to the baseline J-15. As well as the superior capabilities promised by a new version of the J-15, the PLAN urgently needs carrier fighters in general, as it aims to introduce at least four carriers in the coming years, each of which will need an air wing. Furthermore, additional aircraft will be needed to ensure a steady flow of suitably qualified pilots, some of whom, it was recently reported , are being trained as naval aviators after being recruited straight out of high school. It’s not only new fighters that are being prepared for the future carriers. Work is also reportedly well advanced on a carrier-based airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, the Xi’an KJ-600. Last summer there were unconfirmed reports that this aircraft had completed its first flight, from a land base. The KJ-600 is a PLAN equivalent to the U.S. Navy’s E-2 Hawkeye and reflects the service’s ambitions to develop a more comprehensive PLAN carrier air wing. An aircraft of this type would almost certainly require a catapult launch to operate from an aircraft carrier, due to its size and weight, and the limited thrust compared with a fighter jet. With the PLAN at large expanding at a prodigious rate, it’s likely we won’t have to wait too long to see a catapult-capable J-15 go to sea aboard China’s next aircraft carrier.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Whenever new videos of the Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system emerge, my inbox and social media channels get flooded with people asking what the heck they are seeing and especially hearing in those videos. Such was the case on November 17th, 2020, when seven rockets were fired towards the U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital’s sprawling Green Zone after the U.S. announced it was pulling out more troops from the country, leaving a force of just 2,500 behind. Some of the rockets ended up killing an innocent child outside the Green Zone and wounded other Iraqi civilians, while a few others landed inside. As it has for a decade and a half, Centurion was lying in wait near the U.S. Embassy ready to instantly come alive to send its wall off specialized 20mm projectiles into the sky at the incoming threat.

What you are seeing in the video is a dense string of M-940 20mm Multipurpose Tracer-Self Destruct (MPT-SD) rounds. The ammunition is specially engineered to self-destruct at a certain distance so that the string of shells doesn’t take out a city block miles away. The specialized ammunition was originally designed for Centurion’s progenitor, the Vulcan Air Defense System . Since its rushed development back in 2004, at a time when the insurgency in Iraq was rapidly accelerating, Centurion was always meant to be put to use in areas where friendlies literally surround it. Not really innocent locals, but primarily U.S. and allied service members and contractors, or even buildings full of diplomats and support personnel. It is also used to protect far more advanced and longer-range air defense systems, like the Patriot , from low-end attacks. A Centurion weapon system is test fired on Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, Jan. 13, 2018. , US Army It is a short-range system that isn’t there to knock down enemy aircraft or guided missiles, but is instead meant to swat lower-end artillery shells, mortar rounds, and rockets out of the sky before they can land within a fairly limited radius, roughly under a mile, that lies beneath its protective umbrella. As such, the engagement windows are very short and the reaction times are tiny. Because of this, those who have served amongst this robotic guardian are all too aware that its protection comes at a startling cost. Literally, it startles the hell out of people. This is especially true when raid sirens that sound to tell people to take cover have little time to beat Centurion to the audible punch. The sound of the weapon’s 20mm Vulcan cannon, a Gatling-style gun nearly identical to the ones used in numerous American fighters built over the decades, from the F-104 to the F-22 Raptor, is as terrifying as it is fascinating. While the A-10 Warthog’s famed GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm cannon gets all the “BRRRRTTTT” love, the Vulcan puts out a similar, but slightly less throaty howl. It’s a product of spewing between 3,000 and 4,500 rounds per minute out of its six revolving barrels. https://youtube.com/watch?v=AcTXYtB9Lfs https://youtube.com/watch?v=J087UXUt6BM https://youtube.com/watch?v=dKits_TkqX0 Centurion was adapted directly from the Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), which has stood guard on a huge array of U.S. Navy and allied vessels for four decades, and still does so today in regularly upgraded form. A big difference between the systems, beyond the fact that one is mounted on a mobile flatbed trailer while the other rests on a ruggedized naval weapons mount, is the fact that the CIWS sprays Mk 149 tungsten-cored armored piercing discarding-sabot (APDS) projectiles, not self-destructing shells. The ship-based system buys back additional range and minimizes dwell-time on a target by attempting to shred it with a barrage of these super-dense tungsten penetrators. Centurion doesn’t have this luxury as that barrage of penetrators could do massive harm to nearby life and property. That doesn’t mean Centurion’s self-destructing shells are perfect, but they are a far better choice for its mission set than the alternatives. A Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar weapon system is test fired on Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, Jan. 13, 2018. The C-RAM will be used as a response to indirect fire attacks on the base., US Army Both systems are equipped with a similar Ku-band search radar (the dome on top) and tracking radar (located above the gun barrels in the front of the cylinder enclosure). The software is different though as the threats are quite dissimilar, as is each variant’s operating environment. Gauging if the threatening artillery projectile is actually a threat to the area the Centurion gun system protects is a key factor that can influence whether it attempts a shoot down or not. Both systems also feature a similar bore-sighted electro-optical system for target identification, tracking, and kill evaluation. As such, it is a self-contained system that can work on its own without being networked into a larger integrated defensive system, although it can be. Still, oftentimes multiple Centurions guard a single base, providing enough coverage area to defend sensitive locales and extra engagement capability for more complex attacks. It’s thought that the Centurion system holds about five to nine engagements worth of ammunition depending on the situation. A maintainer works on Centurion. , US Army It isn’t clear what the success rate is for Centurion, but I have heard numbers between 60% and 80% thrown around. Clearly, the system’s effectiveness is limited by its direct fire nature and the volume of fire that is incoming at any given time. In other words, it really isn’t designed to counter high-volume simultaneous attacks. While dozens of Centurions were built, some of which still serve today, many more C-RAM solutions now exist. These include the far more capable and farther-reaching Israeli Iron Dome , other larger caliber automated gun systems , and new directed energy (laser) C-RAM systems, the latter of which will be fielded in the not so distant future. But, even with these options, Centurion still stands watch over U.S. troops and diplomats that are tasked with operating in one of the most unwelcome working locations on earth.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 15, 2020",Greece Says It Is Willing To Take Second-Hand F-35s As Part Of An Urgent Request: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Athens has reportedly formally requested information from the Pentagon on the Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter as it eyes a possible purchase of between 18 and 24 of the jets. If the deal goes through, it would mark an ironic twist in the ongoing saga of the Greek-Turkish standoff in the Aegean , after Turkey was itself ousted from the Joint Strike Fighter program in 2019. According to the country’s Proto Thema newspaper, the formal Letter of Request (LOR) was sent to the U.S. Department of Defense by Greece’s Ministry of Defense on November 6, 2020. This outlet said it had obtained a copy of the document, which reportedly requested the “immediate purchase” of either new or former U.S. Air Force F-35As, or perhaps a mixture of both. “The decision to enter the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will be based on a variety of factors such as the delivery schedule of the fighters, the repayment plan, the configuration of the aircraft and a possible combination to obtain a total of 18 to 24 jets (new or used by the U.S. Air Force, if available),” the request said, according to Proto Thema. “Due to internal fiscal arrangements and other applicable rules within the EU [European Union] budget and deficit framework, it is crucial that the first F-35s be delivered in 2021. For our part, we will do everything possible to implement this ambitious program.” The LOR was reportedly signed by Greece’s Director General of Armaments and Investments, Theodoros Lagios. According to the quotes shared by the same newspaper, Lagios has also called for U.S. officials to visit Greece “as soon as possible” to start negotiations over a possible F-35 purchase. The extremely ambitious desire to have its first F-35s delivered next year is presumably the reason that the Greek Ministry of Defense has specified the option of receiving former U.S. Air Force jets. This would avoid having to wait for available production slots on the busy Lockheed Martin assembly line at Fort Worth, Texas, but is not an avenue that’s been utilized for any F-35 export orders so far. Such a rapid introduction of Joint Strike Fighters would also require fast-tracking of the required support elements, not least the unique infrastructure, including the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), that would be required on-site in Greece to aid the bed-down of the new jets and their introduction to operational service. An overhead crane lifts an F-35A from an electronic mating and assembly station at the Fort Worth factory., Lockheed Martin In addition, although the U.S. Air Force does have early-production F-35s that are of arguably limited combat capability, these fulfill an important training role as part of the multinational effort to generate aircrews for the Joint Strike Fighter program. Moreover, the U.S. Air Force has previously indicated that it wants to divert some of these older aircraft to aggressor units . It’s important to note that a LOR does not imply that Greece will definitely acquire the F-35, either, and the reported requested timeline may ultimately be impossible to achieve. Still, it’s noteworthy that this expression of interest follows so soon after the country’s decision to acquire 18 Dassault Rafale multirole fighters from France, a deal that The War Zone previously reported on . Once again, the Rafale order calls for a mixture of new-build and surplus jets (in this case from the French Air Force), to expedite deliveries. The first Rafales are expected to start arriving in Greece in early 2021, at a rate of one per month, beginning with the first six of a planned lot of 12 former French Air Force aircraft. The remaining six aircraft that the Greeks have ordered are expected to be new-build jets. A two-seat Rafale B. Greece is expecting the first six Rafales to arrive in the country in the first half of 2021., DASSAULT AVIATION Clearly, Athens is embarking on a major overhaul of the Hellenic Air Force, likely with an eye on Turkey’s increasing military ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, and elsewhere . Proto Thema notes that Turkey’s recently tested S-400 air defense system “could create problems in the daily activity of the [Hellenic] Air Force” and suggests the fighter plans are an effort to counter this. In October 2020 the Greek newspaper Estia reported that the country might receive the F-35s that were ordered by Turkey and then withheld following that country’s dramatic ejection from the Joint Strike Fighter program. This was the result of Ankara’s insistence on acquiring S-400 air defense systems from Russia, a saga that was discussed in detail by The War Zone in the past. Although the U.S. Defense Department announced earlier this year that the U.S. Air Force will buy eight F-35As originally built for Turkey, it’s known that at least 14 jets from the Turkish order have actually been completed , so there remains a possibility that some of these could be transferred to Greece. As well as the S-400 threat, Turkey currently possesses a numerical advantage in terms of fighter jets, as The War Zone analyzed in this previous feature . Should Greece and Turkey go to war, the Hellenic Air Force’s potential combination of Rafales and F-35s would provide a balanced force that could be expected to gain air superiority over the Aegean region, including operating at least partly from dispersed island bases, as well as conducting long-range land-attack missions and anti-shipping strikes. The F-35 is set to gain the capability to prosecute anti-shipping strikes using the air-launched Joint Strike Missile version of the stealthy Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile . Japan has already ordered these weapons for its Joint Strike Fighters. Meanwhile, the AGM-154E Joint Stand-Off Weapon — Extended Range (JSOW-ER) as recently offered to the United Arab Emirates would provide the ability to conduct anti-shipping and land-attack strikes at significant ranges. Furthermore, the F-35s could act as efficient force-multipliers for other assets in the Hellenic Air Force tactical inventory, which is currently dominated by F-16 Vipers, which are in the process of undergoing a wide-ranging upgrade . In this way, a relatively small fleet of Joint Strike Fighters could be leveraged to achieve an effect beyond the capabilities of a larger force of less sophisticated jets. Were Greece to buy F-35s as well as Rafales, it would continue the tradition of the Hellenic Air Force operating fighter jets from both France and the United States, which could ensure a continued supply chain for at least one of the fleets, in the case of sanctions or other restrictions imposed should Greece ever go to war. A Hellenic Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet lands. The service has a long history of purchasing fighters of both American and French origin., Allied Joint Force Command Naples While it’s unclear what will happen next in regards to a possible F-35 purchase, there’s no doubt that the Joint Strike Fighter has been on Greek officials’ radar for some time now. In December 2019, the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis revealed that he would be discussing a potential purchase of Joint Strike Fighters with U.S. President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House the following January. “We can deepen our defense cooperation even further, for example in the sector of drones,” Mitsotakis told Greek newspaper To Vima , at the time. “We will also begin a discussion on eventually acquiring F-35 aircraft, once fiscal conditions permit.” The latest development would suggest that those “fiscal conditions” may now permit an F-35 purchase to be looked at more seriously. The potential arrival of the Joint Strike Fighter in the Aegean would provide the Hellenic Air Force with a significant capability boost in any future conflict, including against Turkey.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 3, 2020",Watch This Spanish Customs Speedboat Go Full Miami Vice By Ramming A Smuggler,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to possible narco smugglers, the seas can suddenly become an unfriendly place. Case in point, this video that appears to show a go-fast boat being chased and almost hit from the rear by a Spanish Customs Surveillance Service high-speed interceptor boat, before it makes another run at the smugglers and actually rams into them. Check out the video below: The details behind the video are unclear, but some have mentioned that this is a tactic used to disable the smuggler’s outboard motors. Regardless, the move the skipper of that interceptor pulled was very bold, to say the least. All I could hear thundering in my ears while watching it was this: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Mcyx61jUs The ’80s hit action detective show was known for its fast-boat scenes, exotic cars, big bright colors, totally ’80s fashion, melodramatic montages, and its heavy synth soundtrack. The latter has created its own legion of new fans more interested in the retro feel of it all than anything else. There was also the subsequent bizarre Hulk Hogan-helmed show Thunder In Paradise that involved a stealth cigarette boat that would have been totally at home in the scene that occurred off the Spanish coast. Back to reality, fast-boat interceptors have remained a critical tool for taking down drug runners trying to race their contraband onto a country’s shores. They often work with other assets, including helicopters, to better execute a successful bust. As technology has evolved and the cartels have invested into enhanced capabilities that can, in some cases, outpace law enforcement’s own equipment, relying on airborne assets has become even more critical, as has acquiring ever more powerful interceptor boats. Spain’s Customs Surveillance Service has an array of interceptor boats of various sizes and capabilities that concentrates heavily on drug interdiction. Cormorán class (Rodman-55HJ) high-speed interceptor boat Águila I. , Outisnn/Wikicommons The scourge of drug smuggling into Spain has resulted in a remarkable shift in recent years from the common use of fast boats, which is still very much a thing , to the appearance of large narco-submarines packed with cocaine. Up until 2019, this type of craft was a staple of smuggling in the Americas, not Europe, but that has since changed . While speed is certainly important for intercepting these hard to detect semi-submerged assets, actionable intelligence, and military-like sea control and anti-submarine capabilities have become more important. Regardless, the video certainly shows that the Spanish Customs Surveillance Service’s fast-boat teams certainly mean business and are not shy about getting a possible smuggler’s attention, let alone stopping them dead in the water via using their own vessel as an impact weapon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2019",Army Hires Company To Develop Cyber Defenses For Its Strykers After They Were Hacked,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has hired a company to develop a prototype cybersecurity kit for its Stryker family of 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles. This comes more than a year after it first emerged that unspecified “adversaries” had successfully launched cyber attacks on up-gunned XM1296 Stryker Dragoon variants, which The War Zone was first to report . On Nov. 16, 2020, Virginia-based cybersecurity firm Shift5, Inc. announced that it had received a $2.6 million contract from the Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office ( RCCTO ) to “provide unified cybersecurity prototype kits designed to help protect the operational technology of the Army’s Stryker combat vehicle platform.” The company says it first pitched its plan for these kits at RCCTO’s first-ever Innovation Day event in September 2019. “Shift5 is answering the call to arms about military weapon system cybersecurity vulnerabilities,” Josh Lospinoso, the company’s CEO, said in a statement. “Our products are currently deployed protecting commercial rail and aircraft, and this newest engagement will integrate our products onto military ground vehicle platforms.” An XM1296 Stryker Dragoon., US Army “Over the course of a year, Shift5 will develop, test, and refine an enhanced vehicle security system prototype and deliver a transition-ready product,” the firm’s press release added. “The Shift5 solution will increase the cyber survivability of the vehicle across the full lifecycle.” It remains unclear exactly how the Stryker Dragoon, also referred to as the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-Dragoon (ICV-D), or other variants in that family of vehicles are vulnerable to cyber attacks and how Shift5’s kit will help protect against or otherwise mitigate those threats. We do know that the Army has been aware of these issues since at least 2018 and that the vulnerabilities are real. A US Army Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) variant, carrying British Army troops, fires the .50 caliber machine gun mounted in its remote weapon station during a multinational exercise in Poland., US Army “Adversaries demonstrated the ability to degrade select capabilities of the ICV-D when operating in a contested cyber environment,” according to an annual report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, covering activities during the 2018 Fiscal Year. “In most cases, the exploited vulnerabilities pre-date the integration of the lethality upgrades.” The “lethality upgrades” referred to here center on the integration of a turret armed with a 30mm automatic cannon onto the Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) variant of the Stryker, resulting in the Dragoon version. The indication here is that the cyber vulnerabilities were present in systems also found on unmodified ICVs, suggesting that the issues are, or at least were, impacted other Stryker variants, as well. This is further supported by a brief mention of the threat cyber attacks posed to the entire Stryker family in DOT&E’s annual review of activities for the 2019 Fiscal Year. “Government testing revealed cybersecurity vulnerabilities,” that report said bluntly. The reports for both the 2018 and 2019 Fiscal Years both recommended actions to “Correct or mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.” It’s interesting to note that the 2019 Fiscal Year ended on Sept. 30 of that year, the same month that Shift5 says it first pitched its cybersecurity kits for the Strykers to the Army. It’s also still not clear who the “adversaries” mentioned in the DOT&E report for the 2018 Fiscal Year were and where those apparent attacks occurred. It remains very possible that this was a reference to Russian forces in Europe, who have been linked to cyber and electronic warfare attacks in the region, including against U.S. troops, in the past. Russia has carried out electronic warfare attacks on U.S. military aircraft and drones in Syria. Although it seems less likely, it may also have been a reference to American troops playing the role of adversaries, also known as the Opposing Force (OPFOR), during training. We know that the Army has been increasingly working to integrate electronic and cyber warfare attacks into exercises , and rightly so as it will only become more likely that U.S. forces will experience these kinds of threats during actual operations around the world as time goes on. The scope of what cyber warfare encompasses on the battlefield will expand, as well. As it stands now, Russia and China , among others, have demonstrated the ability to spoof , as well as generally interfere with satellite navigation systems, which could impact the ability of U.S. forces on the ground, as well as in the air and at sea, to maneuver and determine the accurate position of other friendly forces. At the very least, it could disrupt commercial support infrastructure that would be critical to any war effort. There have also been reports for years now that some cyber warfare attacks are capable of commanding certain systems to perform various tasks, such as pointing radars in the wrong direction , or just crashing their software and disabling their hardware components, remotely . Industrial controls, in general, are a known risk. There is also the risk of vulnerabilities that a hostile actor could exploit to gain access to sensitive networks and the data therein. A 2018 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, highlighted digital radios, radar receivers, and other wireless links as potential vectors for cybersecurity attacks on American weapon systems. These were in addition to more physical pathways to gaining access to systems or networks, such as USB and other ports on computers and other pieces of equipment, and getting hardware that has been tampered with in some way into the supply chain. A graphic from a 2018 Government Accountability Office report showing various potential vectors for cyber attacks on a fictitious weapon system. , GAO It’s good that the Army is finally working to harden its Strykers against these kinds of threats, but how long it has taken to just begin prototyping these cybersecurity kits shows that there is still much work to be done.
