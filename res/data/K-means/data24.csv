By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Although largely overshadowed by the announcement of a raid in Syria that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, one of the U.S. Air Force’s two top-secret X-37B unmanned, reusable space planes is back on solid ground after a record-setting 780 days circling the planet. Just what it was doing up there since its launch in 2017 remains largely classified, but the marathon mission comes as the United States, and potential adversaries , is increasingly exploring new options for getting payloads outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, or otherwise accessing space, that are faster, more flexible, and are less predictable. The X-37B in question landed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility at approximately 3:51 AM on Oct. 27, 2019, after finishing what was formally known as Orbital Test Vehicle Mission 5, or OTV-5. The Air Force had first launched this space plane from the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A on Sept. 7, 2017. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket boosted it into the highest inclination orbit of any of the OTV missions to date, an immediate test point that demonstrated an expanded operational envelope for the X-37B. When the development of this space plane first began in 2006, the Air Force said it expected it to be able to stay in orbit for up to 270 days. “This program continues to push the envelope as the world’s only reusable space vehicle. With a successful landing today, the X-37B completed its longest flight to date and successfully completed all mission objectives,” Randy Walden, the director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, or RCO, said in a statement . “This mission successfully hosted Air Force Research Laboratory experiments, among others.” US Air Force personnel examine the X-37B after it landing following the completion of OTV-5., USAF The Air Force has generally declined to offer any significant details about the “experiments” that the X-37B has supported during any of the five OTV missions since 2010. We do know that the space plane carried unspecified “ experimental electronics ” and an experimental oscillating heat pipe, a type of heat sink, as well as equipment to monitor its function, as part of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader II (ASETS-II) effort. “The OHP is a simple, wickless heat pipe capable of rejecting more than 200 times the maximum heat load of an axially grooved heat pipe, and transporting more than 45 times more heat than copper,” according to an AFRL fact sheet on the project. “In addition to outperforming traditional thermal management technologies, OHPs enable low-cost manufacturing techniques due to the lack of an internal wick structure. OHPs provide a low-cost method to alleviate electronics thermal constraints and allow for increased processing  power, or bandwidth, for commercial and military users.” A cutaway of an OHP, like the one that X-37B carried during OTV-5, showing its distinctive microchannel pattern., USAF The complete ASETS-II test fixture., USAF RCO director Walden’s statement also said that OTV-5 provided “a ride for small satellites,” which some took to mean that the X-37B launched small satellites during the mission. If true, this could be problematic as the U.S. government never registered any additional objects entering space, as is required by international conventions. However, this is more likely a reference to the fact that a number of small satellites shared space on the Falcon 9 rocket during the launch in 2017, something the Air Force announced at the time , not that the space plane itself launched them after arriving orbit. At the same time, it is important to remember that the X-37B is clearly intended to be able to launch and recover objects in space. BOOM! This mission successfully hosted Air Force Research Laboratory experiments, among others, as well as providing a ride for small satellites. #RecordBreaking #AirForce https://t.co/kccOZqsqTQ — Air Force Research Lab – AFRL (@AFResearchLab) October 27, 2019 We also know that the previous OTV-4 mission involved the test of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s XR-5A Hall-effect thruster, a type of electric propulsion system that offers greater efficiency for satellites and spacecraft maneuvering in orbit. This was officially in support of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program, but the technology could be valuable for other space-based systems, as you can read about more here . In August 2018, during OTV-5, the X-37B modified its orbit using an unspecified onboard propulsion system. During OTV-4, which lasted 718 days, the X-37B had also carried approximately 100 samples of materials from for use in building spacecraft from NASA in order to test how they stood up to the rigors of extended time in space. This included items that NASA had previously experimented with on the International Space Station. “We’re doing experimentation. You know that, publicly we’ve said that,” said at an Air Force Association event just last week. “We’re doing experimentation predominantly to get after what I’ll say is buying down risks for things that can be very expensive in space, and get a good solid understanding of how one would prepare ourselves for either a large buy, an expensive buy if you will, or in this case, get on with how one wants to operate in the future.” There has also been widespread speculation over the years about what else the X-37Bs might be doing, including whether they might be gathering intelligence or conducting other operational military missions of some kind. In July 2019, former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who had already left her post as the service’s top civilian by that time, had reignited those discussions by making curious claims about the space plane’s capabilities. It “can do an orbit that looks like an egg and, when it’s close to the Earth, it’s close enough to the atmosphere to turn where it is,” she said at the annual Aspen Security Forum. “Which means our adversaries don’t know – and that happens on the far side of the Earth from our adversaries – where it’s going to come up next. And we know that that drives them nuts. And I’m really glad about that.” It remains unclear exactly what type of operational envelope she might have been referring to, but this could reflect the X-37B’s ability to dip a wing into the atmosphere as it passes by, using that force to rapidly redirect its orbit. However, experts and amateur observers, who had been actively tracking the X-37B’s movements during OTV-5, almost immediately questioned whether the space plane had actually been performing such maneuvers or even had this capability. It’s also not clear why, if these orbital characteristics offered such a benefit for keeping potential opponents befuddled about the X-37B’s activities, she would publicly disclose them. Amateur observers routinely track the X-37 and it … doesn’t do this. pic.twitter.com/3Sx5nAu9MG — Dr. Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk) July 20, 2019 Mysterious X-37B Military Space Plane Caught on Camera (Photo).

The space plane is also a clear demonstration of the value of using unmanned platforms, which can conduct operations beyond the limits of human endurance and without the need for life support systems. The record for the longest stay by any individual in space, which Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov set between 1994 and 1995 aboard the space station Mir, sits at 678.7 days and required regular supply shipments, as does any crewed space station . At the Air Force Association gathering, he suggested the service was using them to test various concepts of operation for reusable spacecraft, which could be applicable to future systems, according to Air Force Magazine . He also said that “the data are still out” on whether the Air Force might want further improved X-37s, and more of them, or an all-new follow-on spaceplane . Boeing, which built the X-37Bs for the Air Force, as well as the smaller X-37A for NASA, is now under contract to design and build a new reusable space plane, the XS-1, for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The central focus of the XS-1 effort is all about being able to rapidly get payloads into orbit to replace other assets that may have been damaged or destroyed for any reason, including through hostile action. You can read more about that program in this past War Zone piece . Increasing and very real concerns about a potential adversary employing anti-satellite capabilities during a crisis to degrade U.S. military access to space-based early warning , intelligence gathering , communications and data sharing, navigation , and more, have been driving these types of developments. Russia and China both, among others , have been actively working to develop terrestrial and space-based methods of disabling or destroying targets in orbit. This growing military space race, which includes plans in multiple countries for placing ostensibly defensive weapons in orbit, is also what has prompted the Pentagon to re-establish U.S. Space Command and led advocates in Congress to push for an all-new Space Force service branch. There have also been signs of growing interest in reusable space planes, as well as aerial two-stage-to-orbit space launch systems, in other countries, such as Russia , India , and China . Whereas the X-37B uses a traditional rocket concept, these concepts use two-stage-to-orbit systems that leverage a mothership aircraft flying in the atmosphere to air-launch a payload into space. You can read much more in detail about U.S. efforts in this realm in this past War Zone feature . “The safe return of this spacecraft [the X-37B], after breaking its own endurance record, is the result of the innovative partnership between government and industry,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in his own statement after the completion of OTV-5. “The sky is no longer the limit for the Air Force and, if Congress approves, the U.S. Space Force.” The X-37B program is already looking toward its next mission, scheduled to start in 2020, during which it will continue to help the Air Force – and maybe the Space Force – develop new and advanced space-related capabilities as that domain becomes ever-more important to U.S. military operations, as a whole.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 31, 2019",Everything We Know And Don’t Know About The Raid That Killed ISIS Leader Al Baghdadi (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the evening of Oct. 26, 2019, in Syria’s war-torn Idlib Province, a U.S. special operations raid killed one of history’s most despicable human beings, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This man was the mastermind of the ISIS caliphate and presided over some of the most depraved acts against humanity seen in generations. His departure from existence is incredible news for the world. That being said, here’s what we know about the historic and high-risk operation. President Trump, who first tweeted that “something very big has just happened” at 9:23 PM local time in Washington D.C. on Saturday evening, talked for nearly an hour and a half about the raid on the morning of Oct. 27. Here are all the main points garnered from his remarkably extensive comments and keep in mind that some of this information is likely to change: Raid occurred under the cover of darkness in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria. The target was a fortified compound that sat above a number of tunnels, all but one of which were thought to be deadends. Al-Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel with three children. He detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and the three children and collapsing the tunnel. Debris was removed and an on-site technician executed a DNA test that came up positive. What was left of him also matched his description. Cadavers are being brought back to the United States for further analysis. Trump said al-Baghdadi was crying and screaming before death and that he died “like a dog” and “a coward.” The team spent roughly two hours in the compound and retrieved large amounts of intelligence for analysis and exploitation. No American service members were killed in the operation. Special operators were met with a ground fire when they arrived. The targets were neutralized from the helicopters. A hole was blown in the side of the compound to access its interior instead of going through a door as it was thought they would be boobytrapped. One combat K9 was injured after chasing al-Baghdadi into the tunnel, but did not die. A large number of ISIS fighters died with a smaller group captured. They are now in an undisclosed prison. 11 children were rescued safely during the raid and were turned over to an undisclosed local party. Two women who were wearing suicide vests were also killed, but they did not detonate their vests. An explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) robot was on-site to move down the tunnel if needed, but the raid moved too fast for it to be used. Trump watched the raid in real-time from the Situation Room along with Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary Esper, the Joint Chiefs Of Staff including Chairman U.S. Army General Mike Milley, and National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien. The room also held other intelligence and military officials and advisors. Trump noted the technology behind his ability to watch the raid directly was very impressive and it was “as though you were watching a movie.” Only American forces were directly involved in the operation. Eight special operations helicopters were used in the operation, which flew through Syrian, Russian, and Turkish defended airspace during the mission. Flight time was 1 hour and 10 minutes in and was considered among the most dangerous parts of the operation. The helicopters took an identical route in and out. Russia received advanced notice of a U.S. mission in order to deconflict airspace, but they were not told about the target of the operation. Trump thanked Iraq, as well, for their cooperation, although exactly what it entailed is unclear. The helicopters flew at very low level and at very high speed during their ingress and egress to the targe area and took small arms fire along the way. It is thought that these were locals just taking potshots at the helicopters. The operation was supported by substantial airpower operating at very high-altitudes according to Trump. He also stated that many ships and planes were involved. The Kurds supplied useful intelligence leading up to the raid. Trump said the helicopters landed at “a friendly port in a friendly country.” Trump said that he entered the Situation Room at around 5:00 PM and that the helicopters launched shortly after that. He sent his tweet after they landed safely at 9:23 PM. Intel about al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts started the chain of events that led to the operation a month ago. He was under surveillance for weeks. Two or three times similar operations were canceled within that one-month timeframe. Al-Baghdadi constantly changed his plans on the fly and never used cell phones, etc., complicating targeting. Further confirmation of his presence at the compound occurred and the mission was set to be executed for three days before it began on Saturday evening. Trump stated that al-Baghdadi was in Idlib to rebuild ISIS and that he had large amounts of cash on hand to do so. Beyond Trump’s own comments, there have been multiple stories citing anonymous U.S. government sources, as well as those from other countries in the region, that have offered additional, albeit unconfirmed details about the operation. The exact composition of the raiding force, as well as where it started from initially and where it ended, remains unclear, along with a number of other key questions. It has been widely reported that the compound itself was near the town of Barisha, which sits close to the Turkish border. A major U.S. intelligence collection effort, with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at its head, was chiefly responsible for determining Baghdadi’s whereabouts and more immediate actionable information that led to the raid, according to Foreign Policy . For years, the U.S. Intelligence Community and the U.S. military have had standing forces dedicated to hunting down senior ISIS figures and its not the first time there have been major raids in Syria. For instance, in 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter had revealed the existence of the JSOC-led “ Expeditionary Targeting Force ,” or ETF. This unit was likely involved in a mission that killed ISIS’ number two at the time, Rahman Mustafa Qaduli , in Syria the following year. Another operation in 2017, which led to the death of Abdurakhmon Uzbeki ,  a “close associate” of Baghdadi according to the Pentagon, bore all the hallmarks of this task force, as well. It is possible that the raid on Baghdadi’s compound might be at least partially related to a previously reported operation aimed at tracking the movement of ISIS members throughout the region, as well as elsewhere around the world, known as Operation Gallant Phoenix . , as well. An interagency task force including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and U.S. military’s secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) were reportedly in charge of this effort, which focused heavily on intelligence fusion , from a main base of operations in Jordan. During the approximately two hours they were on the ground at the site during the Baghdadi raid, special operators reportedly recovered additional information that could be useful in locating and killing or capturing other major ISIS figures. In addition, Iraqi and Turkish officials have said that their governments were both involved to some degree in the lead up to the operation. Sources in Iraq told Reuters that some of the information that led to the raid came from the arrest of two individuals from Baghdadi’s “inner circle” and documents recovered during that operation. Turkish officials also told Reuters that they been aware of the operation ahead of time and coordinated with “relevant parties” on the ground to assist with the mission. Turkey has a significant influence in Idlib via a number of rebel groups opposed to the Syrian regime and Ankara has been instrumental in ensuring that Assad has been unable to retake the entire province. Those same Turkish officials added that Baghdadi had only arrived at the compound some 48 hours before the raid. An unnamed U.S. official disputed claims of cooperation with Turkey during the operation when speaking to Fox News . The U.S.-supported, predominantly Kurdish-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said that they also provided important intelligence related to Baghdadi ahead of the operation. A spokesman for the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which has provided the bulk of the manpower for the SDF, said in March that the group believed that the ISIS leader had made his way into Idlib. In July 2019, a United Nations report had also said that there was evidence that ISIS fighters, including senior leaders, had fled into the relative safety of the province. This was despite the presence of a litany of groups violently opposed to the terrorist organization residing in Idlib, including Turkish-backed rebels and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the latter of which includes a significant number of former Al Qaeda-aligned fighters. It’s not clear how the Turkish intervention into Northern Syria targeting the SDF, which Ankara sees as a terrorist group, may or may not have impacted the raid on Baghdadi. Later on Oct. 27, after Trump’s formal announcement about Baghdadi, the U.S.-backed group did announce that it had targeted Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, ISIS’ top spokesperson and Baghdadi’s right-hand man, in an associated raid in the village fo Ain al-Baydah, near the city of Jarabulus. This is unconfirmed and would be very curious given that this is an area ostensibly under Turkish control and very close to the Turkish border, where the SDF had previously agreed to withdraw from as part of a deal between the United States and Turkey. That Trump specifically thanked Russia and Syria might also indicate that there was some level of greater cooperation with either of those countries on this operation, but this seems very unlikely. Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies have not historically prioritized fighting ISIS . A recent investigation from The New York Times has only underscored how the Syrian regime, with help from Russia, focused the majority of their energy on eliminating rebel groups that threatened the Assad regime by any means necessary and has been actively targeting civilians, including through bombing hospitals, in the furtherance of those goals. For its part, the Russian Ministry of Defense has publicly denied any involvement in the operation against Baghdadi and has also called the U.S. government’s announcement into question. In February 2019, the head of Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, better known by the Russian acronym GRU, had insisted that the ISIS leader was not in Idlib . The Russians had also claimed to have killed him multiple times in recent years. It also remains unclear how and by what route U.S. special operations forces traveled to Baghdadi’s compound. Reports have said that the American personnel initially departed from Erbil , the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region in the northeastern portion of that country and a major U.S. military hub, as well as Al Asad Air Base further to the southwest. It is possible that both of these reports are accurate and that there was a need to assemble the requisite personnel from multiple locations in order to act on actionable intelligence about the ISIS leader. However, based on Trump’s statements about how long it took them to fly to Baghdadi’s compound, it is all but impossible that they traveled directly from Erbil or Al Asad. The helicopters could have flown to Barisha from an intermediate staging point, however. One very possible location would have been the Kobane Landing Zone , which is situated some 100 miles northeast of where Baghdadi’s hiding out. The U.S. military has been withdrawing from this base, which the United States first occupied some time in 2015, as a result of the Turkish intervention. Official pictures show that U.S. personnel were still there helping with the pullout as of Oct. 23, 2019. Even if the U.S. military had otherwise vacated this base, it would have still provided a large, established airstrip that would have been ideal for establishing a Forward Arming and Refueling Point, or FARP , which U.S. special operations forces routinely use during longer-range air assaults. US military personnel load cargo onto a US Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport plane at the Kobane Landing Zone on Oct. 23, 2019. A US Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter is visible in the background., US Army However, Trump’s comments about a “port” and “ships” might suggest that the raiding force started or completed its mission somewhere else, despite his additional statement that the special operators took the same route to and from the target location. There has been speculation that they may have started and ended the operation against Baghdadi from the U.K. Royal Air Force Base at Akrotiri on the island of Cyprus. A U.S. Navy or contractor-operated ship in the Eastern Mediterranean acting as a sea base is another possibility. More detail about the exact composition of the raiding force could eventually help answer questions about the most likely ingress and egress routes. On Oct. 27, 2019, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told ABC ‘s Martha Raddatz that approximately a 100 U.S. special operators – reportedly primarily from the U.S. Army’s Delta Force and 75th Ranger Regiment – took part in the operation and that Chinook helicopters brought them to and from the target site. The Chinooks were likely MH-47s from the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , though even JSOC’s elite task forces have used standard Army CH-47s , among other conventional enablers, when necessary, in the past. In this case, it is probably safe to say that the 160th SOAR’s highly modified MH-47s were exclusively involved considering the hostile airspace the mission took place in, its low-level night penetration demands, and the unique communications and command and control gear needed to coordinate such a complex and high-stakes operation. Bystanders also found shell casings associated with the M230 30mm automatic cannon near Baghdadi’s compound in the aftermath of the attack. Automatic cannon fire allegedly destroyed a small minibus, possibly to prevent Baghdadi and others from escaping the area. There were also reports that gunships otherwise raked the compound and nearby areas with cannon fire during the operation. This was likely in response to the reports of personnel on the ground shooting at the helicopters. The 160th uses this weapon on their MH-60L/M Black Hawk special operations helicopters in the Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) configuration. Regular Army AH-64 Apache gunships, which have also been supporting special operations activities in Syria from forward locations, such as the KLZ, as seen in the picture of that base earlier in this story, also use this weapon. Both the MH-47s and the MH-60s have inflight refueling capabilities, which could have further helped extend their range during the trip to Baghdadi’s compound and then to where ever they went following the mission, as well.

An M230 30mm cannon pod is visible on the inboard pylon on the left side of the helicopter., United Composites The truth is, we really don’t know the composition of the eight helicopter force at this time beyond the inclusion of MH-47s Chinooks. Many will wonder if some form of stealthy Black Hawk was used, similar to those used in the Bin Laden raid. It is possible that the initial raiding force used such a platform, a newer version of which has been rumored to be operating around Syria for years , but we just don’t know at this time. The possibility that heavy weaponry was fired at the compound from the air during the operation would make this possibility less likely. Also, alerting the local players as to the operation’s timing may have reduced enough risk to allow the more conventional helicopters to be used. Of course, it’s not like the 160th SOAR’s MH-60s and MH-47s aren’t designed to operate in contested airspace as it is. So many other questions remain, such as what airpower was assigned to give this raiding force cover from above if it would have been needed. It is very rare that manned U.S. or coalition aircraft fly into Western Syria. For years, it has been all but off-limits airspace and standoff munitions were used to hit larger targets. American drones have and still do operate in the area, but considering how high-value this target was, placing a non-stealthy drone overhead for weeks may have been too risky. During the lead-up to Operation Neptune Spear that took down Bin Laden, stealthy RQ-170 Sentinels worked as the eyes in the sky over Bin Laden’s compound, even watching him pace daily in his courtyard prior to the operation commencing. It is very possible Sentinels were used to monitor the compound in the weeks leading up to the operation and to stream live video of the operation, as well. In fact, just like in 2011, this is likely what Trump and his advisors were watching in the Situation Room. It’s also worth noting that there are also stealthy MQ-11 Avengers in the region that could be under the CIA’s direction. Either asset would have been more ideal than an MQ-9 Reaper drone hanging out over the compound for days on end and during the raid. The MQ-11 could also provide close air support. A General Atomics Avenger., Tyson V. Rininger / www.tvrphotography.com With all this in mind, another question emerges: were F-35s used for overhead support or were far more traceable assets held off at a greater distance, ready to push into the area if need be? The latter option would have required a far more elaborate package, including Wild Weasel aircraft ready to suppress or destroy any enemy air defense systems that may target the fighter aircraft above. Regardless, a huge number of aerial assets would have been involved in this operation—from airborne command and control aircraft, to tankers, to communications relay aircraft, to electronic intelligence monitoring platforms , to combat search and rescue forces . Every contingency would have been planned for and capabilities arrayed to respond as needed. The lightning-fast disclosure of this raid is also puzzling. There was no stealth Black Hawk tail left behind to answer for as was the case in the Bin Laden operation. Considering the level of exploitable intelligence they pulled out of that compound, even a few days would have given the intel folks a leg up on targeting al-Baghdadi’s accomplices and operatives – as has reportedly already happened to Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir. The compound was leveled after the operation, as well, which may have drawn some local attention, but in that region, kinetic actions happen daily against all types of targets. Electronic communications between top ISIS operatives were limited if not nonexistent, news of the raid would have spread slower than otherwise and it would have probably been laced with confusion. Regardless, one of history’s most depraved maniacs has been scraped from the earth once and for all. More details are sure to emerge about the operation in the hours and days to come. We will keep you up to date as they do. UPDATE: 6:30pm EST— National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Oct. 27, 2019, that the official nickname for the operation was a tribute to Kayla Mueller, an American air worker that ISIS took hostage and murdered in 2015. He did not say what the nickname was, however. For comparison, the raid that led to the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was nicknamed Operation Neptune Spear. UPDATE: 10/28/2019— The New York Times and Bloomberg have both now reported that President Donald Trump’s decision to effectively acquiesce to Turkey’s intervention into northern Syria targeting the predominantly Kurdish SDF and a subsequent order for a near-total withdrawal of American forces from the country had threatened to upend the search for Baghdadi and plans to raid his compound in Barisha. U.S. policy has reversed to some degree with a decision that came last week that has seen American troops now reinforce a position near the city of Deir Ez Zor. “The Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, one official said, provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country,” The Times reported. The SDF continued to provide information on Baghdadi and his whereabouts even after the pullout began, which the group had publicly described as a betrayal by the United States. There is also an unconfirmed report that Baghdadi’s remains have been buried at sea, as was the case with Osama Bin Laden’s body, a tactic used to prevent them, or even just a known final resting place, from becoming a shrine of sorts for future terrorists. This also brings up questions again about the involvement of ships offshore during the operation. UPDATE: 1:20 PM EST— General Mazlum Abdi, who also goes by Mazlum Kobane, the head of the SDF, has claimed that the organization had a source who had infiltrated Baghdadi’s compound, providing unprecedented information about the site and its layout ahead of the operation, as well as other vital details. That individual was reportedly on the ground during the operation. There are also reports that SDF personnel were otherwise present during the raid, but it unclear if this refers to this particular informant. At a press briefing on Oct. 28, 2019, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley, standing beside Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, said that a wide variety of munitions, including AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ( JASSM ) cruise missiles, unspecified precision-guided bombs, and AGM-114 Hellfire guided missiles, had been responsible for leveling Baghdadi’s compound. He did not say what aircraft were involved, but this makes confirms that, as expected, some number of fixed-wing aircraft were providing top cover for the operation, in addition to the still unknown helicopter gunships. Milley said that additional information may be coming soon in subsequent briefings. The General also said that the military working dog injured in the raid was set to make a full recovery.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Chinese Stealth Bomber Wind Tunnel Model Emerges And It Looks Very Familiar,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos that depict a flying wing stealth bomber wind tunnel test article have emerged out of China. What’s immediately most noticeable about the subject in the images is that it directly represents America’s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . There has been some speculation that this is actually China’s long-awaited H-20 stealth bomber design. While it’s true that China is notorious for knocking off foreign designs through various forms of espionage , that fact doesn’t mean what we are seeing is the H-20, quite the contrary, actually. The H-20 is one of two stealth bomber designs that are currently in development in China, with the other being a smaller, regional deep-strike platform that likely has additional multi-role capabilities. Of the two, the H-20 is thought to be farthest along in development, with rumors about its imminent first appearance ramping-up in recent years . The existence of such a capability would represent a giant leap in Chinese aerospace technological know-how. In essence, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force would advance from an updated 60-year-old design based on the Soviet Tu-16 Badger , in the form of its H-6K bomber derivatives , to a stealth flying wing strategic bomber. Once China does unveil its H-20, it will enter an elite club made up of just two nations that have accomplished such a technological feat. Chinese Internet With that being said, just because the photos show a direct copy of the B-2, it doesn’t mean that it represents the H-20 design. By better understanding the world’s only flying wing stealth bomber, China can better inform their own designs. Making a large aircraft like the B-2 controllable over a wide performance envelope is not a small accomplishment. China is deeply invested in unmanned flying-wing designs , but scaling up such a planform drastically presents a number of challenges. So, it makes sense that China would want to better understand everything they can about Northrop’s B-2 not just to apply to the H-20’s design, but also for their own general aeronautical knowledge base for future projects. This is also true for the B-2’s low observable design features and shaping. Foreign adversaries and friends alike can use what they know about the B-2’s design to make radar cross-section (RCS) test articles in order to gain a better understanding of stealth shaping and what features lend themselves to defeating certain RF bands from certain aspects. This information can also be used to develop sensors to better detect stealthy aircraft , such as the B-2. In other words, there is aerodynamic and low observable knowledge to gain by testing sub-scale models of adversary designs, both in terms of acquiring technological intellectual property and for building a better idea of how to counter the threat those designs and their unique features pose. In fact, this isn’t the first B-2 wind tunnel model we have seen emerge out of China (see below). Copying the B-2 exactly to create the H-20 seems a bit odd, even for China, as well. Better low observable capabilities, higher altitude performance, and a simplified empennage design could be had by not including its saw-tooth trailing edge. This was added midway through he B-2’s development at great cost to allow the aircraft to penetrate at low altitudes. You can read all about this design change and how the original B-2 planform design will likely mirror that of the B-21 Raider in this past special feature of ours. Chinese Internet So, while it’s possible that China could have gone with a direct knockoff of the B-2, it isn’t all that probable, and these images don’t prove that either way. What they do prove is that China continues to work to better understand the flying wing concept any way they can and, for all we know, these photos could have been taken yesterday or years ago. Above all else, they are also a reminder that China wants to keep the world guessing about its future in the stealth aircraft production, as well as the arrival of its first stealth bomber onto the world stage.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 24, 2019",Former Top U.S. Defense Official Questions B-21 Schedule As Air Force Hedges Timeline,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A former senior U.S. defense department official who played a central role in the establishment of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber program has cast doubt on the likelihood that it will come in on time and on budget. This comes as the Air Force has been working to soften expectations about the B-21’s aggressive development schedule, now saying that December 2021 is the absolute earliest date for a prototype to make its first flight, with one official saying he would not “bet on” it. On Oct. 24, 2019, Aviation Week published a story on the status of the B-21 program, much of which remains top-secret nearly four years after Northrop Grumman received the contract to formally begin work on the bombers and more than a decade after the Air Force initiated what had previously been known as the Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) program. This piece included comments from Frank Kendall, who, as Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics from 2011 until 2017, had an important role in shaping the schedule for developing and acquiring the Raiders. “I’ll be amazed if they get this thing in on schedule and on cost,” Kendall had told Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone Steve Trimble in September 2019. Kendall’s remarks are perhaps unsurprising now given much more reserved assessments from senior Air Force officials about the Raider’s development timeline earlier this week. “We do have an airplane in there, that would be our test ship number one,” Randy Walden, head of the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), told reporters on Oct. 24, 2019, referring to Northrop Grumman’s facility at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. “We’re working the production line, literally, today.” A B-2 Spirit stealth bomber sits outside of Northrop Grumman’s Site 4 at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, during a ceremony in August 2019 to mark the 30th anniversary of that aircraft’s first flight. The first B-21 prototype is presently under construction at Plant 42., USAF Walden was speaking at an event that the Air Force Association was hosting in in Washington, D.C. The RCO is in charge of managing the B-21 program. “There’s a lot of things that have to happen between now and a couple of years, … but in general terms, that’s what we’re shooting for,” he added , referring to the prospective first flight date in December 2021. “Things like large components coming together, integration, ground tests – all the things that lead up to a first flight – have to be accomplished.” U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Stephen Wilson had first publicly disclosed that target date in July 2019, but had stressed “Don’t hold me to it.” Walden in his own remarks went even further , saying “I would not bet on that date.” The RCO head also warned that any significant changes in the requirements for the aircraft could lead to delays, but did not indicate that this was likely to occur. “In fact, the chief of staff of the Air Force is the only guy who changes the requirements on the model,” he said. The Air Force continues to insist that the B-21 program is on track , meeting milestones as expected and keeping with established cost estimates. Walden’s remarks are some of the first indications that there may at least be concerns about a possible schedule slip, which could also lead to cost increases. To be fair, a slip in the date for the first flight would not automatically mean that the program, as a whole, is behind schedule or that any potential cost increases would upend existing budget estimates. The B-21 development effort is presently a highly classified Special Access Program, something you can read about more in this recent War Zone feature , meaning that details about its progress remain largely unknown publicly. For instance, the Air Force redacted all of the delivery schedule information from its most recent budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, making it harder to assess what impacts any delay in a first flight might have. The extent of the information provided about the B-21 delivery schedule in the Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request, which it released in Febraury 2019., USAF What we do know is that the Air Force has been aiming to both begin receiving its first B-21s in the mid-2020s and reach initial operational capability with the aircraft somewhere in that same timeframe. A first flight in late 2021 had already made it clear that the program as working on an extremely aggressive timetable . Pushing that back into 2022 can only put further pressure on that timeline. Beyond that, designing and building any advanced stealth aircraft is a complicated process and the B-21 is no exception. Last year, Representative Rob Wittman, a Republican from Virginia and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, disclosed that there had been issues with the Raider’s air intake and exhaust systems, including its specialized stealthy air inlets. Stealth aircraft require complex ducting to conceal radar reflecting engine components and these are some of the most difficult components to design and manufacture. Northrop Grumman had told The War Zone and other defense reporters earlier this year on the sidelines of an event marking the 30th anniversary of the B-2 stealth bomber’s first flight that it was leveraging experience from that program, as well as others, to reduce risk on the B-21. The company has been a leader in advanced automated aircraft production techniques, including employing robotic systems to perform some of the work on the stealthy air intakes on Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighters . Northrop Grumman builds the center fuselage sections for all three F-35 variants at Plant 42. Representative Wittman had also revealed that Northrop Grumman had already built a full-scale, non-flying “Iron Bird” systems configuration model of the B-21 to help with the aircraft’s development. It is also very likely that the company has used other aircraft or pre-production test articles for risk reduction work in the past. The Air Force is certainly moving ahead with preparations to host the B-21’s initial testing at Edward Air Force Base in California and there has been significant new construction in recent years that is related to the program and others associated with it. The service formally re-activated the 420th Flight Test Squadron there on Oct. 4, 2019. The insignia of the 420th Flight Test Squadron., USAF This unit had previously served as the B-2 Combined Test Force between 1989 and 1997 . There is evidence that the B-21 Combined Test Force had already begun forming sometime in 2018. Walden did say that the Air Force was hoping to open up more about the B-21 in the near term and that there may be new concept art of the aircraft coming soon. The rollout event for the aircraft, whenever it might occur, will also be open to the press. “We can’t just say we’re going to sneak it out and get a first flight in,” Walden said. So, whatever the actual prospective schedule for that first flight might be at the moment, hopefully, we will begin to learn more about America’s next stealth bomber soon, after years of extreme secrecy.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2020",Air Force Sends B-1B Bombers To Saudi Arabia Amid U.S. Military Buildup In The Kingdom,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has deployed an unspecified number of B-1B Bone bombers to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, which appears to be the first time the service has deployed these aircraft or any other heavy bombers to that country. This comes two weeks after the Pentagon announced plans to establish a full Air Expeditionary Wing at this base as part of a buildup in Saudi Arabia following unprecedented cruise missile and suicide drone attacks, linked to Iran, on two major oil-related sites in the Kingdom last month. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters and U.S. Army Patriot missile batteries have already arrived at Prince Sultan as part of this broader plan. U.S. Air Forces Central Command Tweeted a brief video of one B-1B landing at Prince Sultan Air Base, or PSAB, on Oct. 25, 2019, but did not say how many of the bombers were headed to the Saudi base or for how long. The social media post also said that the bombers had flown directly from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, indicating that the aircraft are from that base’s 28th Bomb Wing . A seperate video from Air Force Global Strike Command showed at least four B-1Bs leaving Ellsworth for the deployment. “The B-1B is a long-range strategic bomber able to strike any adversary at any location on the globe,” the Tweet said. “This demonstrates PSAB’s ability to conduct combat ops.” In addition to appearing to be the first time the Air Force has sent bombers to Saudi Arabia, this deployment also marks the return of the Bones to the region for the first time since March, when the service withdrew a separate contingent of the bombers from Al Udeid Air Force Base in Qatar. At that time, this meant there were no Air Force bombers of any kind forward-deployed to the Middle East at all for the first time in years. The Air Force also revealed that the B-1 fleet had been seriously overworked and had become dangerously overextended with the protracted deployments to the region. A B-1B from the 28th Bomb Wing takes off from Ellsworth Air Force Base in September 2019., USAF In August 2019, then-head of U.S. Strategic Command, revealed that just six of 62 B-1Bs, or around 10 percent of the fleet, were fully mission capable. The United States had sent bombers back to Al Udeid in May, but in the form of four B-52s , in response to intelligence related to potential threats to American interests in the region from Iran or its proxies. The arrival of the Bones at PSAB would indicate that the readiness rates for those aircraft have improved at least to some degree. As with the B-52s, the B-1Bs represent a standing threat to Iran, or any other regional opponents, offering the ability to launch stand-off cruise missile strikes from multiple vectors. Bones flying from Al Udeid notably demonstrated this capability when they took part in U.S.-led missile strikes against chemical weapons infrastructure in Syria in 2018 using AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM). AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles loaded in a B-1 ahead of strikes in Syria in 2018., Anonymous From PSAB, these bombers could also conduct patrols in and around the Persian Gulf, including to keep tabs on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ maritime movements that may present risks to American or other friendly naval vessels or commercial shipping. B-1s regularly conduct similar overwater missions from Key West targeting drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea. In July 2019, pictures also emerged of Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles performing maritime patrols , armed with precision-guided bombs and cluster munitions, optimal loadouts for engaging swarms of the kinds of small boats that the IRGC operates. Of course, there is no reason the B-1Bs couldn’t perform these same missions from Al Udeid, which is their usual base in the region. This would suggest that a major objective of the deployment is to underscore the United States’ specific commitment to Saudi Arabia or is a product of concerns about the potential vulnerability of other bases in the region to attacks should an larger conflict break out in the region. PSAB is some 200 miles inland from the Persian Gulf, much farther from that body of water than Al Udeid, but it is still well within range of Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal . The deployment is also in line with plans the Pentagon announced earlier this month to establish a full Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) in Saudi Arabia, which will likely be headquartered at PSAB, if it isn’t already, something The War Zone highlighted the significance of at the time. This was a clear signal that the Air Force expected to set up a more robust and long-term presence in the Kingdom that could also oversee additional units surging into the region to respond to future crises. This was part of a larger U.S. military deployment that came in the aftermath of cruise missile and suicide drone attacks on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field in September 2019. Saudi Arabia said that Iran was undeniably involved, but has not blamed the regime in Tehran directly. The United States has accused the Iranian government of carrying out the attacks from its own soil. Curiously, the most recent official announcement about American forces heading to the region on Oct. 11, 2019, did not mention bombers at all. It did say that there would be two Air Force fighter squadrons heading to the Kingdom. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia confirmed that F-22 Raptor stealth fighters from the 192nd Fighter Wing, Virginia Air National Guard, had already deployed to the country, as had Army Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, in the blue shirt, stands with airmen in front of an F-22 Raptor at Prince Sultan Air Base earlier in October., DOD Tensions between the United States and Iran have been ebbing and flowing for most of the year, with the United States blaming the regime in Tehran for a number of hostile acts, including a string of attacks on commercial oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The IRGC did shoot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk drone in June, which almost prompted U.S. military strikes in response. The IRGC has also seized a number of oil tankers in the strategic Strait of Hormuz in recent months. The U.S. military had already begun increasing its presence in Saudi Arabia in light of these earlier regional security concerns, but announced the deployment of a significant number of additional personnel in the aftermath of the Abqaiq and Khurais attacks. In total, the United States expects to eventually have 3,000 personnel in the Kingdom. The new deployment of the B-1s, even if it is relatively short, only underscores these broader plans to expand the Air Force’s presence in Saudi Arabia in the near term. It sends a clear message to Iran, or any other American opponents in the region, that the United States is both willing and now increasingly able to send very capable strike assets to the Kingdom to respond to any threats, if necessary.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 31, 2019",Here’s Everything We Know About The Reported U.S. Plan To Send Tanks To Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military is reportedly considering sending a task force equipped with tanks or other armored vehicles to establish an outpost overlooking oil and gas fields in eastern Syria . The primary aim of this deployment would be to prevent the Syrian regime or terrorist groups, such as ISIS, from seizing control of these resources. Where and to what degree the United States intends to maintain a military presence in Syria has been the subject of intense scrutiny and speculation following the start of a major Turkish operation into the northern part of the country two weeks ago, which then precipitated a major American withdrawal . Newsweek , citing unnamed U.S. military officials, was first to report on this potential deployment, which is supposedly pending White House approval, on Oct. 23, 2019. Other outlets , also referencing anonymous sources, have offered corroborating reports . The Washinton Post ‘s Dan Lamothe said that his source indicated the troops would be stationed somewhere in the vicinity of the Conoco Gas Plant, which is situated outside of the Syrian city of Deir Ez Zor. This area has been under the control of U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) since 2017. The concern now is that Turkey’s intervention, which has primarily targeted the SDF, has drawn the attention of those forces away from the area and raises risks that Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, together with his Russian and Iranian allies, or ISIS terrorists may make attempt to retake this strategic area. Within days of the official beginning of Turkey’s operation, dubbed Peace Spring, reports had emerged that the United States was considering retaining some sort of residual force in the country to maintain control of these resources and otherwise ensure that ISIS does not make a comeback. A map showing various zones of influence in Syria as of March 2019, along with various locations of interest. The blue areas, and to a lesser extent the green ones, have significantly grown in recent weeks, while the yellow areas have contracted. The U.S. military position to the west of Deir Ez Zor is the approximate location of the Conoco Gas Plant., CRS President Donald Trump has also called for the SDF to refocus its efforts near Deir Ez Zor following a U.S.-Turkish deal that saw the evacuation of those local forces from a buffer zone along Syria’s border. “Perhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!” Trump wrote in a Tweet on Oct. 24, 2019. Whether or not the SDF, in full or in part, will answer this or any other call from the United States remains to be seen. General Mazlum Abdi, who acts as the head of this umbrella organization, has stated his desire to continue working with American forces, despite the U.S. government’s acquiescence to Turkey’s intervention. He has also said that trust in the United States is at its “lowest.” Mazlum has previously announced separate deals with Russia and Assad, as well. The Oil Fields discussed in my speech on Turkey/Kurds yesterday were held by ISIS until the United States took them over with the help of the Kurds. We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019 I really enjoyed my conversation with General @MazloumAbdi . He appreciates what we have done, and I appreciate what the Kurds have done. Perhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019 The exact composition of the proposed American force remains unclear. Newsweek ‘s sources initially described the projected task force as “half of an Army armored brigade combat team battalion.” CNN reported that the prospective force would include “fewer than two dozen tanks,” on Oct. 24, 2019. An M1 Abrams tank., US Army Lamothe from The Post states that his source had said the “initial force would likely be “about a company,” i.e., a handful of tanks and a couple hundred soldiers,” in a Tweet on Oct. 24. “But source doesn’t rule out that it couldn’t grow from there,” he added. I'm told initial force would likely be ""about a company,"" i.e., a handful of tanks and a couple hundred soldiers. But source doesn't rule out that it couldn't grow from there. Describes it as a ""complete change in macro approach"" for the U.S. in Syria.  2/ — Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) October 24, 2019 Each of the three combined arms battalions in a standard Army armored brigade combat team has two companies equipped with M1 Abrams tanks and two more mechanized infantry companies with M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles , plus a headquarters company and an attached forward support company. Each armor company typically has 14 Abrams in total, while the mechanized infantry companies have an equal number of Bradleys. The entire battalion, not counting the support company, has around 635 personnel in total, making half of this force around 320 personnel. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the total size of the contingent could be up to 500 troops. This task force could include a mixture of Abrams and Bradleys. A visual breakdown of the maneuver components of a standard Army armored brigade combat team., CBO It is also worth noting that Newsweek ‘s initial report does not specify what type of battalion within an armored brigade combat team could contribute the forces for this mission. Each one of these brigades in the Army has an organic battalion-sized cavalry squadron that also has Bradleys, along with up-armored Humvees . CNN also reported that the Pentagon could choose a lighter force, suggesting that it might be equipped with Bradleys or 8×8 wheeled Stryker armored vehicles. However, armored brigade combat teams do not have Strykers. U.S. Army Rangers have deployed these vehicles to Syria in the past, however. UPDATE: another option besides heavy battle tanks could be lighter weight more mobile armored vehicles. — Barbara Starr (@bstarrreports) October 24, 2019 That same CNN report said that the personnel would come from U.S. forces already deployed in the region, most likely the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, an armored brigade combat team that is presently in Kuwait. The Army has an armored brigade deployed to that country at all times as part of Operation Spartan Shield , which provides forward-deployed forces to respond to any contingency in the Middle East. These rotating brigades have regularly sent personnel to Syria, as well as Iraq in recent years to support operations against ISIS. This included a detachment of combat engineers that assisted in the lead up to the liberation of the city of Raqqa from those terrorists in 2017. One of 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division’s M1 tanks in July 2019., US Army It is also possible that the armored brigade combat team in question could contribute personnel from various companies, but would deploy them to Syria in lightly armored vehicles, such as M-ATVs and up-armored Humvees, as well as tactical trucks. These types of vehicles, along with militarized pickup trucks and SUVs , have been the primary modes of transport for both U.S. special operations and conventional forces in Syria for years. The Army is also no stranger to reconfiguring various types of units as light infantry, armed with standard small arms and heavier weapons, including Javelin and TOW anti-tank guided missiles and mortars , for static security and other more limited missions. US Marines, supporting US special operations forces, fire a Advanced Mortar Protection System at an undisclosed outpost somewhere in Syria., US Army The reports that the U.S. military is considering deploying tanks to the environs near Deir Ez Zor at all would seem to suggest that there is a concern that a lighter force may be too vulnerable, especially in the absence of other forward-deployed forces, including helicopter gunships and artillery , in northeastern Syria. The United States has been vacating even large bases in that part of the country in the wake of the Turkish incursion, a withdrawal that has now been codified in an official U.S.-Turkey deal. It is worth remembering that in 2018, a force aligned with the Assad regime, with shadowy Russian mercenaries in the lead, attempted to oust the SDF, along with its American advisors, from their positions near the Conoco Gas Plant. That contingent included tanks and heavy artillery. It took a massive counterattack – which included U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and AC-130 gunships , together with Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and U.S. Marine artillery – to beat them back. American personnel in that same general area might not be able to expect that that kind of support now, or in a timely manner, especially if there is bad weather that might prevent aircraft from responding at all for some period of time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jh1oe_Kdx8c Even a few platoons of tanks, somewhere between three and nine Abrams, could certainly provide a significant force multiplier at an austere outpost near the Conoco Gas Plant. The M1s would provide a much greater volume of anti-tank fire with their 120mm main guns than troops armed with anti-tank guided missiles and could provide additional defensive firepower with their mounted machine guns. Their electro-optical and infrared sensors would also be valuable for monitoring activity around any such forward operating location. Beyond that, the tanks could just present a psychological deterrent to any opposing force thinking about trying to move into the surrounding oil and gas fields. At the same time, M1s or other heavy armored vehicles could present significant logistical complexities compared to a lighter force with less fuel-hungry and maintenance-intensive vehicles. It’s not clear how much of the prospective force would be support personnel, or whether those elements would be in addition to the one or two companies of combat troops. Just ensuring that there is sufficient fuel for vehicles such as Abrams and Bradleys, which would be running their engines even when in static positions to run their sensors and other equipment, could be a substantial undertaking. You can read more about these types of challenges in this past War Zone piece . CNN ‘s report also indicated that the plan included provision for a secure supply line to the forward outpost, possibly from Iraq via the garrison at At Tanf , which sits just across the border from that country in Syria. Aircraft would patrol this route. However, if past experiences have shown anything, supply convoys would require their own protection when en route and there could be a need for more persistent ground patrols, as well. A night vision shot of a resupply convoy near Deir Ez Zor in late 2018., US Army On top of that, tanks or similar armored vehicles would not necessarily lend themselves to the kinds of hasty withdrawals we have seen in Syria, as of late. If American forces had to quickly pull out, even temporarily, from a position near the Conoco Gas Plant, they might be forced to leave these vehicles behind, requiring that they be destroyed in place or blown up from the air. This a hardly an impossible scenario to imagine given that this austere operating location could easily be almost entirely surrounded by hostile actors in the near future as zones of influence in Syria continue to shift. Having to destroy tanks or other expensive armored vehicles, or a worst-case scenario in which they fall into enemy hands , could be immensely embarrassing if nothing else. It remains to be seen how viable any such plan to retain a U.S. military presence near Deir Ez Zor is at all. A separate deal that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently concluded specifically calls for “the preservation of the political unity and territorial integrity of Syria.” Russian officials have made clear that they understand this to mean the ultimate withdrawal of all American forces from the country and have decried the U.S. plans to continue to occupy areas in eastern Syria. Compare the Putin-Erdogan agreement with the Pence-Erdogan one. pic.twitter.com/hdAm3g95Op — Hassan I. Hassan (@hxhassan) October 22, 2019 “I am sure that the implementation of this memorandum will strongly interfere with these plans,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Oct. 23 , 2019. “We will work to nullify them.” Russia has previously threatened to attack the At Tanf garrison, as well, if that’s what it might take to eject U.S. personnel from the country for good. Iranian-backed militias have also attempted to seize control of the area around that outpost in the past, only to face American airstrikes, as well. All told, the U.S. government’s position with regards to Syria, both on the military and diplomatic fronts, is significantly weaker now than it was three weeks ago. We will have to wait and see whether the U.S. military determines that a small armed task force is sufficient to block Assad and his allies, as well as ISIS, from retaking the highly strategic oil and gas fields in eastern Syria. UPDATE: 10/25/2019— U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has now confirmed that a task force will reinforce existing U.S. personnel in Deir Ez Zor and will include “some mechanized forces.” This could mean tanks or other heavy armored vehicles, but he did not elaborate on the exact force mix. “We are now taking some actions… to strengthen our position at Deir Ez Zor, to ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields,” Esper told reporters on Oct. 25, 2019.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 31, 2019",Top Navy Official Lashes Out Over Troubled New Carrier That May Not Be Ready Until 2024 Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer berated critics of the progress, or lack thereof, on the service’s newest aircraft carrier, the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , yesterday. He decried comments from Congress earlier in the week as particularly “disparaging” and tantamount to a “disinformation program” benefiting America’s opponents. This is a far cry from the “the buck stops here” tone Spencer had struck in January, when he said that President Donald Trump should fire him if any of the carrier’s advanced weapons elevators, or AWEs, were not working when the ship leaves its latest maintenance availability, something that will almost certainly be the case now. The Navy’s top civilian official made these remarks during an event that the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C. hosted on Oct. 23, 2019. This followed a particularly tense hearing for senior naval officers in front of the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on readiness the day before. Representative Elaine Luria, a Democrat from Virginia and Navy veteran who once served as the executive officer on a guided-missile cruiser, had revealed the possibility that Ford might not make her for operational deployment until 2024, six years later than originally scheduled and three years beyond the most recent public estimate, according to USNI News . She also derided the long-troubled ship in its present form as nothing more than a “$13-billion nuclear-powered floating berthing barge.” “I look at her and other leadership on the Hill that continually disparage the Ford as a program, and I get a little upset,” Spencer said in response . “You could not ask for a better disinformation program for our competitors. And I truly mean that.” “Not one of her comments was, ‘How can I help?'” he continued . “I have an extra seat up there when I testify, and I have not seen Huntington Ingalls, Newport News called up on the Hill to testify,” he added, referring to the company and its subsidiary responsible for designing and building the Ford , respectively. The USS Gerald R. Ford., USN Spencer also lambasted Congress for putting a $12.9 billion cost cap on work on the Ford , which Navy officials acknowledged they would exceed last year, and for the use of so-called continuing resolutions , or temporary spending packages, rather than full annual budgets. He complained that these factors had limited the Navy’s ability to plan ahead and take correct steps earlier, creating additional problems and delays. He specifically cited a lack of funds to build a land-based test version of the AWE to help work out problems with that particular system. The AWE has been the latest in a string of sore spots for the Ford , which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . At present, only three of the 11 elevators on the carrier work and a fourth may be ready before she leaves the shipyard after her latest round of maintenance. Spencer famously said in January 2019 that he had told President Trump he should be fired if this were to occur. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer, in the blue jacket, visits USS Ford in January 2019., USN The Navy has said that it hopes to get the remaining seven elevators certified for use within the next 18 months, meaning that work would be complete sometime in mid-2021. There continue to be concerns about the functionality and reliability of the ship’s Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults, electrically-controlled Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), and radar , as well. “Spring of this year HII [Huntington Ingalls Industries] management says ‘oops, it’s going to be 2020; we don’t really have any idea what we’re doing,’” Spencer said. “Little change in plan. Totally realize it.” Spencer examines an AWE from inside Ford during a visit to the ship in February 2019., USN While Spencer did acknowledge that the Navy bore some of the responsibility for how the issues with Ford , his remaining criticisms seem disingenuous. For one, he completely ignored Luria’s comments from the hearing where she implored the Naval officers in attendance to tell legislators what they need to help get the carrier fixed. “We want to be here for readiness to provide you the tools to get the carriers out to deploy on time,” she had said . “What else do you need to do that?” Representative Elaine Luria looks into an AWE on Ford during her own visit in June 2019., USN Pointing the finger at Huntington Ingalls and Newport News also seems somewhat hypocritical given that, in 2007, two years before construction on Ford began, representatives from the shipyard joined the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in saying that the Navy’s cost and schedule estimates were unrealistic . The Navy pushed ahead anyways using a practice known as concurrency , wherein Newport News would begin building the ship before various key components, including the AWEs, EMALS, AAG, and radar, were anywhere near mature and their designs stable. GAO and Newport News’ original views on concurrency and cost estimates have turned out to be entirely correct and, by 2015, Ford ‘s pricetag was already exactly where Congressional watchdog and the shipyard had said it would be. This has now ballooned further due to the ongoing need to make extensive modifications to the carrier to ensure systems that are absolutely essential for it to perform its naval aviation mission work as intended. To be fair, these decisions predate Spencer’s tenure and the impact of continuing resolutions on future program planning has been very real. Still, framing the temporary funding and Congress’ cost cap on Ford , nearly $3 billion more than what the Navy said the carrier would cost in total more than a decade ago, as the real driver in subsequent delays ignores the reality that the concurrency process created many of the underlying issues in the first place, either. USN For instance, there would have been no need to build a land-based AWE test article had the design of the elevators, as well as where they would go on the ship itself, been mature when construction started. As of July 2019, up to 70 elevator doors and 17 elevator hatches associated with the AWEs simply did not work because of how the ship’s structure had grown and changed around them physically over time, adding protrusions that meant they could not open or be accessed properly in some cases, according to Bloomberg . “It is important to note that the evolution of many of the new technologies on Ford were originally to be implemented over the first three ships of the class,” Huntington Ingalls pointed out in a statement to USNI News in response to Spencer’s criticisms, a clear reference to concurrency. “That plan was changed in 2002, when a decision was made to install all of the new technology on the first ship. … Most things have gone very well. Some of the newer technologies have been more challenging than anticipated. This is to be expected on any first-in-class ship.” Beyond all this, it is the Navy’s responsibility to monitor the performance of contractors in its employ and take actions as appropriate if they fail to meet those obligations. Spencer had implicitly acknowledged this oversight role when he had previously said that President Trump should hold him personally accountable over the elevator issues. “Here are the facts: The USS Ford will be six years delayed in its initial deployment, which causes incredible strain on the carrier fleet,” Representative Luria shot back in her own statement . “It is now fall, and no elevators accessing the ammunition storage areas are functioning, which results in a carrier with no combat capability. I have yet to see a detailed plan to fix the multitude of problems with these new technologies.” The continuing troubles with Ford also come at a time when the Navy is experiencing a worrying shortage of available carriers , a scenario that the service has been warning about and attempting to find ways to mitigate for years. As it stands now, the USS Abraham Lincoln looks set to remain on station in the Middle East longer than intended after during a confluence of factors, most recently an electrical system mishap that sidelined the USS Harry S. Truman and prevented her from deploying on schedule. “If you talk to HII, they’ll tell you it’s a trail of tears,” Spencer said. “Well, you know what, we have to get the thing off the pier and out to sea.” He’s not wrong about how important it is to ensure that Ford is truly ready to begin conducting operations as soon as possible. However, it remains to be seen how many delays will persist, regardless, due to various decisions that the Navy made about the design and construction of the carrier, to begin with.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 4, 2020",Boeing Fears End Of Its Work On New Air Force ICBM As Lockheed Wins Reentry Vehicle Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has won a new contract to mature the technology and conduct risk reduction work on the Mk 21A reentry vehicle, which will carry a W87-1 nuclear warhead and sit atop the U.S. Air Force’s future intercontinental ballistic missile , or ICBM. The missile is under development now under the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, or GBSD. This comes amid turmoil in the GBSD effort, with Boeing recently announcing that the Air Force effectively canceled its contract related to that missile, making Northrop Grumman the de facto winner of the competition. The Air Force awarded the Mk 21A contract on Oct. 23, 2019, according to a press release from Lockheed Martin. The deal is worth approximately $108 million over the next three years, but includes a provision for a one-year option after that, valued at another $30 million. The United States originally developed the Mk 21, armed with the W87 warhead, for the LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM, but began using them on the LGM-30G Minuteman III after the Peacekeeper’s retirement in 2005. The W87-1 that GBSD ICBMs will use is a product improved version of the older warhead that is safer and more reliable thanks to the use of insensitive explosives , but most of the exact specifics of the updates are classified. “We will continue to demonstrate, through this TMRR [technology maturation and risk reduction], cutting-edge engineering to defeat rogue nation threats,” John Snyder, Lockheed Martin’s Vice President of Advanced Strategic Programs said in a statement . “The Mk21A TMRR contract is a key element of Lockheed Martin’s strategy to remain the Air Force’s trusted partner for ICBM Reentry Systems and modernization of the deterrent triad,” the company’s press release added. The specific mention of “rogue nation threats,” typically a reference to the ballistic missile arsenals of Iran and North Korea , as well as the nuclear weapons the latter country possesses, is curious. GBSD is meant to be a replacement for the approximately 500 LGM-30Gs that the Air Force continues fields as part of the U.S. military’s strategic nuclear capabilities, which are meant to deter any potential opponent from launching a major attack on the United States. The specific doctrine behind the ICBM force is almost exclusively focused on deterring near-peer nuclear states, such as Russia and China, as well. Official Air Force graphics showing the distribution of ICBM fields between missile squadrons under the control of, left to right, the 341st Missile Wing in Montana, the 90th Missile Wing in Wyoming and Nebraska, and the 91st Missile Wing in North Dakota., USAF In addition, the U.S. government describes the W87-1 as a “ life extension ” effort for those warheads rather than a program to develop a controversial low-yield version . The United States is developing a low yield warhead for the Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile, which proponents argue would be more useful for retaliating against smaller-scale nuclear strikes, such as those from a rogue nation. Critics warn that this could increase the likelihood of a nuclear exchange. You can read more about this ongoing debate in-depth in this past War Zone story . Whatever the case, the revised Mk 21A reentry vehicle will be an essential important component of the future GBSD and, as Lockheed Martin itself noted, allows the company to remain involved in the Air Force’s future ICBM program. The Air Force eliminated Lockheed Martin from the main GBSD competition in 2017, choosing teams that Boeing and Northrop Grumman to continue to the TMRR phase of that program. Mk 21 reentry vehicles on a payload bus for the LGM-118A Peacekeeper missile on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force., USAF Details about the GBSD’s exact capabilities and features are also largely classified. Past statements from the Air Force, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman have spoken broadly about how the new missile will be more capable and reliable, as well as being less vulnerable, especially to ballistic missile defense systems and cyberattacks. You can read more about the future ICBM’s likely improvements over the Minuteman III in this past War Zone piece . As of 2017, the Air Force had hoped to begin fielding the GBSDs in 2028, but there are concerns that there may be potential protests regarding the service’s contracting processes from Boeing that could potentially delay the program. In July 2019, the Chicago-headquartered company said it would not compete against Northrop Grumman for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase contract, which could be worth up to $85 billion. An infographic for Boeing’s GBSD proposal., Boeing Boeing’s reason for dropping out centered on complaints that Northrop Grumman had gained an unfair advantage when it bought Orbital ATK in 2018. Orbital ATK, now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, builds solid-fuel rocket motors, meaning that the company will be able to provide this component for its GBSD proposal in-house, according to Defense News . Boeing never announced who its rocket motor supplier would be, but did go on to pressure the Air Force, via members of Congress, to pick it and Northrop Grumman to work together in the EMD phase. In September 2019, Boeing disclosed that Northrop Grumman had said it would not support this joint proposal. On Oct. 21, 2019, Defense News reported that Boeing had further revealed that the Air Force had declined to give the company any additional funds for GBSD work under its existing TMRR contract. The company had already informed the Air Force’s GBSD program office, which resides at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, that it would run out of money on Oct. 18. The Air Force told Defense News that it had not formally canceled Boeing’s contract, but, by every indication, the firm is getting closer to being formally dropped from the GBSD program. The question then becomes whether it will file a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which could, in turn, delay Northrop Grumman from getting the EMD contract or beginning that work. Air Force personnel work on a Minuteman III ICBM in its silo., USAF There have also been debates over the years about whether or not the United States should even continue to invest in ICBMs, at all. The GBSD program, together with associated modernization efforts , including the development of the Mk 21A and the W87-1, will cost more than $100 billion in total, according to present estimates . This is all to maintain a leg of America’s nuclear triad that is commonly known as the “ nuclear sponge ” because its sole purpose is to force potential opponents to expend significant numbers of their own warheads if they want to try to destroy them during a nuclear exchange. The War Zone has explored the many fallacies behind this doctrine in the past. For the moment, however, U.S. nuclear weapons policy calls for retaining the ICBM force, but there is a larger and increasingly intense debate going on in Congress about the future of nuclear modernization efforts, in general, which is set to cost $325 billion overall between 2019 and 2026. It remains to be seen how Boeing might respond if its involvement in the GBSD program does indeed come to an end and whether it will decide to lodge a formal protest that could cause delays in the Air Force’s schedule for developing and fielding these new missiles. Those delays could also push major decisions farther into the future, where they could be impacted by tightening budgets and changing political winds in Washington, D.C.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2019",Satellite Photos Call Into Question Impact Of U.S. Bombing Its Own Syrian Base After Retreat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery that The War Zone has exclusively obtained calls into question the scale, scope, and effectiveness of airstrikes the U.S. military carried out on its own key base in northern Syria. U.S. personnel had operated the facility alongside their predominantly Kurdish allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF, up until being abruptly evacuated last week under very controversial orders . The photos indicate that a substantial portion of U.S.-constructed structures at the site remain intact despite statements that the strikes were supposed to have degraded “the facility’s military usefulness.” This all comes amid the announcement of a Turkish-Russian agreement on a buffer zone along the Turkish-Syrian border and uncertainty over the future of the U.S. military’s presence in the country as a whole. The U.S. military publicly announced that a pair of U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles had struck the now-defunct Lafarge Cement Factory in northern Syria, on Oct 16, 2019. This facility sits along the highly strategic M4 highway between the cities of Ain Issa and Kobane, also written Kobani, and had served as the “headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,” U.S. Army Colonel Myles Caggins, the chief spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said on Oct. 15, 2019. The United States has been hastily pulling troops out of cities across northeastern Syria in increasing numbers after Turkey launched its own incursion into the region, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, ostensibly targeting the SDF, in cooperation with the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA), on Oct. 9, 2019. A map showing the general location of the Lafarge Cement Factory within Syria, situated between Kobane, to the north, and Ain Issa, to the south., Google Maps A closer look at the relative position of the Lafarge Cement Factory in relation to Kobane and Ain Issa., Google Maps The strikes only occurred “after all Coalition personnel and essential tactical equipment departed” the site, Caggins had stressed in a Tweet on Oct. 16, 2019. “As Turkish-backed militias advanced towards the Lafarge Cement Factory, between Kobani and Ain Issa, on Tuesday, Oct. 15, the SDF set fire to, then vacated, its facilities and equipment,” the colonel had explained to Foreign Policy ‘s Lara Seligman the day before. “We want to be very deliberate and very safe as we go about it,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had told reporters on Oct. 19, 2019, in reference to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria. “Job number one, though, remains [the] protection of our forces.” Satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained of the site as it existed on Oct. 12 and then how it appeared on Oct. 22, after the withdrawal and subsequent strikes, seem to tell a different story about just how useful the installation may remain now.

The U.S.-led coalition’s official statement only identified “an ammunition cache” as one intended target of the Oct. 16 strikes, but there is clear damage to at least two distinct buildings. One smaller structure is almost entirely destroyed and there is significant damage to another. It is not clear if the F-15Es struck these buildings or if personnel on the ground may have demolished them. We also don’t know if the structures held ammunition or if they housed other assets or had been serving in another role, such as acting as a command center. There is evidence of another possible strike on or demolition of a set of small structures to the immediate southwest of the damaged buildings, as well. This does not appear to have been the area that SDF forces had burned on Oct. 15, which is further to the southwest, meaning that coalition forces would have been responsible for destroying any assets at this particular location, as well. This could have been the ammunition depot mentioned by the coalition spokesperson, we just don’t know at this time.

The image from Oct. 12, shows both of the structures intact., Photo © 2019 Planet Labs Inc. All Rights Reserved. Reprinted by permission. Both of the damaged buildings predate the U.S. ground intervention into Syria, though the smaller one appears to have received some additions on the left side since American personnel arrived. Lafarge’s operations in the country also began before the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. Last year, a French court indicted the company over complicity with crimes against humanity and financing terrorists after years of investigations indicating that the firm had paid millions to ISIS to release hostages and leave the plant alone. The French government also intervened in 2014 to ensure that the U.S. military did not bomb the site on the grounds that it was still a functioning civilian enterprise. It’s not surprising that U.S. and other coalition forces chose to occupy it and use it for their own purposes after beginning to move into the region in force circa 2015. The site was already relatively fortified and offered the high ground, providing great force protection and offering a unique opportunity to monitor surrounding areas over a great distance. It also had a number of large concrete pads that were readily convertible into helicopter operating areas, too. These structures as they existed in 2014., Google Earth Other satellite imagery from Oct. 15 had shown a large fire at a tertiary location just to the southwest of the main Lafarge plant, which is likely where SDF forces had their associated base of operations. As of Oct. 22, whatever this adjacent site had been was still smoldering a week after the blaze was spotted. An image of the apparent former SDF base near the Lafarge Cement Factory on Oct. 22.

It’s impossible to tell from the imagery what the inside of the remaining structures might look like and what U.S. and other coalition forces removed before making a hasty retreat. The satellite images from Oct. 12 and Oct. 22 make clear that the base’s occupants had evacuated a substantial number of helicopters, vehicles, and other equipment, including entire shipping containers, before they left for good.

At the same time, the assertion that the subsequent airstrikes made a real impact to “reduce the facility’s military usefulness” is questionable at the very best. It certainly pales in comparison to other “terrain denial” strikes the U.S. military has carried out to deny opponents access to certain areas in the past. It’s certainly valuable to deny any potential enemy forces access to any weapons and ammunition, but that doesn’t negate the value of the facilities there, which American forces substantially upgraded and expanded for military purposes. Days after all coalition and SDF forces had left the site, the vast majority of the facilities, seem to be intact. Three clamshell hangars , ubiquitous features of U.S. military forward operating locations around the world , notably remain standing adjacent to an area that U.S. forces had turned into a heliport. Satellite imagery shows that these had supported U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopters and AH-64 Apache gunships . Special operations helicopters, such as those belonging to the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment have made use of the site, as well. Various satellite images over the years clearly show the presence of shadowy Sikorsky S-92 helicopters , which have been seen supporting coalition special operators on multiple occasions .

Rows of structures, include large tents and shipping containers, which would have provided living space, mess halls , and other amenities to U.S. and coalition personnel at the site remain in place across the factory, the main boundaries of which are around a mile long from north to south and nearly a half a mile wide. While they may not offer the same quality of life as before, they certainly look habitable, at least from the air. Some regional journalists have already shot video inside the site, which shows fires burning in some buildings, but it is unclear if these were set before or after American personnel left or how widespread that damage might be. By every available indication, U.S. and other coalition forces left significant and potentially useful infrastructure behind. This is in line with the American pullout from Manbij , further to the west, which occurred on Oct. 15. Russian private military contractors and media outlets had subsequently shot extensive video from inside the former U.S. base there, showing food and personal items still on tables in the mess hall, functional electrically-powered gates at entry control points, and more. This was a major propaganda coup on top of a very practical victory for the Kremlin and its Syrian regime allies. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4bHnIR2oo9U https://youtube.com/watch?v=SiEP1ksZOKA The cement plant still clearly offers military utility, raising questions about who may now be able to exploit those remaining capabilities, both for practical and propaganda purposes. It seems unlikely that American or other coalition forces will return to the site any time soon, if ever. ISIS already claims to have sent fighters inside to investigate. Leveling the entire installation may not be necessary or realistic, but certainly destroying whatever unfortified improvements exist and making the cement plant turned military headquarters into a far less turn-key facility for military operations seems highly logical. On Oct. 22, 2019, Turkey and Russia also announced plans to establish a buffer zone along the full extent of the Turkish-Syrian border with both countries conducting patrols in certain areas. The deal also leverages a 1998 arrangement between Turkey and Syria to cooperate on fighting terrorists and separatists, which will enable Turkish forces to remain in the country indefinitely. Turkey views the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, also known as the YPG, which contributed the bulk of the manpower for the SDF, as terrorists. The YPG has less than a week to withdraw from the entire buffer zone or face a major offensive. The U.S. military and the SDF have already withdrawn to the southeast from this buffer area. The Pentagon says that it still plans to pull out the bulk of American forces from the country in the coming weeks in line with a decision that U.S. President Donald Trump first announced in December 2018. That plan, as it stands now, will also see American troops continue to operate a small garrison at At Tanf near Syria’s southern borders with Iraq and Jordan. The rest of the forces withdrawing from Syria have been flowing into Iraq and the Pentagon had said that these personnel would remain there to conduct cross-border operations against ISIS, if necessary. However, the Iraqi government has said that it has not given permission to its American counterparts to increase their force posture within its border that these personnel can only remain in the country “in transit” before they have to go somewhere else. In addition, the Pentagon has now proposed retaining a similar base near the Syrian oil fields around the city of Deir Ez Zor, though it has not made a decision about whether or not to implement that plan. Without the stability that a larger U.S.-occupied zone in northeastern Syria affords and the logistical infrastructure there, it is unclear how viable such a forward outpost would be, even in the near term. A map showing the various zones of influence in Syria as of March 2019. The blue areas in the northwest have expanded significantly eastward already and will continue to do so, unless something dramatically changes in US policy, while the yellow areas will shrink., CRS At the same time, a backlash to Turkey’s intervention in Congress, which had led to calls for an arms embargo and substantial sanctions, has been steadily dying down since the Trump Administration’s decision to largely acquiesce to Turkish demands with regards to the buffer zone along the border. Trump himself, who at one point vaguely threatened to “ obliterate ” Turkey’s economy if Operation Peace Spring did not proceed according to his liking, has repeatedly dismissed criticism of his handling of the situation, saying bluntly last week that “it’s not our problem.” Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and a major Trump ally who had been among the harshest critics of Trump’s handling, has also notably changed his tone in recent days. “[I am] Increasingly optimistic that we can have some historic solutions in Syria that have eluded us for years, if we play our cards right,” Graham said in an interview on Oct. 20, 2019. However, opposition to the Trump Administration’s policies remain and some American legislators did recently issue a joint statement with various counterparts in Europe condemning Turkey’s actions in Syria. The situation in Syria itself remains fluid and will likely continue to evolve in complex ways in the coming weeks and months as the U.S. proceeds with and finalizes its withdrawal plans. Unfortunately, Turkey’s intervention has already provided space for ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria to reassert themselves and handed Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, together with his Russian and Iranian allies, major territorial gains. On top of that, there have also been steady allegations of TFSA fighters committing atrocities and the Turkish operation has already prompted a major humanitarian crisis . There are very real concerns that the Turkish occupation of northern Syria could lead to ethnic cleansing across northeastern Syria, if it hasn’t already begun , and Turkey says it plans to resettle millions of Syrian Arab refugees into the zone, despite the continuing lack of security and basic infrastructure. Ethnic Kurds, as well as other ethnic and religious minorities in northern Syria, the communities that provided the vast majority of the personnel for the SDF and who were instrumental in rolling back ISIS, feel betrayed and have openly protested the departure of American forces. As more American troops withdrew this week, some Syrian Kurds threw stones and tomatoes at U.S. vehicles, while others held signs lamenting their departure. Some Iraqi Kurds showed similar frustrations as those forces arrived in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, which has been under de facto U.S. protection since the 1990s and where American troops have generally been treated with appreciation. For the moment at least, the now-abandoned major operations outpost at the Lafarge Cement Factory has become something of a troubling monument to the ghost of America’s military operation in Syria that had been successfully churning along for years up until just days ago. With so much of the base intact, it’s more likely than not that the new powerbroker in the very troubled region will set up shop there and use America’s investments in the facility for their own objectives, whatever they may end up being. Author’s Note: We have updated this story to clarify that it is unclear which target or targets the F-15Es hit and about the prospects that coalition forces on the ground may have demolished more structures in the compound.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Air Force Hires Seven Companies In Long-Awaited Mega Adversary Air Support Contract,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has quietly hired not one, but seven different companies to provide “red air” adversary support to help U.S. military combat jet pilots train at various bases across the United States. This massive multi-billion dollar contract is the culmination of a major effort within the service that has been years in the making to increasingly rely on contractors to provide these services in order to improve flexibility for training requirements and to save money. Air Combat Command awarded the subcontracts to Air USA Inc. , Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) LLC., Blue Air Training , Coastal Defense , Draken International , Tactical Air Support (TacAir), and Top Aces Corporation as part of a single, larger deal on Oct. 18, 2019. The Pentagon’s official announcement notice did not say how much each company stands to make under their respective deals, which will cover work through 2024, though it is possible that there may be performance-based incentives for additional work as time goes on. The Air Force has capped the over-arching contract at no more than $6.4 billion, less than the $7.5 billion it had originally estimated it would cost. “Contractors will provide complete contracted air support services for realistic and challenging advanced adversary air threats and close air support threats,” the Pentagon’s contracting notice explained . It also said that the Air Force had received a total of eight bids, but did not name the one company that did not subsequently receive an award. “Work will be performed in multiple locations across the Combat Air Force,” it continued without offering any additional details on the locations. As of June 2018, Air Combat Command was looking at a number of different potential schedules, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story , all of which would eventually provide aggressor and other training support at a dozen bases throughout the United States, including Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. The Air Force has also said in the past that the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps could potentially piggyback onto the deal as time goes on, but there is no mention that those services has sought to take advantage of this contract already. USAF As seen in the above table, the original plan envisioned companies getting their first contracts in July 2019, which does not appear to have occured. It’s unclear if this has caused any other schedule delays or if the Air Force had already revised its timetables between June 2018 and the award of these contracts. In hiring seven companies, the service does appear to be trying to make up for any lost time. ATAC, Draken, TacAir, and Top Aces, the latter of which has its main headquarters in Canada, represent some of the biggest names in the industry worldwide and all have previous experience working with the U.S. military, among others. Since 2017, the first three companies have all been notably expanding their fleets to include new, more capable aircraft that are better able to mimic 4th generation fighter jets specifically in order to better compete for this contract. ATAC and Draken both bought fleets of upgraded Dassault Mirage F1 fighters from France and Spain , respectively. Draken also acquired a dozen ex-South African Air Force Atlas Cheetahs , a Mirage III derivative. TacAir purchased acquired a number of former Royal Jordanian Air Force F-5E Tiger II jets, upgrading them into what they now call the F-5AT Advanced Tiger configuration . One of ATAC’s ex-French Mirage F1, Caulun Belcher Images A Draken International Cheetah., Draken International A TacAir F-5AT., Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com ATAC already flies Israeli-made F-21 Kfir fighters , another Mirage III-based design, along with less capable Hawker Hunter Mk 58 and L-39 Albatros jets .  Draken’s fleet also includes L-39s, as well as L-159E Honeybadgers , along with Cold War-era A-4 Skyhawks and MiG-21bis jets . Front to back, an F-21 Kfir, Hawker Hunter Mk 58, and L-39 Albatros, all belonging to ATAC., ATAC Draken L-159E Albatroses., Draken International Top Aces says on its website that it is in the process of acquiring some number of Lockheed Martin F-16A Viper fighter jets, almost certainly to support this contract. It’s unclear what the source of those aircraft might be, but ATAC had considered buying a number of F-16AMs from Jordan for an earlier aggressor contract with the Navy, but lost that deal to TacAir and its F-5ATs, a decision you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone story . It is possible that those Jordanian Vipers may now find their way to Top Aces, which otherwise operates older Franco-German Alpha Jets and A-4s, though there are other sources of early model F-16s, as well. Air USA Inc. has a diverse fleet that also includes Alpha Jets and the L-59 version of the Albatros, along with Soviet-era MiG-29UB Fulcrum fighters , and BAE Hawk jets . Coastal Defense’s website shows a number of Albatros variants, including some configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions with sensor turrets under the fuselage, as well. An Air USA MiG-29UB., Air USA Blue Air Training’s jet fleet consists of Cold War-era BAC Jet Provosts and Strikemasters , the latter of which are more combat-capable derivatives of the former jet trainers. It’s unclear what mix of aircraft from the different contractor fleets the Air Force will actually work with in the end and it is possible, if not probable that lower-density assets, such as Air USA’s MiG-29UBs may not take part in the training missions at all. Blue Air Training and TacAir also have a number of single-engine turboprops that, along with smaller jets such as the Albatroses and Strikemasters, are ideally suited to training Joint Tactical Air Controllers (JTAC) on the ground to call in airstrikes, which does not have the same performance requirements as simulated air-to-air combat. Blue Air Training also has a number of AH-6 Little Bird light helicopters, but the Air Force does not have any stated requirement for rotary-wing training support . It is certainly interesting that the Air Force decided to hire so many different companies in the end, but it is not necessarily entirely surprising. As the War Zone had previously surmised , the wording of earlier contracting documents clearly pointed to a plan to award smaller “task orders” within the main contract to maximize value by bringing on multiple contractors to best meet the requirements for certain aircraft and the ability to conduct flying operations at such a diverse array of locations. The Air Force could easily have had trouble meeting its requirements with a smaller number of contractors, too. This is also something of a validation for the industry, as a whole, which has been steadily expanding in recent years in line with growing demand , something the War Zone had long predicted and has been following closely . It has been increasingly clear for years that as combat aircraft become more complex and expensive to operate, it will only become less and less cost-effective to use operational types in aggressor and other training roles. A Draken International A-4 Skyhawk supports a US Air Force training exercise under a previous contract., USAF That’s not to say that we won’t see aircraft such stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters playing the roles of aggressors – the Air Force announced it was doing just that earlier this year – but using alternatives when possible will be ever more essential for keeping costs down and preserving fleet airframe time as time goes on. As the War Zone explained back in 2018: “The aforementioned commercial adversary support program at Kingsley Field in Oregon is a good poster-child for what contractors can offer. With Kingsley hosting the last F-15C/D schoolhouse in the Air Force, its throughput has suffered in no small part due to an increasing shortage of pilots across the service’s active and reserve components. Draken’s [L-159E Albatros] jets and their pilots will free up instructors from having to play the “red air” role and give them more opportunities to fly with new aviators instead. … Even more relevant is that the L-159, which packs a modern multi-mode pulse doppler radar, costs a fraction of what an F-15C costs to operate—between $25k and $45k per hour depending on how it’s calculated—in the adversary role. For new pilots, training flights are often just about learning how to execute intercepts and beyond-visual-range engagements where a very high-performance F-15 isn’t needed to act as the bad guy. As such, flying F-15s versus F-15s for new Eagle Driver pilot training, and for many regular fleet training needs as well, is hugely wasteful. It also depletes precious airframe hours on an increasingly geriatric fleet.” Beyond “bread and butter” air-to-air training, it’s all about layering these contractor-operated aircraft in with higher-end Air Force assets. The service’s advanced fighters, especially its stealthy F-22 Raptors and the F-35s, simply have an insatiable need for targets during higher-end training to present a real challenge . This can be satisfied efficiently by mixing dissimilar and lower-performing types of aircraft into a larger adversary air plan. It’s not clear when any contracted companies will actually begin flying sorties under this contract but it’s safe to say that we will increasingly see a diverse group of contractor-operated aircraft supporting Air Combat Command exercises and day-to-day training. Regardless, this is is the long-awaited moment in the history of contractor aggressor services and it will be a game-changer that will allow the industry to only grow and expand more rapidly in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 4, 2020",China Reveals Wind Tunnel Tests Of Space Plane-Launching High-Speed Mothership Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics, or CAAA, has released pictures and a brief video showing a wind tunnel test of a model of a two-stage-to-orbit space launch system involving a fast- and high-flying mothership aircraft that carries a reusable spacecraft on top of its fuselage. Though this general concept has been around for decades , there has been a major resurgence of interest in it around the world in recent years amid growing demand for flexible, rapid, and unpredictable space launch options. CAAA released the imagery , together with relatively general details about the project via its official WeChat social media account on Oct. 21, 2019. Aerodynamic testing and modeling using various wind tunnels and other equipment are among the primary services this research and development center offers. CAAA is also part of the larger state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, or CASC . The statement from CAAA said that the tests had been successful, but offered no details on how far along this two-stage-to-orbit program might. As the researchers noted, safe separation of the spacecraft from the mothership is absolutely essential to making this concept work. The general principle behind two-stage-to-orbit systems is that a mothership carries a spacecraft to a very high altitude, as high as between 80,000 to 100,000 feet in some past proposals . The spacecraft then uses its own rocket motor to boost itself into orbit. CAAA researchers watch the video feed of the test occurring in the high-speed wind tunnel in the background., CAAA Over the years, there have been a wide range of proposed concepts in this vein that differ primarily in how capable the combination of mothership and spacecraft is and, as a result, how big a payload the second vehicle can carry into space and what types of orbit it can achieve. The War Zone has been closely following these developments . Some of these proposals have involved the idea of a mothership that is already flying at high supersonic or even hypersonic speed to give the smaller vehicle an extra boost. The complete concept that CAAA showed along the wind tunnel test imagery is typical of many of these concepts and a 3D rendering shows a high-speed, delta-winged, dart-shaped mothership, which would reportedly use scramjet propulsion. This choice of engine, combined with the vertical wingtip stabilizers, similar to those found on the Cold War-era North American XB-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber, point to a design that rides its own shockwaves at high speeds. The spacecraft also appears to have a general planform that is roughly analogous to other mini-space shuttle designs that have emerged over the years, such as NASA’s X-34A or U.S. Air Force’s more secretive X-37B . A rendering of a notional two-stage-to-orbit aerial space launch system involving a high-speed mothership, in blue, and a smaller spacecraft riding on the top of the fuselage, in gold., CAAA CAAA did not offer any frame of reference for how large the designers expect the mothership or the spacecraft to be in their final forms. However, there are certain similarities between the spacecraft wind tunnel model and unconfirmed images purporting to be the Shenlong , or Divine Dragon, an air-launched, reusable spaceplane that China has reportedly been developing since at least 2000. China reportedly conducted drop tests of a Shenlong test article in 2007 and suborbital flight of a prototype in 2011. Pictures have shown what may be the Shenlong underneath the fuselage of a Xian H-6 bomber. CAAA’s website also has a very small graphic showing a spaceplane or lifting body concept similar in general shape to the U.S. Air Force’s Cold War-era X-20 Dyna-Soar or the Russian Cosmopolis XXI , or C-21. However, this looks unrelated to the two-stage-to-orbit design from the wind tunnel tests. Images purporting to show the Shenlong spaceplane under an H-6 bomber., Chinese internet A purported China Central Television screen capture showing computer modelling of an H-6 releasing the Shenlong., CCTV Another graphic seen on the CAAA that is reminiscent of other spaceplane concepts., CAAA Experts have previously estimated that the Shenlong would be just about 18 feet long, which would make it a very small design similar in many respects to a spacecraft that Russia’s International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) is developing as part of its own two-stage-to-launch concept. If the model CAAA tested is at all related to the Shenlong, the mothership appears to be around two and half times as long, or around 45 feet, and have a substantially greater wingspan as its top-mounted payload. Its small size may also mean that it has relatively limited payload and orbital capabilities. At the same time, the final product could be much larger and more capable. In fact, this is likely the case. A schematic of ISON’s air-launched spacecraft, known the MLD., ISON Whatever the exact specifics of the mothership and spacecraft designs that CAAA recently tested, it’s hardly surprising that China would be interested in this general concept. The Chinese government is pushing ahead hard to become a major space power . Two-stage-to-orbit concepts offer added flexibility in launching smaller satellites and other spacecraft, as well as the ability to potential to do it faster and at a lower cost, as the War Zone has explored in-depth in the past . The motherships used for air-launched space vehicles can reposition to more optimal launch locations and do not generally require the same kind of extensive, fixed infrastructure associated with traditional space launch rockets. This could also make the launches less predictable and harder to monitor or counter. This kind of responsive launch capability could also be valuable for rapidly replacing satellites and other space-based capabilities that may get disabled or destroyed in a future conflict. There are already strong indications that China has been pursuing simpler aerial space launch capabilities for these very reasons. In 2016, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) reached a deal with Antonov in Ukraine to finish the construction of a second An-225 Mriya and potentially produce more under license in China. The Soviet Union only ever built one of these planes, one of the largest aircraft ever built, which now belongs to Ukraine’s Antonov Airlines . Originally intended to carry spacecraft parts, as well as Buran space shuttle, the An-225 would be an ideal aerial launch platform for space vehicles, as you can read about in more depth in this past War Zone piece . The only flying example presently of the An-225. , Larske/wikicommons Work on a second An-225 had come to an end in 1994, but the partially built Mriya remained in storage. As of June 2019, the project appeared to have stalled and the aircraft remains incomplete . In September 2018, Antonov had said it would need hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funds to complete the project . There have been no reports of any progress on licensed production of additional aircraft. Still, even if the final example of the dedicated two-stage-to-orbit system that CAAA has been helping to test is not capable of putting objects into a stable orbit, it could still be valuable for research and development of more robust follow-on designs. It could also have practical applications, such as conducting short-duration orbital or suborbital intelligence-gathering missions on short notice. This is another general area that China clearly has an interest in. At the military parade in Beijing to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state on Oct. 1, 2019, the People’s Liberation Army displayed a rocket-powered high-speed unmanned aircraft, known variously as the WZ-8 or DR-8 , another short-notice, short-duration intelligence-gathering platform, albeit one that does not go into space. It is very likely that this system is also air-launched, using a new version of the H-6 bomber, the H-6N . This aircraft is specifically designed to air-launch oversized payloads. The WZ-8/DR-8 rocket-powered unmanned aircraft., People’s Liberation Army The design seen in the recent CAAA wind tunnel tests may also be capable of functioning as an anti-satellite weapon by carrying a payload to blind, jam, or otherwise disable or destroy target objects in space. The Chinese, as well as the Russians and others , have already been developing increasingly capable anti-satellite systems. These efforts stem from a desire to challenge other countries that have typically had an edge in space-based capabilities, chiefly the United States . There are commercial applications for the two-stage-to-orbit concept, as well. A number of private companies, including Virgin Orbit and the recently sold Stratolaunch, which the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen had originally founded , are looking to offer lower-tier aerial space launch capabilities using expendable vehicles. Another private venture, Virgin Galactic , aims to use reusable spaceplanes for space tourism. Stratolaunch had notably hired Scaled Composites to develop and build the unique and massive Roc, now the world’s largest airplane, which flew for the first time in April, to act as a mothership. The company had also planned to build a reusable spacecraft, called Black Ice, a project the firm canceled before the sale and that now has an uncertain future. All told, whether or not the wind tunnel models that CAAA tested are in support of the active development of a two-stage-to-launch capability, or are simply a stepping stone toward such a program, it seems clear that China has an interest in aerial space launch concepts as the country continues to become an increasingly important player outside the Earth’s atmosphere.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 27, 2019","Cartel “Narco Tanks,” Heavy Weapons On Full Display During Battle Over El Chapo’s Son","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A bungled police operation in Mexico yesterday briefly led to the detention of Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán, the infamous former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel who is now in prison in the United States. Mexican security personnel eventually turned him over to cartel gunmen after the arrest prompted a raging gun battle with extremely heavily armed fighters, including some with American-made Barrett .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles and others riding in gun trucks packing .50 caliber M2 machine guns, the latter of which have become a fixture in Mexico’s drug war over the past decade. Mexican National Guard troops and police personnel launched the operation in Culiacán, the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa State, on Oct. 17, 2019. Culiacán, and Sinaloa broadly, which sits on the Pacific Ocean, has long been a major stronghold of the Sinaloa Cartel and is where it takes its name from. The Mexican government appears to have hoped that the operation would be discreet and quick. After the fighting began, Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo issued an initial statement claiming that security forces had simply been on a routine patrol in the area when they began taking fire from a house and subsequently found Ovidio inside. It has since emerged that this was a pre-planned mission . The elder Guzmán is presently serving a life sentence at the ADX Florence maximum security prison in Colorado after a U.S. court convicted him of various charges in February 2019. The same month the U.S. Justice Department unsealed indictments against Ovidio, as well as another one of his other brothers, Joaquín Guzmán López. The operation against Ovidio was part of the U.S.-Mexican efforts to detain both of them and send them to the United States to stand trial. However, it appears that everything that could go wrong with the Mexican operation did. The task force reportedly received orders to wait after arriving very publicly at the compound where Ovidio was staying after receiving word that authorities had not actually secured an arrest warrant, according to The Washington Post . The occupants inside clearly noticed what was going on and rapidly contacted other Sinaloa Cartel members, who rushed to the area and also set up roadblocks to prevent the government forces from leaving. Underscoring the general state of the security situation in Mexico, gunmen also led a raid on the prison in Culiacán, freeing approximately 49 inmates , including other members of the cartel. The Sinaloa Cartel’s response underscored just how heavily armed it and similar criminal organizations are in Mexico and how capable they are of taking on even Mexican military forces directly. In the hours-long firefight that turned the city into a war zone, residents, while fearful for their lives, were still able to take videos and photographs showing gunmen riding in the back of commercial pickup trucks with the standard rear beds replaced with open-topped, high-walled cargo bodies. Cartel fighters also posted their imagery on social media. At least one of these had a mounted .50 caliber M2 machine gun and another had a complete improvised armored turret-like structure in the back. All told, this is more akin to what one might expect to see in the conflicts raging Syria, Iraq, Libya, or other hotspots around the world. However, these types of gun trucks, as well as even heavier improvised armored vehicles, often referred as “ Narco Tanks ,” or “Narco Tanques” in Spanish, actually predate many of those conflicts. The first known examples began to appear in Mexico’s Drug War in 2010. Mexican President Vincete Fox, who served between 2000 and 2006, and his successor, Felipe Calderon, who remained in office until 2012, had taken hard lines against drug cartels, deploying the military in many cases to try to crush the criminal organizations by force. These policies had, at best, mixed results for a variety of reasons, including corruption within the country’s security forces, and led to spikes in violence and infighting between cartels as the Mexican government’s actions created power vacuums and subsequent turf wars. The Los Zeta cartel , which operates on the other side of the country from the Sinaloa Cartel, is generally credited with making the first Nacro Tanks, but built them in order to fight the rival Gulf Cartel . The Gulf Cartel responded in kind, including unique examples based on commercial dump trucks with names like “El Rinoceronte” (“The Rhinoceros”) and the “Batmobile.” One El Rinoceronte had a mounted Bushmaster BA50 .50 caliber rifle mounted inside. The BA50 mounted inside one of the El Rinocerontes., Public Domain However, as has been the case elsewhere around the world, the most popular Narco Tanks have been modified pickup trucks and SUVs with various levels of armor and weaponry. These could still be quite threatening and versions with custom made armor over the entire body and cab became known as “Los Monstruos” (“The Monsters”). At least one of these was reportedly equipped with James Bond-esque features, including the ability to deploy oil slicks and caltrops to deter pursuers, as well as an electrified front brush guard and battering ram. An early pickup based El Monstruo in 2010., Public Domain The trend has since spread nationwide, though with more discreet designs than the Monstruos having become the predominant type, ss was seen in Culiacán just the other day. This is a symptom of a larger arms race between cartels and the Mexican government, and each other. This can also be seen in the use of Barrett .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles in Culiacán, and elsewhere, which offer cartel gunmen a way to disable opponents riding in increasingly more heavily armed vehicles. There were also reports of individuals carrying belt-fed M249 machine guns , M72 rocket launchers , and unknown rocket-propelled grenades, but at least some of these videos were from previous skirmishes . In 2016, after Mexican Marines, one of the country’s premier counter-narcotics forces, began employing helicopters armed with U.S.-made Miniguns against the Gulf Cartel, that organization also began working to illegally acquire their own examples from sources in the United States. In 2018, the Justice Department indicted two American citizens of being involved in the illicit sales of these weapons. One of these individuals was Tracy Garwood, owner of Garwood Industries , a supplier of Miniguns to, among other customers, the U.S. military. A Minigun, and related parts, bound for the Gulf Cartel that U.S. officials seized as part of their investigation., ATF via Rolling Stone The firepower on display in Culiacán clearly left Mexican security forces outgunned and put the team that had detained Ovidio in a particularly embarrassing and untenable position. “The decision was taken to retreat from the house, without [Ovidio] Guzmán, to try to avoid more violence in the area and preserve the lives of our personnel and recover calm in the city,” Security Minister told Reuters . “If this had been planned differently, perhaps we would have had devoted more air support,” Mexican Defense Secretary Luís Cresencio Sandoval added at a subsequent news conference . There is no indication that the force that arrived at Ovidio’s compound had any immediate backup available . However, an unnamed senior Mexican military official reportedly told The Post that the decision to release Ovidio, along with three other members of the Sinaloa Cartel, was a “political deal,” though he did not elaborate on what the criminal organization might have offered in return. Video, seen below, has since emerged online that appears to show gunmen allowing Mexican security forces members to leave the area alive afterward. The arrangement may have also come with promises not to further retaliate against the government over the botched operation. Just this week, suspected cartel gunmen massacred 14 police officers in an ambush in the western Mexican state of Michoacan. This was followed by a police operation that led to the deaths of 14 alleged cartel members . All of this has raised concerns about an all-new spike in violence across Mexico as the country’s populist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, better known as AMLO, who ran on a platform of “abrazos, no balazos” – “ hugs, not bullets .” “We took this decision to protect the lives of the citizenry. You can’t fight fire with fire,” AMLO said after Ovidio’s release. “That’s how this administration is different from previous ones. We don’t want war.” However, he has also taken a harder-line approach in many regards. This has included forming the country’s new National Guard this year, which led to this latest operation in Culiacán. Beyond all that, the fighting in Sinaloa State simply underscores just how capable and cohesive the Sinaloa Cartel remains, even after El Chapo was imprisoned in the United States. This is despite reports of infighting between some of his sons and other senior members of the organization now that the elder Guzmán is out of the way. Given current trends, and the standing goal for the Mexican government to arrest Ovidio and Joaquín Guzmán López and to extradite them to the United States, it seems very possible that we may see Sinaloa Cartel members, or those belonging to other cartels, challenge government security forces again with their Narco Tanks in the near future. That is unless there has been some sort of deal to leave El Chapo’s sons alone, at least for the time being. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick and Brett Tingley,"Updated on Oct 18, 2019",The Army Wants To Verify To The Stars Academy’s Fantastic UFO Mystery Material Claims,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just yesterday, the U.S. Army confirmed that it had entered into a curious cooperative deal with former Blink 182 frontman Tom DeLonge ‘s To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, more commonly known as TTSA, to investigate certain “novel materials.” The War Zone has now obtained a minimally redacted copy of the agreement that clearly says that the Army wants to attempt to verify TTSA’s claims about reported metamaterials and associated “technology innovations.” If they actually check out, the service thinks they could be immensely valuable to the U.S. military as a whole. TTSA first announced the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) on Oct. 17, 2019. The Army’s Ground Vehicle System Center (GVSC), part of the service’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), which now sits under the recently established Futures Command, confirmed that the existence of the agreement and offered some additional details to The War Zone later that day. You can read our extensive initial report on the CRADA, which will not involve any payment to TTSA, here . On Oct. 18, 2019, the GVSC released a copy of the 26-page formal CRADA document, titled “Novel & Emerging Technology Exploitation (NETE),” to us with some minor redactions to remove the contact phone numbers of the parties involved. We now know that GVSC signed the CRADA with TTSA on Oct. 10, 2019. Jeffery Langhout, the center’s director, and Kari DeLonge, Tom DeLonge’s sister who has held the title of Chief Content Officer for TTSA, physically signed the document. Bean Soave and Dr. Joseph Cannon, both members of GVSC’s Ground Vehicle Survivability and Protection (GVSP) program, are listed as the “principal investigators” on the Army’s side. TTSA’s principal investigator for this CRADA is Luis Elizondo, the organization’s Director of Global Security & Special Programs. Elizondo has claimed in the past to have been in charge of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program ( AATIP ) program, which had the ostensible mission of exploring various UAP sightings and was situated for a period under the Office of the Secretary of Defense. More recent reports had called into question his precise relationship with that program . US Army US Army TTSA has also claimed to be in possession of a number of mysterious metamaterials , which The War Zone covered in detail in our initial reporting on this CRADA. By basic definition, metamaterials are engineered composites that have electrical properties not present in any naturally occurring form of the material, which results in unique attributes, including certain impacts on the transmission of electromagnetic waves. The bulk of the CRADA document is legalese covering the various roles and responsibilities of the Army and TTSA under the agreement. Section II, however, which is six pages in total, covers the exact scope of work under the deal. You can read this entire section below: US Army US Army US Army US Army US Army US Army A lot of this is still very much about legal responsibilities. However, there are a number of extremely important statements in this section, as well. “To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science is a company with materiel and technology innovations that offer capability advancements for Army ground vehicles,” this section of the CRADA says right up front. “These technology innovations have been acquired, designed, and produced by the Collaborator [TTSA], leveraging advancements in metamaterials and quantum physics to push performance gains.” This is immediately notable because it is not qualified in any way. The Army here is presenting as a simple statement that TTSA has “materiel and technology innovations,” not that they might have them. In July 2019, TTSA issued a press release stating that it had acquired a number of metamaterial samples. A subsequent TTSA filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described them as follows: (i) One 1.75” x 1.25” x 0.25” piece of micron-layered Bismuth/Magnesium-Zinc metal; (ii) six pieces of Bismuth/Magnesium-Zinc metal; (iii) one piece of Aluminum that TTSA physicist Hal Puthoff already in his possession that is currently on loan from Seller; and (iv) one round black and silver metal flake that physicist Puthoff already has in his possession currently on loan from Seller (collectively, the “Metal Pieces”). The late Art Bell, long-time host of the paranormal radio program Coast to Coast AM , had originally acquired these from a purported anonymous source. Bell had said the individual claimed that their grandfather had been in an unspecified branch of the U.S. military and that items were related to the Roswell UFO crash conspiracy theory. A purported metamaterial that TTSA has acquired., TTSA The objects had eventually come to Tom DeLonge, who then sold them to TTSA, by way of Linda Moulton Howe , an investigative journalist who is also a prominent member of the UFO community. Howe gave an in-depth presentation, a video of which is available below, on these specific objects in 2004 at the X-Conference, a gathering devoted to fringe topics, such as UFOs. She claimed that these metal samples displayed antigravitational or levitational properties when exposed to certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Howe also discusses how she presented the materials to a number of labs and corporations, including the Army’s Redstone Arsenal, and they could not reproduce them or identify their origins. Tom DeLonge made similar claims about the materials in an interview with Joe Rogan in 2018. Harold “Hal” Puthoff , Ph.D, who is TTSA’s Vice President Science & Technology, has also made similar allusions in the past. In TTSA’s July 2019 press release, TTSA’s Chief Operating Officer Steve Justice and head of its nascent Aerospace Division, who had previously been a senior member of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design division, said the following regarding the Art Bell samples: “The structure and composition of these materials are not from any known existing military or commercial application. They’ve been collected from sources with varying levels of chain-of-custody documentation, so we are focusing on verifiable facts and working to develop independent scientific proof of the materials’ properties and attributes. In some cases, the manufacturing technology required to fabricate the material is only now becoming available, but the material has been in documented possession since the mid-1990’s. We currently have multiple material samples being analyzed by contracted laboratories and have plans to extend the scope of this study. If the claims associated with these assets can be validated and substantiated, then we can initiate work to transition them from being a technology to commercial and military capabilities. As noted in our October 2017 TTSA kickoff webcast, technologies that would allow us to engineer the spacetime metric would bring capabilities that would fundamentally alter civilization, with revolutionary changes to transportation, communication, and computation.” Now, it seems as if these infamous objects, and perhaps others, and the claims surrounding them, have caught the attention of the U.S. Army. “The Collaborator has access to advanced materiel solutions,” the agreement continues, again underscoring the Army’s opinion that TTSA has something tangible to offer. “The Government would like to assess, test, and characterize the products from the Collaborator at Government facilities to compare the capabilities of these advancements to known commodities, understand what facilities would be required to reproduce the advancements, and determine their applications for ground vehicle platforms.” “If the Government can verify materiel solutions claims by the Collaborator, then significant advancements can be made in the capabilities of Army ground vehicle platforms in terms of security, force protection and weight reduction,” it adds. This aligns well with the work of the Ground Vehicle Survivability and Protection (GVSP) directorate. For instance, there is specific mention in the CRADA of the potential applications for the metamaterials with regards to “ Active Camouflage and Directed Photon Projection ,” which have the theoretical potential to lead to cloaking devices that could help conceal vehicles, as well as other military systems. However, the CRADA also says that “the Government is interested in a variety of the Collaborator’s technologies, such as, but not limited to inertial mass reduction, mechanical/structural metamaterials, electromagnetic metamaterial wave guides, quantum physics, quantum communications, and beamed energy propulsion.” There are topics that border on science fiction. Many researchers have questioned whether existing experiments in these fields are at all practical outside of a laboratory setting. At the same time, this comes as the U.S. Navy has been sponsoring patents on inventions in related fields, including a “Craft Using An Inertial Mass Reduction Device” and a “High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator.” The War Zone has previously reported on these and other related Navy patents in detail. Diagrams from the US Navy’s  “Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device” patent, at left, the one on the “High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator,” at right., USTPO Not only that, but the CRADA specifically calls on TTSA to turn over research on quantum communication , directed photon projection system prototypes, as well as beamed energy propulsion “launch vehicles, vehicle prototypes, and systems obtained or possessed.” TTSA has released concept art in the past of a revolutionary flying vehicle, but there has been no indication that there are any actual prototypes or other related hardware of any kind. “The total value of the Collaborator’s participation (personnel, services, Intellectual Property, facilities, equipment, or other resources) is estimated at $1M, but will be determined by business needs and funding availability,” according to the CRADA. Concept art of a notional revolutionary flying vehicle that TTSA has released in the past., TTSA On top of all of this, there is a small and immensely interesting “Other Participants” subsection. “The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) can share historical reports of findings and origin of materiel solutions in the possession of the Collaborator.” This is another unqualified statement that says, without caveat, that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is in possession of reports regarding not only scientific or other findings regarding the materials themselves, but also their origins. There is no other information provided in the CRADA about exactly what information is in these OSD documents, or where they came from, but it sounds very similar to existing reports about the work that AATIP did while under OSD. In 2017, The New York Times reported that Elizondo and other individuals from AATIP had examined “metal alloys and other materials” at a facility that Robert Bigelow ‘s company Bigelow Aerospace operated in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bigelow, a millionaire real estate development and owner of the Budget Suites of America hotel chain, has also been a prominent figure in UFO and paranormal circles for decades. Bigelow Aerospace had initially won a contract to support the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP), which eventually evolved into AATIP. Under Bigelow’s direction, AAWSAP produced a number of study reports on topics, some of which bordered on science fiction. Elizondo, Puthoff, and other members of TTSA have made additional claims in recent years to be continuing to test various purported metamaterials in the organization’s possession, in addition to the Art Bell samples. The organization has been acquiring these objects as part of its internal Acquisition and Data Analysis of Materials program, or ADAM . So, could these supposedly advanced materials be the key to the technologies TTSA plans to develop in cooperation with the Army? While these exact samples of metallic materials TTSA claims to possess have been discussed in UFO circles for years, the recent partnership with the Army and the credentials of the TTSA members discussing them may suggest that there may be more to these samples than unproven claims of crashed alien spacecraft. If nothing else, it abundantly clear that the Army wants to find out definitely if this is indeed the case. The CRADA says that the agreement will run Sept. 30, 2023, but that milestone and intelligence property reviews at the end of every fiscal year between now and then. The first of those reports are due by the end of September 2020. As the partnership gets underway, we may begin to learn more about what is or isn’t behind TTSA’s claims of fantastic and potential other-worldly materials.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 4, 2019",Mysterious Object Northrop Is Barging From Redondo Beach Is A High-Power Naval Laser,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than a day ago, The War Zone reported on a mysterious and very large object related to a “U.S. Navy demonstration program” that was being shipped by Northrop Grumman from the relatively small marine in Redondo Beach to San Diego. Now, as the object is set to be transported via truck to the pier, we know what it is. It is a high-energy laser system that we can say with near certainty is part of the Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program that Northrop Grumman won the contract for in 2015. SSL-TM looks to deliver a “shipboard laser with a beam power of up to 150kW, which would provide increased effectiveness against small boats and UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles],” according to a review of Navy directed energy projects that the Congressional Research Service published in September 2019. “In January 2018, the Navy announced that it intended to install the SSL-TM laser on the newly built amphibious ship USS Portland (LPD-27). Sea testing of SSL-TM on the Portland is scheduled for the fourth quarter of FY2019.” USS Portland ., USN Portland is homeported in San Diego, which is where the laser is reportedly headed, and the ship was in port as of Sept. 26, 2019, according to the Navy . The 2019 Fiscal Year ended on Sept. 30, 2019, which could indicate a slight delay in the schedule. Otherwise, the dates, the ownership of the system, the “demonstration program” description, and the likely destination all seem to line up near perfectly with the SSL-TM program. A recent slide showing how SSL-TM will be installed on an LPD-17 class ship like USS Portland. , USN The Navy had originally planned to install the prototype SSL-TM system on the decommissioned Spruance class destroyer USS Paul F. Foster , which now serves as the service’s designated Self Defense Test Ship , before shifting the at-sea testing to Portland . As such, much of the original documentation describes the system in relation to the ex- Foster . USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN As for the SSL-TM demonstrator itself, the emitter/beam director that sits atop the system, and the platform that surrounds it, is very similar to the design shown in previous concept art. It also looks like a streamlined version of the Solid-State Laser Testbed , or SSLT, which the Army tested a number of years ago at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. This isn’t all that surprising as that too was a Northrop Grumman directed energy program. SSLT’s beam director was repurposed from a prior initiative called Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL), which TRW had first begun to develop as part of a cooperative U.S.-Israeli program in 1996. Northrop Grumman acquired TRW in 2002. The Tactical High Energy Laser Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator, the prototype created under the MTHEL program, during testing circa 2005., US Army A close-up of concept art of the SSL-TM that the Navy released in 2016., USN The Northrop Grumman “demonstrator” in Redondo Beach., KABC CH7 screencap KABC CH7 screencap SSL-TM is an outgrowth of the Navy’s past experience with the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System (LaWS), another Northrop Grumman project. This system was the service’s first-ever operational laser weapon and was fitted to the USS Ponce , an Austin class landing platform dock that subsequently became a sea base testbed in the Middle East. You can read more about that ship and the AN/SEQ-3 in a past War Zone feature . However, SSL-TM aims to be significantly more powerful. Where the AN/SEQ-3 had a 30-kilowatt power rating, the new system will be in the 150-kilowatt class. The Navy also intends for the SSL-TM program to be one step toward even more capable systems as part of its larger Navy Laser Family of Systems effort. Lessons learned from Northrop Grumman’s demonstrator, together with other systems also in development, are all set to feed into the Surface Navy Laser Weapon System Increment 2 program. A diagram showing the Navy’s incremental approach to the development of laser weapon systems., USN The SSL-TM already represents a huge step forward in power growth and capability over the earlier LaWS. With Northrop Grumman’s demonstrator now looking to be headed for San Diego and the USS Portland , it’s certainly an exciting time for the Navy’s directed energy efforts. Update: 1:55AM PDT— Freelance photojournalist and regular contributor here at The War Zone, Matt Hartman, got some photos of the laser system prior to its voyage to the Redondo Beach marina. The system is surprisingly compact considering its supposed capabilities and maritime hardening. It seems readily transportable via road. It’s interesting that such an elaborate transportation scheme was used to get it to San Diego—that is unless it heads to one of the Channel Islands for testing first.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 19, 2019",What Massive Mystery Object Is Northrop Moving By Barge From Redondo Beach This Weekend?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The relatively quaint harbor in Redondo Beach, California is about to become a scene out of a military or sci-fi thriller. Something quite large and very secretive, only described as a “U.S. Navy demonstration project,” is going to be trucked from Northrop Grumman’s campus in North Redondo Beach a few miles to the harbor, where it will be loaded onto a barge and shipped off to San Diego for testing. In all, the staging for the transfer from land to sea and the object itself will take up a whopping 70 parking spots near the pier. The Breeze , a local paper that covers the southern Los Angeles area, was first to report on the mysterious operation that is planned to begin Thursday night and run through the weekend. Our reader Scott Hodges ( @Scottyhodges ) reached out to us with the heads up. Redondo beach’s marina is far from being a locale known for heavy shipping and industry. It is filled with pleasure and sport fishing boats and surrounded by restaurants and other hospitality and entertainment establishments. As such, moving a huge secret object from the marina’s parking lot onto a seagoing barge is bound to draw loads of attention. As for what is being moved, we have no idea. The Breeze states that “Northrop officials declined to provide details about what or how big the object is, citing national security concerns.” Northrop Grumman has a very heavy presence in the area and this could be pretty much anything considering it is supposedly San Diego-bound—a destination that has some of the most abundant military infrastructure in the United States. So, everything from a laser, to a sensor or communications system, to a missile system, to some sort of power system, to unmanned aircraft or submersibles, to maybe even a boat itself, and everything in-between, is worth a guess. It’s also worth noting that the campus the object is originating from is known for its aeronautical and space systems, but it also works in a fairly diverse set of related areas, as well. What the object actually is could become more apparent once it starts making its way to the harbor via truck, but it’s also quite possible that it will be packed in a large container or partially disassembled and wrapped-up so as to hide its features and overall identity. Apparently, the plans for this unique logistical undertaking came fast and furious. Just on October 15th, Northrop Grumman and the city agreed to a $25,000 fee for using the marina in addition to any costs incurred on the city, like personnel overtime and damage caused by the operation. Discussions regarding the move began just a few weeks prior to this final deal being struck. A cursory search for similar logistical operations at the Marina came up emptyhanded, so this seems like a fairly unique occurrence. It will also be interesting to see if the barge actually ends up in San Diego or if it ends up heading to one of the Navy-controlled islands nearby—San Nicolas and San Clemente. We will be sure to update this piece when we receive more information on this mysterious move.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 20, 2019",What We Know About The Army Teaming Up With Rockstar Tom DeLonge’s UFO Research Company,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has confirmed that it has signed a cooperative research deal with former Blink 182 frontman Tom DeLonge ‘s To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, more commonly known as TTSA. Far better known for its activities investigating reports and sightings of UFOs, which are increasingly referred to as unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, this new agreement covers research into metamaterials and other high technology fields that border on the realm of science fiction. On Oct. 17, 2019, TTSA announced the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), which is now part of that service’s Futures Command . The public affairs office at CCDC’s Ground Vehicle System Center (GVSC), situated at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, subsequently confirmed to The War Zone that this CRADA exists and that it will be responsible for executing it. CRADAs are unlike typical contracts and “no money exchanging hands at all” between the Army and TTSA under this present agreement, a public affairs officer at the GVSC told The War Zone . There is also “no articulated deliverable” and if a product comes out of this process, it will most likely be a written study or another similar type of report. The ostensible goal is for Army researchers to work directly with individuals from TTSA in exploring various high technology developments, sharing resources, and any results. “TTSA’s technology solutions, which leverage developments in material science, space-time metric engineering , quantum physics, beamed energy propulsion , and active camouflage , have the potential to enhance survivability and effectiveness of multiple Army systems,” TTSA’s own press release says. TTSA bills itself as a “revolutionary collaboration between academia, industry and pop culture to advance society’s understanding of scientific phenomena and its technological implications.” It also has an Entertainment Division that publishes works of fiction about UFOs and the paranormal, serves as the holder of intellectual property rights related to DeLonge’s new band, Angels & Airwaves, and is responsible for merchandising associated with all of these enterprises. The actual origins of the organization are murky , to say the least. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-gr-A4ebLeE “Our partnership with TTSA serves as an exciting, non-traditional source for novel materials and transformational technologies to enhance our military ground system capabilities,” Dr. Joseph Cannon, the Deputy Product Manager for Science and Technology in the Vehicle Protection Systems division of GVSC, said in a statement . “At the Army’s Ground Vehicle Systems Center, we look forward to this partnership and the potential technical innovations forthcoming.” This reference to “novel materials” strongly suggests that at least part of the CRADA is concerned with metamaterials . This term refers to engineered composites that have properties that do not appear in nature. It is the structure of these new materials, more than their composition that gives them these attributes, including the ability to have unique impacts on electromagnetic waves. “This cooperative research agreement brings additional, critically important expertise that is necessary to advance the state-of-the-art in both our near and long-term technology areas of study,” Steve Justice, TTSA’s Chief Operating Officer and director of the organization’s Aerospace Division, who previously held the same title at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design bureau, added in his own statement . “While the Army has specific military performance interests in the research, much of the work is expected to have dual-use application in support of TTSA’s path to commercialization and public benefit mission.” Though the Army, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, are certainly interested in advanced and novel materials, including metamaterials, for a wide variety of applications, along with the other technologies mentioned, it is entirely unclear what TTSA has actually offered to share with the service through this CRADA. TTSA, which The War Zone has been following extremely closely , has not publicly said that it has actually developed any advanced technology for any purpose from what we can tell and it is unclear what institutional experience the organization may have with this kind of work. However, we do know that in 2018, TTSA revealed that it had “entered into two statements of work with EarthTech International, Inc. (‘ETI’) to prepare plans, perform scientific analysis and advise the company on materials analysis (‘SOW-MSSA’) and beamed energy propulsion launch systems (‘SOW-BELS’),” in a semi-annual financial report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). TTSA planned to pay ETI no more than $35,000 and $25,000 for these projects, respectively. The organization notably touted its work in both of these areas in the press release about the Army CRADA. “We are in the process of evaluating and planning projects in the Aerospace and Science Divisions, in particular regarding materials, an essential precursor to STME [Space Time Metric Engineering], and Beamed Energy Propulsion Launch Systems (‘BELS’),” the same SEC report claimed. When it comes to novel materials, ETI’s job was to “prepare a plan and advise on the collection and scientific evaluation of materials samples the company obtained through reliable reports of advanced aerospace vehicles of unknown origin.” In July 2019, TTSA announced that it had acquired unspecified metamaterials as part of its Acquisition and Data Analysis of Materials program, or ADAM . The organization had already previously claimed to have obtained a number of unknown “samples” as part of that effort, which officially began last year . The new items in question, purportedly from “an advanced aerospace vehicle of unknown origin,” have been floating around the UFO community for years after the late Art Bell , who had been the host of the paranormal radio program Coast to Coast AM , first claimed he had acquired them from an anonymous source. Bell died on April 13, 2018. How they got from Bell to TTSA isn’t entirely clear. TTSA initially implied it had acquired them from Linda Moulton Howe , who has written extensively about and reported on UFOs and other conspiracy theories, including the various purported activities at the notorious Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, for decades. A 2019 SEC report, however, said that Tom DeLonge, as an individual, had sold them to the organization for $35,000. It doesn’t say if DeLonge had gotten them straight from Howe or through someone else. It is unclear if this $35,000 was related to the funds previously set aside for ETI’s work on metamaterials. The 2019 SEC filing had also described the items in question as “Bismuth/Magnesium-Zinc metal” and “Aluminum,” raising questions about just what TTSA had actually purchased. Earlier this month, Luis Elizondo, TTSA’s Director of Global Security & Special Programs, went on Fox News ‘ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and said that the organization was already conducting tests on these objects. Reports in the past have identified Elizondo as the head of the U.S. Military’s still-murky Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program ( AATIP ) program, which explored various UAP sightings, but subsequent information has called his exact relationship to the program into question. It is also worth noting that the 2018 SEC filing said that TTSA’s Aerospace Division Director, Justice, who is now managing the organization’s end of the CRADA with the Army, was also supposed to be monitoring ETI’s performance on the materials analysis and beamed energy propulsion projects. ETI’s founder and current company President is Harold “Hal” Puthoff , Ph.D, who is also TTSA’s Vice President Science & Technology. Puthoff is well known for conducting work into the paranormal under contract to the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, including on remote viewing , during the 1970s and 1980s. He also has connections to the now-defunct National Institute for Discovery Science, or NIDSci , which explored things such as UFO sightings, extraterrestrials, and other fringe topics, including Skinwalker Ranch. Nevada real estate mogul and hotelier Robert Bigelow , also renowned for his interest in UFOs and paranormal phenomena, was NIDSci’s founder. Bigelow had also bought Skinwalker Ranch, using it for a time as a sort of paranormal research laboratory, but sold it, at least publicly, to a company called Adamantium Holdings in 2016. Bigelow Aerospace notably conducted work under contract for AATIP’s predecessor, the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP). It has since emerged that AAWSAP, via Bigelow Aerospace, had overseen the production of numerous written study reports on advanced technology, including virtually all of the topics mentioned in the TTSA press release regarding the CRADA. ETI received contracts to write reports under the AAWSAP program, with Puthoff and Eric Davis, Ph.D., another company employee, authoring them, something The War Zone has covered in detail in the past. Some of the reports that have emerged publicly so far are little more than literature reviews and at least one was on a topic that a major scientific body advising the U.S. government had already deemed to be junk science . A diagram from a report titled “Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy,” that ETI’s Eric Davis wrote under contract to AAWSAP., DIA So, is the Army going to be working with TTSA to investigate the properties of the metamaterials it claims to have acquired over the years, including from purported UFOs, and whether they may have any potential U.S. military applications? It’s unfortunately hard to say for sure at this point, though there are certainly indications that this is the case. It’s true that the Army is getting this cooperation for free, but we still don’t know the motivations behind it or what the service thinks TTSA actually has to offer. It does come at a time when the U.S. Navy has also been sponsoring seemingly fantastical patent applications for inventions such as compact fusion reactors and room temperature superconductors . DeLonge has his own curious and somewhat unexplained connections to the U.S. government and TTSA is made up of a curious group of decorated insiders from the military-industrial complex and the intelligence services. In addition, it certainly helps raise the profile of Tom DeLonge’s organization, which was also at the center of a major History Channel mini-series called “Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation,” earlier this year. For years now, the organization has been trying to raise millions of dollars in investments. In July they circulated an announcement about a new round of stock offers worth up to $30 million in total. We have already reached out to the Army to hopefully get more information about this cooperative deal with TTSA and just what it is looking to actually get out of it.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 28, 2019",Navy’s Advanced Aerospace Tech Boss Claims Key ‘UFO’ Patent Is Operable,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month, The War Zone reported on a series of strange patent applications the U.S. Navy has filed over the last few years and questioned what their connections may be with the ongoing saga of Navy personnel reporting incidents involving unidentified objects in or near U.S. airspace. We have several active Freedom of Information Act requests with the Department of Navy to pursue more information related to the research that led to these patents. As those are being processed, we’ve continued to dig through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) Public Patent Application Information Retrieval database to get as much context for these patents as possible. In doing so, we came across documents that seem to suggest, at least by the Navy’s own claims, that two highly peculiar Navy patents, the room temperature superconductor (RTSC) and the high-energy electromagnetic field generator (HEEMFG) , may in fact already be in operation in some manner. The inventor of the Navy’s most bizarre patent, the straight-out-of-science fiction-sounding hybrid aerospace/underwater craft, describes that craft as leveraging the same room temperature superconductor technology and high energy electromagnetic fields to enable its unbelievable speed and maneuverability . If those two technologies are already operable as the Navy claims, could this mean the hybrid craft may also already operable or close to operable? Or is this just more evidence that the whole exotic ‘UFO’ patent endeavor on the Navy’s behalf is some sort of ruse or even gross mismanagement of resources? Make sure to read our last feature on this bizarre topic to get up to speed on critical background information before continuing on. The Navy’s patents and their alleged operability At the heart of these questions is the term “operable.” In most patent applications, applicants must assert proof of a patent’s or invention’s “enablement,” or the extent to which a patent is described in such a way that any person who is familiar with similar technologies or techniques would be able to understand it, and theoretically reproduce it. However, in these patent documents, the inventor Salvatore Pais, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division’s (NAWCAD) patent attorney Mark O. Glut, and the U.S. Naval Aviation Enterprise’s Chief Technology Officer Dr. James Sheehy, all assert that these inventions are not only enabled, but operable . To help me understand what that term may mean in these contexts, I reached out to Peter Mlynek, a patent attorney. Mlynek informed me that the terms “operable” or “operability” are not common in patent applications, but that there is little doubt that the use of the term is meant to assert to the USPTO that these inventions actually work: “Generally, patent applications are rejected on the basis of enablement more frequently than for operability. The Patent Office rejects patent applications based on enablement because the patent attorney did not describe the invention fully, because either the patent attorney did a sloppy job, or the patent attorney caved to the client’s pressure to disclose as little about the invention as possible. “Operability/operative, on the other hand, means that the invention actually works. From what I’ve seen, operability rejection comes up in cases where the patent attorney does not really understand the science or technology behind the invention. In many cases, the rejection based on inoperability is a kind of way of telling the patent attorney that the attorney has no idea what he/she is talking about .” All of these technologies – the room temperature superconductor, the high-energy electromagnetic field generator, and the hybrid aerospace/underwater craft (HUAC) – are inventions of the same NAWCAD aerospace engineer, the aforementioned Salvatore Cezar Pais. Our previous article on the Navy’s patents explored the hybrid craft and whether or not it could be related to other developments such as Navy pilots reporting strange objects in U.S. airspace during training exercises and members of Congress now asking for answers on UFOs . Salvatore Pais wants to save the world In a conference paper that Pais presented earlier this year at the 2019 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) SciTech Forum in San Diego, the inventor states that the research that led to all of these technologies was funded by a single Naval Innovative Science & Engineering (NISE) – Basic & Applied Research (BAR) program, titled “The High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG).” In the Navy’s patent application for the HUAC, it’s claimed that the radical abilities of propulsion and maneuverability are made possible thanks to an incredibly powerful electromagnetic field that essentially creates a quantum vacuum around itself that allows it to ignore aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces and remove its own inertial mass from the equation. Thus, the ability to generate such high-frequency electromagnetic waves is key to the alleged abilities of this theoretical hybrid craft that can soar near effortlessly through air and water at incredible speeds with little to no resistance or inertia. In the patent application documents for the HEEMFG, we came across a record of an interview requested by Pais and the Navy as part of the appeal process for the patent’s initial rejection. During this telephone interview, which took place on July 10, 2018, Pais and the Navy’s attorney presented evidence that the high energy electromagnetic field generator was, in fact, operable and was a “formative invention in its incipient stage(s).” USPTO In the patent for the HEEMFG, the technology is described as being able to create what is essentially a force field straight out of science fiction, one that could generate “an impenetrable defensive shield to sea and land as well as space-based military and civilian assets, protecting these assets from such threats as Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles, Radar Evading Cruise Missiles, Top Attack for Main Battle Tanks (land and sea-based systems), as well as counteracting the effects of solar-induced Coronal Mass Ejections or defending critical military satellites in an ASAT [anti-satellite] role (space based system).” An image of the high energy electromagnetic field generator from the patent depicting its shell composed of “embedded polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramic material” capable of exhibiting “strong Piezoelectric Effects” (105), an electrostatic generator (200), a nuclear fission pebble bed reactor (300), a thermoelectric generator (400), and an electric motor (500). The protrusion at the top (125) is claimed to “generate a Cyclonic Plasma shield, which would greatly amplify the produced electromagnetic field intensity.”, USPTO In his presentation at the 2019 AIAA SciTech Forum, Pais claims that this device could even serve as an optimal asteroid deflector to save the world from 99942 Apophis , a 370-meter diameter near-Earth asteroid which has been predicted to come dangerously close to our planet in 2029 and 2036. USPTO While saving the world from a massive asteroid is without a doubt a worthwhile application of this alleged high energy electromagnetic field generator, the military applications of this supposed technology would give a paradigm-exploding advantage to any military wielding such an impenetrable electromagnetic force field. Is it only a hypothetical technology, though? The inventor and his attorney assured the patent office it is indeed operable, at least to some degree. Many readers have also questioned whether or not Salvatore Cezar Pais is, in fact, a real person. In our search for information about the elusive inventor, we have found a few mentions in one of his alma mater’s class notes updates , which states that Pais obtained his undergraduate degree in 1990 and a graduate degree in 1993 in mechanical engineering. The Mathematics Genealogy Project, meanwhile, states he obtained his Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University in 1999. We also came across this image purporting to depict Pais on a Chinese news blog which covered our original patent story, but we have so far been unable to ascertain its veracity. However, a smaller version of the same picture appears on a U.K.-based book review site under the author name Salvatore Cezar Pais . A supposed image of Salvatore Pais standing among large Super Hornet and Growler models., New.QQ.com/Chinese Internet Navy CTO claims Pais’ room temperature superconductor is operable While the HEEMFG sounds like pure science fiction, another one of Pais’ patents may be somewhat closer to reality, depending on who you ask. For years, scientists have sought to create room-temperature superconductors, electrical circuits with zero resistance that generate powerful electromagnetic fields. Most superconductors require incredibly low temperatures, however, making them impractical for most uses outside of laboratories or other carefully controlled environments. As noted by Pais in his 2019 AIAA presentation, “the achievement of room-temperature superconductivity (RTSC) represents a highly disruptive technology, capable of a total paradigm change in Science and Technology,” and adds that its “military and commercial value is considerable.” Several recent experiments into room temperature or high-temperature superconductivity have had some preliminary success, which suggests this once-out-of-reach technology could possibly become obtainable with further research. A 2019 Nature article summarizing results with room temperature superconductivity under high pressure states that “it seems more likely than ever that the dream of room-temperature superconductivity might be realized in the near future” and that “experimental data now confirm superconductivity at higher temperatures than ever before.” Nevertheless, Pais’ room temperature superconductor patent was rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the examiner determined “the disclosed invention is inoperative and therefore lacks utility” and that “no assertions of room-temperature superconductivity have currently been recognized or verified by the scientific community.” That code states that patents will be granted only for “any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” According to the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) code 2164.07 , patents are rejected on these grounds in cases “when the examiner concludes that an application claims an invention that is non-useful, inoperative, or contradicts known scientific principles.” USPTO Following that rejection, Naval Aviation Enterprise Chief Technology Officer Dr. James Sheehy once again stepped in to write a letter to the USPTO personally to vouch for the room temperature superconductor, going so far as to declare that the RTSC is “operable and enabled via the physics described in the patent application” and Pais’ publications. Again, the keyword here is “operable,” which has a different meaning than simply “enabled.” USPTO Sheehy assures the examiner that he is “well versed in the generation of electromagnetic fields, high temperature super conductivity, and physics in general.” Note, too, the last line: Sheehy’s declaration was made with the knowledge that false statements to the USPTO are punishable by fine or imprisonment. Sheehy’s letter was accompanied by a statement from Naval Aviation Enterprise attorney Mark Glut in which Glut states that “Sheehy states the invention is operable and enabled, thus overcoming both rejections.” USPTO In a separate appeal document, Glut states that in the case of the RTSC patent, “there is no reason to doubt the truth of the statements contained in the specification” and that the patent office “must provide a factual basis for an enablement rejection, rather than conclusory statements regarding the state of conventional scientific theory.” USPTO Glut goes even further with somewhat of a dig at USPTO examiner Paul A. Wartalowicz, writing that in the case of this rejection, “the examiner turned to perceived mainstream science to indicate the concept was not possible” but that “in this matter, the gatekeepers of science (the peer reviewers of Applicant’s papers) indicated the concept is possible and enabled.” USPTO However, it’s important to note that while many of Pais’ publications were published in peer-reviewed journals, his most recent publication wasn’t actually peer-reviewed. The publication “Room Temperature Superconducting System for use on a Hybrid Aerospace-Undersea Craft” does not appear in a peer-reviewed journal, but was instead presented at the 2019 AIAA SciTech Forum. On the AIAA’s Abstract Submission Process & Requirements page , it is stated that “All abstracts will be evaluated by qualified individuals from industry, academia, or government. It is recommended to the Technical Program Committee to have the broadest representation of reviewers appropriate for the forum/conference. Exceptions may be made for invited abstracts. Please note that this is a review of abstracts only and that AIAA’s meeting papers are not peer-reviewed.” Thus, the statements made by the Navy attorney aren’t entirely accurate. A slide from Pais’ 2019 presentation “Room Temperature Superconducting System for use on a Hybrid Aerospace-Undersea Craft.”, USPTO In another one of the correspondences between the USPTO and the Navy regarding the Room Temperature Superconductor patent, the examiner writes that “in such instances where the utility of the claimed invention is based upon allegations that border on the incredible or allegations that would not be readily accepted by a substantial portion of the scientific community, sufficient substantiating evidence of operability needs to be submitted by appellant.” USPTO Following that rejection, Pais and NAWCAD’s patent attorney Mark Glut requested a telephone interview that took place on June 6, 2019. According to the USPTO’s public database, the appeals surrounding the room temperature superconductor are still ongoing despite the declarations made by Dr. James Sheehy and attorney Mark Glut. USPTO An intimidating river of mumbo-jumbo and sophisticated babble After our last article on these bizarre Navy Patents, and the hybrid craft patent, in particular, some readers were quick to point out that like the physicists I have spoken with while researching these patents, they are unconvinced that the Navy may have actually already developed, or even could develop, radical new forms of electromagnetic propulsion or the room-temperature superconductors the patents and their related publications describe as the key component in their operability. To help contextualize the science or pseudoscience behind these patents and what it may or may not signify, I spoke with Dr. Mark Gubrud, a University of North Carolina physicist who teaches Peace, War & Defense courses and whose PhD is in ultra-low temperature and nanoscale experimental physics. Like many physicists, Gubrud has for years encountered claims of room-temperature superconductors and so-called spacetime metric engineering : “In the past, I have attended conferences of ‘free energy’ and ‘cold fusion’ cranks, and encountered very similar claims. The claim to have developed, or know how to develop, a room-temperature superconductor is a perennial; so are claims based on some woolly physics to alter space, inertial mass or the laws of motion. One sees these things at the meetings and in the publications that constitute a crackpot hobby industry which is mostly about the vanity of its participants. “Pais’s patents flow as an intimidating river of mumbo-jumbo that most trained physicists would recognize as nonsense, although many might simply disengage in confusion, and there are always some who might even be credulous. Of what, however, is hard to say, as it is not really clear what Pais is even claiming, apart from the room-temperature superconductor which, if it were true, would be huge news. “Pais deploys fairly sophisticated babble to make this sound plausible to those who know what real physics sounds like, but don’t understand much of it. Which is likely to include most patent examiners, journalists, and Pais’s own enablers in the Navy .” I asked for Gubrud’s opinion on why Dr. James Sheehy would vouch for Pais’ patents, to which he replied that it’s likely someone at NAWCAD has been misled or fooled: “I don’t know why Sheehy defended Pais’s patents. I am certain it’s not because they really make some kind of sense. I suspect the story is just one professional charlatan who has embedded himself in the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, plus one or a few supervisors he’s managed to fool. It’s possible, of course, that it is a bigger story which involves some actual ‘experiments’ and expenditure of funds, which is now being protected from scrutiny.” Ultimately, Guburd believes the patents signify nothing more than “an illustration of the need for transparency and peer review,” but that “even with such niceties, nonsense gets funded, often for political and ideological reasons, or simply out of corruption. But nonsense seems an especially hardy perennial in hierarchical, closed and secretive organizations.” Weaponizing patents Despite months of research and FOIA requests, it’s still unclear why the Navy would go to bat so vehemently for these patents which, as another physicist I spoke with put it, “bear no more resemblance to quantum physics as I understand it than does ‘The Force’ from Star Wars .” If the Navy has indeed managed to develop operable room temperature superconductors and electromagnetic force fields, these technologies would revolutionize warfare in ways not seen in centuries, or maybe even ever, not to mention leading to paradigm changes in civilian technology. Yet the largest question remains: if the Navy indeed possesses these technologies, or even thinks they are obtainable in the near term, why make the patents public? With all this in mind, it’s certainly possible that these patents are part of some ongoing information campaign designed to make America’s competitors question what types of black budget research is currently underway at NAWCAD and other research organizations. With so many revolutionary new aerospace technologies on the brink of deployment , perhaps this is an attempt to essentially “weaponize” patents and sow doubt among our adversaries and even inject confusion among the American populace. That scenario seems more likely given the fact that the Naval Aviation Enterprise Chief Technical Officer Dr. Sheehy claimed Chinese advances in similar capabilities as a means of getting the hybrid aerospace/underwater craft patent application approved. The U.S. and China are in a new technological arms race to develop the next generations of aircraft and advanced weaponry . Part of this race includes producing disinformation and misinformation to make your enemy invest resources, both intelligence and research and development related, that are, for lack of a better word, dead-ends. Being able to explain away strange objects in the sky as UFOs, which may indeed be emerging classified capabilities, is also beneficial both here at home and abroad. Overall, these patents certainly add to an increasingly complex narrative mosaic that is emanating directly from the Navy, one that began just as a new era of so-called ‘great power competition’ was being declared at the highest rungs of the Pentagon’s leadership. At the same time, maybe this is the Pentagon’s grasping attempt to try to make sense of and emulate mysterious and seemingly highly advanced craft that are supposedly being increasingly observed near its own aircraft, vessels, and installations. Maybe the Chinese competition claim is just a placeholder for the unknown. It’s also at least worth considering that some breakthroughs in highly exotic propulsion might have been made and that the Navy is willing to invest big bucks into seeing them progress further. Maybe those advances happened many years ago and only now is the Pentagon willing to slowly disclose them. Or all this could be a case of wasteful, misguided, or even downright corrupt spending on ideas that have no real chance of paying off down the line. The bottom line is that after months of investigation, reaching out directly to the Navy and all those involved, as well filing numerous FOIA requests that will take months or even years to process, there is still so much we don’t know about the technological developments the Navy is pursuing or that it is at least acting like it’s pursuing. The existence of these patents and the underlying documentation we’ve brought to light and examined has only made this case more puzzling, especially in contrast to experts we have talked to who claim there is no way these patents could describe actual working technologies. One thing is certain, our investigation into these patents and the Navy-funded research that led to them has only just begun.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 13, 2019",This Containerized Launcher For The XQ-58A Valkyrie Combat Drone Could Be A Game Changer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Drone maker Kratos has shown off a launcher for its low-cost XQ-58A Valkyrie unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that fits inside a standard shipping container. There has been a growing trend toward containerized weapon systems around the world and combining this general concept with the Valkyrie could make these already very exciting drones even more capable of conducting flexible, highly agile, distributed operations. A model of the “Deployable XQ-58A Valkyrie Launch System” was on display at the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual convention in Washington, D.C., which opened on Oct. 14, 2019, and came to a close today. Northrop Grumman’s James Drew took a brief video of the model at Kratos’ booth and posted it on Twitter on the last day of the show. The California-headquartered unmanned aircraft company developed the XQ-58A for the U.S Air Force’s Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration (LCASD) program, which the Air Force Research Laboratory is managing. The drone took its first flight in March 2019 and conducted a second test sortie two months later. The unmanned aircraft suffered a mishap just last week after completing its third flight. “Kratos provides ground support equipment that enables agility, remote operations, and deterrence,” a plaque accompanying the model said. “These transportable and deployable solutions offer nondescript launch modules for unmanned aerial/underwater systems and missile defense platforms.” The Valkyrie Launch System model shows what appears to be a standard ISO shipping container that holds the XQ-58A in a semi-disassembled state with its wings removed and stored on the container walls. Rails on the floor allow the launcher to slide forward out of the container and then angle the drone upward for launch. The display shows that there is also space in the container for other equipment, as well as a fire extinguisher. If the launch system does fit inside a standardized container, that would open up a world of possible deployment options for the Valkyries. In its present configuration, the XQ-58A is already runway independent given that it takes off from a static launcher and has a parachute recovery system. The most obvious application of this new containerized system would be to leverage existing military trucks capable of carrying containers, especially those with Palletized Load Systems (PLS) or similar equipment allowing for rapid unloading and offloading. This could allow personnel to quickly set up XQ-58A launch sites, even in very austere locations without any airfield infrastructure, and pack them up just as quickly to avoid enemy counterattacks or otherwise conceal their point of origin. The limited footprint necessary on the ground could help reduce the need for airfields or other established bases in the future more broadly, as well. The U.S. military as a whole is becoming increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of known, static facilities and their ability to support sustained operations during a major conflict. A US Army M1074 Palletized Load System (PLS) truck unloads a container in Afghanistan., US Army Valkyries could potentially conduct the sorties in a semi-autonomous or autonomous mode , reducing the need for direct interaction of any kind from human operators. The Air Force, at present, already envisions the XQ-58A, or an evolved successor, being able to provide a low-cost strike, electronic warfare, or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform that can operate individually, in groups of “ loyal wingmen ” with manned aircraft, or in networked autonomous swarms . You can read more about the Valkyrie and the over-arching Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) project in these past War Zone pieces . The containerized launch system would also allow rapid movement via other means, including by air, train, or ship. In particular, naval ships, such as amphibious warfare ships with large flight decks , or contractor-operated merchant ships could potentially use the system to launch the drones themselves without the need for other specialized equipment. A single ship could potentially carry dozens of XQ-58As in these self-contained launchers. The containerized system also means that personnel could launch it rapidly from one location with the intent for another team entirely to recover it at a completely different one. This could squeeze the most out of the drone’s range capabilities by allowing for more optimal route planning, even on short notice. The mobile launcher would also enable personnel to employ the drones in a more flexible manner, in general, and from multiple vectors, which could stretch an opponent’s resources across a broader front and make it more difficult for them to react. In addition, as Kratos itself has noted, these types of “nondescript launch modules” offer the potential to support discreet or covert operations by using otherwise mundane looking transportation methods, including civilian-style trucks and chartered, contractor-operated ships . This might enable the deployment of more robust unmanned capabilities to support more limited operations, including special operations missions. These concepts of operation could also benefit from the efforts to make Valkyrie attritable, which is to say cheap enough that it can be employed in riskier situations where chances are lower that it will survive its mission intact. In fact, it is being designed to act basically in a cruise missile, one-way trip mode if required, as well. The containerized launcher and the operating concepts it allows for, as well as the XQ-58A itself, are all well in line with the growing emphasis throughout the U.S. military , as well as in other countries around the world , on distributed warfare. While we don’t know how much interest the Air Force, or any of Kratos’ other customers, have expressed in this containerized launcher, it will likely be very attractive to the U.S. military, at least, given that it fits its emerging doctrine to an incredible degree.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 23, 2019",U.S. Airpower Makes Show Of Force To Protect Troops In Syria As Security Situation Unravels,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force F-15 combat jets and U.S. Army AH-64 Apache gunship helicopters conducted a show of force in northern Syria earlier today to brush back Turkish-backed local forces who were getting worrying close to a position that American troops still occupy in the northern part of the country. This came after the U.S. military announced it had completely withdrawn from the strategic northern Syrian city of Manbij , with Syrian regime forces and Russian troops now in control. All of this underscores just how dangerous and convoluted the situation in the country has already become less than two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump gave tacit approval to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch a major incursion into northern Syria. The intervention, which Turkey has dubbed Operation Peace Spring, officially began on Oct. 9, 2019, and is ostensibly targeting the U.S.-backed and predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which officials in Ankara view as terrorists. The War Zone has been following the situation very closely since then. The altercation between U.S. forces and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, or TFSA, occurred near the city of Ain Issa , which is situated in Syria less than 25 miles south of the border with Turkey, on Oct. 15, 2019. There is no indication that American aircraft or troops on the ground actually fired on the Turkish-supported forces during the show of force, though the Pentagon has made it clear that U.S. personnel are authorized to return fire against anyone in Syria in self-defense, if necessary. A map showing the general location of Ain Issa, to the north of Raqqa, also spelled Raqqah, as well as Kobane on the Turkish border and Manbij to the west along the M4 highway., Google Maps A closer view of where these three cities are located in northern Syria., Google Maps The U.S. military did not say what type of F-15s were involved, but both F-15C Eagle fighters and F-15E Strike Eagle multi-role combat jets are forward deployed in the Middle East and have flown patrols over northeastern Syria in recent months. F-15Es , along with Army Apaches , have been regular participants in American operations in Syria for years now. U.S. forces were embedded with the SDF at the time, but the TFSA’s advance toward the American outpost “violated a standing agreement with the U.S. not to get close enough to threaten U.S. troops,” an unnamed U.S. official told Fox News . The United States has reportedly filed a formal complaint with Turkey over the incident. This has also raised some questions about just how much command and control Turkey is exercising over the TFSA. “The Turks have committed to us that they will have control over those forces but it is a continued concern especially once you unleash a force like that what can continue to evolve over time as the violence continues,” an unnamed U.S. official told ABC News following the incident in Ain Issa. Some within the U.S. government have been complaining bitterly about the overall quality and professionalism of the TFSA, which already stands accused of multiple atrocities since Operation Peace Spring began last week. “They could have used Turkish regular troops, … Instead, they decided to use these thugs & bandits & pirates that should be wiped off the face of the earth,” another U.S. official told reporters earlier in the day. At the same time, this confrontation comes just comes less than a week after apparently deliberate Turkish shelling near an American outpost in the border city of Kobane, which is situated to the north of Ain Issa and right on the border with Turkey. The Pentagon says this incident, which Turkey denies occurred, also violated an understanding with Turkish forces not to target American personnel. It was also a major contributing factor in the decision to expedite the withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops from Syria, with the exception of a garrison at At Tanf much further to the south near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. “As United States forces have defeated the ISIS physical caliphate, United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq,” President Trump had said in a statement on Oct. 14, 2019. “A small footprint of United States forces will remain at At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.” At least for now, U.S. forces remain in the vicinity of Kobane, also written Kobani, near the Lafarge Cement Factory, which “had been the headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,” according to U.S. Army Colonel Myles Caggins, the top spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq. “As Turkish-backed militias advanced towards the Lafarge Cement Factory, between Kobanî and Ain Issa, on Tuesday, Oct. 15, the SDF set fire to, then vacated, its facilities and equipment,” Caggins explained. “No U.S. forces or equipment were ever in jeopardy and remain within separate, secure facilities.” Trump’s decision to initiate the full withdrawal did lead to a hasty pullout of U.S. forces from the highly strategic city of Manbij, which the SDF liberated from ISIS terrorists with U.S. support in 2016. You can read more about why this city has been such a flashpoint over the years in this past War Zone piece . Caggins had confirmed that there were no more U.S. personnel in the city in the morning on Oct. 15, 2019. A separate statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that its forces had arrived in the area and taken up positions “along the line of contact between the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey” and that they were “interacting” with Turkish authorities. The speed with which U.S. personnel departed seemed evident from what they apparently left behind, including the bulk of the structures at the main outpost in the city and food and other personal items still on the tables in the mess hall, as if everyone had just gotten up and departed in a hurry. American troops did allegedly take the time to leave lewd and insulting messages for Russian forces. Russian media had already taken the time to gloat over the U.S. withdrawal. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4bHnIR2oo9U https://youtube.com/watch?v=SiEP1ksZOKA However, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists that Manbij remains a key objective for Turkish forces and their local partners in the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, or TFSA. This sets the city up to be a particularly worrying point of contention between all of the parties involved. It’s unclear how long it might take for American personnel to vacate all of their bases and small outposts or how the situation may evolve, forcing further changes to any existing plans. Turkey’s intervention has already set off a major humanitarian crisis and threatens gains made against ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria. ISIS fighters have already begun to escape from SDF detention in the chaos. As is obvious from the situation in Manbij, the rapidly evolving conflict has also offered an opportunity for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, together with his Russian and Iranian allies, to make significant territorial gains after nearly a decade of civil war. At the same time, there has been a growing backlash to Turkey’s operation in the United States, with the U.S. government placing various sanctions on Turkish officials, including Erdogan, and other enterprises in the country. Other countries, include other NATO allies, have begun imposing arms embargos on the Turkish government and moving toward implementing their own sanctions. There are indications that some U.S. lawmakers who had been calling for an American arms embargo may be backing off that position in light of the initial round of U.S. sanctions. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will leave tomorrow to head a delegation to Turkey to try and bring a halt to Operation Peace Spring, as well. Erdogan, who clearly felt he had Trump’s approval initially, has already made it clear that, at present, he has no intention of declaring any form of a ceasefire of the SDF and that he is upset and confused with the abrupt change in U.S. policy. “We can no longer follow Trump’s tweets. We cannot track them,” Erdogan complained on Oct. 15, 2019. “There is a stark change in his stance compared to last night” What impact a ceasefire or a complete halt to Turkish operations would have at this point is unclear, regardless. The SDF has already publicly cut a deal with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad to side with his regime, and his Russian allies, in preserving Syria’s territorial integrity against Turkey. This can only make the U.S. military’s continued presence in northern Syria increasingly untenable. A small number of State Department personnel who had been helping with stabilization efforts in SDF-controlled areas left the country yesterday, according to The Wall Street Journal . The Hill also reported that the U.S. government will continue these efforts, but do so remotely, inherently limiting its ability to monitor the disbursement of humanitarian aid and implementation of projects. This is to say nothing of risks of a further deterioration of U.S.-Turkish relations, which are already at a particularly low point. The U.S. government is reportedly reviewing whether or not it should remove approximately 50 B61 nuclear gravity bombs from the American-operated portion of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, a complex issue that you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece . Plane spotters using online flight tracking software did notice a U.S. Air Force C-32B aircraft, often associated with the deployment of interagency crisis response Foreign Emergency Support Teams (FEST), make an unexplained turn around after initially heading toward Turkey. The plane had originally taken off from Naval Station Rota in Spain, but subsequently flew to Naval Air Station Sigonella in Italy after making its u-turn in the Aegean Sea. As ever, the situation in Syria remains extremely complicated and multi-faceted and continues to evolve rapidly. What is clear is that the security situation is deteriorating rapidly and, despite the announcement of a near-total withdrawal of American forces from the country, some U.S. personnel remain dangerously close to the fighting. This only raises the risk that U.S. troops may find themselves caught in the middle of the fighting, which could prompt an ever broader crisis if they are forced to more actively defend themselves against any of a number of hostile actors…or their Turkish allies.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kim Jong Un probably feels like a knight in shining armor after finagling his way into having the U.S. stand down from a military confrontation while also continuing on with his nuclear and missile programs while also being praised excessively by the President of United States and obtaining unprecedented photo ops with him on no less than three separate occasions , while also tightening ties with his neighbors, China and Russia . It has truly been an incredible couple of years for the Chairman of Juche, Kim Jong Un. With all this in mind, these glorious photos of the Hermit Kingdom’s “Young General” riding a decorated white horse through a snowy landscape at the top of sacred Mt. Paektu probably fit perfectly with his dashing vision of himself and the one he and his henchmen want to portray to their people, many of which live on the brink of starvation on any given day. The reality is that Kim grew up as something of a secondary prince of a kingdom many detested and even fewer visited. Still, the life of a despot’s son offered a lot of opportunities. Kim’s obsession with aviation was fostered by the military dictatorship his family presided over, for instance. Horseback riding is also a famed Kim family tradition that has symbolic roots that date back to Kim Il Sung’s rise to power. As such, horses play a substantial part in the propaganda surrounding the supposedly divine Kim Dynasty, one that only dates back about 65 years. Grand paintings and statues in North Korea’s most important public spaces show Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il riding triumphantly on horseback. Now Kim Jong Un is joining their ranks symbolically. A grand statue located in Pyongyang of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un riding steeds., Nicor/Wikicommons Kim Il Sung on horseback carrying a young Kim Jong Il on Mt. Paektu., apjjf.org Like everything else in North Korea, these images rhyme with those perpetuated by past iterations of the Kim regime in an attempt to subliminally fortify the young ruler’s connection with the cherished bloodline of North Korea’s brutal ruling family. KCNA KCNA As such, even though these images may seem bizarre, they are hardly unique. In fact, Kim Jong Un has been seen atop a horse before, including alongside his entourage of toadies and yes men, many of which have since been liquidated. A younger Kim riding with his inner circle—some of which have since gotten the axe—during a military inspection. Image circa 2012. , KCNA Kim and his mount in a gallop seven years ago., KCNA The horse is clearly a symbol of strength and progress in North Korea. In fact, the mythological winged horse Chollima is probably the closest thing one can find to a national animal in the Hermit Kingdom. It not only has a military and power element to its symbolism, but it also connects North Korea’s leadership with its subjects, many of which live heard agrarian lives. So, putting Kim Jong Un on a white horse adorned with decorative bridal and tack at the most sacred geographical location in the entire country is just about as divine as it gets propaganda-wise, even though it may look downright ridiculous to those of us in the free world. As to how many North Koreans really buy into this type of thing, that’s debatable. But the regime clearly finds great value in pulling out their trusty propaganda playbook and running the same old plays over and over again for decades on end.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 4, 2020",Behold USS America Sailing With A Whopping 13 F-35Bs Embarked Aboard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. USS America (LHA-6) is executing “routine operations” in the eastern Pacific, but her complement of aircraft is anything but. Deployed aboard are no less than 13 F-35Bs , and possibly even more stowed away in her hangar deck. This is the closest we’ve seen the USMC and the “Gator Navy” come to executing the notional “Lightning Carrier” concept , which would see the amphibious assault ships packed with nearly two dozen F-35Bs in the full-on fixed-wing aircraft carrier role. You can read all about this idea in this past feature of ours. It even eclipses the USS Wasp’s (LHD-1) cruise to the South China Sea last Spring when it was spotted with ten F-35Bs aboard . The controversial America class was designed for expanded aviation capabilities, with the space that would have been taken up by the ship’s floodable well deck and other ground-assault related equipment being used for more hangar capacity and aviation support facilities. The first two to ships in the class, America and Tripoli , retain this unique configuration, with the third in the class and those that follow becoming their own subclass as they regain their well deck and have a number of other alterations you can read all about here . U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Chad Swysgood Regardless, USS America is better suited for expanded F-35 operations than any other amphibious assault ship in the fleet and she had to go through a refit just after being delivered for additional modification to be better suited for taking on the F-35’s unique capabilities and especially its hot and powerful exhaust plume when in vertical landing (STOVL) mode. This included treating and reinforcing landing areas on the ship and relocating and hardening components on the vessel that may be directly impacted during F-35B boarding operations. Still, even with these modifications, it looks as if America may have fallen victim to the F-35’s exhaust plume. Take a look at the large satcom dome near the port-aft part of the ship. It looks like it has been badly damaged. This is very near where the F-35Bs lineup beside the ship and cross over onto its deck before landing vertically after their missions. 13 F-35Bs plus two MV-22s on deck. Also, note the damaged satcom dome., U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Chad Swysgood Plussing up the fixed-wing tactical aircraft component dramatically for some Amphibious Ready Group cruises will definitely give the Navy’s big-deck amphibs a boost in air combat capability, including the ability to field more constant aerial patrols, if necessary, but it comes at a cost. Traditionally, these ships deploy with six to eight AV-8Bs or F-35Bs, having the fixed-wing portion of the fixed-wing component of the air wing provide a potent, but limited capability to support amphibious assaults and other traditional Marine tasks. VMFA-122 Flying Leathernecks F-35Bs coming aboard the USS America . , U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Vance Hand When more of these jets are added, less USMC amphibious fighting capability can be deployed. But that doesn’t mean doing so doesn’t make a lot of sense for some missions, in effect turning these ships into light to medium aircraft carriers capable of “first day of war” operations. This is something I have long held up as the biggest advantages of the F-35B and the F-35 program overall—giving America double the carriers capable of kicking-down the enemy’s door as combat operations open up. If you add in a few of Ospreys for aerial refueling , a couple of MH-60s for utility and search and rescue tasks, and an advanced drone for persistent aerial surveillance tasks, you have an impressive fixed-wing carrier force capable of executing relatively high-tempo operations and many of the missions that their larger counterparts are capable of. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Chad Swysgood It’s not like the Harrier hasn’t also turned amphibious assault ships into full-on carriers during wartime operations, as well. But those aircraft are smaller and far less capable than the F-35B, and those types of operations have been very limited in nature. It will be interesting to see if USS America goes on cruise with a similar complement. With just two of the Navy’s big deck amphibious assault ships uniquely suited for greatly expanded F-35 operations, if there are to be Lightning Carriers at all, it will most likely be them implementing this hard-hitting configuration.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 24, 2019","U.S. Reviewing Options For Pulling Nuclear Bombs Out Of Turkey, Here’s How They Might Do It","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government is reportedly examining multiple plans for how it might remove approximately 50 B61 nuclear gravity bombs it keeps in ready storage at the American-operated portion of Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base . This comes a week after Turkey launched an operation into northern Syria targeting the primarily Kurdish U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF. This intervention has precipitated an all-new crisis in the region, prompted the start of at least a tactical withdrawal of U.S. forces from much of the country amid concerns they could be caught in the fighting, and led to calls for an arms embargo and major sanctions on the Turkish government. The New York Times was the first to report that officials from the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Energy, the latter of which oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, were reviewing what to do about the B61s at Incirlik. These bombs have been a particularly serious security concern, as the War Zone has highlighted in the past , after U.S.-Turkish relations began to chill following an attempted coup against Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. There continue to be completely unfounded conspiracy theories that the U.S. military was directly involved in the abortive putsch, which did involve Turkish Air Force units at Incirlik. There have been calls in Turkey since then for investigations into American military personnel and raids onto the American portions of the base to collect evidence, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . A satellite image of Incirlik Air Base as of October 2018., Google Earth Turkey’s invasion of Northern Syria Concerns about the B61s are undoubtedly higher now given the current situation in neighboring Syria. On Oct. 11, 2019, Turkish artillery “ bracketed ” a U.S. military position in the Syrian city of Kobane, firing shells within just hundreds of feet of the outpost edges of the outpost. This highly strategic city sits right on the border with Turkey and, at the time of writing, is under SDF control. The Pentagon has insisted that its Turkish counterparts know all of the locations of U.S. forces in Syria and this appears to have been a deliberate attempt to get the Americans to abandon their post, which they did, but only temporarily. “In the last 24 hours, we learned that they [the Turkish military] likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned – and to the west,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said in an interview on Oct. 13, 2019. “I spoke with the president last night after discussions with the rest of the national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria,” Esper continued . In Syria itself, there is already a humanitarian catastrophe emerging , as well as the prospect of ISIS fighters escaping from SDF detention centers and rejoining their cause. There are also reports that the erstwhile U.S.-backed group has struck a deal with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, and his Russian allies, that would see them all join forces to block the advance of Turkish forces, as well as Ankara’s local partners in the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA). Syrian Arab Army forces, and militias aligned with Assad, as well as Turkish forces and the TFSA, are already reportedly converging on the area around Manbij , another highly strategic city in northern Syria and a major flashpoint over the years, which that you can read more in this past War Zone piece . There are separate indications that American personnel may be trying to block Assad’s advance toward Manbij, as well as Kobane, but this may just be in order to give them time to safely evacuate from the area themselves. A growing number of U.S. lawmakers are now calling for an arms embargo against Turkey, as well as an array of sanctions. Trump and his Administration has offered his support to the idea of sanctions, despite at least tacitly approving the Turkish operation in a phone call with Erdogan on Oct. 6, 2019. Other countries, including a number of NATO allies , have already halted their own arms sales to Turkey and could be looking at additional sanctions, as well. B61 nuclear bombs in Turkey The risks of a larger conflict erupting in Syria, including from inadvertent clashes between the myriad parties present in the region, is extremely high. This, combined with the artillery incident in Kobane and the general worsening of U.S.-Turkish relations, may finally be changing the security calculous with regards to keeping the B61s in Turkey. The United States has had those weapons forward-deployed at Incirlik since the Cold War as part of a broader nuclear response plan throughout NATO. There are between 150 and 200 total B61s deployed between Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Turkey is the only host country that is not part of the alliance’s nuclear sharing agreement , which gives the other countries involved access to these weapons, in close coordination with the United States, during a crisis. So, there are no aircraft actually based in Turkey that could deliver the weapons in a crisis. It’s important to note that there are a number of security measures in place that mitigates the most immediate risks to the B61s, such as someone attempting to steal one and set it off. Each bomb has a coded lock mechanism known as a Permissive Action Link (PAL) that requires a unique 12-digit code in order to arm it. Handlers can also render them inert using a different command disable code. That’s not to say that there aren’t risks, including that someone could fashion the weapons into some form of a dirty bomb, as well as the general security nightmare that would result from any loose nuclear weapons, not to mention the national embarrassment. As we wrote back in 2016 : “Still, it is unlikely that the 700-pound B61 nuclear bombs would be stolen from the facility. The storage area is made up of underground vaults, and its perimeter is ringed with two security fences and loads of surveillance, not to mention the compliment of soldiers there to protect the weapons. The facility has also received recent upgrades to make it more hardened against intrusion. However, if Turkey’s increasingly totalitarian political leadership were to take a vehemently anti-American stance, the security that protects the nukes would amount to a speed-bump for Turkey’s armed forces. Even a very well-orchestrated and large-scale terrorist attack on the compound could lead to a disastrous situation, even if only geopolitically. On the other hand, you can’t simply steal a B61 nuclear bomb and use it as you wish. The fusing system is protected by a code mechanism called a Permissive Action Link (PAL). The codes needed to authorize their activation have to be provided by the National Command Authority. The weapons also must be continuously maintained to be combat effective. These nuclear gravity bombs also feature a command disable mode which allows handlers to disable the weapon in fairly quick order. This is done by entering the right code to activate the bomb’s thermal battery, which also detaches the bomb’s control handle in the process. The battery overheats and fries the weapons electronics, thus making the weapon incapable of triggering its nuclear warhead. Supposedly, the B-61 must be sent back to depot for a complete overhaul in order for it to be capable of functioning normally once again after a command disable action, although there are differing theories as to just how hard it would be for a very dedicated entity, especially a state actor, to get the weapon in working order once again. Some say it is quite possible. If under an imminent threat of seizure, the facility’s security teams and the vaults that the bombs are held in could give technicians time to attempt to disable the weapons via the command disable function. If executed, and all the weapons were rendered useless, at least temporarily, even threatening the technicians directly to bring them back online would be a useless exercise. The value of the actual warhead’s nuclear material is also debatable, as designing a weapon around it would require great know-how and testing would likely be required. Regardless, the weapons could be fashioned into crude but potentially very deadly dirty bombs. The truth is, that if the base were seized, the US would likely attempt to flatten it before the weapons were able to be dispersed, but doing so would be unprecedented on a massive scale and it would take time to accomplish. A mission would likely have to originate out of the Middle East, the continental US, or using tactical aircraft out of Europe, although they would have to be able to carry sufficient “bunker busters” (BLU-109 equipped JDAMs, GBU-24/27) to strike all 21 storage vaults located at Incirlik. As we saw in Benghazi, tactical aircraft are not held at a high-readiness for strike operations in the region, and especially not equipped at the ready with bunker busters. The idea of a country stealing nuclear weapons from the US has long been a staple of pop culture fascination, but the reality is far less sensational. Still, an incident where American nuclear weapons security was directly threatened could be a massive geopolitical failure for the United States, and if they were to fall into someone else’s hands, even those of a close former ally, it would be devastating to American credibility abroad, regardless of if they can actually be used or not.” Getting nukes out of Incirlik It is unclear how advanced the U.S. government’s discussions about pulling the B61 bombs out of Incirlik might be. The Times report does not specifically say that the U.S. military has been involved in the review of the possible options, though it is hard to see how that could be possible as they would almost certainly be responsible, at least in part, for transporting the weapons out of the country. While we don’t know what courses of action might be under consideration, any option would be a major logistical undertaking, even under the best of circumstances. The most likely plan would be to fly the bombs out as part of what is known as a Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) operation using specifically designated U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster IIIs and crews trained in the movement of nuclear weapons and who are vetted under the Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Assurance Program, though properly configured and crewed C-130 Hercules and C-5 Galaxy airlifters are also options, if necessary. Members of the US Air Force’s 62nd Airlift Wing tie down inert B83 nuclear bombs inside a C-17 during a Prime Nuclear Airlift Force inspection in 2009., USAF Regardless, moving nuclear weapons requires the utmost safety and security to ensure the weapons do not get lost or stolen and that they do not get damaged or otherwise improperly handled, potentially in such a way that leads to a devastating nuclear or radiological accident . Even just flying nuclear material around for disposal is often a highly secretive and controlled affair. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators, headed for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site, on a C-17 in 2015., USAF “Select the safest, most reliable aircraft available for PNAF missions,” according to one Air Force manual titled Safety Rules for Nuclear Logistics Transport By The Prime Nuclear Airlift Force . “Fuel PNAF aircraft with the best low-volatility fuel available which is compatible with aircraft engine operation.” The stipulations regarding flight route restrictions and aerial refueling, which you can read below in full, are particularly notable in this context: USAF The base does sit within 250 miles of the Syrian border, but there’s no indication that this meet’s the Pentagon’s definition of an “unsafe distance” for transporting nuclear weapons by air. Since the civil war in Syria erupted in 2011, there have been limited movements of bombs in and our of Turkey in order to return them to the United States for maintenance and upgrades, according to our trust sources. That doesn’t mean that planning a route from Incirlik with these restrictions and in order to ensure access to other airbases or airports that meet various security requirements in the event of an inflight emergency, couldn’t still be immensely complicated. On top of that, just while personnel are on the ground loading nuclear weapons and otherwise conducting PNAF missions the Air Force rules “prohibit direct overflight of PNAF ground operations within the airspace controlled by the installation.” This would require some level of direct coordination with Turkish officials at Incirlik, as well. For safety and surety reasons, it is also highly unlikely that one aircraft would move all 50 of the bombs, adding to the complexity of the overall operation. It is possible that the U.S. military could fly the weapons to an intermediate location, such as to Aviano Air Base in Italy, which also hosts B61s, before moving them on to a final destination, as well. Unfortunately, many NATO members, even those who host nuclear weapons, are generally reluctant to be involved with them in any way publicly due to domestic political considerations, which could add to the existing complications. There are other transportation methods, including movement by road convoy using specially protected trucks or bringing them to a port for shipment out of the region by sea. However, the idea that the United States would choose either of these options seems remote, especially given the state of relations with Turkey and risks that various state actors and non-state militant groups in the region pose. “Erdogan’s hostages” Whatever the actual physical method of getting them out of the country might be, there are intangible complexities, as well, too. “Those weapons, one senior official said, were now essentially Erdogan’s hostages,” given the current geopolitical situation, according to The Times . “To fly them out of Incirlik would be to mark the de facto end of the Turkish-American alliance,” the story explained. “To keep them there, though, is to perpetuate a nuclear vulnerability that should have been eliminated years ago.” US Air Force Security Forces at Incirlik Air Base., USAF Removing the B61s would not remove Turkey from the deterrent protection offered by NATO’s nuclear umbrella, but it certainly would be a very clear statement about the state of U.S.-Turkish relations. That could have serious ramifications for the future of the alliance in general, which has been trying to tread very carefully around the growing spat between two of its members for some time now. Ankara and Washington have been sparring in recent years over a wide array of issues , including SDF. Turkey’s purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system also led to its suspension from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program earlier this year. In addition, though Erdogan has a close relationship with Trump, many of his policies have been increasingly authoritarian and he has been moving his country closer to Russia’s sphere of influence as ties with the United States have worsened. Turkey and Russia, together with Iran, another American opponent that stands to benefit from the new chaos in Syria, have all been cooperating on a diplomatic effort to bring an end to the country’s civil war in a way that suits their various national interests, as well. From left to right, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani after a meeting in Anakara to discuss the situation in Syria in September 2019., Valeriy Melnikov / Sputnik via AP It might also prompt new calls within Turkey, which is presently a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to consider developing its own nuclear arsenal. “Some countries have missiles with nuclear warheads, not one or two. But [they tell us] we can’t have them,” Ergodan had said at a gathering of his members from his Justice and Development Party, also known by the Turkish acronym AK, in September 2019 . “This, I cannot accept,” the Turkish President continued. “There is no developed nation in the world that doesn’t have them,” he added, despite the fact that the vast majority of the developed world does not have nuclear weapons. It’s unclear how serious Ergodan might have been about the prospect of a Turkish nuclear stockpile. Reports have suggested this may have been more of a pointed comment about Israel’s well known, but unacknowledged nuclear arsenal, which the United States and the rest of the West tolerates. It also came amid broader concerns about a new Middle East nuclear arms race that followed reports that Saudi Arabia might also be interested in developing such weapons to counter Iran. Though the regime in Tehran insists that it is not developing nuclear weapons at present and there is no hard evidence to the contrary, Iranian nuclear ambitions remain a topic of intense debate . At the same time, it had already appeared increasingly untenable to keep the B61s in Turkey from a basic security standpoint and those concerns have only grown in the past week. After years of ignoring the issue and not taking the opportunity to remove the bombs when it might have been possible to present it as a mutual decision or as a byproduct of the B61-12 upgrade program , it may be impossible to ignore the risks of keeping the weapons where they are.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week Bell unveiled its 360 Invictus high-speed armed scout helicopter contender for the Army’s Future Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) tender and now Sikorsky is firing back with its long-anticipated entrant, the “Raider X.” The aircraft is based directly on its S-97 Raider demonstrator, which leverages the company’s X2 compound helicopter technology to achieve very high speed and maneuverability for a rotorcraft. The company’s larger SB>1 Defiant , which is taking part in the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program now and is likely to try to capture the Future Vertical Lift-Medium contract in the future, also uses this unique configuration. Sikorsky’s X2 technology has been developed and funded internally for over a decade. You can read all about it and the S-97 in this exclusive War Zone interview with the company’s X2 team. The S-97 Raider demonstrator serves as a basis for the Raider X design, although with some significant differences. , Sikorsky Bell is not Sikorsky’s only competitor for the FARA contract, which is slated to fill the void that the prematurely retired OH-58D Kiowa Warrior left and also replace a number of AH-64 Apaches, in the decade to come. The company, which is now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, is also facing off against Boeing, AVX and L3 , and a powerful consortium that includes Karem, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Boeing and the latter team have yet to show off their FARA concepts. Sikorsky says that their Raider X is the leader in the “service’s revolutionary approach for rapid development and delivery of game-changing technology and warfighter capabilities, equipped for the most demanding and contested environments. Raider X enables the reach, protection, and lethality required to remain victorious in future conflicts.” The company goes on to highlight the unique capabilities of the Raider X: · Exceptional Performance : The X2 rigid rotor provides increased performance including; highly responsive maneuverability, enhanced low-speed hover, off-axis hover, and level acceleration and braking. These attributes make us unbeatable at the X. · Agile, Digital Design : State-of-the-art digital design and manufacturing is already in use on other Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky production programs such as CH-53K, CH-148 and F-35, and will enable the Army to not only lower the acquisition cost, but enable rapid, affordable upgrades to stay ahead of the evolving threat. · Adaptability : Modern open systems architecture (MOSA)-based avionics and mission systems, offering “plug-and-play” options for computing, sensors, survivability and weapons, benefiting lethality and survivability, operational mission tailoring and competitive acquisitions. · Sustainable/Maintenance: Designed to decrease aircraft operating costs by utilizing new technologies to shift from routine maintenance and inspections to self-monitoring and condition-based maintenance, which will increase aircraft availability, reduce sustainment footprint forward and enable flexible maintenance operating periods. · Growth/Mission Flexibility : Focused on the future and ever evolving threat capabilities, X2 compound coaxial technology provides unmatched potential and growth margin for increased speed, combat radius and payload. This potential and growth margin further enables operational mission flexibility which includes a broader range of aircraft configurations and loadouts to accommodate specific mission requirements. Sikorsky Raider demonstrator during flight testing., Sikorsky Some other features of the X-2 technology in the raider were stated by the company as such: With RAIDER X, Sikorsky introduces the latest design in its X2 family of aircraft. To date, X2 aircraft have achieved/demonstrated: Speeds in excess of 250 knots High altitude operations in excess of 9,000 feet Low-speed and high-speed maneuver envelopes out to 60+ degrees angle of bank ADS-33B (Aeronautical Design Standard) Level 1 handling qualities with multiple pilots Flight controls optimization and vibration mitigation Sikorsky experimental test pilot Bill Fell, who has taken the Raider on the majority of its test flights, also stated the following about the X2 technology: “The power of X2 is game changing. It combines the best elements of low-speed helicopter performance with the cruise performance of an airplane… Every flight we take in our S-97 RAIDER today reduces risk and optimizes our FARA prototype, RAIDER X.” The concept image of the Raider X is very similar to the S-97, but with a number of significant refinements. It appears that some low-observable considerations may have been driving factors of its design. The rendering shows a helicopter that is free of radar-reflective components bolted on to the airframe, such as sensors, pylons, antennas, or weapons. In fact, it looks as if its 20mm cannon is concealed when not in use. Its rotor head shrouds are also angled and it has a v-shaped inlet design feeding a deeply buried gas turbine engine. Its exhaust also appears to be buried inside its tail boom and it could even use a similar cooling system as found on the company’s long-defunct RAH-66 Comanche . The protruding contour soffit on the tail would point to this feature. On the Comanche, the hot exhaust of the engine was mixed with cool air and vented through this area. Sikorsky Sikorsky In addition, the edges of its fuselage appear to also be chined, like the Comanche. In fact, the chine line is quite similar, albeit less extreme. The airframe also appears to be designed with continuously changing radiused surfaces. We must stress that these could also be features largely intended to make the airframe as efficient and the helicopter as fast as possible, and they may just appear to share some tenets of low-observable design . We have reached out to Sikorsky for clarification on this. Also remember that there are varying degrees of low-observability and reducing the aircraft’s radar cross-section and infrared signature significantly, while not going nearly as far as the Comanche, would still be a major win in terms of survivability. This is especially true considering that this machine will also have speed, new situational awareness enhancing sensors, and advanced defensive countermeasures on its side when it comes to surviving over a modern battlefield. A similar design was teased for the FVL Light requirement that came before the FARA tender was formally announced. , Sikorsky/Lockheed Martin The Raider X, with its coaxial compound configuration, will certainly be a top kinetic performer out of the FARA contestants, but even though Sikorsky really stresses that their X2 technology is low risk, that term is very certainly subjective. It is true that the company has spent over a decade developing the technology, but it has never been put into production and it is substantially higher-risk in nature than what Bell is offering , which is really a conventional helicopter. Considering its complexity, the Raider X could also come with a significantly higher price tag, although we really can’t say that definitively at this time. Then again, is a low-cost, lower-performing option really even worthwhile persuing for the FARA mission at all? In a new era of advanced integrated air defense systems (IADS) networks and capable short-range air defense systems , it’s already questionable that any traditional helicopter can persistent over highly contested territory and survive reliably in order to do it over and over again. Range is also an issue. In an age of anti-access, area-denial strategic realities, will the prospect of basing helicopter units within say 150 miles of an objective area even be realistically possible in any way? We will be talking more in-depth about these issues in the near future, but with them in mind, range, speed, and especially survivability should really be placed above everything else if the FARA concept is even worth investing billions into at all. Otherwise, it seems like something of a wasteful tribute to the days or rotary-wing warfare that seems to have already passed us by. The S-97’s unique lines seen from above in this striking image., Sikorsky The Raider X could very well deliver in the speed, range, and even in the survivability department if it is indeed stealthy in nature and has the latest defensive aids, sensors, and weaponry. If it doesn’t, it will be a complex helicopter with some developmental risk that may come in at a significantly higher price than some of its competitors. But once again, even if something is cheaper, is it worth really doing it at all if it isn’t survivable or even employable in a future higher-end conflict? We’ll have to wait to answer these questions as FARA progresses, but for now, we finally know exactly what Siksorsky’s offering will look like, and it is quite impressive.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 13, 2021",Here Is Our First Clear Look At China’s Z-20F Seahawk Helicopter Clone (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China is world-renowned for its ability to steal foreign intellectual property, reverse engineer it, and to quickly produce something similar. In fact, this relationship between espionage, design, and production has helped catapult the People’s Liberation Army into a place where America’s technological superiority is no longer assured. But when it comes to creating a knock-off of America’s legendary Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter, China already had dozens of airframes on-hand to examine and even improve upon. You can read all about the Z-20 and China’s experience with the Black Hawk in this past piece of ours . Now, with their standard Z-20 Black Hawk utility helicopter clone already in service, the rapidly expanding People’s Liberation Army Navy is getting its own shipboard model, just like how the U.S. Navy has the Seahawk . Below is a great shot of the latest Harbin Z-20 configuration, taken at China’s big helicopter exposition just days ago. The Z-20 is now in operational service with the People’s Liberation Army. Z-20 helicopters fly during The 5th China Helicopter Exposition at Free Trade Zone of Tianjin Port on October 10, 2019 in Tianjin, China. This is the latest configuration of the Z-20 we have seen to date. , VCG/VCG via Getty Images While China was showing off its Black Hawk clone in front of an international audience, low-resolution and blurry photos of the supposed Z-20F began to appear online, including some that showed auxiliary wing-like hardpoints attached to it, similar to the Lightweight Armament Support Structure (LASS) and External Stores Support System (ESSS) wings found on its American-made counterparts. Z-20F seen with pylons and missiles during testing., Chinese internet These attachments have become especially critical for U.S. Navy Seahawk helicopters as they are being used constantly in the force protection role aimed at countering small boat swarms that could threaten their motherships and other allied ships nearby. So, it’s not surprising that China in prioritizing emulating this capability. Now, not long after these less than stellar images began to surface, we have our first high-resolution photos of the Z-20F to examine in detail. Z-20F, Chinese Internet The helicopter is closer in form to the mold line of the Black Hawk than its general utility counterpart, especially in terms of its nose section. It features apertures for a missile approach warning system (MAWS) and it has a landing gear arrangement similar to SH-60B/F and MH-60R Seahawks that operate from the small decks of surface combatants. A FLIR sensor is seen underneath the helicopter’s nose, as well as what looks like some sort of larger radome for a surface search radar under its fuselage. Author’s update: A Seahawk pilot contact of ours pointed out that the bulges below the cockpit doors may be conformal radar arrays. After closer examination, I agree. This would also make sense considering the ventral radome’s shallow dimensions and smaller size than what is found on the SH-60B/F and MH-60R, for instance. The Navy’s hugely capable and multi-role MH-60R seen equipped with Hellfire missiles and a 50 caliber machinegun for the anti-surface warfare/counter-small boat swarms role. The helicopter is a highly capable sub-hunter and sea control platform, as well, and can also be used in some utility roles and for search and rescue., USN A square hole similar to those found on Seahawk and other maritime-optimized helicopters that use the RAST system for recovery is also clearly seen. Another large square structure is visible along the helicopter’s under-fuselage centerline, although it is tough to tell definitely what it is for in the available images. This is also true for a number of other protrusions on the Z-20F’s belly. A vertical sonobuoy launching aperture is possible here. A crude Z-20F mockup seen aboard a Chinese Type 055 destroyer for testing. , Chinese internet The helicopter’s tail boom holds a number of features, including a downward-facing UHF communications antenna and a directional data-link antenna under a dome. These are key components that give the Z-20F the capability to send large amounts of information to receivers that are located on the surface of the earth within line-of-sight. For beyond-line-of-sight connectivity, a “towel rack” high-frequency antenna is visible, as is a large satellite communications antenna system is located just aft of where the fuselage connects with the tail boom. An APU exhaust appears to be located just before it on the helicopter’s fuselage. There are also brackets for flare dispensers on the tail and you can clearly see how the rotor portion of the tail is meant to fold for storage within the tight confines of a ship’s hangar bay. Finally, the aircraft is also equipped with a temporary air-data probe for flight testing. The Z-20F will likely share the same glass cockpit with its utility cousin. We got a glimpse of it for the first time via the image below: The Z-20F isn’t some sort of frivolous technological parity prestige program for the PLAN, it is a badly needed capability. Currently, there is no helicopter that is ideally suited for China’s rapidly expanding force of large and advanced surface combatants. Currently, the PLAN has some Russian-built KA-28s , the larger Z-8 /Z-18 that was designed off of the French Super Frelon, and the Z-9 , which is a light twin derived from the French Dauphin. Z-18F outfitted for anti-submarine warfare. , Chinese Internet None of these helicopters offer a modern, multi-role capability that has the ability to hold significant amounts of gas while also lifting diverse weaponry, such as guided anti-armor missiles used for defending ships against swarming attacks, torpedoes, and anti-ship missiles. The Z-20F can presumably do all this while also being ideally suited for the hangar bays of China’s growing fleet of massive Type 055 destroyers . It is also very possible that this helicopter will end up on the PLAN’s Type 052C/D destroyers , and possibly even the PLAN’s Type 054 frigates , among other vessels, such as China’s aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships . A Z-8 seen on the deck of a Type 054 frigate. , Chinese military With this in mind, the Z-20F would fill a massive gaping hole in the PLAN’s inventory and would extend the combat reach and enhance the situational awareness of its ships dramatically. So, don’t be surprised if you see China’s navalized Black Hawk clone flying from the decks of its warships very soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 25, 2019","It’s Not What The U.S. Is Deploying To Saudi Arabia, It’s The Structure Of The Deployment","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just hours after news hit that an Iranian tanker experienced some kind of explosions in the Red Sea, off the Saudi coast, the Pentagon announced that it was deepening its military deployments to The Kingdom with a host of new capabilities and thousands of additional American personnel. While the deployment of two fighter squadrons, two Patriot missile batteries, and one Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system, in addition to what’s already there, is very significant, a detail that most have glossed over is what’s most intriguing—the Air Force is setting up a new Air Expeditionary Wing in Saudi Arabia, one that could quickly grow in size and that could potentially be in place for years to come. An official release from the Pentagon reads as such: At the request of U.S. Central Command, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper authorized the deployment of additional U.S. forces and the following equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Two Fighter Squadrons One Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) Two Patriot Batteries One Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) Secretary Esper informed Saudi Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Muhammad bin Salman this morning of the additional troop deployment to assure and enhance the defense of Saudi Arabia. Taken together with other deployments this constitutes an additional 3,000 forces that have been extended or authorized within the last month. Since May, the Department of Defense has increased the number of forces by approximately 14,000 to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility as an investment into regional security. As we have stated, the United States does not seek conflict with the Iranian regime, but we will retain a robust military capability in the region that is ready to respond to any crisis and will defend U.S. forces and interest in the region. Clearly, the deployment is defensive in nature. The aircraft that are most likely to deployed are F-15C/D Eagles, which have air-to-air as their only mission and are especially well equipped for detecting, identifying, and countering low-flying targets with small radar sections—such as drones and cruise missiles—with their powerful AN/APG-63V3 AESA radar sets and Sniper targeting pods . Saudi Arabia also operates a large quantity of F-15s in various configurations, including the most advanced ever built, the F-15SA. While Patriot batteries and THAAD systems have the ability to swat down incoming ballistic missiles, the most potent and enduring capability being sent over to Saudi Arabia is the Air Expeditionary Wing concept. Although it has no aircraft permanently assigned, the AEW is the foundation for a highly agile and logistically capable support force to field all types of airpower in a constantly morphing and composite manner. This elastic, forward-deployed force concept has been hugely effective in the region, with the AEWs located at multiple major bases in the Middle East and prosecuting conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as other regional security missions. Installing an AEW in Saudi Arabia is major step towards forming a permanent presence in the country. For many years, beginning after the Khobar Towers attack in 1996 , the U.S. military had largely vacated Saudi Arabia and settled into bases in other Arab countries in the region. That is now changing as the U.S. looks to backstop Saudi Arabia’s defensive capabilities , many of which were purchased from the United States, but proved ineffective at countering the unprecedented drone and cruise missile strike on two of the Kingdom’s most important oil facilities last month. Saudi Arabia still has tens of billions of dollars in new air defense equipment on order from American defense contractors. Considering that Saudi Arabia is the largest customer of American arms, backing up your product with good customer relations and on-sight support seems to be very much a factor here. So, with all this in mind, is the U.S. planning on moving back into Saudi Arabia for the long-term? It’s impossible to answer that with certainty at this time, but clearly that is far more possible once an AEW is fully established than it is now. In fact, some sort of a long-term military presence is more probable than ever now. Considering all the other bases the U.S. has already invested in heavily that surround Saudi Arabia, this act seems to be more about supporting the Saudi Royal Family directly than about ensuring regional stability or supporting ongoing missions in the CENTCOM area of operations. With that being said, rebuffing another similar drone and missile attack could help stop an all-out war between Iran and Saudi Arabia—one that is very capable of boiling over into a broader conflict.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 5, 2019",Iranian Tanker Burning Off Saudi Arabia In The Red Sea (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An Iranian tanker was traveling through the Red Sea when reports state it was rocked by two explosions. The vessel continued to burn following the explosions and some amount of oil has spilled into the sea. It isn’t clear what caused the explosions, but Iranian media claims the tanker was struck in some sort of an attack. Of course, this particular incident comes just weeks after two of Saudi Arabia’s most important oil terminals were struck in a large and highly coordinated long-range cruise missile and drone attack. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels still claim responsibility for that attack, while the Saudis and the U.S. are pointing the finger at Iran. The ship was traveling near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, also written Jiddah, when the incident occurred. Although we must stress that details remain scarce and could change dramatically as more information comes to light, at this time, there is speculation that the ship involved was the Sinopa, an Iranian-flagged cruise oil tanker. That vessel is 20 years old and has a listed gross tonnage of just under 81,500 tons. The vessel’s current location is stopped in the middle of the Red Sea, across from Daghbaj, Saudi Arabia. Oddly enough, another Iranian tanker, which that to be of the exact same age and size, the Sabiti , has also appeared very close to the Sinopa . This is quite peculiar, but above all else, it acts as a reminder that we just don’t have enough information to confidently identify the ship in question at this time. Although some sort of a reprisal attack from Saudi Arabia may come to mind, the Red Sea has been a hotbed of brazen shipping attacks in recent years . Those attacks were largely focused hundreds of miles south, near the Mandeb Strait, off the coast of Yemen, and were prosecuted by Iranian-backed Houthi rebel forces. Still, the Red Sea is a busy waterway and targeting mistakes can happen due to weapons limitations and outright confusion, especially among non-state belligerents. It’s also worth noting that rudimentary naval mines have increasingly become a major concern in the region , and even if they are released in a distinct target area, they can float vast distances and are indiscriminate in nature. Whatever the case, this could turn into quite the crisis if Iran attempts to blame Saudi Arabia or another allied actor for the damage done to its ship. Iran has plenty of reason to make an attempt at molding what has become an increasingly negative narrative regarding its actions as of late into something more sympathetic or at least more doubt-inducing. As a result, claims of any attacks on Iranian shipping, especially in a waterway dominated by the Saudis, will be considered highly suspect. This is especially the case the denials and confusion surrounded a series limpet mine attacks on tankers in the Persian Gulf last Spring. Iran ended up getting caught nearly red-handed after denying they were responsible for those attacks. Shortly after that incident, they shot down an American Global Hawk unmanned aircraft that was flying a surveillance mission near where some of those limpet mine attacks took place. On top of all this, there have been a series of tit-for-tat tanker seizures in the Middle East and Europe. Another saga that has increased tensions with Iran and resulted in the slow formation of a maritime security task force in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Navy says that they are aware of the latest incident, but have nothing to add at this time. Iranian state media, on the other hand, says it was likely a ‘terrorist attack,’ with some outlets stating missiles were the culprit. Saudi Arabia has yet to offer an official statement regarding the incident. We will update this post with new information periodically throughout the morning as this story develops. UPDATE: 2:10am PDT— Reuters reports that the ship was indeed the Sabiti. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) says that the ship exploded two times—at 5:00 AM and 5:20 AM. NIOC also states that the vessel will be exiting the Red Sea as soon as possible. If it is capable of doing so, one would imagine it would return to Iran, but if it is leaking oil, doing so would be problematic and a major environmental concern. Beyond that, there are conflicting statements for pretty much everything else—from the extent of the damage to what likely caused the explosions to the status of the vessel and the oil on board. So, we will wait for better clarity before bringing you additional details. UPDATE: 7:40am PDT— Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi has now described the incident as an “ attack .” Iran’s state-run news agency IRNA has also said that two “missiles” hit the Sabiti . “The oil tanker … sustained damages to the body when it was hit by missiles 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the Saudi port city of Jiddah,” according to IRNA . The report did not say who might be responsible for firing these weapons or where the point of launch might have been. Financial data and risk management firm Refinitiv said that the Sabiti had been carrying approximately one million barrels of crude oil at the time of the incident, according to the Associated Press . The official news outlet of Iran’s Oil Ministry, SHANA , said that the tanker had leaked an unspecified amount of oil following the attacks, but said that the crew had been able to plug the hole. The ship is now reportedly underway again, but its destination is unclear. Iran’s National Iranian Tanker Company (NTIC) has also said that there is no fire on board. The Associated Press has reported that new satellite imagery of the area does not show any visible smoke. “All the ship’s crew are safe and the ship is stable too,” a statement from NITC said. “There is no fire aboard the ship and the ship is completely stable.” SHANA also released pictures, seen below, from onboard the Sabiti as it was sailing in the Red Sea that do not appear to show any significant damage. SHANA via AP SHANA via AP SHANA via AP SHANA via AP SHANA via AP SHANA claims that there had been no responses to the Sabiti ‘s distress calls. In May, the Iranian tanker Happiness I had suffered a technical issue in the same general area and the ship received assistance from Saudi Arabian authorities, who towed it to Jeddah. The tanker underwent repairs there and left without incident. In June, the Saudi Arabian military also rescued an injured Iranian sailor from the M/V Saviz , a cargo ship that experts believe has been acting as a mothership for activities in support of the Houthis, including smuggling and potentially serving as a base to launch attacks. At that time, Saudi officials said that the country had a duty to help in this case based on its “Islamic religion and human values.” UPDATE: 8:45am PDT— The National Iranian Oil Company has also now said that the attack on Sabiti was “likely by missiles,” but has dismissed a brief earlier allegation that Saudi Arabia might have been responsible, according to the BBC . UPDATE: 9:40am PDT— Some readers have pointed out some curious digital artifacts around the date stamps in the pictures that SHANA released, which could suggest they were altered in some way. If the pictures are genuine, any damage or evidence of a fire may not be visible from the available angles, especially if it is lower on the hull.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 25, 2019",South Korea Considers Building Large Aircraft Carriers As Country Prepares To Buy More F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior South Korean lawmaker has said the country should reconsider proposals for acquiring either light or medium aircraft carriers with Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery, or CATOBAR, configurations to respond to growing regional security threats . These were alternatives to South Korea’s reported decision to purchase a number of large amphibious assault ships capable of supporting fixed-wing short takeoff and vertical landing combat jets, namely the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. This call for reassessing that choice comes as the South Korean Ministry of Defense may be leaning toward acquiring 20 more conventional F-35A models rather than B variants, further deferring plans to develop a fixed-wing naval aviation capability. Choi Jae Sung, a member of South Korea’s leading Democratic Party, who reportedly has a close relationship with President Moon Jae In, made his pitch for buying more traditional aircraft carriers in a white paper that the National Assembly’s National Defense Commission on the Navy and Air Force distributed earlier this year, according to South Korean newspaper Money Today . On Oct. 7, 2019, the country’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration told the National Assembly that the Ministry of Defense was planning to spend approximately $3.3 billion on around 20 new F-35s, but did not specify the variant, according to Defense News . Choi’s report included details on the two CATOBAR aircraft carrier concepts that the South Koreans have previously considered. One of these would be almost 978 feet long and displace approximately 71,400 tons, around the same general size as China’s Type 001A carrier , which has a Short Take-Off Barrier-Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) configuration with a ski jump rather than catapults. The other proposal was around 41,500 tons displacement and just under 788 feet long, making it just slightly smaller than France’s Charles de Gaulle , which does have a CATOBAR configuration. The larger of the two designs would have a full crew complement of 1,340, not including members of the air wing, which would consist of 32 fixed-wing combat jets and eight helicopters. The smaller carrier concept would only need half as many crew members, but would only trim back the number of fixed-wing aircraft to just 12. For comparison, Charles de Gaulle with its 1,350 crew typically sails with an air wing with another 600 personnel and at least 28 aircraft and helicopters, including E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft. A Korean language infographic regarding two CATOBAR aircraft carrier proposals from a report South Korean lawmaker Choi Jae Sung., Choi Jae Sung’s office Money Today ‘s report did not include any additional information about what other systems, including radars or self-defense suites, that South Korean officials might have been considering for these ships. It is also worth noting that at present, only two other countries in the world, the United States and France, operate CATOBAR carriers. Brazil formally retired its CATOBAR carrier, the São Paulo , in 2017, and put her up for auction last month. China is reportedly considering constructing its future Type 002 and Type 003 carriers in this configuration. The People’s Liberation Army Navy’s existing carrier Liaoning , as well as the aforementioned new Type 001A, which has not formally entered service and that experts say may be experiencing complications of some kind, both use ski jumps rather than catapults. China’s developments were a major driver in Choi’s call for larger South Korean carriers. “In view of the current military expansion rate of major Northeast Asian countries, the future battlefield in 2033 will be very different from what it is now,” Choi wrote. “You should review your plan changes.” In July 2019, reports had emerged that South Korea was moving forward with a plan to develop a 30,000-ton displacement amphibious assault ship, known as the LPH-II, with a ski jump that could potentially support more robust fixed-wing combat jet operations. Choi had complained that “tactical limitations are a concern” even with the proposed 41,500-ton displacement light carrier, adding that he felt a ship that size might not even be suitable for a CATOBAR configuration. Of course, France’s Charles de Gaulle would suggest otherwise. The U.S. Navy has been faced with similar questions regarding fixed-wing focused concepts of operation for its existing Wasp class amphibious assault ships, even though these ships displace 10,000 tons more than the proposed LPH-II. You can read more about the various factors involved in this past War Zone piece . Choi also noted that the decision not to pursue true carriers now could have impacts on how long it might take to acquire suitable aircraft, such as the carrier-specific F-35C , which is only in service with the U.S. Navy at present, should South Korea change course in the future. As noted, the country’s Ministry of Defense is looking to buy an additional 20 F-35s, but has not decided on what variant to buy, in part due to the questions about possible ship-board operations. The short takeoff and vertical landing B variant would be best suited to the LPH-II plan. They could also potentially fly from South Korea’s existing Dokdo class amphibious assault ships, if major modifications could be made, as well as support distributed operations on land, concepts of operation that you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone stories . South Korea’s first-in-class Dokdo amphibous assault ship., USN However, “the state-funded Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, or KIDA, has concluded a study on the additional acquisition of F-35 aircraft, and the study is to suggest the introduction of more F-35As be more feasible,” an unnamed Ministry of National Defense source had told Defense News . “There are two issues [with buying] the F-35B. First, it’s more expensive than the conventional-takeoff-and-landing version. Second, the deployment of a carrier-type landing ship is far away from now.” Cost was also reportedly a factor in choosing the LPH-II proposal over the CATOBAR carrier concepts, as well, according to Choi. Still, the legislator’s position may increasingly resonate with other South Korean officials, including President Moon. “Our military’s iron-clad security supports dialogue and cooperation, and enabled [the country] to boldly walk toward permanent peace,” the South Korean president had said on Oct. 1, 2019, during a ceremony to mark the country’s Armed Forces Day. The South Korean Air Force’s F-35As were also a prominent feature at that event. South Korean President Moon Jae In, standing at right in the limousine, rolls past a South Korean Air Force F-35A during the country’s Armed Forces Day celebrations on Oct. 1, 2019., Jeon Heon-kyun/Pool Photo via AP South Korea is facing the prospect of renewed belligerence from North Korea, which has been testing increasingly threatening ballistic missiles and other weapons in recent months. The regime in Pyongyang notably fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile on Oct. 2, 2019, the first such test in three years. It was also the longest-range ballistic missile test since North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un had announced a self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile and nuclear weapons testing in 2017. With U.S.-North Korean relations cooling off again after a recent thaw, South Korea may also need to reassess its regional security priorities. On Oct. 10, 2019, North Korea even renewed its threat to abandon the testing moratorium entirely if it does not feel sufficient progress is being made in negotiations with the United States. At the same time, South Korea has been increasingly faced with broader security challenges when it comes to China, as well as Russia, who are increasingly cooperating militarily in northeast Asia and the Pacific region , as a whole. Just this week, the South Korean government announced that it was in talks to establish new security hotlines with the Chinese and Russians to try to avoid dangerous altercations around disputed boundaries. Though Russia disputes the account , South Korea claimed that its fighter jets had fired warning shots at Russian combat aircraft flying around contested islets in the East Sea in July. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aN13wrqnt_0 On top of all this, the South Koreans are embroiled in a serious trade and political dispute with the Japanese, despite the two countries being treaty allies. In August, South Korea notably ended an intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan. All told, South Korea may be facing new questions about how it intends to secure its interests in its immediate neighborhood, as well as project power regionally and potentially beyond as time goes on. Whether or not the government in Seoul will decide that aircraft carriers and aircraft to go with them are essential to meeting those demands, as Choi argues, remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2019",USAF Fought ISIS With the Wrong Bombs and Tactics For Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. No matter how well prepared a military is, it’s never easy to shift direction rapidly to respond to new threats. One U.S. Air Force briefing suggests Pentagon’s rush to counter ISIS in Iraq and Syria sent the service scrambling to find the right mix of tactics and weapons, with nearly 20 percent of its bombs failing to achieve the desired effect within the first four months of the bombing campaign and potentially contributing to an ongoing shortfall of certain bombs and missiles. On Aug. 7, 2014, the United States kicks off air strikes against the brutal terrorists in Iraq, beginning attacks on its members in neighboring Syria the following month. But between August and November 2014, the Air Force saw between 11 and 19 percent of weapons either not have the intended effect or not detonate entirely, according to a briefing Air Force Major Brian Baker gave at the National Defense Industry Association’s Precision Strike Annual Review in March 2017. At the time, Baker was one of the American representatives at the multi-national Air and Space Interoperability Council , which included individuals from all of the so-called “Five Eyes” countries – the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The main reason for this was that the Air Force had initially shifted forces from Afghanistan, who had been primarily providing close air support and other counter-insurgency type missions, to the new fight in Iraq, he explained. By comparison, the situation in Iraq and Syria was “more similar to air interdiction – disguised as CAS [close air support].” In general, CAS is supposed to describe strikes on targets that are actively engaged with friendly forces on the ground. Interdiction refers to attacks on the enemy before they get to an actual battle. Baker’s description matches up with what a public affairs officer for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve told me about aerial missions against ISIS all the way back in January 2015. At that time, there was some confusion in the official categorization of the missions. USAF Iraqi or Kurdish troops and vetted Syrian rebels only needed to be “in proximity” to ISIS fighters – sometimes miles away – for the Air Force to count the strike CAS, the official acknowledged . “It is sometimes the case that sorties tasked for CAS may wind up supporting strikes that look more like interdiction, or vice versa.” Though perhaps a pedantic difference to many people, this confusion in roles had a direct impact on the kinds of weapons Air Force multi-role fighters, bombers, ground attack aircraft, and drones carried on each sortie. In his presentation, Baker identified three particular systems were major contributors to the early problems, the GBU-38(V)4/B and 5/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs and the DSU-33/B proximity sensor . An full load of GBU-38/Bs under the wing of a B-52 bomber., USAF The two JDAM types are a GPS guidance kit attached to the BLU-126/B Low Collateral Damage Bomb (LCDB) and BLU-129/B Very Low Collateral Damage Bomb (VLCDB) respectively. These 500-pound class warheads both cause damage within a relatively small blast radius compared to full-power weapons. The DSU-33/B triggers the bomb’s fuze to air burst above the targets, showering them in shrapnel. Combining the DSU-33 and either the LCDB or VLCDB creates a munition that is precise, deadly against enemy personnel who are either entirely exposed or with no cover above, and safe enough for pilots to drop in relative proximity to friendly forces. In short, it’s a great option for supporting troops on the ground in the midst of a protracted firefight who might desperately need air support. Airmen at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar assemble GBU-31/B JDAMs., USAF But once engaged against ISIS, the Air Force found itself interdicting a “drastically different target set,” Baker noted. This included large structures, bridges, armored vehicles, and other hard targets, rather than just lightly armed insurgents in the open. Peppering these targets with a burst of fragments might rattle the occupants, but couldn’t incapacitate them or destroy their cover. If the proximity fuze had a delay in detecting an object or didn’t sense anything due to a low impact angle, the weapon might not go off at all. On top of that, the bombs wouldn’t have been useful at all for knocking out tanks, bridges, or tunnels. The Air Force had begun to respond to these problems by the end of 2014, most notably starting to use 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B JDAMs. These weapons often had the BLU-109/B penetrating warhead, which could break through the roof of a concrete building before exploding within for maximum damage. The service quickly decided to save weapons like the GBU-38(V)4/B and 5/B “for expected urban fights” such as the liberation of Fallujah and Mosul, Baker added. The Air Force appears to have resolved this initial mismatch, but the experience is likely to be a teachable moment. On top of that, the lessons learned may extend to procurement practices and broader planning for future conflicts. Though Baker does not implicitly make the connection in his brief, the problems he describes, including an existing inventory primarily structured around ongoing operations in Afghanistan and limited reserve stocks, could have been contributing factors to an ongoing bomb shortage. Notably, his presentation also pointed out that the fight against ISIS had seen a dramatic increase in the service’s use of GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), a light 250-pound class GPS-guided glide bomb, as well as Hellfire missiles. These small weapons would have been again most useful against small groups of insurgents in the open, crew served weapons and other fighting emplacements, and light vehicles. The Air Force felt stockpiles of both munitions were “healthy” as of March 2014, but the campaign in Iraq and Syria put its inventory of both “on glide path to zero.” An A-10 on a mission against ISIS with a single GBU-31/B JDAM and four GBU-58/B Laser JDAMs., USAF The F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16C Viper multi-role fighters can both carry the SDB. The service’s MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones have historically been the main platforms for employing the Hellfire. In addition, Air Force Special Operations Command’s AC-130W Stinger II gunships, which have been spotted in action against ISIS, can launch both weapons. As of 2017, other types of GBU-38s, with standard high-explosive warheads, along with the GBU-31s and 1,000-pound class GBU-32/B JDAMs, continue to be the most common weapons the Air force employs in Iraq and Syria. U.S. aircraft have been routinely carrying the 500-pound GBU-12/B Paveway laser-guided bombs and GBU-58/B dual-mode Laser JDAM , as well. As of November 2016, American aviators – whether from the Air Force, Navy, or Marine Corps – had not dropped any more specialized JDAMs with BLU-118/B or BLU-121/B thermobaric or BLU-109/B deep-penetrating bunker-busting warheads, though there is some indication these have since seen use during the Mosul offensive . However, with over 51,000 bombs and missiles expended in total by that point, the Pentagon was reportedly digging into war reserves in Europe and Asia to make up for the shortfall regardless. So, it’s not particularly surprising that the U.S. military’s proposed budget for the 2018 fiscal year includes a significant increase in spending on munitions. The Pentagon’s plan includes more than $874 million for more than 34,500 JDAM guidance kits, almost $714 million for over 7,600 Hellfires, and another approximately $504 million for more than 7,300 SDBs. In all, the full budget includes more than $16 billion in funds for missiles, bombs, and other ammunition. “For munitions…, we remain challenged by the pace of current operations,” Air Force Major General James Martin Jr, the service’s Assistant Deputy Secretary for Budget, told reporters during the proposal’s rollout on May 23, 2017. “Based on current demand…, we will put an emphasis on replenishing our weapons inventory.” Small Diameter Bombs loaded onto an F-15E., USAF With this in mind, the Air Force and the rest of the U.S. military will probably have to focus on just making sure there are enough munitions to continue its existing missions before moving on to see whether future purchases realistically take into account future crises.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 17, 2019",Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie Drone Suffers Damage After Third Flight Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force says that its Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie unmanned aircraft sustained some amount of damage in a recent mishap. The drone had just completed its third flight under the Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration program, or LCASD , which the service says was otherwise successful. The accident occurred on Oct. 9, 2019, after the XQ-58A had landed at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. “High surface winds and a malfunction of the vehicle’s provisional flight test recovery system resulted in a mishap,” according to an official Air Force press release . “The prototype cushion system, which was employed for the initial test series but is not intended for ultimate operational use, suffered an anomaly resulting in the aircraft sustaining damage upon touchdown,” the manufacturer, Kratos, explained in its own statement . Though past Air Force concept art of a notional low-cost attritable aircraft showed a tricycle landing gear configuration, Kratos has been recovering the XQ-58A after test flights using a traditional parachute recovery system. This means that after the drone finishes its flight, its engine shuts off and it deploys a parachute. Airbags also deploy and cushion the unmanned aircraft when it hits the ground. This is a proven concept that has been in use on drones since the 1970s and it’s unclear how the malfunction occurred in this particular incident. “We continue to learn about this aircraft and the potential the technology can offer to the warfighter. This third flight successfully completed its objectives and expanded the envelope from the first two flights,” U.S. Air Force Major General William Cooley, head of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is running the LCASD program, said in a statement . “We have gathered a great deal of valuable data from the flight and will even learn from this mishap. Ultimately, that is the objective of any experiment and we’re pleased with the progress of the Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstration program.” Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie., USAF The test flight itself lasted approximately 90 minutes and saw the XQ-58A fly to higher altitudes and at higher speeds than ever before. The Air Force did not release details on the exact performance parameters. The Valkyrie had taken its first flight , last approximately 72 minutes, at Yuma on March 5, 2019. The second test sortie , approximately 71 minutes long, took place on June 11, 2019. Kratos first received a contract to develop the XQ-58A for the LCASD program in 2016. This demonstration effort is part of AFRL’s larger Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) project. The general goal is to develop a low-cost unmanned aircraft capable of performing intelligence, surveillance, and intelligence, strike, and electronic warfare missions either on its own, as a loyal wing working together with a manned aircraft, or in a networked autonomous swarm. Kratos has said it is aiming to eventually get the unit price down to at least $2 million, which is a price point that one might expect to see with advanced cruise missiles rather than reusable unmanned stealthy aircraft. The War Zone has been following this program closely for years and you can read more about it and the potential benefits of these developments here and here . The XQ-58A is also slated to be the first aircraft of any type to flight test the new computer brain that the Air Force is developing under the Sky Borg program, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . Kratos says it has it already has other, unnamed customers for the Valkyrie beyond the U.S. Air Force, as well. An overview of the LCAAT program as of 2017., USAF It is unclear how severe the damage to the XQ-58A is and how it might delay the LCASD test schedule. The Air Force has said that the fourth flight will be postponed until it can complete a formal safety investigation into the mishap. Kratos says “the damage has been initially evaluated and determined to be fully repairable” and also highlighted that it designed Valkyrie from the beginning to be “quickly repaired and reused if damage is sustained after performing operational missions.” The company also says it plans to fully address the issues with the cushion system in the fourth test flight for AFRL. Hopefully, the extent of the damage is minimal and the Air Force will not have to significantly delay its continued testing of this exciting unmanned aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has quietly sold off an ex-North Korean bulk freighter that it seized earlier this year in a sealed auction and the ship has left the port of Pago Pago in American Samoa under tow to an unknown destination. At least a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the M/V Wise Honest are likely to go to the families of Otto Warmbier and Kim Don Shik, who have both won judgments in U.S. courts against the North Korean government over the deaths of their loved ones. This sale also comes as U.S.-North Korean relations continue to cool, with the regime in Pyongyang renewing its threat to restart long-range missile and nuclear weapons testing if it doesn’t see the progress it wants in future negotiations. On Oct. 8, 2019, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a press release that the Wise Honest had department Pago Pago the day before, but declined to name the ship’s new owners or explain what they intended to do with the ship. The service has been in charge of guarding the freighter since it arrived in American Samoa in May. Online ship tracking website vesseltracker.com reported that the vessel was headed to an unspecified scrapyard, but did not provide a source for that information. The Department of Justice had first seized control of the ship in Jakarta, Indonesia, over sanctions violations, in April. “We are grateful to our partners in American Samoa and the Department of Justice who led this operation,” U.S. Coast Guard Captain Arex Avanni, the commander of Coast Guard Sector Honolulu, said in a statement. “We are pleased this event concluded without incident and to have supported the effort by ensuring the safety of the strategic deepwater port of Pago Pago and the security of the vessel while in U.S. custody.” The Coast Guard says two of its cutters, the USCGC Joseph Gerczak and the USCGC Walnut , conducted patrols related to Wise Honest’s detention in and around the port of Pago Pago over the past five months. Maritime Safety and Security Team Honolulu and the Marine Safety Detachment in American Samoa also supported the security operation. The USCGC Joseph Gerczak. , USCG The Wise Honest , which Shin Kurushima Dockyard in Japan constructed in 1989, had been part of North Korea’s extensive sanctions-busting smuggling activities, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The vessel was reportedly carrying 25,500 tons of North Korean coal at the time of its seizure. The vessel, which was dual-registered in North Korea and Sierra Leone at the time, had switched off its transponder before sailing into Indonesian territorial waters and appeared to be moving to offload its cargo at sea onto another ship, according to NK News . This has been a common tactic for the regime in Pyongyang to circumvent sanctions on its exports. Imagery of the M/V Wise Honest in North Korea in March 2018 and in Indonesia in April 2018., USG The United Nations is presently investigating whether South Korean energy firm Enermax Korea had been attempting to buy the illicit coal. This company is also under investigation in connection to other potential North Korean smuggling ships, including the DN5505 . South Korean authorities seized that ship in February 2019 over sanctions violations, including potential involvement in the delivery of luxury automobiles to the regime in Pyongyang. It’s unclear when the sale of the Wise Honest occurred exactly . The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the sale on July 18, 2019, according to a notice about the upcoming auction from the U.S. Marshals Service. “The Government makes no representation, warranty, statement, guaranty, promise, or commitment as to the quality or seaworthiness of the Wise Honest and notes that the vessel is not in condition to be moved except by tow,” the announcement said, which supports the reports that the purchaser intends to scrap it. The U.S. government sold the ship “as is, where is.” A file photo of the Wise Honest ., AP The U.S. government has also not revealed the total value of the sale and where the proceeds will go. In July, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the family of Otto Warmbier had a valid claim to any such money, which appears to have triggered the sale in the first place. The Warmbiers had won a civil suit against the North Korean government in December 2018 over the death of Otto, with a U.S. court awarding them $500 million in damages. North Korean authorities had arrested Otto, an American missionary, in 2016, but released him in a persistent vegetative state in 2017. He subsequently died after returning to the United States. It soon emerged that he had suffered a serious neurological injury shortly after his sentencing and had never recovered. The exact circumstances surrounding his treatment in North Korea remain murky . Otto Warmbier, at center, headed for his show trial in Pyongyang in 2016., Kyodo via AP Images However, relatives of Kim Dong Shik had also filed a similar claim in U.S. courts over the Wise Honest . A South Korean pastor and permanent U.S. resident, Kim disappeared in a Chinese town on the North Korean border in 2000 and subsequent reports indicated the regime in Pyongyang had abducted and murdered him. In 2015, his son and brother, both American citizens, won their own court case against the North Korean regime and won a $330 million judgment. It remains to be seen how North Korea may respond to the sale of the ship. The seizure was unprecedented, being the first time the U.S. government had ever detained a North Korean vessel over sanctions violations. It drew a strong rebuke from Pyongyang, which declared it to be illegal and not in keeping with the spirit of the Singapore Summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018. However, the seizure had already come after the collapse of the second summit between Kim and Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam in February 2019. Since then, U.S.-North Korean relations, which had seen something of a thaw, have steadily worsened. The most recent attempt to reboot negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program in Sweden this past weekend also ended in failure and drew more harsh comments from Pyongyang. On Oct. 10, 2019, North Korea did threaten to abandon this policy, something it has done on multiple occasions before. However, this appeared to be in response to a possible upcoming United Nations Security Council Resolution condemning the Oct. 2, 2019 launch of the new Pukkuksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and the outcome of the meeting in Sweden. A photo of the test launch of North Korea’s new Pukkuksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile on Oct. 2, 2019., KCNA This was the first launch of an SLBM of any kind since 2016 and the longest range weapon North Korea had launched since 2017, when it announced a self-imposed moratorium on tests of longer-range missiles and nuclear weapons. It also followed the public disclosure earlier in the year that the North Koreans have been converting a Soviet-era diesel-electric attack submarine into a ballistic missile sub. Whatever happens, the U.S. government has now demonstrated it is willing and able to not only use available legal options to seize North Korean ships – and potentially those belonging to other countries – over sanctions-busting, but also to sell them to help compensate parties in relation to civil court cases.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2019",China Reveals Exotic Flying Saucer-Shaped “Armed Helicopter” Concept (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images have emerged online of a what may be a mockup of an unusual-looking circular “armed helicopter” ahead of the opening of a major helicopter exposition in China. This is not the first flying saucer-esque design to have appeared over the years and the Chinese are likely to face many of the same hurdles that these earlier aircraft faced in making the concept viable, especially in any sort of actual combat environment. Still, it does seem to reflect a broader and still-growing trend in advanced and novel aircraft design within China. The rotorcraft concept, called the “Super Great White Shark,” is about to go on display at the fifth China Helicopter Exposition , which formally opens in Tianjin, China on Oct. 10, 2019. The state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) has its main industrial base of operations for helicopter development and production in Tianjin. It’s not clear which of AVIC’s helicopter-producing divisions may be responsible for the development of the Super Great White Shark. A crude translation of the placard next to the Super Great White Shark reads as follows: “[The] Super Great White Shark armed helicopter is a composite wing-body fusion high-speed helicopter configuration designed for the future digital information battlefield. In the initial stage of its design, it refers to the international excellent and mature helicopter design technologies, such as AH-64 Apache , CH-53 Sea Stallion , and Russian Ka-52 , Mi-26. While absorbing their respective advantages, it adopts the internationally popular wing-body fusion (BWB) [blended wing body] design and the former. A new type of high-speed helicopter with [a] conceptual design of propeller blades has been successfully applied in helicopter design.” It’s not at all clear what this particular design might have to do with the other helicopters listed, only two of which are “armed helicopters” as the Super Great White Shark purports to be. The assertion that this is a “blended wing body” design, a type of aircraft planform that you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , is also not reflected in what is on display. The Super Great White Shark does appear to be aiming for some form of circular wing design , but its tall, largely vertical ring calls into question how much actual lift the main body would generate in flight. It’s also not immediately apparent how the aircraft, which features a centrally-mounted cockpit that appears to offer space for at least two individuals to sit side-by-side, is supposed to work, at all. One of the available pictures does appear to show that the majority of the top of the main fuselage is open, implying that the center portion is simply a large lift fan. This would fit with the technical specifications on the placard that say it has a “main rotor” that is just over 16 feet in diameter. The Super Great White Shark concept, with what appears to be its largely open top just barely visible at left., Chinese Internet The Super Great White Shark model has two sets of air intakes and exhausts positioned laterally for what would likely be jet engines providing forward thrust. They might also supply power in some fashion to drive the main lift fan in the vertical takeoff and landing mode. Another image showing that there are in-line intakes and exhausts for laterally mounted engines., Chinese Internet As noted, this is certainly not the first circular wing aircraft design. During World War II, U.S. aircraft manufacturer Vought notably experimented with propeller-driven designs, including the V-173 Flying Pancake . The U.S. Navy even tested an experimental circular wing fighter get, the XF5U-1, more commonly known as the Flying Flapjack for its unusual shape. However, these aircraft typically featured very thin wings that were intended to generate significant amounts of lift, unlike the present design of the Super Great White Shark, and were expected to function otherwise as traditional aircraft. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the U.S. Air Force and Army began experimenting with new types of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, including circular flying platforms and rotorcraft with large central lift fans and more complex flying saucer-like designs. Among the most notable of these was the Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar , which used three centrally mounted jet engines to blow air through vents all around its circular edge to create lift by exploiting the Coandă effect . These vents could then be angled to provide forward thrust. An additional central lift fan gave the craft the ability to take off and land vertically. A cutaway diagram of the VZ-9’s internal configuration., William “Bill” Zuk via Wikimedia Flying saucer concepts have continued to be a subject of interest among aircraft designs, large and small, since then, but have, so far, yielded little in the way of practical flying machines, at least that we know of. Development of the Moller M200G Volantor , which designer Paul Moller pitched as a personal flying saucer for civilian use and that received a certain amount of media attention in the 2000s, has led to more refined models and other “flying car” projects , but no real sales. https://youtube.com/watch?v=GKuDJr-feSk Earlier this year, Romanian engineers demonstrated what they are calling an All-DIrectional Flying Object, or ADIFO , which features rear-mounted engines for forward thrust and uses blown air through side- and top-mounted vents for vertical and lateral control. So far, this is only a subscale model, though. The biggest problem that circular vertical takeoff and landing aircraft have faced in the past is generating sufficient lift to bring them to any significant altitude and then keeping them stable once they are in forward flight. Avro Canada, for instance, had claimed that the VZ-9 would be able to reach 10,000 feet and have a top speed of 225 knots. The prototypes never made it more than three feet off the ground or flew faster than 30 knots, effectively making the extremely complicated hovercraft. The M200G Volantor is also designed to prevent the operator from flying above 10 feet and reportedly cannot get above 15 feet , at most. The placard for the Super Great White Shark claims that the final design could reach altitudes of just under 19,700 feet and have a top speed of around 350 knots. These claims seem questionable, at best, given existing examples of similar craft. Using an advanced lift fan system, such an annular-ducted fan , might provide additional efficiency in different flight regimes to improve performance and stability at low speeds, such as taking off and landing, and at high speeds during level flight. Making such a configuration work reliably in a design of this size, including in hot-and-high conditions, could prove challenging, though a modern fly-by-wire flight control system could potentially help manage the aircraft’s stability. It is also possible that the Super Great White Shark could evolve into some sort of advanced, high-speed, wing-in-ground-effect style vehicle. This could offer rapid mobility over various terrain types closer to the ground that could be valuable for certain missions, such as reconnaissance or short-notice raids, possibly in support of special operations forces. Depending on its range, it could also be valuable for patrolling litoral areas, including around China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea . Whether or not the Super Great White Shark ever flies at any height, or meets the existing performance claims if it does, it certainly demonstrates that China is looking forward to a potentially new generation of helicopters or other rotorcraft. The U.S. military, among others, is also deep in a number of programs that are also looking into advanced, high-speed compound helicopter and tilt-rotor concepts to replace a wide array of existing traditional helicopters. China’s Z-10 gunship helicopter, a much more traditional design, which began entering service in 2012., 3GO*CHN-405/mjordan_6 via Wikimedia Concerns about whether or not traditional helicopters will be viable over future battlefields full of advanced air defenses and other threats have been driving these efforts, most notably the U.S. Army’s overarching Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program and its offshoots . China’s People’s Liberation Army is no doubt having similar internal discussions based on its own analysis of emerging battlefield trends. We have already seen the Chinese pour significant amounts of time and effort into the development of advanced aircraft and other weapon systems . The explosion of stealthy drone concepts from China’s state aviation industry has been particularly notable. The military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist state on Oct. 1, 2019, highlighted progress toward a true unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) and supersonic unmanned aerial reconnaissance capabilities, along with other major developments , such as hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and more . When the China Helicopter Exposition formally opens tomorrow, we may learn more about the Super Great White Shark, how it is supposed to function, and what China claims it can do. In the end, it may turn out to just the first of a number of advanced rotorcraft concepts that begin to emerge as the Chinese look toward the future of their own vertical lift capabilities. Updated 10/10/19: A cutaway diagram of the Super Great White Shark has emerged that confirms much of The War Zone’s initial analysis of the general configuration. Other reports indicate that it has two sets of main fan blades, each with its own power source inside the fuselage. Questions remain about how the aircraft might attempt to overcome the hurdles that similar designs have faced on the past, including the drag that would arise from the large open lift fan. Chinese Internet In addition, the artwork shows a three-point landing gear system not see on the example on display in Tianjin. The concept art also indicates that the Super Great White Shark’s armament might include a 20mm automatic cannon, as well as air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and air-to-air missiles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",Top Senator And Trump Ally Pushes For Arms Embargo On Turkey After Syria Invasion Begins,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Senator Lidnsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and major political ally of President Donald Trump, has called for an arms embargo and host of other sanctions against Turkey is newly proposed piece of legislation. The draft bill came just hours after Turkish forces, and local partners, launched a new operation into northeastern Syria primarily targeting the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish Syrian Defense Forces, or SDF. On Sunday, Trump had given tacit approval to this military intervention, which risks creating all-new conflicts in the region and leading to a humanitarian disaster, as noted in The War Zone previous in-depth analysis of the situation. Graham, together with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, drafted what they called the Graham-Van Hollen Turkey Sanctions Bill late on Oct. 9, 2019. Earlier in the day, Turkish combat jets and artillery began attacking various targets in northeastern Syria linked to the SDF as part of what officials in Ankara are calling Operation Peace Spring . Ground forces, including elements of the Turkish Free Syrian Army, or TFSA, subsequently began moving in to seize control of various objectives. The Turkish government’s ostensible goal is to set up an approximately 20-mile-deep and 75-mile-wide buffer zone on the opposite side of its southern border with Syria. Turkey views the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, also known by the acronym YPG, an organization that provides the bulk of the SDF’s manpower, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Both the United States and Turkey have designated the PKK as a terrorist group, but the U.S. government is of the view that the YPG is a distinct entity. The exact relationship between the two groups is murky and the issue is complex, as the War Zone has explored in detail in the past. The SDF has been instrumental in rolling back ISIS in northeastern Syria, but has now halted those operations , as have their U.S. and other foreign partners. This could give the terrorist group an opportunity to regroup and there are already indications that sleeper cells in major Syrian cities, such as Raqqa , are now receiving orders to begin launching attacks on the U.S.-backed forces. The fate of thousands of ISIS fighters in SDF custody, as well as their families in various refugee camps, is now uncertain and the U.S. military has reportedly taken custody of a number of particularly high profile detainees. There are also concerns that the Turkish intervention will result in the ethnic cleansing of Kurds and other ethnic and religious minorities from the border area and spark a humanitarian crisis. Officials in Turkey have said that a “ demographic correction ” is part of their objectives and say they plan to eventually relocate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees from Turkish territory into this “safe zone.” The crisis could also provide an opening for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies to make important territorial gains in the eastern portion of the country. Senator Graham, who has been a staunch and vocal supporter of Trump’s in recent years, and continues to be one despite a serious and still-growing domestic political scandal, has said that “a disaster is in the making” with the start of the new Turkish operation in Syria and has urged the President to take a harder line opposing the intervention. Trump, for his part, has issued a statement saying he thinks Turkey’s actions are a “ bad idea ” and has made vague threats to retaliate against the government in Ankara, including to “destroy and obliterate the [Turkish] Economy,” if they proceed in a way that he does not feel is appropriate. Still, he has made clear that he does not intend to more forcefully intervene diplomatically or militarily to block the progress of Turkish or Turkish-backed forces, in general. The clear objective of the Graham-Van Hollen Turkey Sanctions Bill is to force Trump’s hand or otherwise stymie the Turkish military. Among the most significant of its proposed provisions, which you can read in full below, is a near-total U.S. arms embargo on Turkey. US Senate US Senate If it were to become law, the bill “prohibits the sale of U.S. defense articles, services, technology, materials to the Turkish Armed Forces” and “ammunition sales and transfers to the Turkish Armed Forces.” It also levies sanctions on any foreign individuals who sell aircraft, vehicles, and other “weapons or defense articles” to the Turkish military, which, given this blanket language, would include Turkey’s own domestic defense industry. This would end deals many of those companies have with U.S. defense contractors. These restrictions would “go into effect upon enactment of this Act unless the Administration certifies to Congress – every 90 days – that Turkey is not operating unilaterally (without U.S. support east of the Euphrates and west of the Iraqi border) in Syria and has withdrawn its armed forces, including Turkish supported rebels, from areas it occupied during the operation beginning on October 09, 2019,” the proposed legislation says. This could have severe impacts on the Turkish military’s ability to operate. A number of its key systems, including its F-16 Viper fighter jets and UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters , rely heavily on cooperation with American or other foreign vendors for spare parts and other support. Turkish Air Force F-16 Vipers., Turkish Armed Forces Underscoring how significant the embargo might be, in July 2019, there were reports that the Turkish government was hoarding F-16 related spares, among other items, in case the U.S. government imposed heavy sanctions over its purchase of Russia’s S-400 surface-to-air missile system. The S-400 deal, which has now led to Turkey’s ejection from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, is a saga unto itself that you can read about more in these past War Zone stories . This would not be the first time the United States has imposed such an embargo on Turkey, either. The U.S. government halted arms sales to the country in 1975 in response to the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus . The year before, Turkey had launched the operation with the ostensible goal of offering protection to ethnic Turks on the island following a coup by Greek Cypriots. The embargo remained in place until 1978 and had a major impact on the Turkish military’s capabilities. New restrictions on arms sales have the potential to be more significant. The Turkish Air Force, for instance, is one of the largest F-16 Viper operators in the world with around 245 F-16C/Ds in total that a mix of Block 30, 40, and 50 variants. These aircraft have already been active participants in Operation Peace Spring, but could find themselves quickly grounded without a steady supply of spare parts and other support. Cannibalizing some F-16s to keep other Vipers flying, or locally devised workarounds, as Venezuela has done with its F-16s, could help keep some of the jets in the air, but with increasingly diminished capabilities. The same would go for any other aircraft or vehicles that need spare parts from American vendors, or foreign suppliers who are not interested in getting sanctioned themselves. The proposed bill also begins the process of putting additional economic sanctions into effect under the existing Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA, over the S-400 sale. This would require the Trump Administration to select five options from a dozen predetermined options, which severe penalties, such as cutting Turkish banks and business off from U.S. financial markets and preventing the Turkish government from securing U.S. loans. The draft legislation calls for sanctions against Turkey’s energy sectors, including oil- and natural gas-related enterprises, as well as a number of senior Turkish government officials, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan himself. The bill would create exemptions for humanitarian aid, medical assistance, programs to promote democracy and assist with elections in Turkey, and, interestingly, intelligence sharing with the Turkish government. There is also notably no mention of pulling U.S. troops out of Turkey or discontinuing the use of bases in the country. As U.S.-Turkish relations have already soured in recent years there have been increasing calls, in particular, to remove a stockpile of B61 nuclear gravity bombs from the U.S.-operated portion of Incirlik Air Base . B61 nuclear gravity bombs., DOD Of course, there is no guarantee that legislators will pass this sanctions package, or, if they do, that Trump, who has a close relationship with Erdogan, will sign it into law. That being said, Kurdish issues do generally enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress at present and Graham has publicly stated he believes he could secure a veto-proof majority vote. If the sanctions do come into force, it’s unclear when the Turkish government might begin to actually feel the impacts. It may also further push Erdogan toward other partners, notably Russia, who could supply the Turkish military with new military hardware in spite of any threat of U.S. sanctions. The Russians have already proposed a number of cooperative deals, with regards to both advanced combat aircraft and air defense systems , in light of the S-400 spat. How the Trump Administration and the Turkish government do or do not respond to this threat in the immediate future remains to be seen, but it is certainly a significant statement of disapproval for the Turkish intervention and Trump’s handling of the situation from one of the U.S. President’s most prominent political allies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 11, 2021",Tests For DARPA’s Gremlins Drones Are All Laid Out But May Be Headed To New Venue,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Defense contractor Dynetics has offered new details about its flight test plans for the first prototypes of its X-61A Gremlins reusable, air-launched and recovered drones. Unfortunately, the program , which aims to eventually demonstrate the ability of these unmanned aircraft to operate as a low-cost drone swarm, is facing delays after earthquakes left the U.S. Navy’s sprawling China Lake test base in California severely damaged earlier this year. Multiple testing phases may now have to move to the U.S. Army’s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. Tim Keeter, Dynetic’s Gremlins program manager, explained the situation in a recent interview with Air Force Magazine . The Alabama-headquartered firm had first revealed to FlightGlobal that it had delayed the first phase of the X-61A’s flight tests in September 2019 due to the devastation at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. The War Zone was first to report that the Navy might need as much as $5 billion to make the base, which houses some of the Navy’s premier research and development facilities for aircraft and weapons, “mission capable” again following a series of earthquakes in July. “It’s limited range access. They’ve got a lot of damage that’s been done,” Keeter told Air Force Magazine . “They’ve got a lot of things to take care of in terms of infrastructure before they can support a flight test … like this.” In September, FlightGlobal had reported that the loss of a piece of ground control equipment called the flight termination system, which is employed when there is a need immediately abort a flight test for safety or other reasons, was a particularly critical issue. The earthquakes left approximately 20 percent of China Lakes structures either dangerous to occupy at all or with severe restrictions on their use. A more detailed look at the extent of the damage can be found in this past War Zone story . A map showing the approximate epicenters of various earthquakes and aftershocks that rocked China Lake between July 4 and 5, 2019, as well as the locations of various key facilities., USN Fast-growing drone maker Kratos is actually building the Gremlins drones , which the Air Force designated as X-61As in August 2019, and has completed five so far for Dynetics. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been running the Gremlins program since 2015 and selected the Dynetics-led team to proceed to the final demonstration phase of the program in 2018. Dynetics’ concept involves air launching the Gremlins from a carrier aircraft and then recovering them in midair. The drones each have a docking device, which folds flush with the fuselage when not in use, that then locks into a shuttle towed behind the recovering aircraft. That plane then reels in the unmanned aircraft. DARPA envisions the Gremlins acting as a semi-autonomous or autonomous swarm and conducting various missions, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance or launching electronic attacks on hostile air defenses. Dynetics has noted in the past that swarms of X-61As could also perform a multitude of other missions, including kinetic strikes. You can read more about the program and its objectives in this past War Zone piece . You can also see how all of this is all supposed to work, in principle, in the video below. Dynetics has conducted some general testing of the recovery system already, but has yet to conduct an actual first flight with one of the X-61As. It had planned to do so last month at China Lake using a specially configured C-130 Hercules transport aircraft from International Air Response . This is one of the tests that may now occur at Dugway to try to avoid significant additional delays. Under the current plan, International Air Response’s C-130 will launch the Gremlin from a pylon under the wing and personnel onboard will control it. Dynetics says its current control system can direct up to eight X-61As simultaneously. After the flight, “we’ll deploy our parachute and our airbags to have a … gentle ground recovery, hopefully,” Dynetics’ Keeter told Air Force Magazine . This is a very well established method for recovering unmanned aircraft that has been in use since the 1970s . A second phase of flight testing would involve a Learjet from Calspan , another contractor, acting as a surrogate for the X-61A and attempting to link up with the docking mechanism trailing behind the C-130. This will allow Dynetics to evaluate the Gremlins avionics and flight software. Calspan has used its Learjets in the past to demonstrate the technology necessary for an unmanned aircraft to conduct a mid-air refueling with a manned tanker using a boom system. A Calspan Learjet maneuvers behind a U.S. Air Force KC-135 tanker during a test., USAF “That will allow us to further check our recovery system, docking system avionics, and our safety features associated with that, because that’s a high-risk part of the operation, is getting close to that manned aircraft,” Keeter said. “We want to do that in February [2020].” By that point, Dynetics hopes that China Lake may be able to accommodate this particular round of tests. Keeter told Air Force Magazine that this phase may need less extensive infrastructure as it involves two manned aircraft. The last phase of the flight test demonstration program, which Dynetics hopes will take place no later than next summer, may still be too much for the Navy facilities to handle, unfortunately. Under the contract with DARPA, the company will have to demonstrate its system recovering four X-61As within 30 minutes. Dugway may ultimately host these tests, as well. There are still questions about how quickly Dynetics would be able to relocate any necessary test assets and associated equipment to this Army facility. There could be additional scheduling complications, as well, at the proving ground or with the other contractors involved. All of these factors could still potentially lead to additional delays, but Dynetics remains upbeat and is already looking ahead to a potential demonstration of an actual mock Gremlins mission of some kind. The company is exploring the possibility of full autonomy for the X-61As and into adapting the launch and recovery mechanisms to work with various types of mounting options on other aircraft, including on a rotary launcher in a B-52’s bomb bay , according to Air Force Magazine . An unspecified U.S. military customer had previously inquired about whether it might be possible to recover the drones and then refuel and re-launch them all in flight, according to FlightGlobal . DARPA has long indicated that its main goal with Gremlins was to demonstrate a proof of concept that other elements within the U.S. military could then expand upon to meet their specific operational needs. It will certainly be exciting to see the progress Dynetics has already made in its development of the Gremlins drones in the coming months. Hopefully, whether the testing takes place at China Lake or at Dugway, there won’t be any significant additional delays.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2018",House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Raises Alarm That Trump May Axe The Open Skies Treaty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee has sent a letter to National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien saying he has seen reports that President Trump’s Administration may be preparing to leave the Open Skies Treaty . This international agreement allows signatories to fly largely unrestricted aerial surveillance missions over each other’s territory using approved aircraft and sensors and with monitors from the host country on board. The deal has drawn criticism from certain members of Congress and other U.S. government officials over the years who argue that Russia has been abusing its terms. Proponents have, in turn, highlighted the immense benefits it offers in terms of transparency and accountability , especially for smaller member states. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, a Democrat Party Representative from New York, sent the missive to O’Brien on Oct. 7, 2019. In it, he vociferously defends the Treaty , which dates, in principle, back to 1955 and President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Soviets, however, rejected the proposal and it wasn’t until 1989 that President George H.W. Bush signed the agreement. However, it wasn’t until 2002 that the deal actually entered force. Today, there are 34 countries party to the treaty. The Open Skies Consultative Commission, under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), manages its implementation, including the setting of annual quotas outlining how many times member countries are allowed to overfly each other. “I am deeply concerned by reports that the Trump Administration is considering withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty and strongly urge you against such a reckless action,” Engel writes. “Withdrawal risks dividing the transatlantic alliance and would further undermine America’s reliability as a stable and predictable partner when it comes to European security.” You can read the full letter below: House Foreign Affairs Committee House Foreign Affairs Committee Engel does not elaborate on what reports he is referring to or where he heard them. A cursory search of available news reporting on Open Skies does not yield any recent news reports that the treaty is in any kind of imminent jeopardy. The State Department did say that it couldn’t comment on “deliberative matters” when The War Zone asked if there were any plans to leave the agreement or if the OSCE had been notified of the U.S. government’s intention to do so. The language in Engel’s letter would seem to suggest that he is also attempting to ascertain whether or not these reports are accurate and, if so, how close the Trump Administration is to actually pulling out of the deal. “If the Administration is indeed considering a change of status on the Treaty, it must be part of a transparent process that includes a thorough interagency review and consultation with Congress, and that provides other signatories a clear understanding of your intentions. To my knowledge, the Administration has not held significant consultations with our allies and partners on this matter,” the New York congressman continues. “Such consultations are a prerequisite to successfully navigate any major policy shift with the Treaty.” The ostensible objective of the Open Skies treaty is to enable signatories to monitor each other’s military activities. The core idea is that if member states can monitor and verify what foreign militaries are doing, it is less likely that they will mistake certain maneuvers for preparations for some sort of hostile action. This then prevents that sort of confusion from escalating into an actual war. Member states, as well as the OSCE itself , have also employed the treaty’s various provisions to monitor compliance with ceasefires and peace deals. “Observation flights under the Treaty have generated additional information regarding Russian military action in Ukraine and provided a check on further Russian aggression there,” Engel notes in his letter. “NATO allies and partners, and Ukraine in particular, have repeatedly stressed the importance of the Open Skies Treaty for their efforts to monitor Russia’s military.” An Antonov An-30 that Ukraine uses for Open Skies missions., Bomberpilot via Wikimedia However, other members of Congress , as well as U.S. military leaders , have, over the years, criticized Russia’s activities, in particular. This has included complaints about the Russian government’s flight restrictions over its Kaliningrad enclave , which sits on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania, geographically separated from the rest of the country. The U.S. government imposed its own restrictions on the Kremlin’s flights, notably over certain parts of Hawaii and Alaska, in response. There have also been accusations that Russia has been conducting unscheduled overflights over the United States with its Open Skies aircraft, but no evidence has emerged to support these assertions. There have been claims that Russia has been looking to upgrade its Open Skies aircraft with improved cameras and other sensors that would allow them to gather imagery with potentially great granular intelligence value, something not in keeping with the spirit of the agreement, as well. The Trump Administration did briefly attempt to block certification of Russia’s new Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft, but relented in the end and the first one of these planes conducted a mission in the United States in April 2019 . Despite initial reports that the Tu-214ONs might carry all-new sensors, including a synthetic aperture imaging radar, these planes have now entered service with the same upgraded digital camera package found on the Kremlin’s older Tu-154M-LK-1 plane . “Make no mistake, Congress is aware of some treaty implementation concerns regarding Russia. Russia continues to operate in unexpected ways. Therefore, I support the Administration’s efforts to ensure full applicability of the Treaty to Kaliningrad and to the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and I support the restrictions put in place on Russian flights over the United States in response,” Engel explains, not even mentioning the aircraft certification issue. “But it is clear that these implementation concerns do not rise to the level of material breach of the Treaty, an excuse that is being peddled as the potential reason for withdrawal.” It is worth noting that the dispute over flights over Abkhazia and South Ossetia is a multi-layered issue stemming from Russia’s recognition of these breakaway parts of Georgia as independent countries . The Open Skies Treaty prevents flights within six miles of a non-member state. The Kremlin, therefore, says that member states cannot fly along this border to monitor Russian activity. However, the vast majority of the world, including all of the other Open Skies member states, as well as most international organizations, including the OSCE, do not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent nations. This has created an impasse wherein the Kremlin has been blocking flights in exactly the sort of place the treaty was designed to monitor based on a policy no other party to the deal recognizes. This became such an issue that Georgia refused to sign off on the annual flight quotas for 2018, which effectively brought the entire treaty to halt that year. The only Open Skies flight anywhere that year was a single extraordinary one that the United States flew over Ukraine under the auspices of the OSCE, which can be done under certain circumstances outside annual quotas. The future of U.S. participation in the treaty had also appeared on the verge of collapse last year. “The Open Skies Treaty is out of date and favors Russia, and the best way forward is to leave it,” Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and a particular critic of the treaty, said in a statement in September 2018 . The month before, Congress had passed the annual defense policy bill, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act, for the then-upcoming 2019 Fiscal Year, which blocked funds for upgrading the U.S. Air Force’s Open Skies capabilities, including modernizing or replacing its aging OC-135B Open Skies planes, and the U.S. government’s ability to take part in the Open Skies Consultative Commission unless President Trump took certain actions, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Despite not knowing the source of Engel’s concern that the Open Skies Treaty may again be on shaky ground, it is certainly possible that the critics of the deal may be looking to pursue Trump to pull out of the deal before any future NDAA might block him from doing so. The House’s version of this bill for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which technically began on Oct. 1, explicitly seeks to ensure American participation in the agreement indefinitely. Proponents of the deal point out that it gives smaller countries immense leverage over larger, hostile neighbors. Ukraine’s use of the treaty to monitor Russian activities along their shared border is a prime example, as Engel noted in his letter to O’Brien. The United States pulling out of the agreement could lead to Russia further flaunting its terms, or its complete collapse, which would leave American allies and partners without this valuable tool. In addition, if Russia is actually trying to get any true intelligence value out of these flights, it is a more notable reflection on how limited the Kremlin’s other collection options, especially from space with spy satellites, actually are, in general. The limitations on the quality of imagery that countries can gather under Open Skies means that it is in no way comparable to even older American space-based capabilities . If nothing else, continuing to be party to the treaty, any faults aside, is taking a stance in support of long-established international norms. It also denies the Kremlin another opportunity to erode key international arms control agreements, but escape any real repercussions for doing so. For the time being, at least, the treaty is functioning as intended. The Georgians did not oppose the 2019 flight quotas and Open Skies missions have returned to normal levels this year . When it comes to continued U.S. participation in the agreement, it remains to be seen if Engel’s letter is an indication that the Trump Administration is actually planning to withdraw from the deal in the near future or if the New York Congressman is seeking to head off that outcome before gains any real traction.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 16, 2019",U.S. Army To Execute Its Most Massive European Deployment Exercise In 25 Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Next year, the U.S. Army is planning to lead the largest deployment of U.S.-based personnel to Europe for an exercise in two and a half decades. This is the latest example of how the U.S. military as a whole is re-examining its ability to prosecute high-end conflicts, including ensuring it still has the capabilities to deploy significant amounts of personnel and their equipment to battlefields overseas during a crisis. Above all else, it is a signal to Russia that the U.S. can deliver large amounts of military capability onto Russia’s front doorstep in a timely manner should it be required. The Army announced Defender-Europe 20, which is scheduled to occur sometime in the Spring of 2020, on Oct. 7, 2019. The exercise will involve the rapid deployment of approximately 20,000 Army personnel and their equipment to Europe from the United States. Another 17,000 troops, including forward-deployed U.S. units and forces from NATO members and other American partners in Europe, will take part, as well. Just getting all the soldiers and their gear there is a huge undertaking, but once they are in theater, we can expect widespread drills across Europe for some time after. It’s not clear exactly who and what will be sent on the deployment, or all the assets that will be used to rush all of it across the Atlantic. Recently, the Pentagon has been stepping up its logistics drills after troubling reports emerged that some of the Pentagon’s reserve logistical support capabilities may not be up to the task of sustaining a high-end conflict. Defender-Europe will likely be a stress test of sorts for the whole system, as well as how well the assets operate and interoperate with allied forces once they are safely in Europe. Even just being able to move so much equipment and personnel around Europe’s bridges, streets, railways, and canals will be part of the stress test. American armor rolls through Poland during a major forward-deployment exercise. , US Army In a press release, Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn, the US Army Deputy Chief of Staff, stated the following about the massive endeavor: “Defender-Europe 20 is a great opportunity to demonstrate the US Army’s un-matched ability to rapidly project forces across the globe while operating alongside our allies and partners in multiple contested domains.” Still, this exercise is relatively small compared to many of the annual Reforger exercises during the Cold War, which, at its peak in 1988, included some 125,000 troops. Another iteration of Reforger is also likely the one this is being compared to that occurred 25 years ago. America has stepped up its presence markedly in Europe following the invasion of Crimea in 2014, but local commanders continue to warn that more is needed to deter potential Russian aggression. This will satisfy some of those requests for a time, but above all else, it will work as a glaring warning to Moscow.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 10, 2019","U.S. Blindsides Syrian Kurds With Approval For Turkish Invasion, Opens Door To Larger Conflict (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late yesterday, the White House announced a snap decision to abandon a fledgling security protocol that sought to balance Turkish interests with those of U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces in the region, effectively allowing Turkey to launch its own military operation to create what Ankara describes as a buffer zone on the opposite side of its southern border. The Pentagon has since sought to downplay the situation, stating that the U.S. military does not support a Turkish intervention, but the U.S. military has not suggested it will do anything to directly impede Turkey from taking action, as it has done in the past . The concern remains that America’s Kurdish partners, fearing ethnic cleansing, may find themselves pulled away from their fight against ISIS, as well as the task of guarding thousands of prisoners and their families, giving the terrorist group an opportunity to regroup . Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies are sure to try to exploit these new developments, as well. This also comes as mass protests and a violent government crackdown continue to rock neighboring Iraq, which further underscores the potential for an immensely dangerous power vacuum in the region. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a brief statement announcing the massive shift in U.S. policy toward Syria late on Oct. 6, 2019, following a call between President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump subsequently confirmed the plan to withdraw and acquiesce to a long-threatened Turkish intervention in a series of Tweets on Oct. 7, 2019. The President had already stated his intention to eventually pull out all U.S. forces from Syria in December 2018. At the core of the issue is Turkey’s long-standing contention that the American-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the bulk of which are ethnic Kurds who also belong to Syrian Kurdish groups known commonly as the People’s Protection Units , or by the Kurdish acronym YPG, are functionally indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party , or PKK. Both the United States and Turkey have designated the PKK, which has operated in Turkey, northern Syria, and northern Iraq, as a terrorist group. However, the U.S. government insists that they are two distinct entities and that the SDF is itself separate from the YPG. The actual extent of the direct coordination and cooperation between the YPG and PKK is unclear, but it seems indisputable that the two groups are, at least, in regular contact. A map of Syria showing a number of important locations in the context of the current geopolitical situation in the country. The SDF, as well as other U.S-backed “Vetted Syrian Opposition” (VSO) groups, effectively controls the entirety of the country east of the Euphrates River. SDF control also extends in the north to the edge of the city of Manbij., DOD Erdogan has repeatedly called on the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, of which it is technically a part, to abandon the SDF and instead back the predominantly Arab and Turkmen Turkish Free Syrian Army, or TFSA. The Turkish leader has also regularly threatened to launch an invasion of northeastern Syria to root out “terrorists,” even if that might mean fighting American forces in the process. In January 2018, Turkish forces and the TFSA launched a similar operation in northwestern Syria that ostensibly targeted non-SDF-aligned YPG fighters in and around the city of Afrin. In August 2019, the U.S. and Turkey had agreed to a shared security framework that saw the SDF demolish fixed fortifications in a portion of the border and then withdraw from those positions entirely. Combined U.S.-Turkish military patrols on the ground and in the air would then began to monitor activities in this zone. This follows a similar deal for the SDF to pull out from the hotly contested city of Manbij, which is a highly strategic point in the center of northern Syria, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . Trump has now said that he has cast aside this plan in favor of the completion of the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria that he announced nearly a year ago and allowing Turkey to proceed with establishing an approximately 75-mile long and 20-mile deep buffer zone in northeastern Syria. Erdogan had recently promoted this plan during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September. The full White House statement is as follows: Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey by telephone. Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial “Caliphate,” will no longer be in the immediate area. The United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused. The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial “Caliphate” by the United States. The SDF says it presently holds 12,000 of the terrorists, including foreign fighters from countries in Europe and elsewhere, in a number of prison facilities.  The SDF also manages camps that house approximately 70,000 family members, some of whom may actually have been active participants in the terrorist group’s activities. How to manage and potentially repatriate these individuals to their countries of origin has been a contentious and complicated debate for more than a year now. It’s certainly true that the SDF received not-insignificant U.S. assistance , as well as aid from other coalition partners , together with on-the-ground support from special operations and conventional forces , who notably provided essential air and artillery strikes and vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, during the campaign against ISIS. At the same time, the SDF was absolutely instrumental in rolling back the terrorists and bringing an end to their self-declared caliphate. Some 11,000 U.S.-backed fighters have died in these operations since 2011, according to the SDF. Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman subsequently issued a statement on behalf of the Pentagon, which warned of “possible destabilizing consequences” from any unilateral Turkish operation, but did not openly contradict Trump’s earlier statements. The full press release is as follows: “The Department of Defense made clear to Turkey – as did the President – that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria. The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation. “In conversations between the Department and the Turkish military we have consistently stressed that coordination and cooperation were the best path toward security in the area. Secretary Esper and Chairman Milley reiterated to their respective Turkish counterparts that unilateral action creates risks for Turkey.  As the President has stated, Turkey would be responsible, along with European nations and others, for thousands of ISIS fighters who had been captured and defeated in the campaign lead by the United States. We will work with our other NATO allies and Coalition partners to reiterate to Turkey the possible destabilizing consequences of potential actions to Turkey, the region, and beyond.” Regardless, Trump’s decision clearly came as a shock to the SDF, especially given the assurances they were publicly given for agreeing to the U.S.-Turkish security mechanism. It appears to have been equally surprising to U.S. military commanders, who had been insisting that its local partners enjoyed their full support and warning against a unilateral Turkish intervention just days ago . “There were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region,” SDF spokesperson Kino Gabriel said in an interview with Al Hadath television on Oct. 7, 2019. “The (U.S.) statement today was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF.” There are also reports that the SDF feels as if it was set up from the start by the requirement in the U.S.-Turkish security framework that it physically destroy various fortifications. This has left its fighters more vulnerable and unable to rapidly reoccupy positions in order to try to check any Turkish or TFSA advances. “We are not expecting the US to protect NE [northeast] Syria,” Mustafa Bali, another SDF spokesperson, wrote on Twitter. “But people here are owed an explanation regarding security mechanism deal, destruction of fortifications and failure of US to fulfill their commitments.” It’s unclear what Trump’s decision may mean in the immediate future. It has been difficult to assess the state of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which American officials have also insisted has remained the overarching plan since the President announced it last year, since the Pentagon has declined to give any information on how many American troops are in the country or their general distribution, to begin with. Pictures and video footage have already begun to emerge of what appears to be U.S. forces hastily departing outposts in northeastern Syria. Again, however, it is unclear whether or not the U.S. military had planned any of these particular movements in advance as part of the U.S.-Turkish security cooperation framework. On Sept. 5, 2019, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) had notably issued an amendment to a contracting notice regarding fuel shipments to support American operations at various sites in Iraq and Syria. DLA deleted, without explanation, requirements for deliveries of multiple types of fuel to a location known as T2 near Hasakah, the H3 firebase near Ash Shaddadi, and an airstrip known as H4, or the Northern Landing Zone (NLZ), all in northeastern Syria. The NLZ, situated outside of Hasakah, is one of two large airbases that American forces have been maintaining in Syria since at least 2016, the other being the Kobani Landing Zone (KLZ) near the city of the same name. The change in the proposed contract also eliminated a line regarding deliveries to Ar-Rutbah in Western Iraq. Curtailing the regular delivery of fuel to these locations suggests that the U.S. military was already moving ahead with shutting down various operating locations in Syria in line with President Trump’s order to withdraw last year and in light of its security agreement with Turkey in August. Still, at the time of writing, the prospective deal did include fuel shipments to four other major U.S. military operating locations in Syria, including the KLZ. There is also no word on how the U.S. decision may impact the activities of other coalition partners, including the United Kingdom and France, who had recently agreed to deploy additional personnel to Syria to backfill the withdrawal of American forces. It’s also unclear how quickly Turkey might be able to mobilize its own troops, or significant elements of the TFSA, for a major operation. There have been reports of Turkish forces massing near the border in recent months, though. The concern is what will happen to the campaign against ISIS, and to the ISIS prisoners and their families, if the United States effectively cuts off support for the SDF and steps aside as Turkish and Turkish-backed forces flood into the border area. The YPG components of the SDF, as well as other ethnic and religious minority groups, such as Armenians and Arab Christians, may feel that defending their hard-won gains against Turkey is a more pressing concern, giving various terrorist groups , who are very much not defeated, much-needed breathing room to regroup. A map showing ISIS’ approximate zones of influence as of April 2019., DOD A map showing the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps that the SDF oversees, some of which contain ISIS family members., DOD Reports that Turkish forces and their TFSA partners have been waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the northwestern Syrian region of Afrin, where Turkey ejected the YPG in 2018, can only reinforce these fears. Turkey’s reported interest in resettling Arab Syrian refugees in the buffer zone only compounds these issues. Further internal displacement of civilians in any direction risks create new and potentially serious humanitarian crises in areas that are still in a state of civil strife and have had, at best, limited opportunities to reestablish even basic infrastructure. “In FY [Fiscal Year] 2020, the primary focus will be continued equipping of the Internal Security Forces (InSF) that are responsive to civilian authorities and protect the rights of religious minorities.  These forces, together with wide-area security and other VSO [Vetted Syrian Opposition] elements, will focus on back-clearing and holding areas that were liberated from ISIS,” the Pentagon said in its most recent budget request for funds to continue supporting local forces in Syria, using the term VSO, which applies to the SDF, as well as numerous smaller American-backed, predominantly Arab groups. “Setting the conditions to prevent an ISIS resurgence and deny safe haven post-U.S. withdrawal from Syria will be heavily reliant on ongoing U.S. support of the VSO.” The other near-term issue is that any shift in the SDF’s attention may allow Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, together with his primary allies Russia and Iran, to reassert control over the eastern portion of his country. This would be a major victory for Assad and his benefators, especially Iran, which could use the situation to establish a more secure overland route to send military aid and other support straight from its own territory to its proxies further west, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the occupied Palestinian territories. The YPG has already reached out to Assad and his allies in the past and the withdrawal of SDF forces from Manbij proper almost led to Syrian forces retaking the strategic city . There is a distinct possibility this might happen under Turkey’s plan, as well, given that Turkish officials have been working closely with their Russian and Iranian counterparts to negotiate some sort of final settlement to the conflict that meets their various interests. Given the disparate geopolitical agendas of all of the parties involved, it may be difficult to find any sort of agreement that any plurality of actors can agree to in the end. Given how fluid and confusing the situation is in Syria, to begin with, it is easy to see how various sides and their local partners could come to blows, even inadvertently. This, in turn, creates broader risks of new conflicts erupting inside Syria and potentially spilling over into neighboring countries. Iraq, which continued to be wracked by mass protests and a subsequent violent government crackdown , is also particularly vulnerable at present to a resurgent ISIS. Iraqi security forces, as well as predominantly Iranian-backed militia groups , have reportedly killed hundreds of protesters and injured thousands more already. The demonstrations, which appear largely youth-based and leaderless, and have very broadly stated goals, such as ending corruption and political patronage, look unlikely to end any time soon. However, it’s also unclear what impact they may have in unseating Iraq’s most entrenched political figures, who are the primary targets of the protester’s outrage. Iraqi authorities have sought to blame nebulous “ malicious hands ” for stoking the violence on both sides, but has offered no evidence to support these claims or explanation about who these actors might be and what their purported agenda might be. A smaller explosion of protests last year, which also led Iraqi security forces and militias to conduct a violent crackdown, eventually subsided without any significant change in the status quo. Where Iraq’s top leadership makes any concessions now remains to be unseen, but, if they don’t, it could lead to cycles of protests and accompanying violence that terrorist groups, such as ISIS, could exploit. Disaffected young Iraqis who see limited opportunities to improve their livelihoods in the near term would be a worrying source of potential new recruits. Beyond all this, there’s simply the damage to the credibility of the U.S. government, which has not only stated its intent to abandoning key allies who have been critical in the advancement of American interests in Syria, but is also doing so immediately after publicly offering guarantees that this would not happen. The Kurds have certainly suffered numerous betrayals in the past, including by the United States , but, since the 1990s, they have enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in the halls of the U.S. government, making this all the more glaring. So, Trump’s political critics in Congress and elsewhere, both Republicans and Democrats, have, unsurprisingly condemned his decision and voiced their intent to try to block him from implementing it. Even some of the President’s staunchest political allies, most notably Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, have described the announcement as dangerously misguided and shortsighted. It is possible that some of these individuals may be able to convince Trump to walk back his plan, or at least his rhetoric. The President himself has already made a somewhat conflicting statement on Twitter that “if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.” Trump has made this vague threat in the past. It came after his political allies and advisors convinced him to slow his order to withdraw all forces from Syria last year. At that time he also voiced support for the Kurds and the SDF. Unfortunately, Trump has framed his latest decision as making good on a three-year-old campaign promise to pull American troops out of unpopular foreign wars and is clearly seeking a political victory of some form. The original announcement of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria was also an attempt to make good on this pledge and garner domestic support. With the President now embroiled in one of most serious sets of American political scandals in a generation, centering on alleged attempts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the business deals of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his family, he may be less willing to back down. America’s chief diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is also tied up in these allegations and Trump recently fired National Security Advisor John Bolton, hiring Robert O’Brien in his place. The scandals and shakeups may limit the number of individuals who may be in a position to effectively argue for taking a different track in Syria. Even if Trump were to back down from his current course of action, as the Pentagon’s statement suggests could be possible, his initial decision has already seriously eroded ties between the United States and the SDF. It may be difficult, if not impossible to rebuild that relationship before the security situation in Syria shifts beyond a point of no return. In addition, every time the United States makes these types of extreme policy decisions, only to quickly retract them, at least to some degree, it only raises questions about the continued reliability of the U.S. government as a partner, in general. Given the unfortunate decades-long history of the U.S. government abandoning proxy forces or otherwise cutting ties with local forces that made immense sacrifices alongside American troops, dating back to the Vietnam War , one has to wonder how this latest shift in policy may impact the ability to find partners willing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. personnel anywhere in the future. With regards to Syria specifically, Trump decision has only opened the door more for a new and serious conflict to emerge and has further limited the U.S. government’s ability to influence the situation, militarily or diplomatically, in any meaningful way going forward. Update 3:45 PM: There are already unconfirmed reports that Turkey has begun air and artillery strikes on various targets near the border with Syria. Fox News is also reporting that the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria is no longer allowing Turkish aircraft to fly along the Syrian border under its auspices and the U.S. military is no longer providing the Turkish military with feeds from American unmanned aircraft flying over northeastern Syria. Curiously, a Tweet from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper accompanying the official Pentagon statement from Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman has disappeared. The statement remains online and it is unclear what the reason for the deletion was, though it may simply be a matter of seeking to avoid any confusion over attribution of the press release. Update 5:45 PM: The White House has sought to push back on reports that the U.S. government has given Turkey’s planned intervention into Syria its approval in a press briefing. The unnamed senior adminitration official leading the press conference also told reporters that between 50 and 100 special operations forces had relocated to other bases in Syria as they “should not be put at risk or injury, death or capture.” However, the official also made clear that the United States would not seek to impede any Turkish advances into northeastern Syria. “The U.S. is not in a position and will not be in a position to fight Turkey over any action it takes in Syria,” they said. The White House is also insisting that Trump’s decision was coordinated with other officials, including within the Pentaton and State Department. The Pentagon has similarly claimed that Secretary of Defense Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley, were not “blindsided” by the President’s moves. However, at the time of writing, there have been no statements of any kind on this important and still-developing stiuation from the State Department, U.S. Central Command, or U.S. European Command. In the meantime, there continue to be reports that Turkish troops and TFSA fighters are moving toward Syria or otherwise preparing for a major operation into the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2019",B-2 Stealth Bomber Has Made Its First-Ever Visit To Increasingly Strategic Iceland (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bomber has made the type’s first-ever visit to Iceland. The mission is nearly a year after a B-2 made another first of its kind trip to Wake Island in the Pacific region. It also comes as the Air Force has become increasingly concerned about whether it would have access to established bases during a large-scale conflict and is actively exploring new and improved rapid , expeditionary , and distributed deployment concepts. The B-2, using the call sign Mighty 22, arrived at Naval Air Station Keflavik from RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom on Aug. 28, 2019, and returned to Fairford. Three of the stealth bombers from the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri had touched down in the United Kingdom the day before to kick off a series of regional training exercises, according to an official statement from U.S. European Command (EUCOM). The flight of B-2s had originally left Whiteman on Aug. 26, using the call signs Death 11, 12, and 13. Death 11 and 12 flew in formation, along with a tanker, toward Fairford, while Death 13 arrived later on by itself. For unclear reasons, Death 11 also broke away at one point from Death 12 and the tanker. “The deployment of strategic bombers to the U.K. helps exercise RAF Fairford as United States Air Forces in Europe’s forward operating location for bombers,” the EUCOM statement said. “The deployment also includes joint and allied training in Europe to improve bomber interoperability. Training with partners, allied nations and other U.S. Air Force units contributes to our readiness and enables us to build enduring and strategic relationships necessary to confront a broad range of global challenges.” There was no specific mention of the Iceland visit or the B-2s traveling to any other sites in particular. The other two bombers at Fairford flew local missions from that base on Aug. 28, 2019, while the third went to Keflavik. Historically, B-2s have been limited to operating from Fairford and Whiteman, as well as Andersen Air Force Base on Guam and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, due to the specialized requirements to support the aircraft. All of these bases have hangars capable of shielding the bombers’ sensitive radar-absorbing skins from the elements. Other bases do have suitable facilities that they can be made available to the B-2s, if necessary. When one of the bombers traveled to Wake Island in September 2018, it had started out at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, which is situated adjacent to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on the island of Oahu. This, in of itself, was something of an unusual deployment. Mighty 22 spent less than five hours at Keflavik and its not clear if the crew even got out of the plane. During the B-2’s visit to Wake Island, crews conducted a “ hot pit ” refuel, a practice where the plane never shuts down its engines. The Air Force often uses this tactic to speed up the pace of operations at forward locations, either for training or actual combat missions. When it comes to more complex and finicky aircraft, such as the B-2, it can also remove the need for complicated start-up procedures and help ensure it will be able to get airborne again without issue. In this case, at Keflavik, doing something similar would have also demonstrated the ability to use the base as an emergency divert or staging location if more typical launch sites, such as Fairford, were unavailable for any reason . Flying from Iceland would still allow B-2s to conduct operations over Europe, as well as into the increasingly strategic and potentially contested Arctic region. Though U.S. military presence at Keflavik waned after the end of the Cold War, with the U.S. Navy formally shuttering Naval Air Station Keflavik, which had also served as a forward deployment location for U.S. Air Force contingents, in 2006. Iceland subsequently took responsibility for the remaining base facilities, which are still commonly referred to as Naval Air Station Keflavik. This site, collocated with the civilian Keflavík International Airport, still supports rotational detachments of fighters from the United States and other NATO members as part of the Alliance’s Icelandic Air Policing mission. Other exercises also regularly make use of the base. A satellite image of what is still commonly referred to as Naval Air Station Keflavik as of August 2019. The base is co-located with Keflavik International Airport, the main terminal for which is visible to the north., Google Earth Since 2015, however, the United States has been working to re-establish a larger presence at Keflavik, particularly in light of increasing, potentially hostile Russian military activity. The Navy has been particularly keen to highlight concerns about increasing Russian submarine operations in the Arctic and North Atlantic and, to a lesser extent, the emergence of Chinese naval activity in those areas. The service reactivated its 2nd Fleet to better manage its own operations in the North Atlantic in August 2018. This has all led the United States to invest more than $80 million in recent years to expand runways, refurbish hangars and other facilities, and otherwise rehabilitate the base, particularly to support increasing U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft deployments. Those same expansions may also help accommodate larger aircraft, including the B-2s, at least during short-duration pit stops. The Air Force has already been stepping up bomber deployments to the region, in general, primarily act as deterrents to any potential Russian aggression and offer clear commitments to America’s NATO allies. In March 2019, a relatively large task force of six B-52 Stratofortresses arrived at Fairford for one such rotation, with at least five of the bombers taking part in one especially impressive sortie over the Norwegian Sea. Three months later, additional B-52s arrived in the region to take part in a number of exercises. During that deployment, one of the bombers made an apparent mock attack run toward the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally seized from Ukraine in 2014. Those two countries have been embroiled in a limited conflict ever since. It’s also worth noting that it was a day of other firsts back in the United Kingdom, as seven Israeli Air Force F-15 Baz combat jets, along with a KC-707 tanker and C-130J airlifter, arrived at RAF Waddington ahead of Exercise Cobra Warrior . The U.K. Royal Air Force, along with the German, Italian, and U.S. Air Forces, are also participating. This is the first time IAF combat jets have visited the United Kingdom. All told, the skies over and around the United Kingdom look set to be particularly jam-packed with military aircraft for the immediate future. It will especially interesting to see where else the three B-2s visit during their deployment. UPDATE: 3:15am PDT— The USAF has issued an official press release on the B-2’s visit to Iceland. Here are the three bits of information to add to the post above: The USAF states two B-2 bombers were involved in the mission to Iceland. We were only aware of one. We will try to clarify which number is accurate. It is also possible that only one aircraft landed. The aircraft did use the hot-pit refueling method and never shut down their engines. A fairly candid quote about the reason for the B-2’s use of the base was also included in one of the photo captions. It also underlines that the base is now considered a forward operating location for the stealth bomber. It reads: The use of strategic bombers in Iceland helps exercise Naval Air Station Keflavik as a forward location for the B-2, ensuring that it is engaged, postured and ready with credible force to assure, deter and defend the U.S. and its allies in an increasingly complex security environment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The Navy’s Oldest Attack Submarine Goes Out On Top After Circumnavigating The Globe,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s oldest active attack submarine, the Los Angeles class USS Olympia , returned to her homeport in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii yesterday after an impressive seven-month-long world tour. The voyage, which saw the boat head east and circumnavigate the globe, was also her last. It’s certainly bittersweet, but it follows twilight years for the submarine that featured a number of significant events, including being responsible for firing the first submarine-launched Harpoon anti-ship missile in many years, and other public recognition of her nearly 35 years of service. Family and friends were at Pearl Harbor to meet Olympia when she arrived on Sept. 8, 2019 . The Navy announced earlier this year that it would decommission her by June 2020, but reports say that she will leave active service before the year ends. After that, the Los Angeles class attack submarine will head for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Bremerton, Washington, where workers will remove her nuclear reactor plant for disposal and scrap the rest of her hull. “ Olympia has completed her final deployment after 35 years of service, circumnavigating the globe in seven months starting from Oahu, Hawaii, transiting through the Panama Canal, Strait of Gibraltar and Suez Canal,” U.S. Navy Commander Benjamin Selph, Olympia ’s commanding officer, said in a statement . “Sailing around the world in our country’s oldest serving nuclear-powered Los Angeles class fast-attack submarine is a testament to the durability and design of the submarine, but also the tenacity and ‘fight on’ spirit of the crew.” USS Olympia returns to Pearl Harbor on Sept. 8, 2019., USN The submarine is actually just shy of 35 years in service, with the Navy having commissioned her on Nov. 17, 1984. She is also the last of the original batch of Flight I Los Angeles class boats still in service. The submarine that had previously held the title of the oldest active-duty boat, USS Bremerton , another Flight I Los Angeles class sub, went on the inactive rolls in July 2018. She is now at Puget Sound undergoing the decommissioning process . Two other Flight Is, the USS La Jolla and USS San Franciso , remain technically commissioned, but serve only as inactive Moored Training Ships. Still, after Olympia goes off to Puget Sound, there will still be eight Flight II Los Angeles class subs and 22 Flight IIIs, also known as the 688is or “improved” types, in active service. USS Bremerton leaves Pearl Harbor for Puget Sound in 2018., USN “We have [sic] been training towards this deployment for months, and it was great to see the sailors put their skills and knowledge to the test,” U.S. Navy Master Chief Electronics Technician (Radio) Arturo Placencia, Olympia ‘s chief-of-the-boat, said . “Our motto is ‘We do difficult things with excellence, strength, and honor,’ and that’s exactly what our sailors did.” As a member of the “ silent service ,” it’s perhaps not surprising that the Navy has offered limited details on what Olympia actually did do during her worldwide cruise. The boat’s official stated mission was “conducting operations to support national security,” according to the official news release . We know the submarine headed into the Eastern Pacific Ocean from Pearl Harbor after she left in February. From there, she sailed through the Panama Canal and into the Atlantic Ocean. After a visit to Faslane, Scotland, it was through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean Sea, before passing through the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea. Back in 1998, Olympia , which has been homeported in Hawaii since it entered service, had already earned the distinction of being the first Pacific-based U.S. Navy submarine to transit the Suez since 1963. Olympia at sea in 1990., USN Olympia had spent at least two months cruising around the Mediterranean Sea. In May 2019, she made a scheduled port visit to the U.K. Royal Navy’s base in Gibraltar in the Western Mediterranean. During her visit, personnel erected scaffolding around her sail to conduct apparent work on the submarine’s Universal Modular Mast (UMM), an electronic periscope or “ photonics mast .” It’s not clear whether the work was the result of damage sustained earlier in the submarine’s travels or something breaking down during an earlier portion of its voyage. It is also possible that the Navy installed some additional mission equipment during the stopover. The “ Los Angeles -class submarine USS Olympia (SSN 717) arrived and left as scheduled for their port visit in Spain,” was all U.S. Navy Commander Kyle Raines, a spokesperson for Commander, 6th Fleet, which oversees the service’s activities in the region, could say when The War Zone reached out in June. “The submarine is on routine deployment conducting maritime operations with allies and partners in the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations.” “The crew of Olympia welcomed British Parliament members on a tour … during our visit,” Commander Selph said of the port call after returning to Pearl Harbor. “We joined the crew of [the Royal Navy’s Trafalgar -class attack submarine] HMS Talent (S92) in a day of barbeque and friendly sports competitions of soccer, football, and volleyball. There was also a promotion ceremony for two Olympia Sailors and a dolphin presentation onboard Talent .” It’s worth noting that Talent also appeared in Gibraltar in May sporting what appeared to be a wake detection system. You can read the War Zone ‘s past analysis of what this piece of equipment might be capable of and why the Royal Navy may have been experimenting with it here . Then, in July, Olympia made another scheduled port call at Naval Support Activity Souda Bay in Greece in the Eastern Mediterranean, where official pictures show she took on Mk 48 torpedoes. Again, however, personnel set up scaffolding around the sail, though it’s not clear what work they may have performed in this case. If workers had installed mission-related equipment in Gibraltar, they may have removed it in Souda Bay if it was no longer necessary. Members of Olympia ‘s crew load a Mk 48 Torpedo onto the submarine at Naval Support Activity Souda Bay in Greece in July 2019. Scaffolding, which was also present around the sail during the submarine’s visit to Gibraltar, is visible here, as well., USN US Navy personnel, including members of Olympia ‘s crew, pose in front of a Mk 48 torpedo at Naval Support Activity Souda Bay., USN After conducting operations in the Mediterranean, Olympia moved into the Red Sea via the Suez and into the Indian Ocean, before eventually making her way back home to Pearl Harbor via the Western Pacific. No matter what Olympia might have been doing during her final cruise around the world, it was certainly a worthy sendoff for a submarine that has given more than three decades of service to the U.S. Navy. Right up until the end, the boat has been very active and visible. In July 2018, the submarine became the first to fire a UGM-84D Harpoon submarine-launched anti-ship missile in more than 20 years at the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise off Hawaii. The missile successfully hit the decommissioned tank landing ship ex-USS Racine during a live-fire sinking exercise, or SINKEX. The Navy is now looking to restore this capability, which you can read more about in this previous War Zone piece , to the Los Angeles class as an interim anti-ship weapon until the service can integrate the new Maritime Strike Tomahawk cruise missiles onto the remaining boats. The next month, Olympia went viral online when the Navy posted some amazing above-and-below water shots of the submarine’s crew during a swim call off in the waters of Hawaii. The submarine’s crew is probably looking forward to some rest and relaxation again now ahead of preparing for the boat’s retirement from active service. One of the photos from Olympia ‘s swim call in August 2018., USN For this particular submarine, those preparations will also include a piece of storied naval tradition that is now 76 years old. In 1943, then-U.S. Navy Commander Richard O’Kane , executive officer of the Gato class submarine USS Wahoo was playing cribbage with other officers and received the highest-scoring hand possible. That same night, the submarine sank two Japanese freighters, and O’Kane’s cribbage board became a symbol of good luck. O’Kane brought the board with him when he took command of the Balao class submarine USS Tang . He retired from the Navy as Rear Admiral in 1957, but the keepsake has since gone on to be a good luck charm for the crew of the longest-serving attack submarine assigned to the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet. USS Wahoo in July 1943. The Japanese sunk her in October 1943, with all hands perishing on board. O’Kane and his lucky cribbage board had moved on to the USS Tang by that point., USN The USS Kamehameha , a Benjamin Franklin -class ballistic missile that the Navy had converted to an attack submarine between 1992 and 1993 and then used as a special operations mothership for SEAL teams , carried the board until its decommissioning in 2002. It then passed to the spy submarine USS Parche , a heavily modified Sturgeon -class attack submarine, which remains the most highly decorated Navy vessel of any kind, ever. The first-in-class USS Los Angeles and then the USS Bremerton had the board until it most recently made its way to Olympia last year. U.S. Navy Commander Travis Zettel, at left, then the commanding officer of USS Bremerton , hands O’Kane’s lucky cribbage board to U.S. Navy Commander Benjamin Selph, Olympia ‘s commanding officer, at right, on May 3, 2018., USN If the tradition continues, and there’s no reason to assume it won’t, Olympia ‘s crew will now pass the board to the USS Chicago , a fight II Los Angeles class boat, which was commissioned in 1986. USS Providence , the first Flight II, which the Navy commissioned in 1985 and is set to become the oldest attack submarine on active duty, is assigned to the U.S. Navy’s Atlantic Fleet. So, while Olympia ‘s storied service to the Navy may be coming to an end soon, it will live in on in a way with that piece of naval history, which will continue to offer good luck to another group of submariners of the “silent service” and the old, but proud submarine they serve on. Correction: The original version of this story said that Olympia had circumnavigated the globe by sailing west to east, when it had actually sailed east to east.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 6, 2020",New Photos Point To Chinese Bomber Being Able To Carry Huge Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged confirming that the newest variant of China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s Xian H-6 bomber, the H-6N , does indeed have a semi-recessed area with a hard point for a very large payload under its fuselage. This is reportedly meant to accommodate an air-launched derivative of the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile giving the aircraft an impressive stand-off capability against large enemy warships, especially aircraft carriers. A trio of H-6Ns has been seen flying over Beijing practicing ahead of a massive military parade that will be part of ceremonies to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state on Oct. 1, 2019. Experts say that there at least four of these aircraft presently assigned to a People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) bomber brigade in China’s Central Theater Command (CTC) region. Other pictures of the parade preparations have already shown that there will be a number of significant reveals during the procession. Reports about the H-6N and its ballistic-missile launching mission first began to emerge in 2017. Xi’an Aircraft International Corporation’s H-6 , a derivative of the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger , has been the centerpiece of China’s bomber force since the 1970s. In 2009, the H-6K variant , a significant redesign from the original aircraft optimized as a carrier for long-range anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles, entered service. The H-6N is a further outgrowth of this earlier missile carrier version. An H-6K bomber, which the H-6N is derived from., Japan Ministry of Defense The most notable change between the N and K is the complete elimination of the bomb bay on the N and the addition of semi-recessed area with a hard point for a large missile. This is similar in some general respects to the ability of Russia’s Tu-22M Backfire bombers to carry a single Kh-22 or Kh-32 anti-ship cruise missile in a semi-recessed mount under its central fuselage. There are no pictures from the parade preparations that show the H-6Ns carrying a payload and some of them appear to have a plug installed that gives the fuselage its normal profile when a missile is not loaded. So, it remains unclear what type of weapon, or weapons, the Chinese intend to employ on these aircraft. A view of the underside of one of the H-6Ns seen flying over Beijing ahead of the 70th-anniversary parade, showing the semi-recessed area with a hard point for a very large missile., Chinese Internet An annotated image showing what appears to be a protective “plug” in place on one of the H-6Ns for when it is not carrying a missile on the centerline., Chinese Internet Previous reports have indicated that an air-launched derivative of the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, reportedly called the CH-AS-X-13, will be the primary weapon for the H-6N. A publicly released U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report has said the standard DF-21D has a range of more than 930 miles when ground-launched. In 2018, The Diplomat reported , citing anonymous sources, that this new missile, which uses lightweight composite materials would have a range of more than 1,860 miles. Air-launching the weapon could also help increase its range by eliminating the need to first boost tens of thousands of feet in the air. The DF-21D features a maneuverable, conventionally-armed reentry vehicle and the CH-AS-X-13 could leverage its basic design. The existing ground-launched missile reportedly has a limited ability to locate and zero in on a particular target during the terminal phase of flight using radar, as well as possibly infrared sensors, on the reentry vehicle. It may also be able to course-correct during the mid-course portion of its flight based on the information it receives from other sources via data link. A computer rendering of the H-6N carrying an air-launched anti-ship ballistic missile that emerged in 2017., Chinese Internet It is unclear whether or not the CH-AS-X-13 will carry a conventional or nuclear-armed warhead and it may be dual-capable. “China is developing two air-launched ballistic missiles, one of which may carry nuclear weapons,” U.S. Army Major General Robert Ashley, head of DIA, said in 2018 . He had also made a virtually identical comment in 2017. A nuclear warhead would reduce the need for especially precise targeting and could make the weapon useful for taking out larger groups of targets at once, including entire U.S. Navy carrier strike groups . The CH-AS-X-13 will also likely leverage China’s increasing experience with long-range ballistic weapons with maneuvering warheads, in general, which is also a product of efforts to help defeat any potential missile defenses. It’s worth noting that the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) already operates the larger DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), seen in the video below, which also reportedly has anti-ship capabilities. In 2017, China also revealed a version of the smaller, short-range DF-16, the DF-16G , with a maneuvering warhead. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pdm2i-jVAWk Last year, state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) showed off a new short-range ballistic missile specifically for the anti-ship role, known as the CM-401 , at the biennial Zhuhai Airshow, as well. All told, it could turn out that the H-6N may eventually be able to use its large, semi-recessed mounting arrangement to carry a number of different air-launched ballistic weapons, and potentially future hypersonic weapons , in the coming years. The bomber’s ability to carry over-sized payloads may ensure it remains a useful tool in the PLAAF arsenal even as newer stealthier bombers begin entering service in the future. The U.S. Air Force similarly intends to keep flying its aging, Cold War-era B-52 bombers for decades to come for this very reason . Air-launched ballistic missiles are also becoming an increasingly popular concept around the world . The H-6N also prominently features an aerial refueling probe on its nose, which could further expand its flexibility and reach, especially when it comes to engaging targets at the very edges of areas China claims as its integral national territory, including in the South China Sea , and beyond. The aerial refueling capability may also just be necessary to ensure that the aircraft can lug the weapon to the appropriate altitude and launch point. China operates an aerial refueling tanker variant of the H-6, the HY-6, as well as the various bomber versions. , Li Pang via Wikimedia Whatever the case, the H-6N has the potential to be another formidable addition to China’s already extensive anti-access and area denial capabilities, especially in the South China Sea . Just in January 2019, the PLARF conducted drills that appeared intended to demonstrate China’s ability to conduct extremely long-range anti-ship attacks on potential opponents in the South China Sea. Then between June and July, there were reports that Chinese forces conducted live-fire drills that involved firing ballistic missiles into that region, further underscoring the threat. In addition, China’s ability to detect and track naval threats, as well as potential opponents in the air , under the water , and in space , are rapidly improving, as are its command and control capabilities . When it comes to spotting ships, the Chinese can increasingly call on manned and unmanned surveillance aircraft , as well as shore-based assets, including over-the-horizon radars. This provides the kind of network essential for long-range anti-ship ballistic missile strikes. In July, weeks after the Chinese missile exercises, there was an unconfirmed report from Taiwan’s Up Media that one of the PLAAF’s Xianglong, or Soar Eagle , high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drone had shadowed the U.S. Navy’s Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Antietam as it sailed through the Taiwan Strait . Soar Eagle is just one of a number of HALE unmanned aircraft that the Chinese have been developing in recent years. A prototype Soar Eagle drone., Chinese Internet With regards to the H-6N and its weapon loadouts, we may learn more during the Oct. 1 parade, especially if one of the aircraft flies over onlookers in Tiananmen Square carrying a payload of some kind. With this official debut, we will almost certainly be seeing more of these missile carriers in various settings, including training exercises, that will help illuminate more details about its exact capabilities, as well.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 23, 2019",China Just Launched Its Huge And Incredibly Quickly Built Amphibious Assault Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some five months after the first pictures emerged of its keel under construction, China has launched its first Type 075 landing helicopter dock amphibious assault ship, or LHD, at the Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai. This achievement comes just days before the country marks the 70th anniversary of Communist state’s founding. The speed with which the Chinese have been able to execute its construction is as impressive as the ship’s size. The vessel will significantly increase the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s amphibious warfare capabilities , and the China State Shipbuilding Corporation is already building a second example. Â Dockworkers at Hudong-Zhonghua launched the still-unnamed Type 075 LHD after a ceremony on Sept. 25, 2019. Images began to emerge online of the ship’s keel under construction between April and May 2019, though it is unclear when the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) formally began work on the ship. Workers will now complete the final phases of construction with the vessel in the water. There is no word yet on when the Chinese expect it to head out for its first sea trials or actually enter service with the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). “Officials from the central and Shanghai governments, officers from the Central Military Commission’s Equipment Development Department and the PLA Navy, executives of the State-owned conglomerate China State Shipbuilding Corp, as well as the vessel’s designers and construction workers applauded as they watched the launch process,” an official statement declared, according to China Military , an official PLA news outlet. There were reportedly no additional details about the ceremony in that press release. Members of the PLAN stand at attention during the launch ceremony for the Type 075 LHD., China Military Specifics about the Type 075’s size and capabilities remain limited. Development of the ship began in 2011, at which time reports said that it would displace “more than” 30,000 tons . More recent estimates suggest its final displacement is somewhere between 35,000 and 40,000 tons, which would put it in a size class close to the U.S. Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ships. This would make it significantly larger than many similar ships that other countries in the Asia-Pacific region operate, including Australia’s 27,500 ton-displacement Canberra class and 18,800-ton displacement South Korea’s Dokdo class . The Type 075 is also bigger and more capable than the Type 071 amphibious transport docks, or LPDs, which are presently the PLAN’s largest operational amphibious warfare ships. The Type 071, which displaces around 25,000 tons, has a smaller flight deck at the stern and hangar space for up to four Z-8 heavy transport helicopters .Â By comparison, the new LHD will have a dedicated hangar deck below its flight deck and will reportedly be able to carry between 28 and 30 helicopters of various types, including the Z-8 and the smaller Z-9 utility and light attack helicopters. China does not have any short takeoff and vertical landing capable combat jets at present, but it is at least exploring this possibility and the Type 075 could already have design features to support fixed-wing operations in the future. An interesting graphical illustration of the PLAN's Type 075 showing its current progress (July 2019). via 'baoxiuyuan'/CJDBY-forum pic.twitter.com/kEdjW8NrXm — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) July 5, 2019 It is not clear how many Marines the Type 075 will be able to accommodate, but its full complement will likely be much larger than that of the Type 071, which can carry between 600 and 800 troops, as well as their ground vehicles and other equipment. The U.S. Navy’s Wasp class, for example, can carry 1,650 Marines , along with their light armored and unarmored vehicles and other equipment. Similar to the American ships, China’s new LHD also has a well deck that can hold multiple Type 726 air cushion landing craft â€“ roughly analogous to the U.S. Navy’s LCAC â€“ in order to move personnel, vehicles, and other cargo ashore. A picture of the Type 075 in the lead up to its launch, showing what appears to be at least one FL-3000N point defense system mounted on the stern., Chinese Internet The exact armament fit on the Type 075, including systems for self-defense , is also unknown. Reports say that it will include at least two H/PJ-11 30mm close-in weapon systems (CIWS), also known as the Type 730 , and a pair of FL-3000N point defense surface-to-air missile systems. Pictures of the ship at its launch ceremony, and in the days and weeks before, show what appears to be at least one FL-3000N in place at the stern and one forward of the ship’s island superstructure. A Type 730 CIWS is also seen amidships on its port side. Chinese Internet Regardless of how much the ship actually displaces and what its exact capabilities are, what may be most impressive about it is China’s ability to proceed so fast with its construction. Chinese shipyards have already demonstrated their ability to produce large surface warships with relative rapidity, but work on the Type 075 has progressed at a particularly fast pace. For comparison, it took three years between keel-laying and launch to build the U.S. Navy’s second in class USS Tripoli (LHA-7) . Also, keep in mind that the U.S. has been building flattop amphibious assault ships for the better part of a century. This is China’s first.Â It is possible that the goal was to have this ship launched ahead of celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist State on Oct. 1, 2019, and that CSSC did everything possible to ensure it could meet this timeline. How fast Hudong-Zhonghua is able to get the second hull in the water may offer some insight into how sustainable this pace of work actually is. The first tranche of Type 075s will reportedly consist of three ships in total. The hull of a second Type 075 is visible to the right of the first ship at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard., Chinese Internet Still, the Type 075 only further underscores the significant modernization and expansion underway within the PLAN, as well as across the PLA as a whole. The new LHDs will dramatically transform the PLAN’s ability to conduct amphibious operations, including against Taiwan , especially if grouped together with other existing assets, such as the Type 071s and the country’s massive Russian-made Zubr class hovercrafts, which you can read about more here .Â The expanded amphibious capabilities the Type 075 will offer could have significant impacts on China’s military presence throughout the Asia-Pacific region, including its ability to assert its claims over disputed areas, such as the South China Sea, where the country already has an extensive network of man-made island outposts. They could also be valuable for exerting Chinese influence further abroad, coupled with a growing number of bases in foreign countries . China also operates one of the largest hospital ships anywhere in the world, its lone Type 920 , which offers a relatively unique capability that could be essential for supporting expeditionary operations further from the Chinese mainland. China Is making a bold military power play https://t.co/OK2Db30q1z pic.twitter.com/aKomI2MOaB — Bloomberg Originals (@bbgoriginals) March 6, 2018 This could extend beyond traditional military operations. American amphibious warfare ships have historically been a go-to option for extracting U.S. citizens from countries experiencing sudden and violent upheaval and a vital tool for responding to natural disasters. PLAN amphibious warfare groups built around Type 075s could similarly help rescue Chinese nationals, who are working in ever-increasing numbers in potential hotspots around the world, or respond to humanitarian crises at home and overseas. China already employs its Type 920 hospital ship as a valuable soft-power tool . Chinese Internet With the Type 075’s construction proceeding so quickly, it is very possible that the ship will be ready for sea trials relatively soon. At the same time, we may begin to learn more about its exact features in the coming months now that the lead example of the class is in the water and will be getting fitted out. No matter what, the Type 075’s launch is simply another clear demonstration of China’s desire and ability to increase the size and scope of its naval capabilities, with a clear eye toward operations further and further from Chinese shores.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2019",Four Of The Biggest Revelations From China’s Massive 70th Anniversary Military Parade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China was always going to be a grand spectacle. As photos from the preparations emerged online, it was clear that the Chinese government would put a large amount of previously unseen weapons and other hardware on display, including new mockups of stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles, examples of high-speed rocket-powered reconnaissance drones , new bombers capable of carrying outsized payloads , and much more . As it turned out, the celebrations in Tiananmen Square were especially grandiose, with Xi Jinping making pointed appeals to Chinese nationalism and the country’s growing influence globally, themes also present in a recently released national defense policy white paper, throughout. “It was today, 70 years ago, that Chairman Mao stood at this very place and announced solemnly to the world the founding of the People’s Republic of China, which marks the end of more than 100 years of humiliation and misery the country had suffered since modern times,” Xi declared in his speech. So, it’s perhaps not surprising that the parade was particularly jam-packed with very clearly Chinese weapons and other equipment and had a heavy focus on strategic deterrence, including the country’s latest nuclear delivery systems, and advanced weapons, like hypersonic missiles and unmanned platforms. It would take too long to go through everything that was on display, but here are four systems The War Zone thinks are especially significant in addition to our analysis of two advanced aerial systems we have already posted . The DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile China’s anniversary parade included 16 DF-41 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), marking the first time the country had publicly displayed these weapons. With an estimated range of around 9,300 miles, they are China’s longest-range strategic nuclear weapons. The missile has a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) configuration, though how many warheads it can actually carry is unclear. There have been unconfirmed reports in the past that it may be able to accommodate between 6 and 10 nuclear weapons, though experts believe the number is much smaller, possibly around 3. The missile also reportedly carries decoys and has other unspecified penetration aids to help it get past hostile missile defenses. The road-mobile 16-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher and the missile’s solid-fuel rocket motor make for a highly flexible weapon that is more difficult for opponents to track and is, therefore, more survivable. The road-mobile DF-41 ICBM., Kyodo via AP Images Reportedly in development since before 2000, the DF-41 project appeared to have been deferred multiple times in the past. The first of these missiles were reportedly deployed operationally in 2017, with two brigades of them in service by the end of that year. This would align with the official Chinese statement that personnel from two People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force DF-41 brigades took part in the Oct. 1 parade. The DF-17 hypersonic missile It is something of an open secret that China has been developing hypersonic boost-glide vehicles for some time now . The appearance of 16 mockups of the DF-17, the first time this weapon has been shown in any format, at the parade only drove home Chinese ambitions in this regard. The DF-17, which has reportedly been in testing since at least 2017 , uses the rocket booster from the already operational DF-16B short-range ballistic missile. On top, instead of a traditional warhead, however, is an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, which reports have previously referred to as the DF-ZF or WU-14. A top-down look at two of the DF-17 mockups., China Military The shape of the vehicle on the mockup DF-17 missiles in the parade was, not surprisingly, similar, if not identical to a wind tunnel model, footage of which appeared on Chinese state television in 2017. It also looks very much like vehicles involved in an apparent high-altitude drop test in northwestern China in 2018. Chinese testing of earlier hypersonic boost-glide vehicles dates back to at least 2014. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles use a rocket booster to get up to an appropriate altitude and a speed over Mach 5, after which they fly a maneuvering flight path through the atmosphere to their target. Between their sheer speed and their ability to maneuver in unpredictable ways, they are ideally suited to penetrating through dense enemy defenses to strike strategic or time-critical targets. The differences between their flight trajectory and signature and those of traditional ballistic missiles, also make it hard for defenders to spot, track, let alone attempt to shoot down these weapons. This reduces how much time an opponent has to try to relocate important assets to another location, as well. With an estimated range of around 1,240 miles, the DF-17 is more of a regional weapon, but one that would still pose a very serious threat to potential Chinese opponents, especially Taiwan . It would also present new challenges for the United States and its Asian allies, such as South Korea and Japan, as well as India . A closer look at the mocked-up hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that sits on the top of the DF-17., CCTV capture The JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile China’s 70th anniversary parade interestingly included 12 JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) carried on trucks. Though these have reportedly been in active service on board the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s nuclear-powered Type 094 Jin class ballistic missile submarines, the Chinese government had not displayed any examples publicly. Sharing a common rocket motor and other features with the land-based DF-31 ICBM, the JL-2s at the parade confirm that the submarine-launched weapon has a much blunter shroud for unexplained reasons. This configuration is often associated with MIRV designs, but all existing reporting indicates that each JL-2 carries only a single warhead. It is possible that this could point to the missile having additional space devoted to penetration aids or the shape may simply be a product of the design constraints of the launch tubes on the Type 094. Whatever the case, the PLAN’s six Type 094s, each of which can carry 12 JL-2s, form the backbone of China’s naval nuclear deterrent. The Chinese have been working to expand the capabilities of their ballistic missile submarine force, including the development of a future JL-3 SLBM . The PLAN’s Jin class boats are already, by their nature, difficult for opponents to track. Trucks carrying the JL-2s during the parade., China Military HSU-001 unmanned undersea vehicle Unmanned systems were a big feature of the 70th anniversary parade, but the systems on display weren’t limited just to flying drones. China also revealed a large unmanned undersea vehicle , possibly known as the HSU-001, given the markings on the two examples in the procession. Based on the truck carrying them, the HSU-001 appears to be similar in size to Boeing’s Echo Seeker design. Boeing’s Echo series also includes the much larger Echo Voyager, which served as a stepping stone to its winning bid for the U.S. Navy’s Orca Large Displacement UUV (LDUUV) program. The two HSU-001s on parade., Imaginechina via AP Images Unlike Boeing’s designs, which have a single screw propulsion arrangement, the HSU-001 has a twin-screw configuration. The exact capabilities of China’s large UUV are unknown, but it does have two collapsible sensor masts. If the Chinese plans for the HSU-001 are at all similar to the U.S. Navy’s with regards to Orca , then the drone submarine could find itself tasked to perform a variety of wide-area intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, as well as hunt for mines and conduct underwater mapping, especially in littoral areas. Given its size, China UUV could eventually evolve to carry new sensor payloads or even compact weapons. A look at the rear of the HSU-001s., China Military With all these systems, and many more, now having made their official public debut, we may begin to learn more about their specific capabilities and intended roles. What is already clear is that China’s military modernization is continuing at a brisk pace and the country is pushing ahead more and more toward closing capability gaps with its largest competitors, namely the United States. It certainly appears that America’s military dominance in the Asia-Pacific region is continuing to erode.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",You Can Buy This U.S. Navy High-Speed Riverine Assault Boat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you have a nearby river or lake, or just a really big back yard pond, that you’re worried terrorists or smugglers might infiltrate, or are just looking to turn heads at your local marina, you may want to place a bid on the auction for this ex-U.S. Navy Riverine Assault Boat, or RAB. United States Marine, Inc. built these in the late 2000s for the Navy specifically to equip new units tasked with patrolling inland waterways in Iraq, which led to something of a brown water renaissance within the service. Before then, this kind of inshore watercraft capability was largely limited to Naval Special Warfare units . United States Marine, Inc., or USMI, built the particular RAB that is up for auction back in 2008. The 33-foot long boat is presently at the Naval Support Fleet Logistics Center in Williamsburg, Virginia, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), which is facilitating the sale. At the time of writing, someone had bid $4,500 for the watercraft, an offer that did not meet the unspecified reserve price. While we don’t know what the reserve price may be, it is likely to be drastically less than the unit cost the Navy paid for these originally, which official budget documents say was just over $1.4 million 2010. However, that price tag may have also included a variety of military-specific equipment that is not included in the auction of the boat. GSA only mentions the Furuno navigation radar, compass, and navigation lights among the aluminum-hulled craft’s features. A view from onboard the RAB that is up for auction., GSA The RAB’s main controls., GSA The RAB’s Furuno navigation radar on top of its folding mast in a partially deployed position., GSA “DISCREPANCIES (INCLUDE BUT MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO): PORT ENGINE MISSING PARTS; PORT DRIVESHAFT DISCONNECTED FROM WATERJET; STARBOARD ENGINE MISSING AIR FILTER; HULL HAS DENTS, SCRATCHES AND MISSING PAINT IN SOME AREAS,” one document attached to the auction listing warns in all-caps. Each RAB has two Yanmar 6LY2A-STP diesel engines, each rated at 440 horsepower. These power a pair of Hamilton HJ292 Waterjets. The boats have a very shallow draft of just two feet and a top speed of over 40 knots, or more than 46 miles per hour, according to USMI , which still offers them on its website. The Navy says that the typical cruising speed was 30 knots and that the boats had a range of around 250 nautical miles with at their full combat weight of around 20,500 pounds. One of the RAB’s two Yanmar diesel engines., GSA The standard configuration for the Navy included five weapons stations, two on either side of the bow, two on either side amidships, and one at the stern. The mounts in each of these positions could accommodate a variety of weapons, including .50 caliber M2 machine guns , 7.62mm Miniguns , and 7.62mm M240 machine guns . The boats also had armored shields that can be placed along their sides to offer additional protection, which appear to be missing from the example that is up for auction now. A single individual was in charge of sailing the craft from a standing position in the center, giving the RABs a total crew complement of six. A basic overview of the RAB., USN This made them formidable craft for patrolling inland waterways, which was the Navy’s original mission for them. In 2006, the Navy stood up Riverine Group 1 (RIVGRU 1) and its subordinate Riverine Squadron 1 (RIVRON 1) under the control of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command. RIVRON 1 immediately went to Iraq to help provide security along that country’s rivers and canals and to interdict terrorists and criminal elements, such as smugglers. “You have to have guys out here on the water,” U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Nickolas W. Tilliman, a gunners mate with the squadron’s Detachment 3, said in an official interview in 2007. “You have Marines and soldiers on the roads, but if you got nobody in the water, there is no hope of stopping the flow of weapons or illegal activity.” Sailors fire various mounted weapons on a RAB during a state-side training exercise., USN Patrolling along Iraq’s coasts, including around its offshore oil infrastructure, and further inland had been a major component of U.S.-led operations in the country following the invasion in March 2003. In the opening phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom, SEAL Teams and Special Boat Teams from Naval Special Warfare Command used their own specialized watercraft to seize control of offshore oil terminals. The Navy had built up a significant riverine capability during the Vietnam War , with a wide array of heavily armed and armored watercraft, including the iconic Patrol Boat Riverine , or PBR. After that conflict came to an end, the service steadily cut back on those capabilities. By the time the war in Iraq kicked off, the vast majority of this type of capability was located within Navy special operations boat units . RIVGRU 1’s job was to provide additional and conventional capacity to perform these kinds of maritime security tasks, which also included visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) missions to inspect other vessels. The RABs themselves are variants of the Special Operations Craft-Riverine (SOC-R), which USMI was already building for Naval Special Warfare elements. The SOC-R has a hull with horizontal ribbing on the side, while the RAB’s hull is flat, but the boats are functionally identical. Given the date of production on the RAB that’s now up for auction, it may well have served in Iraq. A SOC-R with its distinctive ribbed hull at high speed., USN The Navy’s new riverine group eventually expanded to include three squadrons. By 2010, these units were equipped with RABs, as well as the smaller Riverine Patrol Boat (RPB), a type of rigid hull inflatable boat, and the larger Riverine Command Boat (RCB), a variant of the Swedish Combat Boat 90 design. The video below shows RABs and RPBs working together during an exercise. As time went on, the RABs gained additional equipment to help them conduct their missions, including sensor turrets with electro-optical and infrared cameras to give them greater ability to operate at night when terrorists and militants would be most active. The boats also eventually sported smoke grenade launchers at the rear to conceal them during intense firefights, while inserting or extracting personnel from the shore, or to cover a tactical withdrawal. Some even had electronic warfare jammers to defeat improvised explosive devices along the shoreline. A fully kitted out RAB with sensor turret, seen on top of the radar mast, with two tan electronic warfare jammers flanking it. Four four-round smoke grenade launchers are alos visible at the rear., USMI In 2012, a year after the U.S. military officially completed its withdrawal from Iraq, the Navy shuttered RIVGRU 1 and combined its personnel and assets with maritime security units, which had been tasked with providing port security in the United States and at forward-deployed locations, creating new Coastal Riverine units in the process. These new units continued to operate RABs, as well as the other riverine craft, using them to perform various inshore security missions around the world. In 2016, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps infamously detained the crews of two RCBs from Coastal Riverine Squadron 3 in the Persian Gulf. One of Coastal Riverine Squadron 3’s Riverine Command Boats., USN It’s not clear whether this particular auction reflects a larger plan on the Navy’s part to divest any remaining RABs. In recent years, coastal riverine units have begun to receive newer, more capable boats. The most notable of these is the Mk VI patrol boat, which you can read about in more detail here . The Navy is also looking to adopt a replacement, dubbed PB-X , for the 25- and 34-foot security boats found in these units. The SOC-Rs remain in service with Naval special operations elements. A Mk VI patrol boat assigned to Coastal Riverine Group 1., USN Whatever happens to the RABs, the Navy’s riverine units are definitely here to stay. For years now, the service has also been exploring how it might use these boats in distributed warfare scenarios, with larger ships and sea bases acting as central operational nodes. The U.S. special operations community has already pioneered similar concepts of operation that could be applicable to regular Navy units. If you’re interested in trying to buy your own riverine patrol boat to guard waters a bit closer to home, don’t wait too long. The auction for this particular RAB closes on Oct. 10, 2019.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",Amazing Cockpit Video Of Unusual Trident Ballistic Missile Test May Point To New Warhead,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. No less than four D5 Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles were fired from the USS Nebraska off the Southern California coast between September 4th and September 6th, 2019. We detailed this rare test in an article posted shortly after it occurred. Now, a video we received shows one of these launches from the perspective on an Airbus airliner’s cockpit as it flew from Guadalajara to Tijuana, Mexico. Any rocket or ballistic missile launch from such a perspective is fascinating to see—as the aircrew’s dialogue proves—but the one recorded appears to have been potentially unique and quite timely considering ongoing U.S. nuclear weapons developments in response to peer state competition abroad. You can watch this intriguing video for yourself below: The video, which is downright gorgeous, shows the Trident missile rising from the Pacific ocean at twilight and streaking westward across the sky. You can clearly see two distinct stage separations and one of them falling away as the missile’s third stage continues on, barreling westward. But what’s strange about it is that the missile looks to level out and fly a relatively low and flat trajectory as it roars across the sky. We don’t know the distance of the aircraft to the missile, and of course, the aircraft’s altitude and range from the missile is going to make a difference as to where it appears in the sky from the aircrew’s perspective, but this looks too flat even taking those factors into account. Trident missile launch from an SSGN., USN I reached out to a number of experts in ballistic missile and strategic capabilities about the video in question. Every one of them agreed that it does look to be a “depressed trajectory.” One, who was only willing to discuss his analysis on background, said quite definitely that it was a unique, flatter trajectory than what these missiles usually fly to deploy their extremely powerful reentry vehicles. Another stated the same. I also discussed the video with Ankit Panda , an international security expert who focuses on strategic weaponry. He took a good look at the video and agreed that it could to be a depressed trajectory test, stating: “The launch angle does appear to be slightly depressed. While it’s difficult to ascertain with any certainty from the footage alone, a depressed trajectory test would not be particularly unusual. With the development of the low-yield W76-2 warhead, promptness is at a premium. Depressed trajectories shorten flight times considerably.” The development of the W76-2 is something we have been following closely and mentioned in our original writeup about the launches, noting the following: Regardless of whether the launches were routine or not, this large test event also comes as the United States and Russia are finding themselves increasingly at odds over strategic arms control and other nuclear weapons-related issues and signs of a new arms race are already growing. The U.S. government has publicly said that it needs the W76-2 in large part to counter potential Russian developments, as well as the country’s purported “ escalate-to-deescalate ” doctrine. Experts continue to disagree about whether this policy actually exists. The W76-2 came to be out of recommendations from the 2018 Strategic Posture Review and was designed quickly using the existing W76-1 that flies aboard the D5 Trident II missile by lowering its yield dramatically, from 100 kilotons to around 5-7 kilotons. This allows for tactical nuclear weapons effects, but delivery via an at-the-ready strategic delivery system that can hit pretty much any target on earth in a very short period of time. By depressing the trajectory of the missile, it can get to its target even faster, but doing so sacrifices range and payload capacity. Pantex workers with a W76 warhead. , Pantex Youtube video screengrab The use of a depressed trajectory and faster flight times may also work to help the missile survive any enemy anti-ballistic missile defenses beyond just cutting down the kill-chain duration. For decades, the idea of using these fast flight profiles has been touted as uniquely well suited for executing decapitation strikes and taking out extremely time-sensitive targets, albeit it could mean starting a nuclear exchange in the process. Even using them in a broader nuclear exchange against key targets has been a possible application of the tactic. There are limits to just how fast and shallow a trajectory is possible, though, mostly due to the thermal loads the missile system can endure. You can read more about the potential use of depressed trajectories for submarine-launched ballistic missiles here . The timing for such a test is also logical, as the W76-2 entered production in January of 2019 and the first completed warhead rolled off the Pantex line in late February 2019. It’s also worth mentioning that a number of notices were posted with general warning areas highlighting where the launches would occur and where the weapons’ stages and warheads would fall. Aside from the eastern Pacific where the launch would occur, waters off Hawaii and Guam were designated. It’s possible that Hawaii is where the shorter-range, depressed trajectory test’s warhead landed. So, with all this in mind, is it possible that this video depicts the test of the new W76-2 fired on a depressed trajectory? The answer seems to be a strong yes. In addition, considering the Nebraska launched four test missiles, one can assume that different launch profiles and warhead configurations were tested. As for what the pilots were saying while all of this was going on, here is a translated transcript of their conversation: 0:00-0:30 Affirmative. (Unintelligible) 4-5 level 3-4-0. 4-5 Hello, good evening 3-4-0. Wow, what is that? I don’t know. (Unintelligible) I have no idea but it’s super interesting. 0:30-1:00 Wow, son of a bitch.

Look, look, it stopped and ended up looking like a star. We can only imagine how impressive the light show looked like being actually in the cockpit, but the crew of this A320 may have actually caught a very unique moment, even for what were already rare ballistic missile tests—one that is truly a sign of the more uncertain geopolitical times we are currently living in.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 4, 2021",This Is Our Best Look Yet At The Elite FBI Hostage Rescue Team’s UH-60 Black Hawks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Regular readers of The War Zone may remember a pair of stories from last year regarding what appeared to be domestic training exercises involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s elite Hostage Rescue Team, or HRT, and their UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters. Now the FBI has offered its own inside look at another such exercise in South Carolina that included the Black Hawks. This confirms our earlier assessment that those helicopters belonged to the Bureau and offers a closer look at their exact configuration. Members of HRT and other FBI agents, including trainees, together with elements from the South Carolina National Guard and no less than 10 other state and local agencies, conducted the exercise in Charleston between Aug. 5 and 7, 2019. The SeaHawk Interagency Operations Center , which the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice run together as part of managing security at the Port of Charleston, also participated. At least three UH-60Ms from HRT’s Tactical Helicopter Unit, along with two of the Bureau’s Special Operations Craft-Riverine (SOC-R) boats, which you can read about in more detail here , helped move personnel around the littoral areas in and around the coastal city. “The goal was to build a realistic scenario to exercise a range of techniques,” an unnamed special agent from the FBI’s field office in South Carolina’s capital Colombia said in an official interview . “The local agencies gain a better understanding of the FBI’s capabilities and special equipment. The HRT trainees see how incredibly important it is to seek out the local expertise and collaborate with regional and state partners.” A full list of the participants in the August exercise in Charleston, South Carolina., FBI The exercise scenario involved reports that an individual, belonging to a fictitious domestic militia group, had thrown a bag off Ravenel Bridge, a span that crosses Copper River and Drum Island linking Charleston with the suburb of Mt. Pleasant to the northeast. The FBI and its local partners spent three days gathering mock evidence, conducting a simulated manhunt, and defusing various surrogate improvised explosive devices, including a vest strapped to an individual playing the role of a hostage. An HRT tactical special agent bomb technician trainee, flanked by members of the Charleston Police Department SWAT team, investigates a mock pipe bomb during the August 2019 exercise in South Carolina., FBI During the exercise, HRT’s UH-60Ms inserted personnel into hard to reach areas via fast ropes and extracted them using rope ladders. One of the helicopters used its hoist to conduct at least two mock rescue operations, retrieving “injured” individuals from a boat belonging to the North Charleston Fire Department and one of the FBI’s SOC-Rs. One of HRT’s UH-60Ms hoists an individual up from a SOC-R during the training exercise in South Carolina in August., FBI HRT members “rescue” a first responder from a North Charleston Fire Department boat., FBI HRT has been operating various helicopters since its inception in 1983, including Bell 407s and 412EPs and MD 500-series Little Birds . Starting in 2009, HRT began acquiring new UH-60Ms via U.S. Army contracts and reportedly now has six of them in total. Since then, the Army has also begun to divest earlier model UH-60s to other U.S. government agencies and foreign partners through its Black Hawk Exchange and Sales Team (BEST) program. The Department of Justice has received some of these second-hand Black Hawks, but it is unclear if they have gone to the FBI or other agencies. While the FBI’s Black Hawks might have the same overall green paint job, the photos the Bureau released from the exercise show that their helicopters have some distinct features, including the hoist, compared to their standard Army cousins . It is also clear that they are dead ringers for unknown helicopters seen flying around Chicago in September 2018 and in and around the Port of Miami in December of that year, right down to the simple “United States” marking on the tail. The FBI Black Hawks notably have two satellite communications antennas on the roof, which one typically does not see on standard Army examples. One of the UH-60Ms present during the exercise in Charleston had a pair AV 2091 “ Eggbeater ” or “ O Wing ” UHF SATCOM antennas, though the FBI Black Hawks seen in Chicago and Miami had X-shaped UHF SATCOM antennas . A HRT member rappels from a UH-60M during the August exercise in South Carolina. The two “Eggbeater” or “O Wing” UHF SATCOM antennas are clearly visible on top. This particular helicopter also has a notable hammerhead shark artwork on the engine cover., FBI A lower quality picture of one of the FBI’s UH-60Ms in Miami in December 2018, with X-shaped UHF SATCOM antennas on top of the fuselage., Owen from Miami These are in addition to multiple blade-style aerials that are also typically associated with communications systems on top and underneath the fuselage, which are more reminiscent of what one might expect to see on Army UH-60s . The extensive communications suite may reflect the FBI’s expectation that HRT will be operating in environments with various different actors, including civilian first responders and members of the U.S. military, who may all have their own networks , and will need to be able to readily connect with all of them. The sheer number of different agencies involved in this one exercise in South Carolina certainly underscores this reality. Interestingly, as with Army Black Hawks, the FBI UH-60Ms have the mounts on the nose and tail for the AN/AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System’s (CMWS) electro-optical sensors, as well as a bracket on each side of the tail for countermeasures dispensers for decoy flares. When installed, the CMWS provides audio and visual warnings about incoming short-range infrared-homing missiles and a central control unit can be set to automatically employ countermeasures , such as flares. A standard US Army UH-60M with the CMWS sensors installed, most clearly visible on the nose, and countermeasures dispensers fitted to the sides of the tail., US Army It is possible that these features were simply included on all of the UH-60Ms in the Army’s order, even the ones earmarked for the FBI. There’s no clear indication that HRT is necessarily worried about the threat from weapons such as shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS , in a domestic context. That being said, in the past, the U.S. government has noted the potential danger MANPADS would pose, especially to airports , in the United States. In addition, HRT personnel do deploy overseas, including on joint operations with U.S. military special operators, and having the ability to install these defensive systems on its Black Hawks could allow it to deploy its own air support to higher threat environments, if necessary. Beyond offering an opportunity to take a good look at the FBI’s Black Hawks, the exercise in South Carolina was also just another good example of the kind of hyper-realistic training activities that elite U.S. government agencies, including law enforcement groups such as HRT and military special operations forces, regularly engage in domestically. As The War Zone has pointed out in our past coverage of these types of events , while dedicated training centers can support a wide variety of scenarios, they’re simply no substitute for real-world environments, especially when it comes to dense urban areas . Two of these FBI SOC-R riverine boats also took part in the South Carolina exercise in August., FBI This is especially true when it comes to HRT, which is part of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). The group’s units are required to be on-call should any number of serious emergencies occur anywhere in the country, including in America’s largest cities. This includes traditional explosive ordnance disposal missions, as well as disarming or otherwise neutralizing weapons of mass destruction, including fully-fledged nuclear weapons and dirty bombs . As its name suggests, HRT is a premier hostage rescue unit, as well as one of the U.S. government’s top-tier domestic direct action counter-terrorism elements. CIRG is also responsible for a host of other functions, including intelligence gathering and dissemination, crisis negotiations and management, and helping with the response to any potential large scale catastrophe. From every indication we’ve seen so far, the Black Hawks are definitely a key component of HRT’s ability to carry out these missions. With this in mind, if you look up and happen to see a largely unassuming green Black Hawk flying over your city in the future, you may be watching the FBI’s elite counter-terrorism unit conducting one of these valuable training exercises.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 5, 2019",Here’s What That Commando Laden UH-60 Black Hawk Was Doing Whipping Around Chicago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last eight hours, I have been bombarded with tips and questions regarding a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter buzzing around Chicago with fully kitted commandos hanging out of its doors and deploying on rooftops around the city. Some people were alarmed by what they were seeing and wondered if there was a crisis taking place. Others were thrilled as the special operators fast-roped from the helicopter and took up positions along high rise rooflines. A couple were even wondering if this was another Transformers movie being filmed in the city. I can definitely assure you that is not the case and that there is nothing to worry about. But that doesn’t make the spectacle any less interesting. What Chicagoans have been seeing is a training operation. I talked to the Chicago Police Department about the sightings and they told me that they were given notice that the drills would commence but would not tell me anything else, such as who was training. But it really didn’t seem like they knew if it was specifically law enforcement or military. But that’s beside the point. It is an exercise and it is not part of any operational mission. I have also reached out to the Illinois Military Department and National Guard for more details, but I have yet to hear back. The fact of the matter is that this type of thing really is not that unique—at least not on a national level. I have posted in depth before about urban terrain helicopter assault training operations that occur all across the United States on a fairly consistent basis. In fact, it has happened in Chicago before, including in 2012 : These exercises almost always involve helicopters from the elite 160th Special Operations Air Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers and Navy SEALs, Delta Force, or other top-tier counter-terror special ops units. During these unique military drills, which always draw local ire and a flurry of conspiracy theories, most of the action starts around sunset and goes late into the night. But in this case, broad daylight was the setting and it seems pretty clear that this wasn’t a Department of Defense affair. Instead, it looks like a federal operation: The UH-60M Black Hawk photographed and filmed all over Chicago does not appear to belong to the United States Army. The configuration of its antennas is unique and it does not have any Army titles or serials on it. Over the last decade, a number of UH-60s of various sub-types have been transferred from the DoD to federal agencies like the Department of Justice. The DOJ has also bought UH-60Ms by piggybacking the Army’s buys. This appears to be one of those aircraft. As for the operators themselves, their kit looks top notch. Note the four-tube, wide field of view night vision goggles made famous by the DEVGRU/SEAL Team Six mission to kill or capture on Osama Bin Laden. These are still somewhat rare pieces of equipment. The unit that put on this awesome, albeit unexpected display likely belongs to the Department of Justice’s Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG), which includes the vaunted FBI Hostage Rescue Team, also known as HRT. Now in its 35th year of existence, HRT is the nation’s top law enforcement counter-terrorism direct action unit. HRT has been deployed overseas, including as part of Joint Special Operations Command missions, but it’s best known for being on call to respond quickly to very high-risk, very high-threat scenarios. There is also the FBI’s SWAT Teams that are assigned to all 56 field offices which CIRG’s SWAT operations oversee. So the Chicago field office’s SWAT Team is probably involved in this training event as well. FBI SWAT from the Tampa field office show off their skills alongside US Special Operations Command operators at a demonstration in Tampa Harbor during SOFIC 2018. , USAF Master Sergeant Barry Lou CIRG maintains and operates a range of aviation assets, in particular, six UH-60Ms just like this one, the first of which was delivered in 2009. CIRG also provides a slew of other important functions, like explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), hazardous devices disruption (disarming nukes and countering WMD in general), crisis negotiations, intelligence dissemination, ground and air surveillance, security management for major events, crisis negotiations and much more. Basically, they are the guys and gals that prepare and are ready to literally confront the worst mankind has to offer. The need for this type of training is straightforward. Mock villages in remote locales cannot substitute for the incredible complexities of an actual dense urban environment complete with skyscrapers. As the Pentagon is moving to prepare to fight increasingly in dense urban locales, which they call ‘megacities,’ so are their federal counterparts. In fact, the terrorist’s maleficent playbook pushes them to target these areas over any other. As such, this training is absolutely essential and can’t be replicated anywhere else. So if you find yourself in a position to watch these warriors practicing their deadly arts in person then consider yourself very lucky, it is a truly rare sight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 24, 2019",The U.S. Military Is Buying These Small Interceptor Drones To Knock Down Other Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A small California-based tech startup has reportedly begun supplying small “hard kill” attack drones to the U.S. military that are designed to bring down similarly sized hostile unmanned aircraft by physically smashing into them. The market, within the United States and around the world, for counter-drone systems, ranging from electronic warfare jammers to directed energy weapons to suicide drones , has exploded in recent years as the threats that even relatively cheap and diminutive unmanned aircraft pose has become glaringly apparent . Anduril Industries unveiled what it is presently referring to simply as the “Interceptor” on Oct. 3, 2019. The company says it started delivering its system to the U.S. and U.K. militaries earlier in the year and now has a contract to support activities at an unspecified location overseas, likely as part of a field test, according to reports from Bloomberg and NBC News . Anduril has not specified what American or British military branches specifically it has been working with as part of the project or whether there are any additional foreign customers. “All the soft kill systems are a waste of time,” Palmer Luckey, on of Anduril’s co-founders, told Bloomberg in an interview. Luckey was referring to other counter-drone systems that seek to disable their targets by using electronic warfare , typically by jamming the unmanned aircraft’s links to a ground control station. The hope is that this would cause it to fall out of the sky or initiate a pre-programmed emergency function that tells it to return to the point of launch. U.S. Marines used just such a system earlier this year to knock down two Iranian drones in the Strait of Hormuz . This might have limited, if any impact on a drone, or a networked swarm of them, operating in a semi-autonomous or fully autonomous mode that does not require a constant connection with a human operator. A rendering of the Interceptor., Anduril Industries Anduril’s quad-copter Interceptor uses its own onboard electro-optical and infrared sensors to spot, track, and, as the name implies, intercept the target. An operator on the ground can watch the feed through a hand-held controller and then gives the final order to attack the threat. A full video of the Interceptor in action is available here . The sensor technology, and the computer algorithm behind it, are based on ground-based and small drone surveillance systems that Anduril has already developed since the company’s founding in 2017. Some of these earlier systems are already in service with U.S. Customs and Border Protection along America’s southwestern border with Mexico and the U.S. Marine Corps also began buying some of the firm’s existing products earlier this year, after having tested them in the past. After getting approval to attack, the Interceptor, which is “roughly the weight of a bowling ball,” typically between 10 and 16 pounds, according to NBC, smashes into the target at approximately 100 miles per hour. This is enough force to destroy the target and bring it down. “It almost always survives and returns to base,” Luckey wrote on Twitter in response to a question about whether the Interceptor was a single-use system. “But for planning purposes, it makes sense to assume one interceptor per target.” It almost always survives and returns to base, but for planning purposes, it makes sense to assume one interceptor per target. — Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) October 3, 2019 It’s not clear what particular concept of operation Anduril, or its customers, may envision for the Interceptors. Luckey says the company is already working on larger and faster versions that could potentially work against “an ultralight aircraft, or a helicopter, or a cruise missile,” according to Bloomberg . The existing design is certainly lightweight and compact enough for small units to carry them on patrols where they might encounter singular enemy unmanned aircraft and want to try to quickly neutralize them. The U.S. military has already publicly said that its bases and forward outposts in Afghanistan are under routine surveillance from insurgent-operated small drones. Non-state actors in recent years have employed small numbers of quad- and hex-copter style drones to drop improvised munitions in various hotspots around the world, including a notable attempt to assassinate Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro in 2018. State actors, such as China and Iran , are making even more impressive strides in developing these capabilities. Iranian drones were notably part of a recent pair of unprecedented attacks on oil-related sites in Saudi Arabia. Countries developing these unmanned aircraft may also then potentially proliferate these systems, or associated technologies, to their partners around the world. We have already seen this occur with the rapid expansion of the drone arsenal belonging to Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. “In the same way that the Soviets gave away boxes of AK-47s to other countries to get in bed with them, China is giving countries in Africa and Asia access to artificial intelligence technology that allows them to build totalitarian police states ,” Luckey told NBC. “And they do this because it makes these countries completely dependent on China.” The Interceptor could also be valuable for law enforcement groups who are also increasingly struggling to contend with the proliferation of small drones and the hazards they pose. In December 2018, reports of small drones flying near Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom led to mass flight cancellations and thousands of stranded airline customers during the peak holiday travel season. There have since been questions about whether any drones were actually present, to begin with, something that Anduril’s drone attacker could have been able to more rapidly discern after tracking down the purported object. A soft-kill jamming system in place at Gatwick in December 2018., AP A more robust system would be necessary if the Interceptors are to form a shield against mass drone attacks or fully-networked drone swarms operating as a single group, though. The size and autonomous operation of Anduril’s design would seem to lend itself to a configuration involving a vehicle- or trailer-mounted launcher that could rapidly launch dozens of these attack drones. Networking the Interceptors into a larger air defense system with radars and other sensors, which would provide early warning and cueing, could be necessary to truly be able to respond to swarm attacks. In 2018, the U.S. Army announced it was buying exactly this kind of system , now called Howler , based on a variant of Raytheon’s expendable Coyote drone with a small explosive warhead. This truck-mounted arrangement also includes a radar to cue the Coyotes toward their intended targets. Raytheon’s truck-mounted Howler system for the US Army., Raytheon In general, using drones to intercept other unmanned aircraft is a concept that makes good sense and it’s one that The War Zone has highlighted on multiple occasions. As our own Tyler Rogoway wrote in 2017 : “Being networked together, and being autonomous in nature after being loaded with a target area location, along with other mission parameters, these swarms will be extremely hard to defend against using even the best SHORAD [short-range air defense] systems in development today. It’s the saturation nature of the attack, the size of the attackers, and the fact that they work as a coordinated swarm, employing dynamic tactics to see as many in their company survive long enough to make their suicidal attack, that make them so deadly. They could even drop micro-munitions and be reused for a later attack. Just the knowledge that such an attack is possible would be psychologically stressful and demoralizing for troops on the ground. … “Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots.” It’s not clear how close the U.S. military, or any of Auduril’s other clients, may be to actually adopting and fielding the Interceptor system on a broad scale. The company is relatively secretive and it can be difficult just to determine the basic scope of its work for the U.S. government and others. This may be due, at least in part, to the controversial nature of Luckey, who first entered the public eye as the founder of the virtual reality company Oculus VR, which Facebook later acquired. In 2016, he left Oculus under still-murky circumstances that may have had to do with his connections to a pro-Trump political group and support for the then-presidential candidate, though Facebook has repeatedly denied this was the case. The bulk of Anduril’s other founding members also came from Palantir, a private intelligence firm with its own strong ties to the U.S. government that has been a magnet for controversy in its own right from civil liberties groups . At the time of writing, the official Federal Procurement Data System database lists just two contracts for Anduril, one with the U.S. Navy and another with the Pentagon’s Washington Headquarters Service, neither of which appear to have to do with counter-drone systems. This is despite the fact that it is well established that the firm is doing more work than that for the U.S. government, raising the question about whether deals with the company have been piggybacked onto other existing contracts or awarded through non-traditional mechanisms, such as the U.S. Military’s Other Transaction Authority . Whatever the case, the threat that Anduril has designed its system to respond to is very real and is only likely to grow as time goes on. The appearance of the Interceptor shows that more firms, large and small, are increasingly coming around to the idea of countering these hostile drones with their own suicide unmanned attackers.

Chris Harmer,"Posted on Apr 9, 2019","Top Marine’s Force Changing Plans Prompt Talk Of Smaller Ships, F-35 Buy Changes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month we published a review of Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger’s strategic guidance, which called for a significant modernization in Marine Corps amphibious doctrine. While we concurred with his premise, that modern detection and targeting systems combined with long-range precision-guided weapons like anti-ship ballistic missiles and high-speed anti-ship cruise missiles, make an amphibious landing in anything other than a relatively permissive environment extremely risky, we were quick to point out that his guidance did not yet have a lot of detail. Recent developments have started to fill in the characteristics and features that will turn his overall plans into a definable, new doctrine regarding how Marines will conduct regularly scheduled rotational deployments and how they will fight during a time of war. While no major procurement plans or budgets have been announced, several recent developments do indicate that the new strategic guidance is influencing and expanding future procurement options. Offshore Support Vessel As first reported by the USNI News, the Navy and Marine Corps are considering procuring relatively small Offshore Support Vessels (OSV) to supplement the existing fleet of large amphibious assault vessels that the Navy currently operates to support rotational deployments of Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). While the Marines have tinkered with alternate forms of deployment, like doing experimental short-term exercises on Military Sealift Command cargo ships,  the basic model of operating from amphibious assault ships will be the norm until the Navy and Marine Corps procure something significantly different than what they currently have. Regarding the OSV, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) previously developed and procured two 60 meter OSVs for the Iraqi Navy. These vessels are a cross between patrol boats and logistical support ships, capable of carrying troops, cargo, and in the case of the Iraqi Navy OSVs, servicing oil platforms. The lessons learned from already having designed and procured two hulls for the Iraqi Navy would certainly inform the process if the Navy and Marine Corps decide to go ahead and buy this platform. Iraqi navy Al Basra-class offshore support vessel Al Basra (OSV 401)., USN OSV Supplements, Not Replaces, Amphibious Fleet Based on the size and range of the OSV, it would probably operate in close cooperation with the existing fleet of amphibious assault ships. In other words, it would supplement and expand the existing operational model, rather than replace it. In this concept, the amphibious assault ships would still hold the bulk of the Marines and their equipment, then transfer Marines and equipment to the OSV for forward operations. At first glance, this might seem like a concept of operations similar to what US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has developed with the MV Ocean Trader . Originally built as a commercial vessel, the vessel was purchased by Military Sealift Command (MSC) and highly modified to support special operations personnel operating smaller craft, such as the Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) or the Combat Craft Assault (CCA) . A number of other small surface craft designs could also potentially be operated from this platform. With that said, MV Ocean Trader and the OSV are fundamentally different platforms. At over 20,000 tons displacement, the MV Ocean Trader is a high-capacity, long-range, and long-endurance platform supporting special operations at sea. It’s just smaller than the USS San Antonio (LPD-17), the lead ship in the Navy’s newest class of amphibious assault ships. In contrast, the OSV displaces under 1,000 tons and has a much shorter range. The most likely operational concept for OSV is not as a mothership, but as a primary platform executing a distributed concept of operations, which was one of General Berger’s points of emphasis in his planning guidance. By using numerous smaller and less identifiable platforms, like the OSV, the Navy and Marine Corps intend to complicate a potential enemy’s detection, tracking, and defensive problems. Amphibious assault ships are large and have a unique appearance. OSVs or a similar platform are much smaller, and less readily identifiable as uniquely military platforms. It’s also possible that vessels similar to the Ocean Trader could eventually find their way into the Marines’ maritime combat playbook and they could help enlarge the ‘Gator Navy’ fleet and allow it to operate more flexibly. You could buy multiple Ocean Traders for the cost of a single San Antonio class ship. This would allow Marines to be in more places at once given a set budget. With that said, regardless of how the operational and deployment models shake out in the long run, it’s clear the Navy and Marine Corps are looking at a wide array of smaller surface ships that will supplement the existing amphibious assault ship fleet without divesting or replacing it—at least for now. M/V Ocean Trader packing CCAs., DAVID KOZDRON Marine Corps Weapons Experimentation And Development The Marines have been pushing hard to develop smaller, lighter, more mobile weapons systems, like mini rocket systems that can be transported inside a MV-22 Osprey or CH-53K helicopter. This trend seems tailor-made to provide firepower to a vessel like the OSV, which would probably come equipped with minimal offensive capability of its own. The new Marine philosophy seems focused on procuring or modifying weapons systems that they can take with them, regardless of what vessel or platform they are on. An example of this is the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Originally developed for the US Army, the Marines procured HIMARS with the intent of transporting the system onboard ship as cargo, then moving it ashore to operate it as a mobile truck-mounted rocket launching platform. With the new focus on modifying their existing weapons systems to operate from whatever ship they happen to be on at the moment, the Marines recently demonstrated the ability to fire the HIMARS from sea, with the rocket launcher simply chained to the deck of an amphibious assault ship. The same HIMARS launcher is also capable of firing Deep Strike , which could range far beyond previous range limitations now that we are in the post INF era. Another possibility for the OSV is the Navy’s new Adaptive Deck Launcher (ADL) that’s designed to be a bolt-on, highly-flexible missile launcher that can be easily mounted on a ship with enough deck space to host it. For certain missions, this could turn a smaller patrol ship into a high-end ‘shooter.’ HIMARS firing off the stern of USS Anchorage , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock., USN Adjusting The F-35 Buy The OSV is not the only indication that the Marine Corps is adapting to General Berger’s new vision. As reported by Aviation Week and Space Technology, the Marines are adjusting the mix of F-35B and F-35C airframes they plan to procure. The F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant optimized to operate from amphibious assault ships, and the F-35C is the carrier variant that the USMC would also use from land bases, like their Hornets. While the total number of Marine F-35 airframes to be procured remains steady at 420, Marine Corps Headquarters is preparing to reduce the F-35B and increase the F-35C buy. As it sits today, 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs are to be procured. Although nothing official has been announced yet, if this happens it is one possible sign the Marine Corps is shifting emphasis away from the amphibious assault ship centric planning model that has reigned for at least the last several decades. The F-35Bs were always going to replace some of the Marines’ Hornet squadrons, but just how many F-35Cs will be procured going forward could be a major tell as to what the USMC sees its future STOVL needs being. Introduction ceremony for the F-35C by VMFA-314. , USMC Contracted Support In Lieu Of Acquisition Even before the Navy and Marine Corps opened up these procurement options for discussion in response to General Berger’s guidance, the Marines were experimenting with how to accelerate deployment of capabilities outside normal procurement channels. As an example of this, the Navy announced last year that it had awarded a contract to General Atomics to provide, maintain, and operate its own MQ-9 Reaper drones in support of a Marine Corps task force in Afghanistan. To be clear, this contract was only intended to provide surveillance and reconnaissance support, and not armed strike in support of Marines. Still, it is a significant indicator in terms of how the Marines intend to get critical capabilities to the front lines without going through the lengthy formal process to establish and fund a program of record. In any case, the Marines are clearly experimenting not only with new ways to get capabilities to forward-deployed personnel outside of the standard procurement system. A civilian registered MQ-9 Reaper. , USAF Would Contracted Maritime Capabilities Work? Using contractors instead of uniformed personnel to deploy capabilities is a model that might also extend to the new maritime construct. In the same way that it is quicker and easier for a contractor like General Atomics to put together a deployment package of drones to support Marines in Afghanistan than it is for the Marine Corps to build that capability into a Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), it might also be easier for the Marine Corps to contract some maritime support on the open market. So far, all we have seen the Marine Corps do in this vein is deploy smaller units onboard US Military Sealift Command (MSC) ships. One factor that has to be considered with respect to contracted maritime support is the lack of self-defense capabilities. A prime example of this is the fate of the High-Speed Vessel Two (HSV-2) Swift, which MSC leased for ten years from 2003-2013. During that time, Swift was used for special operations support, logistics, humanitarian assistance, and foreign partnership exercises. In short, Swift showed the ability to flex to a variety of missions, which is exactly what the Marines are looking for in ship platforms that will allow them to expand beyond the amphibious assault ship model of deployment. Unfortunately, Swift was badly damaged while transiting the Red Sea as a result of an attack by Houthis rebels based in Yemen. The fate of Swift is not dispositive, but it does show that at least some of the dangers that inspired General Berger to move the Marine Corps away from its traditional amphibious doctrine might also apply to smaller, non-traditional ships as well as amphibious assault ships, and especially largely defenseless ones. The Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport ship USNS Carson City (T-EPF7)., USN Show Me The Money At this point, it might be reasonable to ask how the Navy and Marine Corps are going to pay to expand their capabilities beyond the core fleet of amphibious assault ships. As described in the USNI News reporting we linked to at the beginning of this article, during a panel as part of Modern Day Marine 2019, Frank DiGiovanni, the deputy director of expeditionary warfare on the Chief of Naval Operations staff, made it clear that Navy and Marine Corps strategists were looking at the OSV and other options as additive to the existing fleet of amphibious assault ships, and not as a replacement for them. That answer is adequate for the time being, because the OSV and other options are just items for discussion at this point. Nothing has been formally proposed, Congress has not yet marked up the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), so there is no budget or timeline for procuring these assets at this point. With that said, sooner or later Navy and Marine Corps leadership will have to provide specific plans, budgets, and timelines regarding the size and composition of the additional capabilities like the OSV that will expand the deployment options for the Marine Corps beyond the current capabilities of the existing amphibious assault ship fleet. Unless there is net growth in the Navy budget, which seems highly unlikely, those new small ships will have to be funded by reducing some other line item in the Navy budget. The most obvious solution seems to be to reduce the rate at which new amphibious assault ships are procured. Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps, talks to Marines., USMC The Next Checkpoint The Navy is currently conducting the 2019 Force Structure Assessment (FSA). It is due to be released by the end of 2019, perhaps earlier. The 2016 FSA established the Navy’s end strength goal of 355 commissioned warships, including 38 amphibious assault ships. General Berger’s guidance from earlier this summer said that “We will no longer reference the 2016 Force Structure Assessment as the basis for our arguments and force structure justifications.” It seems reasonable to assume that the 2019 FSA will incorporate and formalize General Berger’s strategic guidance. Navy and Marine Corps leadership should be commended for proactively engaging in a very difficult strategic reassessment of the roles and missions of the Marine Corps and support provided by the Navy’s amphibious assault ship fleet. The 2019 FSA will inevitably contain much more detail about what comes next for the Navy and Marine Corps with respect to supporting rotational deployments, the amphibious assault ship fleet, and new platforms and capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 20, 2019",U.S. Intelligence Agency Eyes The Navy’s MQ-25 Drone For Maritime Surveillance Missions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, or NGA, wants to know if Boeing could transform the MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone that it is developing for the U.S. Navy into an unmanned maritime intelligence platform using a modular sensor pod. This highlights continued interest within the Navy, and elsewhere in the U.S. military, in utilizing the Stringray, a test article for which flew for the first time just last month , for missions beyond just aerial refueling. NGA awarded the sole-source contract to Boeing’s Phantom Works advanced projects division, the value of which is not disclosed, on Sept. 27, 2019, but only announced it had done so three days later on the U.S. government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps. Under the deal, which Aviation Week was first to report , Phantom Works will conduct a study into what it would take to integrate “NGA’s Maritime Program capability” into the MQ-25, as well as the manned P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, via Boeing’s proprietary Multi-Mission Pod (MMP), according to a so-called Justification and Approval document. U.S. government agencies need to submit this type of document when requesting authority to give a contract directly to a specific company or companies without going through a competitive bidding process. “The MQ-25 itself is still in early development containing much Boeing proprietary information,” the Justification and Approval , which NGA lawyers and contracting officers cleared between May and June 2019, explains. “Only the suggested source can perform the study as required, to the exclusion of other sources, because Boeing is the direct manufacturer of the system and maintains the unique intellectual knowledge of these systems.” Boeing first announced it was working on the MMP as a private venture specifically for the P-8A in 2016. At the time, the company said that the pod, which it had flight tested twice already, would incorporate signals intelligence systems (SIGINT) and added communications and data sharing equipment, among other capabilities. This sounds very much like a pod with a dense antenna farm that appeared underneath a P-8A testbed in 2015. The Navy’s Poseidons already have powerful SIGINT and other intelligence-gathering capabilities, which you can read about in more detail here . A US Navy P-8A Posiedon maritime patrol aircraft., USN The contracting document does not offer any insight into how Boeing might integrate the MMP onto the MQ-25. The company does plan to equip the Stingray with underwing hardpoints to support the Cobham aerial refueling pods required for the tanking mission, which could potentially accommodate an external sensor system. A Boeing computer-generated rendering of an MQ-25 with a Cobham aerial refueling pod under its left wing and a regular drop tank under its right wing., Boeing An addition, the unmanned aircraft’s design is a direct evolution of the one Phantom Works had developed for the Navy’s abortive Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS ) program. That effort, which the service subsequently abandoned in favor of an aerial refueling focused drone, envisioned a true unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that would carry munitions inside internal payload bays. It might be possible to insert a MMP into that payload space in a way where it flush with or semi-recessed in the fuselage, similar in general concept to the installation of the Pave Tack targeting pod on the F-111 Aardvark . The exact configuration would no doubt depend on exactly what capabilities NGA is interested in inserting into the MQ-25. There is no clear public reference to a “Maritime Program” on NGA’s website, but the agency is responsible for a Maritime Safety Information program . Despite its mundane name, this division’s mission is to “provide global maritime geospatial intelligence in support of national security objectives, including safety of navigation, international obligations, and joint military operations,” according to NGA’s website . This includes collecting and fusing intelligence relating to maritime threats to military and commercial vessels, from terrorists and pirates , as well as nation-state actors . Tracking other types of hazards and maintaining accurate nautical charts for U.S. military and civilian use are also among NGA’s Maritime Safety Office’s jobs. As such, the most likely sensor payloads that NGA would want to integrate into the MQ-25 would be wide-area surveillance systems capable of capturing either still imagery or full-motion video, day or night. The drone will already have a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, giving it some ability to find and fix targets of interest. The pod could include additional optical sensors or radar or laser imaging systems . An inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) with geo-location and ground moving target indicator functionality could be particularly useful for the maritime surveillance mission. The AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye radar pod and the AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), which are already in service with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army respectively, are good existing examples of what a sensor system like this could offer. A view of the feed from an AN/ZPY-5 VADER radar imaging system, with the red and green tracks representing moving targets. , DHS However, it’s unclear whether the MQ-25 would have the altitude and range performance typically associated with these types of broad area missions. The Navy, for instance, is focused on fielding a manned-unmanned team of P-8As and MQ-4C Triton high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aircraft to meet its own similar maritime intelligence and surveillance needs. The service has already been employing older, ex-U.S. Air Force Block 10 RQ-4A Global Hawks, known as Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrators (BAMS-D), in this role. Iran notably shot down one of these unmanned aircraft in the Gulf of Oman in June. An overview of the MQ-4C Triton’s capabilities., Northrop Grumman That being said, the Navy has itself envisioned a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance role for the Stringray, even after abandoning the more robust UCAV requirements it had outlined in the original UCLASS program. When the service officially asked to change the future unmanned aircraft’s designation from RAQ-25A to MQ-25A in 2016, this is how it described the ISR requirements in the request packet, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act: “The UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] is envisioned to be an integral part of the future CVW [Carrier Air Wing]. During periods of flight when it is not executing the tanking mission, the UAS will be available for ISR tasking. As an ISR asset, it will provide the CSG [Carrier Strike Group] commander an organic, long-endurance ISR capability. It will be capable of providing Maritime Domain Awareness via SIGINT [Signals Intelligence], AIS [Automatic Identification System], and EO/IR [electro-optical/infrared]. The UAS will also be capable of performing dedicated ISR missions in support of the joint, component, or task force commander. Sensors will be controlled from the CVN-based [carrier-based] UMCS [Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control System] and by various work stations afloat or ashore depending upon the type sensor. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) control will be accomplished based on the DSO NTTP [Defensive Systems Operator Navy Tactical Techniques and Procedures]. Based on the data collected from its sensors, the UAS will be capable of transmitting and receiving tactical data link tracks, with associated processing and exploitation capabilities afloat (airborne, surface, and sub-surface) or ashore.” USN via FOIA USN via FOIA It is possible then, that NGA may be simply interested in inserting some more limited maritime surveillance capabilities on the MQ-25, and then linking it more directly to its own networks, as part of a more distributed means of acquiring maritime intelligence. The would allow carrier strike groups in the future to be regularly feeding a variety of data, including just basic mapping information to help with maintaining nautical charts, back to NGA during routine operations, as well as those in support of responses to actual crises or contingencies. The inclusion of SIGINT in the Stingray’s potential ISR capabilities could similarly lead the Navy to incorporate the drone into its plans for replacing its EP-3E Aries II aircraft. The service has already stated that it intends to supplant those ISR planes with a mix of P-8As and MQ-4Cs. Giving Carrier Strike Groups additional organic SIGINT capacity that personnel afloat or ashore could immediately process and exploit, as well as disseminate onward to other U.S. military or Intelligence Community elements, could only help American commanders get a more complete picture of activity within their area of operations. As The War Zone has highlighted before , the Navy’s decision to abandon the UCLASS effort has long seemed like a particularly egregious missed opportunity . Still, the decision to choose an MQ-25 design directly based on one of those earlier proposals only left the door open for potentially reinserting capabilities more in line with a UCAV down the line. NGA’s new contract with Boeing shows that various elements within the U.S. military are already looking at additional roles and missions for the Stingray, even with the unmanned aircraft still in the early stages of development.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 14, 2019","No, Bell’s Invictus Armed Scout Helicopter Isn’t Stealth But It Aims To Be Fast And Cheap","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bell has unveiled its much-anticipated offering for the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) tender, an initiative that seeks to replace some of the Army’s AH-64 Apache attack helicopters as well as better fulfill the mission left somewhat underserved by the early retirement of the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. Bell has branded this new design the “360 Invictus.” The storied helicopter manufacturer made somewhat of an unconventional move by going with a conventional helicopter configuration, one based its 525 Relentless next-generation medium-twin engine model, instead of pursuing a more exotic concept in order to meet the program’s threshold speed of 180 knots, among other requirements. Bell said it could meet FARA’s demands and do so at a lower cost and with lower risk than its more complex and unorthodox competitors, such as a design based on Sikorsky’s S-97 Raider and AVX and L3’s design , by sticking with a classic helicopter layout. Now we know just how they intend to do this and what such a flying machine will look like. First off, I know what you are thinking—is this a stealth helicopter? In other words, was low observability a primary driver in its design? Many are comparing it to the RAH-66 Comanche looks-wise, but even though it may look similar, sources close to the program have assured us that the design came to be primarily to reduce drag and increase top-speed, not to hide from enemy radars. Signature control is a significant part of most combat aircraft designs these days, but in this case, it came secondary to performance. This wasn’t just Bell making a design choice, low-observability is not part of the FARA requirements, and it’s not like Bell doesn’t have the know-how when it comes to infusing stealth aspects even into its existing designs . In fact, certain aspects of foreign designs look somewhat similar to Bell’s Invictus, such as China’s Z-10 , which is not a “stealth” helicopter, either. RAH-66 Comanche during flight testing., Sikorsky The 360 Invictus is definitely a modern take on the classic attack helicopter configuration, with its tandem, stepped cockpits, single rotor, and fenestron. But it seems that Bell poured a ton of pointed optimization into this design and a lot of new technology that could fit within the somewhat classical attack helicopter mold. The biggest being its propulsion system. It uses a single General Electric turbine in the 3,000hp class, that is mounted offset to one side. The air intake is also only on one side and the exhaust is on the other. The primary engine is geared with some sort of supplemental power unit that provides extra power when needed to give the helicopter the dash capability demanded under the FARA requirements. It will be interesting to learn more about what exactly this secondary propulsion unit is and what difference in performance it makes when it is engaged and when it isn’t. Also, questions like how long it can run, what does it do to the aircraft’s range and fuel consumption, and even its infrared signature, are also important. At this time, Bell is sharing very little about it beyond the fact that it exists as part of the 360’s configuration. The 360 Invictus has a lift-sharing clean wing that reduces the load on the main rotor in forward flight and helps with the helicopter’s high maneuverability. The main rotor has an aerodynamic shroud and is articulated with ‘high flapping’ capability that helps with high-speed flight, as well. It shares a lot of commonality with the rotor on the 525 Relentless, but it has four blades instead of five. To counter torque, the Invictus has a fenestron that is slightly tilted to reduce drag and increase thrust. Continuing with the airframe efficiency focus, the design has retractable landing gear, as well. Its flight control system also builds off of the 525’s very advanced fly-by-wire system , which has the potential to cut down pilot workload dramatically and can be leveraged for autonomous, unmanned operations in the future. The avionics all run on Collins Aerospace’s open architecture concept (Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) enabled by a Digital Backbone) so upgrades and enhancements will be very easy to realize, both in terms of adding new software and hardware, to the airframe. Bell When it comes to sensors, Bell just says that the helicopter is “provisioned for enhanced situational awareness and sensor technologies.” You can use your imagination here, but suffice it to say that sensors will be among the most important elements of any FARA entrant. The concept art shows a multi-role FLIR sensor on the helicopter’s nose and missile approach warning sensors (MAWS) and/or distributed aperture system (DAS) apertures scattered around its fuselage. Survivability will largely be gained through speed, situational awareness, advanced electronic warfare capabilities and countermeasures, and new weapons when it comes to the Army’s future armed scout helo. As far as those weapons, the aircraft is seen with a 20mm cannon, similar to what arms the mature AH-1 Cobra family of helicopters. In fact, the Army has contracted General Dynamics to supply its XM915 20mm cannon that is derived from the one once intended for the Comanche for all FARA participants. Beyond that, its weapons will be carried internally in its primary configuration on launchers that can both fire missiles and drop unpowered glide and gravity weapons. Bell describes this as an “integrated munitions launcher with ability to integrate air-launched effects, and future weapons, as well as current inventory of munitions.” The helicopter’s stub wings are also able to carry weapons, as well. Let’s talk about performance. Details remain pretty thin, but Bell says the 360 Invictus will be able to reach speeds in excess 185 knots and it will be able to hover in ground effect (low over the ground) at 4,000 feet elevation in 95-degree Fahrenheit heat. As far as projected range, a 135 nautical mile combat radius with better than 90 minutes on station once at its target area is what Bell is positing for the design. Bell Textron’s official announcement reads in part: Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) company, has announced a new rotorcraft, Bell 360 Invictus, as the company’s entrant for the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Competitive Prototype program. Bell’s innovative approach to designing the Bell 360 Invictus combines proven low-risk technologies with advanced processes to deliver soldiers an affordable, agile and lethal solution to win on the modern battlefield. The Bell 360 Invictus meets or exceeds all requirements as laid out under the FARA contract. “The Bell 360 will deliver advanced battlefield situational awareness, as well as lethal options, in support of the maneuver force at an affordable cost” said Vince Tobin, executive vice president of Military Business at Bell. “The multi-domain fight will be complex, and our team is delivering a highly capable, low-risk solution to confidently meet operational requirements with a sustainable fleet.” The Bell 360 Invictus’ design emphasizes exceptional performance using proven technologies to fulfill the Army’s FARA requirements at an affordable cost and on schedule. One example is the Invictus’ rotor system. This design is based on Bell’s 525 Relentless rotor system which has been tested and proven at speeds in excess of 200 Knots True Air Speed (KTAS). By incorporating proven designs and the best available technologies from commercial and military programs, Bell delivers a low-risk path to a FARA program of record. … “Bell is committed to providing the U.S. Army with the most affordable, most sustainable, least complex, and lowest risk solution among the potential FARA configurations, while meeting all requirements,” said Keith Flail, vice president of Advanced Vertical Lift Systems at Bell. “360 Invictus is an exciting opportunity for us to continue our support of Army modernization. This is the next solution to ensure soldiers have the best equipment available for the multi-domain fight.” Bell has decades of experience providing attack and reconnaissance aircraft to the warfighter, such as the Kiowa Warrior which delivered high reliability and availability through more than 850,000 flight hours. The Bell 360 Invictus design builds from that legacy, Bell’s commercial innovations, and from the success in the development and manufacturing capabilities required for Future Vertical Lift (FVL) as part of the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR TD) over the past six years. It is pretty amazing what Bell is looking to pull off here. Just as our original analysis stated , it is abundantly clear that Bell’s FARA team believes that offering the Army a relatively low-cost, low-risk solution to a fairly complex set of requirements is the winning ticket. Where other competitors, such as Sikorsky, will likely provide capabilities far in excess of FARA’s base requirements, those technologies could very well come at an additional cost, both in terms of the purchase price and operating costs. They also come with uncertainty. Traditionally, armed scout helicopters are reliable, simpler airframes than their heavy-hitting attack helicopte r brethren. Currently, when you look at the other offerings, FARA presents the possibility that this tradition will be flipped on its head, at least for a period of time, until—and if—the Army procures an attack helicopter based on the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative . The Invictus design is also reminicent of Bell and Boeing’s Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) concepts from the 1980s., Bell/Boeing Bell/Boeing The big question is what will the Army actually be willing to spend on an individual capability-set it largely abandoned when it retired the Kiowa Warrior and rolled it into the AH-64 Apache’s repertoire? With so many other major priorities—Future Vertical Lift being a huge one of them—is the Army really going to invest in hundreds of ‘exquisite’ scout helicopters? Even the survivability of any of these less than stealthy helicopters over a modern battlefield is being questioned by some, rightfully so. Do an extra 50 knots or so of speed really buy survivability? Will other technologies provide robust enough defenses for these helicopters to make them truly employable in contested airspace? We will give you our take on these questions and more soon, but the fact that they exist does make Bell’s approach to the FARA tender more relevant. If Bell can deliver a low-risk design at a substantially lower price than their counterparts, will the Army be willing to spend far more money on what may not even be a realistically employable concept in higher threat environments to begin with? There is also the looming defense budget question. What happens if—or as I believe, when—the defense budget retracts after growing substantially over the past few years? What will be sacrificed? Bell may find itself in a unique and very favorable position to offer a baseline capability at low enough cost to mean the difference between program cancellation and acquisition. Beyond these uncertainties, one thing is for sure, the fight for FARA is officially heating up. In all, Bell, Sikorsky, Boeing, AVX and L3, and a consortium of Karem, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon, will be competing for the FARA prize.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 19, 2019",This High-Speed Amphibious Armored Vehicle Could Race Russia’s Naval Infantry Ashore,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s top tank producer, UralVagonZavod, has developed a concept for a new amphibious tracked armored vehicle, called the BMMP, for the country’s naval infantry units. The modular design would be a marine compliment to other recent Russian armor developments, including the T-14 tank and the Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicle, and comes amid Kremlin plans for new amphibious assault ships . Earlier in May 2018, an undated Russian-language powerpoint presentation appeared online detailing the BMMP concept. OmskTransMash , a subsidiary of UralVagonZavod , is reportedly primarily responsible for the development of the vehicle. The briefing is no longer available from the original source, but Archive.org has mirrored a significant portion of the document. UralVagonZavod’s brief says Russia needs to replace its “inferior” amphibious vehicles to keep pace with development in other countries, specifically citing the U.S. Marine Corps’ now-canceled Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV), the Chinese ZBD 2000 , and the Italian Arisgator as examples of advanced developments. At present, Russian naval infantry units rely primarily on wheeled BTR-80 and BTR-82AM armored personnel carriers for mobility and fire support. UralVagonZavod noted that these often have trouble in soft sand or snow once they hit land. Russia’s naval infantry also have tanks and tracked self-propelled artillery, but these vehicles require landing ships and craft to bring them directly to the beachhead. The brief also mentions the tracked BMP-3F infantry fighting vehicles, which has additional modifications to improve its performance in the water specifically for amphibious operations where it has to swim from ships offshore to the beach. Though it remains another potential option and is in service in Indonesia, Russia has not actually bought any of these vehicles. A rendering of the BMMP without its tracks., UralVagonZavod The new BMMP would use a common tracked chassis that would offer good mobility on land combined with water jets to propel the streamlined vehicle at high speeds in the water. When it enters the water, the crew would extend a retractable bow plane in the front and deploy a blade at the rear to improve handling. It only takes 40 seconds to extend or retract these components, according to a report from Jane’s . At present, the Chinese ZBD 2000 is the only such vehicle in active service anywhere in the world to use a similar propulsion method paired with a hull design optimized for amphibious operations. After the U.S. Marines scrapped the EFV program in 2011 due to delays and cost overruns, the service changed course and began pursuing a new wheeled amphibious vehicle and upgrades for existing tracked AAV7-series types . The underlying impetus for vehicles such as the ZBD 2000 and the EFV is the increasing range of shore-based defenses , particularly anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, along with their associated sensors. In any future amphibious operation, ships will have to deploy forces increasingly further away from the beach in order to better defend themselves and their supporting surface and air elements from those weapons or avoid their reach altogether. At the same time, then, this means that amphibious vehicles and landing craft will have further to travel and slower vehicles would be inherently more vulnerable during that trip, if they can even make it at all. The video below shows China’s ZBD 2000 amphibious vehicle in action. UralVagonZavod says the BMMP would be able to reach speeds of faster than 45 miles per hour on land and over 20 miles per hour on the water. Once ashore, it will be able to carry 10 troops up to almost 100 miles. The vehicles would be able to operate in almost any weather, including Arctic conditions at temperatures below negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The Russia design would be slower at sea that the ZBD 2000, but faster ashore. More importantly, it would be nearly four times faster than the BTR-80s and -82s and BMP-3Fs on the water with a comparable top speed after hitting the beach. However, it’s not clear if this performance is representative of the new Russian design in all of its different potential configurations. The briefing also suggests that UralVagonZavod may be considering multiple different starting places for the underlying vehicle, as well. A slide showing a number of potential BMMP-based vehicles., UralVagonZavod The concept art shows designs with five and six wheels on each side. RussiaDefence.com noted that this could indicate plans to use at least some of the chassis components from the in-production BMP-4M airborne infantry fighting vehicle or the newer Kurganets-25 . This would make good sense since a significant number of common components, including those already available, would help reduce development risk and production costs. It could also simplify some logistics, training, and maintenance requirements, making the system cheaper to sustain overall. The main infantry fighting vehicle variant of the BMMP, as well as scout and command vehicle versions, would have a three-person crew and use a common unmanned turret, according to UralVagonZavod. Called Kinzhal – not to be confused with Russia’s new air-launched ballistic missile – this weapon system appears similar to the AU-220M Baikal turret and looks to use the same 57mm automatic cannon. It also has a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun and numerous sighting systems, which likely include image magnification and night-vision capabilities to spot and engage targets at extended ranges and at night. UralVagonZavod also says the vehicle as a whole will have digital fire control and other mission systems. UralVagonZavod claims the weapon system can fire a variety of point- and proximity-detonating rounds that can engage vehicles and troops on the ground, unmanned vehicles and low-flying helicopters in the air, and even small watercraft near the shore. It is also able to shoot a gun-fired guided anti-tank missile, reportedly able to strike targets more than nine miles away. A slide showing the various targets the BMMP would reportedly be able to engage with the Kinzhal turret and at what ranges., UralVagonZavod The briefing suggests that various other manned and unmanned turrets would work on the BMMP, as well. These could include the weapon system found on the BMP-3, which has a 100mm gun and a 30mm automatic cannon, and a design from the Impulse-2 Scientific and Technical Center armed with a 30mm cannon and six anti-tank guided missiles. Turretless BMMPs could perform more specialized tasks, such as electronic warfare or carrying mortars and other heavy weapon teams. UralVagonZavod says the platform might even be able to carry a larger turret with a 125mm gun or a more purpose-built air defense system. Various different potential turret options from the BMMP. The weapon system from the BMP-3 is at the upper left corner and the Impulse-2 turret is at the upper right. The Kinzhal is in between., UralVagonZavod The briefing says that OmskTransMash could finish the initial development of the vehicle by the end of 2019 and have prototypes ready to go between 2020 and 2022. Serial production of the final vehicle would then begin in 2023. This schedule would be in line with Russia’s goal of having new Lavina -class amphibious assault ships before 2025. The Krylov State Research Center in St. Petersburg says these vessels will displace approximately 24,000 tons and be able to carry up to 50 main battle tanks and other armored vehicles and 500 naval infantrymen. At present, Project 11770 or Project 02510 landing craft would have to ferry those vehicles ashore. Adding the BMMPs to the force could allow the ships to more rapidly deploy forces and do so from a safer distance offshore. The Lavina project is a replacement for Russian plans to purchase French Mistral -class ships . That deal collapsed after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. A model of the future Lavina -class amphibious assault ship., Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia The BMMPs could also help expand the capabilities of Russia’s smaller landing ships . Combined with those ships, their speed might improve the Russian military’s ability to conduct shorter-range amphibious missions in constrained waterways, such as the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea , as well as for more limited operations in remote regions, such as the Arctic . But, as is the case with many of Russia’s military development and procurement plans, it’s unclear whether the country will be able to afford either the Lavinas or a substantial number of BMMPs in the near future. As a result of international sanctions due to the Kremlin’s intervention in Ukraine and its support for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, among other international disputes , the country’s economy has contracted and so has its defense budget . Just when it comes to armored vehicle development, the BMMPs would be competing for limited resources against a host of other new developments, including the T-14 tank , the T-15 heavy infantry fighting vehicle, the BMPT Terminator fire support vehicle, and the Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicle, among others. Russia’s 2015 State Armaments Program originally outlined plans to have some 2,300 T-14s would be in service by 2020 . At present, true mass production of those vehicles isn’t supposed to even begin until 2020 . A BMPT armored fire support vehicle., Vitaly Kuzmin That’s not even taking into account a flurry of other expensive, high-priority projects, including the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet, Tu-160M2 bomber , A-100 airborne early warning aircraft, and any of a number of advanced strategic weapons . Russia has already canceled one new ballistic missile project to focus those resources on nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicles . Russia’s naval infantry have already historically been low on the list when it comes to recieving new equipment. It’s possible that the Kremlin might be able to further reduce the BMMPs cost by offering them to foreign buyers. It’s unclear how many other countries have a need for such an advanced amphibious vehicle and would be interested in a Russian-designed system. One obvious potential customer would be Egypt. Not only has it formed growing ties with Russia in recent years , it swooped in to buy the Mistral -class ships after France canceled the Kremlin’s order. Other countries are also expanding their amphibious fleets and associated capabilities , but they might be more likely to turn to American or European sources for armored vehicles to go along with them. All told, it seems likely that OmskTransMash will proceed with the basic development of the BMMP, but how many actual vehicles it builds and in how many variants remains to be seen. Correction: While UralVagonZavod briefing mentions the BMP-3F among the vehicles presently available to Russia’s naval infantry units, the Kremlin has not actually procured any of these for its own forces.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2018",This High-Speed Special Operations Boat Used By Navy SEALs Can Now Be Yours,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you’re looking to stand out at the local yacht club, rescue your friends from pirates, or just be prepared to launch a raid on a small island somewhere, you might be interested in buying this ex-U.S. Navy Mk V Special Operations Craft, or SOC. VT Halter Marine built these high-speed waterjet-propelled boats in the late 1990s for the Navy’s elite Special Boat Teams , who work closely with the SEALs, but the service has since replaced them with improved Combatant Craft Mediums , or CCMs. The General Services Administration (GSA) is currently auctioning off this Mk V, which is presently sitting at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC Panama City), in Florida. The current bid is just $52,100 for the 82-foot long aluminum-hulled boat, which originally cost the Navy millions of dollars to buy, though this offer does not yet meet an unspecified reserve price for a final sale. The boat’s two MTU 12V396 TE94 diesel engines and its pair of Kamewa 50-511 waterjets “are reported to be operational; however, this is not a guarantee,” according to the GSA listing. The auction listing does note that this Mk V went through a routine maintenance availability in October 2017, which is relatively recent. This propulsion system is the core of the Mk V and gives it a serious top speed in excess of 50 knots , or more than 57 miles per hour, and a range of around 250 miles. To go along with performance, which can result in the boat slapping violently up and down on top of the waves at high speed, the SOC has shock-mitigating seats in its main cabin. These are also part of the package GSA is offering. A view of one of the Mk V’s two MTU 12V396 TE94s., GSA In addition, the buyer will get the boat’s Furuno navigation system, which includes a surface search radar, GPS, and a depth sounder, as well as a VHF radio and a Northern Lights PSL 1515 16 kilowatt generator. GSA is throwing in the boat’s microwave, too. You can see the full list of what the package includes below. GSA You will have to deal with a dent in the starboard side of the bow and the soft canopy that covers part of the cabin. Things like weapon mounts, and weapons to go on them, or any of the specialized sensors, communications, and data sharing equipment the boat once had are also, and not surprisingly, missing from the deal entirely. But any buyer still needs to submit an End User Certificate to actually buy the boat, which retains a distinctly military character. A US Navy Mk V SOC at speed., USN The Navy hired VT Halter Marine to design the Mk V in 1994, with the goal of replacing supplementing and supplanting a variety of earlier special operations watercraft that it had acquired in the decades following the Vietnam War. The Mississippi-headquartered shipbuilder has constructed a number of these earlier boats itself, including the smaller kevlar-hulled Mk Mod 2 High Speed Assault Craft . VT Halter Marine also worked together with United States Marine, Inc. (USMI) on many of these projects and two companies collaborated on the development of the Mk V, which occurred at a very accelerated pace. The Navy received the first SOC in September 1995, 18 months after issuing the original contract. The service eventually bought 20 Mk Vs with an average unit cost of around $3.7 million . The Mk Vs had a standard crew of six individuals and space to accommodate a typical complement of 16 SEALs. The boat has a relatively low profile when cruising at lower speeds, which made it a valuable tool for sneaking SEALs close to shore in low-to-medium threat environments and recovering them after their mission. “The MK V SOC is fundamentally a single sortie system with a 24-hour turn-around time. The typical MK V SOC mission duration is 12 hours,” according to one 2008 U.S. Special Operations Command handbook . “An MK V SOC detachment consists of two craft and support equipment and is deployable on two USAF C-5 aircraft into the gaining theater within 48 hours of notification.” Personnel unload an Mk V SOC from a US Air Force C-5 cargo plane., USN A ramp at the back could launch rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIB), jet skis , or even a Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) mini-submarine , allowing the boat to remain further from shore during insertions and extractions, if necessary. This also meant that the Mk V could conduct more dynamic extractions, with SEALs in a RHIB or other craft driving right up onto the boat’s rear deck as it speeds away from the target area. With five weapons mounts for 7.62mm and .50 caliber machine guns and 40mm automatic grenade launchers, and a standing position for an individual armed with an FIM-92 Stinger shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile, it could provide its own defensive firepower during either insertions or extractions, too. The Mk V also offered a relatively spacious main cabin and rear deck area, allowing for the installation of additional communications and other gear so it could act as a small command and control platform. There was also enough space for a launch and recovery system for a Scan Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle, which gave personnel another means of monitoring situations, providing overwatch, and just gaining additional situational awareness during operations. Naval special operators launch a Scan Eagle drone from a Mk V SOC., USN The boat’s performance and other features made it a valuable tool for conducting boarding operations, such as assaults on ships that terrorists or pirates had seized control of, too. Its high speed similarly meant that it could chase down opponents, such as drug smugglers, in their own speed boats, if necessary. There is limited information about the actual operational activities of the Mk Vs. They did help insert SEAL teams to seize control of offshore oil terminals in the open stages of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003. At least four Mk Vs from Special Boat Team 20 (SBT-20), among other boats, took part in the operation, according to The New York Times . A US Navy RHIB sits off the Mina Al Bakar Oil Terminal in Iraq during the open phases of the U.S.-led invasion of that country in March 2003. Mk Vs also reportedly took part in this assault., USN In 2010 , in a much different kind of operation, one of SBT-20’s Mk Vs helped in the rescue of individuals who had ended up in the Delaware River after the World War II-era DUKW “Duck” amphibious truck they’d been riding in as part of a pleasure tour collided with a barge and sank. “ Duck tours ” saw a surge in popularity in the early 2000s and various companies continue to operate them in the United States and around the world, despite a number of high-profile accidents . Two years earlier, Maine Marine Manufacturing, a subsidiary of Hodgdon Yachts, in cooperation with the University of Maine’s Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center, had launched an improved derivative of the Mk V with a composite material hull. The Office of Naval Research had funded the development of this prototype, known variously as the Mk V.1 or Mako, with the main goal of finding ways to reduce the craft’s violent movements at high speeds. As noted earlier, this had required the installation of shock-mitigating seats in the Mk Vs, but the boats were still notorious for injuring their crews, especially on longer duration operations. The new boat also offered an opportunity to experiment with advanced manufacturing processes for composite boat hulls and how those materials factored into hullform design and final performance. This effort seems to have helped contribute to a program to find a composite-hulled and otherwise improved successor to the Mk V, which eventually became known as the Combatant Craft Medium (CCM). The Navy subsequently held a competition for new craft and chose a design from Oregon Iron Works over a submission from VT Halter Marine. Oregon Iron Works has since become known as Vigor Works. As of 2018 , the Navy had fielded 17 CCMs out of a total of 30 that it plans to buy. The Navy officially retired the Mk V in 2013, according to Jane’s Navy International . One of the US Navy’s new CCMs., USN The U.S. military has now been offering the Mk V to allies and partners through the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program. In 2018 , Jane’s 360 reported that Greece would receive four of them. There have also been limited direct foreign sales of the design overseas over the years, including to Kuwait in 2009 . Four years later, the U.S. government approved the potential sale of Mk Vs to Saudi Arabia. There’s now at least this one up for sale to the highest bidder through the GSA and more might appear at auction in the future if the Navy can’t find homes for them itself. The one on offer now could just as easily continue life in a more specialized capacity, going to an organization with a need for a high-speed watercraft, including law enforcement agencies, emergency management services, or a public or private wildlife conservation organization, such a state fish and wildlife service, or even Greenpeace . The Mk V’s design offers significant space to convert it into a patrol boat, search and rescue platform, or even a small pleasure craft. If you’re interested in potentially buying a high-performance boat that you can turn into a small luxury yacht and still have the ability to launch an assault on a nearby beach, you have until Apr. 29, 2019, to place your own bid.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019",North Korea Tests Submarine Launched Missile In First Launch Of Its Kind In Three Years (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea appears to have test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, from an offshore platform for the first time in three years , with it crashing down in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. The launch follows the announcement that the U.S. and North Korean governments had agreed to begin new working-level talks on the latter country’s nuclear weapons programs. It also comes amid growing strains between the United States and its regional allies, Japan and South Korea, over a variety of issues on and off the Korean Peninsula. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the North Koreans had fired the missile in the waters off Wonsan on that country’s Eastern Coastline in the early hours of Oct. 2, 2019 , local time. The weapon flew just shy of 280 miles, but along a lofted trajectory with an apogee of around 565 miles, landing in the East Sea some 217 miles north of Japan’s Oki Islands. With a flatter trajectory, the missile may have been able to fly more than 1,240 miles, according to Japan’s Kyodo News . South Korean authorities stressed that while they had assessed that the missile was an SLBM, they believed a submerged test launcher had actually fired the weapon, rather than a submarine. This is an important caveat given that the North Koreans offered the first public look at the conversion of an old Soviet-era design into a ballistic missile sub in July. U.S. officials have reportedly concurred with South Korea’s initial assessments, though both countries were continuing to gather and examine information about the test. South Korean authorities also said that the missile in question was likely a member of North Korea’s solid-fuel Pukkuksong ballistic missile family. This includes the Pukkuksong-1, the country’s only known SLBM to date, and the land-based Pukkuksong-2 , which is based on the submarine-launched weapon. North Korea has not, at the time of writing, released any photographs or video footage from its latest test launch. It is generally much faster and easier to launch solid-fuel missiles than liquid-fuel ones, which, on land, makes it more difficult for an opponent to spot preparations to launch such a weapon before it occurs. They are also ideally suited to submarine-launched applications, given the difficulties and safety risks generally associated with storing liquid rocket fuel and then pumping it into missiles before firing them. Based on the information at hand, however, North Korea’s most recent missile test involved a design with a greater range than the Pukkuksong-1, also known as the KN-11. Japanese authorities also initially reported that there had been two missiles, but subsequently revised that statement to suggest that what they had detected was one of the weapon’s stages separating in flight . The ground-launched Pukkuksong-2, also known as the KN-15 , is a two-stage derivative of the earlier missile. In August 2017, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had toured facilities involved in the production of solid-fuel rocket propellants and lightweight wound filament rocket casings. During one of those visits, he had stood in a room with a poster that made reference to a still unseen Pukkuksong-3. It is possible that this could be a two-stage SLBM design that uses a wound filament rocket motor to reduce weight in order to fly even greater distances, or simply to free up space for more fuel or heavier warheads. Kim Jong Un visits the Chemical Material Institute of Academy of Defense Science in August 2017. The poster on the wall to the right mentions the still unseen Pukkuksong-3 missile., KCNA New North Korean SLBM developments make good sense, given that the regime in Pyongyang revealed the existence of their work to convert a Soviet-era Romeo class attack submarine into a ballistic missile sub in July. This diesel-electric submarine would offer limited capabilities and be relatively easy to track, but could still present significant headaches for the country’s opponents, including the United States, which you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s past analysis of this development program. Kim Jong Un, in the gray suit at center, talks with other officials in front of a Romeo class attack sub under conversion into a ballistic missile submarine., KCNA Whatever the exact specifications of the missile might turn out to be, this test is already especially notable for a number of reasons. In addition to being the first time North Korea has launched an SLBM from a sea-based platform since 2016, this is the longest range weapon the regime in Pyongyang has tested since 2017, when it declared a self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile launches and nuclear tests. That moratorium only extends to intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missiles, with ranges above 1,864 miles, so the North Koreans are not technically breaking their pledge. At the same time, this represents a clear escalation in North Korea’s signaling after a slew of tests involving new guided rockets and short-range ballistic missiles earlier this year. The exact signal North Korea may be attempting to send now is not entirely clear. On Oct. 1, 2019, the U.S. State Department had announced that there would be new talks between American and North Korean officials within the next week, the first such engagement after months of stalled negotiations in the aftermath of the failed second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February. North Korean officials also said they were ready for new talks. Since then, Kim and other North Korean officials have repeatedly threatened to go down a “new path” if the United States does not meet various demands, including relaxing sanctions. Many observers had taken this to indicate North Korea’s willingness to abandon its missile and nuclear testing moratorium. Trump and his Administration have repeatedly downplayed the earlier, short-range weapon tests that have occurred in recent months. Kim Jong Un stands in front of a large multiple rocket launch system following a test in September 2019., KCNA With the Trump Administration now embroiled in major political scandal, which could have serious domestic ramifications, North Korea may be concerned that its opportunity to deal with Trump himself, who has remained very positive about the prospects of success from future negotiations with Kim and has been inclined to offer concessions in the past, may be running out. As such, North Korea could be attempting to influence the upcoming talks with its SLBM launch, while still, technically, abiding by its stated testing policy. At the same time, North Korea might be more focused on sending messages to America’s regional allies South Korea and Japan, who are, themselves in the midst of an unprecedented political spat . This led to the collapse of a Japanese-South Korean intelligence sharing agreement in August, which many are concerned will only limit the ability to monitor and assess various North Korean developments, including missile tests. Japan has sought to quell these concerns and plane spotters online noticed that one of the Japan Air Self Defense Force’s RC-2 electronic intelligence aircraft had taken off following the new SLBM test. Regardless, North Korea “appears to aim to strengthen its negotiating hand to the maximum,” South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong Doo said on Oct. 2, 2019. “It also appears to take into consideration multiple factors, including our military’s demonstration of its latest military assets yesterday.” On Oct. 1, 2019, South Korean President Moon Jae In had marked his country’s Armed Forces Day with a ceremony that showcased, among other things, the country’s new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The North Korean regime has often singled out these stealthy aircraft as something they see as a particularly significant threat. “Peace is not something that is defended, but created,” Moon said in his speech . “Our military’s iron-clad security supports dialogue and cooperation, and enabled [the country] to boldly walk toward permanent peace.” Moon Jae In, standing in the limousine at right, rolls past a South Korean Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter during a celebration to mark the country’s Armed Forces Day., Jeon Heon-kyun/Pool Photo via AP The North Koreans may have interpreted this as a sign that the attitude of the South Korean government, which has, in the past, been working to dramatically improve and potentially even normalize relations with the North, might be shifting. Of course, there have been reports that Moon’s Administration is irate over how U.S. government policies, particularly sanctions, have threatened to scuttle progress in their own negotiations with Pyongyang. The SLBM test also comes as Japan’s present government continues to push ahead with plans to establish multiple U.S.-supplied Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense sites, despite missteps and growing costs . Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has, in general, cultivated a very close relationship with Trump and has largely adopted a policy toward North Korea that mirrors that of the U.S. governments, to the ire of Pyongyang. “Such a ballistic missile launch is in breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions and we strongly protest and condemn it,” Abe told reporters on Oct. 2, 2019. Japan has also filed a formal complaint about the test. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks to the press about North Korea’s SLBM launch on Oct. 2, 2019., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Images In September 2019, Japanese media reported, citing unnamed sources, that the country’s Self Defense Forces had failed to track some earlier North Korea short-range tests. The latest North Korean test may, in part, be another attempt to demonstrate their continued ability to target Japan. If nothing else, North Korea’s new SLBM test underscores how the regime in Pyongyang continues to advance its missile and other military development programs in spite of U.S. and other international sanctions. Kim is also continuing to making it clear that the status quo on the Korean Peninsula could very rapidly change if the regime in Pyongyang does not see the kind of progress in any future negotiations that it wants. Update 5:35 PM: North Korean state media has now officially said that the country has successfully tested the new Pukkuksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and released photographs of the test. The images show that this was indeed an underwater launch, but there is nothing to suggest a submarine was involved. The missile itself looks significantly more advanced than either the Pukkuksong-1 SLBM or the ground-launched Pukkuksong-2.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 26, 2019",China Showcases Stealthier Sharp Sword Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Configuration,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China revealed a new iteration of its Sharp Sword stealthy flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) at a parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state. The drone, which the Chinese have designated GJ-11, most notably now features a completely redesigned rear aspect with a stealthier exhaust compared to an earlier prototype that could significantly improve the unmanned aircraft’s radar-evading capabilities. The Chinese paraded a sole example of this improved Sharp Sword through Tiananmen Square in Beijing on Oct. 1, 2019. The event saw the first official public appearances of a number of new and advanced weapon systems, including the DF-41 solid-fuel road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the DF-17 hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , a high-speed drone know variously as the DR-8 or WZ-8, a version of the H-6 bomber capable of carrying outsized weapons and other payloads, the HSU-001 large unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV), and a still mysterious missile known as the DF-100, among others. Pictures of Sharp Sword first emerged on Chinese social media in 2013 and that same year a prototype conducted its first flight. At that time, the design featured an engine arrangement with a completely exposed and decidedly non-stealthy exhaust. The GJ-11 displayed now has a concealed exhaust and generally more streamlined rear aspect. The intake may also have been revised. It is impossible to tell from the available pictures and video from the parade whether either the intake or exhaust systems feature any sort of ducting that could further conceal the engine, especially its fan face, and further improve the drone’s stealth qualities. It seems safe to assume that incorporating these design features would at least be the eventual goal. The GJ-11 Sharp Sword on parade on Oct. 1, 2019., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP A side view of the Sharp Sword prototype in 2013 with its completely exposed engine exhaust., Chinese Internet There has also been much speculation since then about what the Sharp Sword’s specific roles and missions might be over the years, with earlier reports indicating that it might be able to carry two 2,000-pound class munitions in internal bays and use a satellite data-link to conduct long-range missions well beyond the Chinese mainland. More recently, there had been unconfirmed, but not unreasonable reports that the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) might be interested in employing a version of Sharp Sword from its aircraft carriers in an unarmed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capacity, a concept The War Zone recently explored in detail . Narrators on China Central Television who were giving a play-by-play of the parade and the weapons and other military hardware on display reportedly said that the GJ-11’s primary mission would be conducting deep penetrating strikes on critical targets. The “GJ” in the designation also stands for “gonji,” or “attack” in English, which would seem to further confirm that this unmanned aircraft is a strike-focused UCAV first and foremost. Of course, this wouldn’t preclude it from taking on ISR missions, whether it be from bases on land or Chinese aircraft carriers, or from versions of it being built specifically for such a role. Previous reports had suggested that the Sharp Sword prototype was supposed to lead into an improved design that would be operational by 2020. At the same time, it appears to be very likely, if not probable, that the GJ-11 on parade in Beijing was a mockup of an improved variant that is still in development rather than an actual flyable aircraft. The drone on display lacked a wide variety of features one would expect to see on a flying aircraft, such as visible panel or seam lines, or tape sealing them, any indication of thermal protective treatment to the exhaust area, or air data systems, and the list goes on. At the 2018 Zhuhai Air Show, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) revealed its own UCAV design, the CH-7, which has very broad similarities to the Northrop Grumman X-47B . CASC had a mockup on display that still had a number of features, including panel lines, that one would expect to see on a real aircraft. There are even higher fidelity mockups out there, such as the one for the X-47B itself. A mockup of the CASC CH-7 UCAV at the 2018 Zhuhai airshow., Chinese Internet Some observers have also suggested that a number of facets in the trailing edge of the wing on the Sharp Sword in the parade may be part of a non-traditional control arrangement that uses blasts of air rather than conventional control surfaces. It is possible that China might be interested in this sort of technology, in general, but actual examples of work on “ morphing wings ” and “ fluidic thrust vectoring ” elsewhere in the world show that these developments are very much in their infancy. Regardless, official pictures from the parade show the clear outlines of traditional control surfaces. As such, the faceted areas indicate where the control surfaces would come close to joining or are otherwise simply a feature of the design. A look at the rear of the GJ-11 showing the revised exhaust and the faceted areas in the trailing edges of the wings., China Military Another rear shot of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword on parade, making it clear that the design has traditional control surfaces., China Military When it comes to the GJ-11’s rear aspect, it is worth remembering that engine exhausts are among the most notoriously complicated elements of developing any stealth aircraft, manned or unmanned. The Russians have been facing a similar issue with their S-70 Okhotnik-B , or Hunter-B, UCAV, another flying wing design with clear stealth aspirations. As with the original Sharp Sword prototype, the first flying example of the S-70 also has an exposed engine exhaust . However, in August 2019 at the biennial MAKS airshow outside of Moscow, the manufacturer, Sukhoi, displayed a model of a future iteration with a greatly revised, stealthier rear aspect . If nothing else, the general layout of the Sharp Sword UCAV in the anniversary parade is the latest indication of how invested the Chinese are in the development of stealthy unmanned aircraft , as well as drones in general . Sharp Sword is just one of the numerous flying wing style unmanned designs that Chinese aviation firms have been producing in recent years . These are developments that The War Zone has been following very closely . Another view of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword on parade., Anna Ratkoglo / Sputnik  via AP The Chinese have also made significant strides in developing autonomous, networked swarms of small drones, technology that could have some limited applications in larger unmanned designs. This is to say nothing of China’s known work and reported progress on stealthy manned aircraft , including the development of two stealth bombers . It’s also worth remembering that China’s investment in stealthy UCAVs, in particular, came after the United States publicly turned away from this concept , or moved those efforts entirely into the classified realm . There have been some indications as of late that the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy may be reversing course again, but they might also find themselves now playing catchup. Whatever the actual state of the GJ-11’s development is or isn’t, China is definitely eager, and publicly so, to push further ahead in developing a real stealth UCAV capability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2019",Air Force Just Tested Its Big Backup Plan If Its Air Ops Center In Qatar Gets Attacked,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force shut down its nerve center for air operations all the way from Syria to Afghanistan for a day, and had airmen in South Carolina take over the management of those activities, as part of an extremely important exercise over the weekend. This is the first time in more than a decade that the so-called Combined Air Operations Center , or CAOC, in Qatar was not in control of regional operations. The decision to test this ability to shift responsibility to a command center in the United States came amid increased tensions with Iran following unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Air Force’s growing concerns, in general, about the vulnerabilities of known bases to enemy strikes in any major conflict. The Washington Post , which the Air Force invited to come and sit in on the exercise, was first to report on what it described as an “unannounced operation.” The CAOC , also known as the 609th Air Operations Center (AOC), at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, ceased operations on Sept. 28, 2019. For 24 hours, personnel at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina were in control of all Air Force operations in the region, as well as coalition aerial activity in countries such as Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Construction of the CAOC at Al Udeid began in 2002 in the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq the following year, according to the Air Force . It kicked-off operations in February 2003, just a month before coalition forces streamed into that country and toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The Post says that the operations center in Qatar, which today has representatives from almost a dozen other allied and partner nations, has been the sole entity in charge of American and coalition air operations in the Middle East and Central Asia since 2006. Having personnel at Shaw, more than 7,000 miles away, take over makes good sense. The South Carolina base is the official home of U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), the Air Force’s top command for operations in the regions that the CAOC in Qatar serves. A view of the CAOC at Al Udeid during the exercise, empty for the first time in 13 years., USAF via The Washington Post However, the fact that there are direct linkages on an organization chart between the 609th and AFCENT does not necessarily mean that personnel back in the United States have the capacity or capability to assume responsibility for managing hundreds of aircraft flying all sorts of missions in and around the Middle East, if necessary, with no notice, during a crisis. This exercise was the culmination of work that the Air Force had done in order to assure that the hand-over would be as seamless as possible. This included the re-activation of the 609th Air Support Squadron at Shaw on Sept. 18, 2019. This unit had previously been active at the base in South Carolina between 1994 and 2008, “supporting Air Force component planning, execution, combat support, and combat service support,” according to the Air Force . After 2008, a smaller detachment of airmen technically assigned to the 609th AOC in Qatar, but co-located with the rest of AFCENT, continued to provide more limited support for operations downrange. “We are truly distributed [around the globe],” U.S. Air Force Colonel Frederick Coleman III, head of the 609th AOC said at the re-activation ceremony for the squadron. “All of these people use technology provided, maintained, and protected by our own communications squadrons here at Shaw and at Al Udeid to plan, task, command, and control every airplane that flies, every bomb that is dropped, every pallet that is moved, from Egypt to Afghanistan.” USAF It’s hardly surprising that the Air Force has become concerned about what might happen to the CAOC at Al Udeid, and the rest of that base, should an actual conflict between the United States and Iran break out. The regime in Tehran has threated , on multiple occasions, to retaliate to any American strikes on its territory with attacks on American bases throughout the Middle East. The base in Qatar is well within range of various Iranian ballistic and ground-launched cruise missiles . Recent, unprecedented attacks on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia have also underscored Iran’s ability to employ suicide drones against major targets. U.S. Army Patriot surface-to-air missiles, as well as Qatari air defenses, guard Al Udeid, but the attacks in Saudi Arabia also highlighted how difficult it might be to first spot and then to try to shoot down incoming low-flying drones or cruise missiles, as the War Zone recently explored in-depth . Ballistic missile defense is hardly a sure thing, either, as you can read about more in this past War Zone feature . Communications and command and control nodes are prime targets and even hardened facilities could be vulnerable to missile barrages or other mass attacks. There is also the threat of electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and other asymmetric operations, such as terrorist attacks, that could potentially hamper routine activities at the CAOC. A US Army Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar., USAF “The functions that the CAOC provides for air power are so critical and so essential that we can’t afford to have a single point of failure,” U.S. Air Force Major General B. Chance Saltzman, the deputy commander of AFCENT, told The Post . But Saltzman’s point stretches beyond any possible conflict with Iran and applies to forward-deployed Air Force command centers, in general. Just with Al Udeid, since 2017, there have been concerns about the continued viability of U.S. operations at the base due to a serious and ongoing political spat between Qatar and a number of countries, chiefly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, for at least a year now, the Air Force has been actively voicing its concerns about what it would do and how it could continue to operate during a major conflict if it no longer had access to well-established bases in and around any theater of operations, including those in Europe or the Pacific , for any reason. You can read more about this in the issues at play in these discussions in this past War Zone piece . Being able to rapidly shift responsibility for activities in certain regions from one command center to another might not only be valuable, but essential in the future. “We are changing the game,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Reid, now head of the new 609th Air Support Squadron and previously in charge of 609th AOC, Detachment 1, said when he assumed command of the re-activated squadron. “This is about growth. We are changing the spectrum with how much distributed operations we can do anywhere in the world. We’ve demonstrated with our agile systems that we can access and support anywhere. This is built in resiliency. The growth of the squadron really is about continuing that trend.” Of course, a 24-hour shift in responsibility, where the CAOC in Qatar was able to resume its normal operations afterward, makes this more of an initial concept of operation than proof the personnel at Shaw would be able to take over for a protracted period of time. The distances involved also create different risks, including what could happen if U.S. military satellite communications were to be interrupted, another increasingly realistic concern . The Air Force will almost certainly take what it has learned from this particular exercise and use it to refine the process, correct any issues, and prepare for additional, more robust tests of the procedure in the future. Regardless of whether or not tensions between the United States and Iran lead to an actual conflict, the Air Force also clearly intends for this added command and control infrastructure to be a permanent fixture, at least for the foreseeable future. We may well see similar concepts of operation emerge with regards to air operations centers responsible for American aerial activities elsewhere in the world, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 22, 2019",Houthi Rebels Trounce Saudi Force Amid Concerns Over The Kingdom’s Military Competence,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have released video footage that they say is from a recent major battle with Saudi Arabian forces that resulted in hundreds of Saudi casualties and the capture of many more, along with the seizure of vast array of vehicles and other weapons and equipment. The Houthi’s specific claims cannot be independently verified and follow questionable assertions from the group about its involvement in recent unprecedented attacks on key pieces of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure . However, the disclosure does come nearly two years after a senior U.S. military advisor publicly highlighted worryingly high casualty rates and poor training and sustainment practices within the Saudi Arabian National Guard, specifically, which appears to have been involved in this particular incident. On Sept. 29 and 30, 2019, the Houthi-aligned Al Masirah television channel broadcast footage from the reported battle, showing the Yemeni rebels firing anti-tank guided missiles and other weapons at a convoy consisting of LAV-25 light armored vehicles , M163 Vulcan Air Defense System (VADS) vehicles, as well as various types of mine-protected or otherwise armored trucks and unarmored Toyota pickup trucks. Additional footage shows allegedly Saudi personnel, as well as possible foreign mercenaries under Saudi direction, surrendering. At an earlier press conference, with foreign journalists in attendance, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree would not say where or when the fighting occurred, specifically, claiming operational security concerns. He did claim that it had taken place within Saudi Arabia’s southern Najran province, which borders Yemen. Al Jazeera reported that the battle had taken place sometime in August 2019. A map showing Saudi Arabia’s Najran province., Google Maps It has been, so far, impossible to verify the Houthis claims that they killed or wounded 500 Saudi-aligned troops and captured 2,000 more. At the time of writing, Saudi Arabia has declined to respond in any way to the Houthi’s claims. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MB1C7XyUvNo https://youtube.com/watch?v=qfDPlfzj0uI The credibility of Houthi claims, in general, has seen significant challenges recently after the group claimed responsibility for a series of unprecedented suicide drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field earlier in September. There has been a growing body of evidence that suggests that these attacks did not originate in Yemen. That the Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels have released their own clearly fabricated “evidence” to support their claims has only further called them into question. At the same time, however, there are many details available already that lend weight to their claims with regards to fighting in or around Najran, even if the Houthi’s assertions about the total number of Saudi casualties, and personnel and equipment they captured, remain dubious. The presence of LAV-25s, for example, strongly indicates that members of the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) were among those in the convoy that the Houthis attacked. https://youtube.com/watch?v=svWB9or1eJc https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ba87DXH-_t8 https://youtube.com/watch?v=Esb61gbS9oU https://youtube.com/watch?v=we7WKL3f_SI The Saudis have the largest force of LAV-25s, and other associated variants of that 8×8 wheeled design, in the world, with more than 1,900 examples in total, Major General Frank Muth, then-head of the Office of the Program Manager-Saudi Arabian National Guard ( OPM-SANG ), the top U.S. advisory body to this Saudi force, said during a presentation at the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual convention in October 2017. With the exception of Qatar, which dropped out the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in 2017 over a still-ongoing political spat , no other country that has been part of this bloc operates these vehicles. Since at least 2016, SANG has been rotating its mechanized brigades, one at a time, through deployments to the border region with Yemen, according to Muth. “They [the SANG] are on the border with Yemen right now, fighting the Houthis, fighting the Houthis crossing the border,” he said in his 2017 presentation. There is also evidence that the SANG has deployed with these vehicles into Yemen proper . Saudi-Canadian LAVs as far as the eye can see pic.twitter.com/NmKHzE5HL2 — Anthony Fenton (@anthonyfenton) June 12, 2018 Unlike the U.S. National Guard, the SANG is a sort of praetorian guard that is publicly charged with protecting the ruling monarchy in Saudi Arabia, as well as key religious sites and other important infrastructure, including oil-related sites. This Saudi force also has a large irregular component that recruits heavily from various tribal groups within Saudi Arabia, which would help explain the general appearance of a large portion of the individuals the Houthis reportedly captured. Many of the supposedly captured fighters were wearing flip flops and traditional clothing found in this region has led experts to question whether or not these individuals were Saudi Arabians or foreign mercenaries, including pro-Saudi Yemeni militiamen.  At least some of the troops that the Houthis captured were wearing Saudi uniforms or claimed to be Saudi Arabian nationals, which could have been the SANG officers leading the force. A slide from Major General Muth’s 2017 presentation, showing the general dispositions of SANG mechanized forces in the country, including a brigade’s worth of forces along the southern border with Yemen., Joseph Trevithick If the Houthis claims are at all true, the battle will be a particularly embarrassing episode for the Saudis, who have been fighting a brutal war with the Yemeni rebels since March 2015. Unfortunately, the SANG’s apparent performance, as well as that of the irregular forces that appear to have been under their immediate command, is not necessarily surprising to anyone who might have caught Major General Muth’s discussion nearly two years ago. Though Muth, who had taken over the post as head of OPM-SANG in July 2016, was upbeat in his talk about the progress that the Saudis had made, he highlighted a number of extremely severe deficiencies that had he and his team of advisors had been working to rectify. His descriptions of SANG experiences in fighting with the Houthis along the border align well with the Houthis latest claims. “They were having problems with people not getting off the point of injury and not surviving,” he said in 2017. “We had to show them, it only takes like four basic things for you to learn and understand at the soldier level, be able to bring that – I’m not going to use an exact number, but let’s say its very high, 70 to 80 percent died of wounds, just an example, that may not be the case – down to a much lower number.” Muth pointed out that, on average, only two percent of U.S. Army soldiers typically died at the point of injury in recent American conflicts. The general officer said that, as of October 2017, the SANG, with great effort, had been able to get their rate down to 16 percent. US Army Brigadier General Frank Muth, then-head of OPM-SANG, receives the King Abdul Aziz Medal, First Order, from His Highness Prince Khalid bin Abdul Aziz bin Ayyaf Al Megren, Minister of the National Guard, in May 2018., US Army It is “night and day how much better they’re fighting now. Why, because they know somebody’s there to care of them,” Muth said, a comment that further highlights how dire things must have been initially. Still, the “improved” casualty rate meant that nearly two out of every 10 SANG casualties were still dying right on the battlefield and it is unclear how much better their prospects may have been at the next level of care, if they even got there. We don’t know if these figures have improved or regressed since then. Training, in general, was also a problem. Muth said that he had initiated plans in 2016 to establish officer and non-commissioned officer academies to improve the performance of SANG’s leadership, but that it was unlikely they would produce results for at least five years. Bear in mind that OPM-SANG has been working in Saudi Arabia since 1973. In the interim, American advisors had helped craft a six-week “Warrior Leaders Course” to try and improve the force’s overall quality. “We’re going to pull staff sergeants and sergeant first classes out of the LAV formations, put them through an intensive six-week training cycle, and we’re focusing on some basic stuff,” Muth explained. “I’m talking patrolling, weapons fire, communication, land nav [sic; navigation], P.T. [physical training] – let me say that again, P.T., a lot of P.T. – and just basic skill sets.” US Army advisors to Saudi Arabia pose with members of Saudi Arabia’s G3 Military Police Command and instructors of Riyadh’s Military Police Training Academy after a graduation ceremony in 2016., US Army The state of the SANG’s LAVs was also dismal, according to Muth. “When they came off of the border for the first time, they did not have a battle damage and repair [BDAR] facility. So, we had 19 LAVs from the first brigade that were shot up pretty bad, from RPGs to you name it. We had no way to repair them,” he explained. The U.S. military, through the Foreign Military Sales program, only hired General Dynamics Land Systems (GLDS), the LAV’s original manufacturer, to set up a BDAR facility in 2016. Saudi Arabia had first bought its fleet of these armored vehicles in the early 1990s. After those contractors set up this repair depot, they found that there had been, at best, minimal maintenance on the vehicles since then. Muth said a contractor had, at one point, shown him an oil filter taken from one of the LAVs that had a specific 1992 date code that indicated it had never been replaced. “I’m not kidding,” he declared during his talk. The video below purportedly shows Houthis destroying a captured Saudi LAV in 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xeR-KxqAF5Q It’s not clear how many similar issues may plague the regular Saudi armed forces, but other reports strongly suggest that Muth’s experiences were not out of the ordinary for U.S. advisors working in the Kingdom. In 2017, the general officer had noted that there could be difficulties in convincing senior SANG and other Saudi military leadership to adopt reforms and ensure those directives got carried out at lower echelons. He also said he had laid out a number of goals to try to make sure the SANG, at least, would have self-sustaining mechanisms for handling attrition in regards to both manpower and materiel. The Saudis have “to anticipate many years out, knowing that this [the fight against the Houthis] is not gonna end any time soon,” he said. “And if you’re rotating people in and out, brigades every year, you’ve gotta anticipate those requirements, anticipate the training needs, and get that on the calendar, and then force everyone to do that.” Major General Muth left OPM-SANG to become head of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command in July 2018. It’s unclear how much progress the Saudis had made on implementing the goals he had laid out by then. If the Houthi’s latest operation in or around Najran is any indication, the SANG, specifically, looks to be having serious challenges in finding replacement personnel and training them into a capable fighting force. There have been multiple allegations that Saudi Arabia has been heavily relying on local fighters tied to terrorist groups , foreign mercenaries , and the forced conscription of Sudanese child soldiers to bolster its forces in Yemen proper. This latest battle, coupled with Muth’s past comments about the quality of the SANG, only underscores the concerns about the general capabilities of the Saudi armed forces, more broadly. These have been front and center since the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais. Saudi air defenses proved ineffectual in defending at all against the suicide drones and missiles. It’s fair to say that the dated point defense systems available to the Saudis may not have been able to repel the attacks, at all, something The War Zone has analyzed in-depth since those attacks, but it remains unclear how well prepared those personnel were for any threats, to begin with. All this also raises doubts about how capable the Saudi armed forces might be in a protracted regional conflict against a more capable adversary that the Houthis, such as Iran. The United States has blamed Iran directly for the Abqaiq and Khurais attacks and the Saudis say that they were at least Iranian-sponsored . “If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests,” Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, better known as MBS and widely seen as the man actually ruling Saudi Arabia and the chief architect of the war in Yemen, warned in an interview with CBS ‘ “60 Minutes” this past weekend. “Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven’t seen in our lifetimes.” Further attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil and other energy-producing infrastructure, as well as threats that could limit its ability to export those resources around the world could potentially lead to a “total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,” the crown prince continued. MBS also said he agreed with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s past comments that the suicide drone and missile attacks on his country earlier in September constituted an “act of war” by Iran. All of this comes as the United States says it is preparing to send an additional battery of U.S. Army Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to Saudi Arabia, on top of existing ones already there . The U.S. Navy has already moved an Arleigh Burke class destroyer into a position where it can also provide additional air defense coverage for Saudi Arabia. This is on top of a steady influx of additional U.S. military personnel and assets, including U.S. Air Force fighter jets and bombers and additional Navy warships , into the Middle East, as a whole, since May. US Air Force F-15C Eagles fly with Royal Saudi Air Force F-15C Eagles and a KE-3A tanker in June 2019., RSAF The United States also says it plans to fast-track additional military aid to the Kingdom. This follows a major Saudi spending spree on U.S. military hardware in recent years, including combat jets , warships , air and missile defense systems, and more. One has to wonder, given the available details about the SANG and their apparent recent performance in Najran, whether Saudis forces would truly be able to put that additional materiel to good use within any reasonable timeline of whenever they receive it. Whatever the case, there seems to be a growing danger that Saudi Arabia may find itself as a center of a larger regional conflict, one that it appears to be largely unprepared for. The incident in or around Najran shows that the country may not even be able to guarantee security along its southern border against a more limited opponent after more than four years of heavy fighting.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have written about the Royal Australian Air Force’s low-level flying displays for years , with Brisbane’s Riverfire celebration always being the most jaw-dropping of them all. Even though the iconic F-111 “Pig” is no longer the star of the show, with its amazing “dump and burn” maneuver , RAAF Super Hornets, Growlers, C-17s, and more have stepped in to keep the aerial spectacle part of the event enthralling and unique. I have seen clips showing so many angles of these flybys over the yearsâ€”with last year offering the most spectacular perspective yet â€”but I have never seen any of them from the cockpit point of view… Until now.

Videos of their training flights surface from time to time and they never disappoint . While RAAF tactical jets weave through urban obstacles for their displays throughout the year, Riverfire seems a bit unique when it comes to pushing the big transports very close to skyscrapers.

Communities within the larger community can take on a life of their own. “ National Security Twitter ,” which includes everyone from foreign policy wonks to missile tech geeks to open source intelligence gatherers, is no different. Earlier in the month, Military Giant Cats â€”literally a Twitter user that posts photoshopped giant cats interacting with military hardwareâ€”was all the rage. This week the “Tetris Challenge” meme has risen to prominence, and for good reason. The photosâ€”which are shot from an overhead perspective and showcase military personnel and their vast and usually highly expensive gear and vehiclesâ€”look like packaged toy playsets. Think the most realistic GI Joes ever.Â It all looks so real… because it is! According to one source , this particular meme concept dates back a couple of years when the New Zealand Police posted such an image, but it really picked up steam this month when some Swiss police officers posted their own take on the idea and it went viral. The classic videogame callback moniker comes from the grid-like pattern that all the gear, and the personnel that uses it, are laid out in. Â It suits the military particularly well because there is a lot of high-end kit to show off and plenty of creative service people that are always thinking of new ways to do so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",China Leaks Video Of Mysterious Ground-Launched Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China appears to have accidentally revealed the existence of a new high-speed ground-launched missile. A brief glimpse of what looks to be a test launch of this previously unseen weapon emerged earlier this week in an official video released in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist State on Oct. 1. There have already been indications that a number of new or otherwise previously unseen aircraft , missiles, and other systems will be present at a major parade in Beijing to mark the occasion next week. The People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force, or PLARF, posted the full video on social media on Sept. 25, 2019. Sometime afterward, the original one-minute long montage was replaced with one that omitted the launch of the unknown weapon and replaced it with unrelated footage of known missiles, according to the South China Morning Post . The PLARF is in charge of China’s strategic nuclear arsenal, as well as a variety of conventionally-armed long-range ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles. The service is also in charge of ballistic missile defense, which may then also include anti-satellite capabilities. The PLARF came into being in 2015 with the decision to elevate what was previously known as the 2nd Artillery Force into a full service with equal status to the People’s Liberation Army’s Army, Air Force, and Navy. It seems to be CJ-100 near space supersonic(Mach 3~5) cruise missile. https://t.co/ACZ82CPOFl pic.twitter.com/LSt46g4IkR — dafeng cao (@dafengcao) September 25, 2019 There is no obvious indication about what this new missile is or what its mission may be. The video shows that it is vertically launched from a 10-wheel transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) that appears to be able to carry two of the weapons in a ready-to-fire configuration. Photos of preparations for the 70th-anniversary parade in Beijing on Oct. 1, 2019, have shown a similar, previously unseen TEL with its entire rear section tarped off. A screenshot from the original PLARF video showing the TEL as the missile begins to blast off., PLARF capture A similar-looking TEL seen during preparations for the parade in Beijing on Oct. 1., Chinese Internet The weapon itself appears to have at least two distinct parts, a main body with a very large rocket booster attached to the end. The booster would fall away at some point in the early stage of flight. The main weapon has large strakes or fins and what appear to be a number of relatively long and thin fairings at the tail end, which some have suggested could be ramjet intakes. An air-breathing ramjet propulsion system would fit with the large booster motor, since the weapon would then need to get up to an appropriate speed and altitude before its engines could function properly. A number of existing Chinese supersonic anti-ship missiles, such as the YJ-12 series or the newer HD-1 , use a similar general configuration. The unidentified missile seen in the original PLARF video., PLARF capture China’s HD-1 supersonic anti-ship cruise missile., Chinese Internet The PLARF already operates the ground-based subsonic CJ-10 land-attack cruise missile, which has a range of approximately 930 miles. This has led some to believe that this new weapon is a supersonic, or possibly hypersonic, land-attack cruise missile intended to replace that existing weapon. Hypersonic speed is defined as greater than Mach 5 . The wide nose and missile body, together with the strakes/fins, would seem to make it unlikely that this is indeed a hypersonic weapon. Others have posited that it could be a new quasi-ballistic missile . However, the strakes/fins and possible ramjet propulsion would be at odds with what one would expect to see in a weapon that is supposed to fly in a ballistic flight path. Regardless of the exact nature of its configuration, the weapon could also potentially be intended for other roles instead of or in addition to striking land targets, including engaging hostile ships at extended ranges. The PLARF has already developed significant anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities , most notably with the DF-21D medium-range ballistic missile and the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, the latter of which is seen in the video below. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pdm2i-jVAWk A very-long-range, fast-flying, dedicated anti-ship cruise could certainly give the force additional flexibility in this regard. It seems worth noting that this weapon has appeared more than a year after Chinese hackers stole sensitive information about a U.S. Navy supersonic anti-ship missile program known as Sea Dragon, which The War Zone has previously explored in-depth . There is, of course, no hard evidence, so far, that the two designs are in any way related. The video has also emerged some six years after what was then known as U.S. Pacific Command made an urgent request to acquire and field an electronic warfare system for ships in the Asia-Pacific region in order to counter an unspecified missile threat or threats in their terminal phases of flight. This led to the installation of the AN/SLQ-59 Transportable Electronic Warfare Module (TEWM) on U.S. Navy ships assigned to the U.S. 7th Fleet, which is forward-deployed in Japan. You can read more about this system in this recent War Zone feature . The AN/SLQ-59 installation on the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur . The Navy rushed this system into service in response to unspecified anti-ship missile threats in the Pacific region., USN Given the PLARF’s core missions, though this weapon looks too small to be an anti-satellite system , another possibility is that it’s a missile defense interceptor. It’s not clear why such a weapon would use ramjet propulsion, although we can’t say this is definitely the case at this time. In addition, China has already been working on a number of ballistic missile interceptors, reportedly derived from its HQ-9 long-range surface-to-air missile, over the last decade. The U.S. military , as well as its regional allies Japan and South Korea , have been working in recent years to expand its missile defenses in the Pacific and China could be interested in fielding its own systems in response. Still, the PLA’s interest in additional missile defenses options may be growing with the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the United States and Russia in August 2019. Shortly after, the Pentagon tested a ground-launched BGM-109 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile and promised to deploy post-INF missiles of some kind to the Pacific region within a matter of months . U.S. officials repeatedly cited the fact that the Chinese were not bound by the INF treaty as a justification for withdrawing from it. The U.S. Army is also in the process of developing land-based hypersonic missiles , which it could also deploy to locations in the Pacific, such as Guam, where they could threaten China and its interests. “China will not stand idly by and be forced to take countermeasures should the U.S. deploy intermediate-range ground-based missiles this part of the world,” Fu Cong, Director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s Arms Control Department, had told reporters on Aug. 6, 2019. Even though very little is known for sure about this new missile, if nothing else, it is yet another indication of how active China continues to be in the development of new and advanced aircraft , weapons , and other military systems . The new missile is just one of a number of previously undisclosed systems that have emerged in the lead up to the Oct. 1 anniversary parade. It is possible that the Chinese may have intentionally allowed the footage to slip out, even though they pulled it down later, in order to send a signal or create uncertainty for foreign intelligence agencies, as well. Given the appearance of a very similar looking TEL, which does not appear to be associated with any existing, known missiles, during the parade preparations, it is very possible that we may learn more about this new weapon in the coming days.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Watch Russia’s S-70 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Fly With An Su-57 For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s S-70 Okhotnik-B , or Hunter-B, flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle, or UCAV, has flown together with a Su-57 advanced combat jet for the first time. The Russians see at least one of the S-70’s future missions being to operate together with the Su-57 in a “ loyal wingman ” role, which could help mitigate some of the shortcomings of the latter manned aircraft’s design and usher in new air combat synergies overall. The Russian Defense Ministry announced the test flight on Sept. 27, 2019, but did not say specifically where or when it had taken place. Video footage that the Kremlin released from the flight strongly suggests it occurred at the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center in Russia’s southwestern Astrakhan region, which is also likely where the S-70’s first flight took place earlier this year . The flight reportedly lasted “more than 30 minutes,” according to an official statement . “As part of the ongoing test program, the Okhotnik drone performed a flight in the automated mode,” the Russian Defense Ministry’s statement said . The S-70 will “broaden the fighter’s radar coverage and to provide target acquisition for employing air-launched weapons,” it continued. It’s unclear whether or not the two aircraft were actually networked together in any way during the flight, though the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the test was related to the development of manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. The S-70, bort number Red 071, appeared to be in the same general test flight configuration, complete with air data probes, as it had been during its first flight . The official video only shows the two aircraft flying in relatively close formation. This does offer a good size comparison between the two aircraft and underscore just how big the Okhotnik-B is. The S-70 is visible in this satellite photo of the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center from May 2019. That month, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a dramatic visit to the center on an Il-96-300PU presidential aircraft and with an escort of six Su-57s., Google Earth The Su-57 involved in this new test flight also does not appear to be one that plane spotters have previously seen carrying a logo on the tail that shows the silhouettes of one of the manned fighter jets together with that of an Okhotnik-B. There has been speculation in the past that this other Su-57, which has been seen with the bort number Blue 53, could have been specifically configured for manned-unmanned teaming tests. Regardless, employing S-70s as loyal wingmen for Su-57s, as a general concept, is one that makes good sense, as The War Zone has noted in previous analysis about the Okhotnik-B and its development. As the Russian Ministry of Defense itself has said, the UCAVs could operate ahead of their manned counterparts, feeding the pilots information from their sensors to give them a broader and more complete picture of the battlespace. That information could be used to cue very long-range weapons, allowing the Su-57s to engage targets, in the air and on the ground, while still staying as far as possible from enemy air defenses and hostile fighters. This could be especially valuable given the Su-57’s limited stealth capabilities at present and could help make the best use of its other features , including its ability to carry relatively large munitions inside its two ventral weapons bays. In August 2019, at the biennial MAKS airshow outside of Moscow, Sukhoi also publicly displayed a model of an S-70 with a significantly revised and far stealthier engine and exhaust configuration as compared to what we have seen on the flying prototype. Red 071’s engine arrangement, at present, is entirely exposed , which can only significantly limit its stealthy characteristics. You can read the War Zone ‘s full analysis of this proposed updated design here . A top down look at the S-70 model at MAKS 2019, showing a completely revised engine and exhaust configuration., Courtesy of Michael Jerdev/@MuxelAero Suffice to say, if Sukhoi does implement these changes in future S-70 iterations, the Okhotnik-B could be even more adept in penetrating through hostile air defenses in order to feed targeting information back to Su-57s staying further away from the objective. This would offer the Russians a more flexible approach to acquiring a stealthy, deep penetrating aerial combat capability that neither the Su-57 nor the S-70 can provide on its own. A manned-unmanned team with these aircraft would also be able to work together without a satellite data link, instead using a far less vulnerable line-of-sight connection. This could also make up for Russia’s more limited satellite communications and data-sharing capabilities. That being said, the Russians also expect to operate Okhotnik-B independently, including in combat and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance roles. The goal is also for the UCAV to be able to carry a mix of sensors or weapons, as required for the mission, and to be able to rapidly integrate new systems and munitions as time goes on. The video below shows the S-70 during its first flight earlier in 2019. The S-70 will be a “universal baseline platform for carrying advanced air-launched weapons, onboard reconnaissance systems and other equipment, which will allow constantly expanding the drone’s functional capabilities during the serial production,” a representative from Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov’s office reportedly told state-run media outlet TASS at the MAKS airshow. Borisov’s office also said that tests of armed Okhotnik-Bs are scheduled to take place between 2023 and 2024, with serial production of the UCAVs beginning in 2025. Still, a lot can happen in the next six years that may impact, at least to some degree, how Russia decides to move ahead with the S-70 program, in general, and what roles and missions it may assign to the unmanned aircraft when, and if, they actually enter service. The Kremlin’s on-again-off-again relationship with the Su-57 is a good example of how plans can shift and evolve depending on a wide variety of factors. That being said, Russia’s investment in UCAVs, such as the S-70, certainly represents a cost-effective and flexible approach to acquiring much-needed capabilities. Regardless, having the S-70 fly at all with the Su-57 does show that the Russians remain interested, right now, in pairing the two aircraft together operationally in the future.

The Army’s Product Manager for Demilitarization and the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command had first put out a notice of the potential contract on Sept. 17, 2019. The announcement stressed that there has been no final decision about whether or not to go ahead with getting rid of the ammunition. The Army has provided prospective contractors with a detailed list of the types of ammunition and the total number of rounds of each type that they could be called upon to break down. The final tally is 35,748,417 individual rounds of all types in storage at eight different Army facilities, the Anniston Munitions Center (ANMC), Blue Grass Army Depot (BGAD), Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CAAA), Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP), Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC), Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD), McAlester Army Ammunition Plant (MCAAP), and Tooele Army Depot (TEAD). You can browse the full list below: US Army US Army US Army US Army US Army Of these, just 277,718 are a mix of 105mm M833, M900, 120mm M829A1 rounds, and A2 tank shells. The final disposal of the M833 and M900 rounds makes good sense. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps no longer operate any tanks with versions of the 105mm M68 main gun that can fire these rounds, such as early variants of the M1 Abrams or the older M60A3 and M48A5 Patton tanks. The M900 was only ever certified for use in the longer M68A1E2 gun found on earlier M1 and IPM1 tanks, to begin with. These rounds will not work in the M1128 Stryker Mobile Gun System’s M68A1E5 gun and its autoloader. The Army and Marines have also already supplanted the M829A1 and A2s with improved A3 and A4 versions for use with their later model M1 tanks. The remaining 35,470,699 are 30x173mm shells intended for the GAU-8/A . These include armor-piercing PGU-14/B, -14A/B, and -14B/B rounds with DU penetrators, as well as belts of ammunition interspersed with PGU-13/B and -A/B high-explosive incendiary shells that have no DU. One would imagine that the Army would seek to recover the HEI rounds for later use as the contracting notice says nothing about disposing of non-DU ammunition and the PGU-13/B family remains in U.S. military use across multiple platforms, including Air Force AC-130W and J model gunships . It’s unclear whether this represents the entire stockpile of PGU-14/B rounds left anywhere within the U.S. military. The contracting announcement offers this description of the PGU-14A/B’s design, which is broadly applicable to the other variants, to help potential vendors develop a plan to dismantle and dispose of the rounds: The PGU-14A/B Armor Piercing Incendiary (API) – Kinetic energy [KE] projectile is used against armored targets. The PGU-14A/B API Armor Piercing Incendiary round has a lightweight body, which contains a sub-caliber high-density penetrator of DU. In addition to its penetrating capability; DU is a natural pyrophoric material, which enhances the incendiary effects. This round is effective against tanks and personnel carriers. The projectile is made up of four parts: an aluminum body or pusher, glass-reinforced nylon rotating band, DU rod penetrator, and aluminum windshield. The projectile has no fuze; its penetration depends on the shape of the penetrator, KE of the round, and grazing angle at impact. A diagram showing the construction of the PGU-14/B’s projectile. “Heavy metal” here refers to depleted uranium., USN The DU penetrators inside the PGU-14/Bs can punch through inches of rolled homogenous steel armor at ranges greater than 1,000 yards. A-10 pilots would also try, whenever possible, to attack tanks and other armored vehicles in their more vulnerable top and rear flanks, making the rounds particularly effective. Since the rounds fly at such high speeds and contain no explosive, relying simply on the sheer force of their impact to bust through armor, explosive reactor armor and active protection systems are unlikely to defeat them, as well. Unfortunately, the oldest stockpiled rounds, which have been in service since the 1970s when the A-10’s primary mission was to have been busting up hordes of Soviet and Wasaw Pact tanks in Europe, have been becoming increasingly unsafe to use. As of May 2018, the average age of PGU-14/B rounds was 32 years old, according to Military.com . At that time, the Air Force had growing concerns about whether the primers and propellants in the cartridges would perform as expected and ensure the actual projectiles went safely flying out of the GAU-8/A’s barrels. The A-10 is the only aircraft to carry the Avenger , which is a seven-barrel, electrically-driven Gatling cannon that can fire 70 rounds every second from what is known as a double-ended ammunition feed. What this means is that empty cartridge cases get cycled back into the massive drum magazine that feeds the gun after firing. This design eliminates the need to physically eject the cases out of the Warthog, where there would be a risk of them becoming hazardous aerial debris and potentially damaging the plane. The entire system, however, is a finely tuned machine. If the projectiles don’t exit the barrel when they’re supposed to, it can quickly lead to a serious malfunction. “I have 4.5 milliseconds from the time I initiate that round to get the projectile out the muzzle,” Bob DuPont, a member of the 780th Test Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, had told Military.com in May 2018. “Anything beyond six milliseconds is catastrophic for this system.” It now appears that the Air Force, via the Army, has decided to move ahead with simply disposing of these older rounds altogether. This also raises the question of whether the service will stop using DU ammunition in the A-10 entirely. “There’s a lot of discussion of whether we’re going to use depleted uranium again, or the tungsten penetrator,” DuPont had noted back in 2018. “We’re going to try to keep the weight the same, but it will have a less penetration capability because of the density of the material, DU being more dense [sic] than tungsten.” An A-10 fires its GAU-8/A cannon during a training exercise., USAF Scrapping the older versions of the PGU-14/B does offer the Air Force the opportunity to ditch the controversial ammunition for good. DU is a byproduct of the process of making uranium fuel for nuclear reactors and is both denser and cheaper than alternatives, such as tungsten. The U.S. military had used it for decades to make armor-piercing projectiles, as well as super-strong armor plating . The problem is that it’s also mildly radioactive, though it only emits alpha particles that your clothing and even skin can block, and studies have also indicated that its a toxic carcinogen . As such, there have long been concerns that depleted uranium projectiles, which shatter and burn on impact, have been contaminating the soil and water in areas where the U.S. military has used them extensively, such as Iraq during the first Gulf War and the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. DU has been one of the many factors possibly responsible for various illnesses that have emerged in large numbers among Gulf War Veterans, which have become known as Gulf War Syndrome . The U.S. government’s position continues to be that there is no conclusive evidence linking the rounds to the health issues, which is true. At the same time, it has been extremely difficult for researchers to go to places, such as Iraq, to conduct long-term field studies that could provide enough data to put the debate to rest for good. It has been difficult to even get a full accounting of where and when the U.S. military has used DU ammunition. From what is known, the PGU-14/B ammunition has only seen limited use in more recent conflicts in places such as Iraq and Syria, where there has been a dearth of targets that require is armor-piercing properties. The shell of a lightly armored M113 armored personnel carrier that A-10 pilots have used as a target on a training range., USAF The War Zone has reached out to the Air Force to try to confirm whether or not this contracting announcement means that they have decided to stop using 30mm DU ammunition in the A-10 completely. We will be sure to update this story with any additional information we receive. If the service has retired the rounds, it would certainly be good for public relations and there is already at least one 30x173mm tungsten-cored round available, which is in use in the Goalkeeper naval close-in weapon system. This system also features a GAU-8/A cannon. Still, getting rid of the PGU-14/Bs could result in some loss of capability given that the other available options, such as tungsten, simply do not perform as well. While not necessarily an issue with regards to lower-end conflicts, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, this could be worrisome with regards to potential major conflicts against larger opponents with more traditional standing armies. The U.S. military, as a whole, has seen a general shift toward preparing again for particularly high-end wars against “great power competitors,” such as Russia and China, operating large numbers of tanks and other heavy armored vehicles . Smaller forces, including non-state actors, have also demonstrated their ability to acquire and employ armored vehicles, including as suicide bombs , to varying degrees , on multiple occasions in recent years. Of course, the GAU-8/As and the A-10s that carry them are only one, relatively small piece of the puzzle when it comes to defeating enemy tanks and armored vehicles on the battlefield. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, may see the mix of anti-armor capabilities it has , or is otherwise developing , as sufficient to mitigate any impact from removing the PGU-14/B ammunition from service. A 30mm armor-piercing shell using tungsten could still be very effective against a wide array of targets, too, though its cost might limit its availability compared to existing DU shells, to some degree. At the same time, the A-10’s ability to launch precision-guided attacks , using everything from laser-guided 70mm rockets to GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs, means it does not have to rely as heavily on its gun, either. Whether or not the Air Force has decided to stop flying A-10s with loads of DU ammunition on the A-10s, or why, the stockpile of more than 35,000,000 existing rounds in Army custody appears to have outlived its usefulness.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Brazil’s Aircraft Carrier To Be Auctioned Off After Years Of Disappointment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Brazil’s Ministry of Defense has reportedly begun the process of auctioning off its retired aircraft carrier, the ex- São Paulo , with bids starting at $1.275 million, roughly a tenth of what the country paid to buy the ship from France nearly two decades ago. The Brazilians formally decided to decommission the flattop two years ago, which has left the fate of the country’s AF-1 Skyhawk carrier-based combat jets in limbo ever since. The Brazilians officially put the carrier up for sale on Sept. 23, 2019, according to Airway1 . Originally commissioned in the French Navy as the Foch in 1963, she was the second of two Clemenceau class aircraft carriers and remained in service in France until 2000. Brazil purchased the ship that same year for the bargain price of $12 million. At the time of São Paulo ‘s retirement, there were only two other countries in the world, the United States and France , still operating catapult-assisted takeoff and barrier assisted recovery ( CATOBAR ) configured aircraft carriers . Brazil’s acquisition of São Paulo was part of a broader push on the part of the country’s Navy to field a carrier-based fixed-wing tactical jet capability. This effort dated back to the 1980s and the elimination of rules that had said the Brazilian Air Force was the only service that could operate fixed-wing aircraft of any kind. The São Paulo at sea., Brazilian Navy This previous inter-service arrangement had meant that the Air Force had been responsible for flying the S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare planes embarked on the Brazilian Navy’s first aircraft carrier, the Minas Gerais , while the Navy flew helicopters from that ship’s deck. This ship, another CATOBAR type, was a former U.K. Royal Navy World War II-era Colossus class carrier that Brazil had acquired from the United Kingdom in 1956. In 1986, Minas Gerais ‘ catapult broke and, what with having to rely on the Air Force for fixed-wing aircraft, the Navy elected not to fix it, bringing fixed-wing operations on the ship to an end for more than a decade. In 1995, Brazil began work to install a replacement catapult, acquired from Argentina after that country retired its aircraft carrier Veinticinco de Mayo , another Colossus class ship. Two years later, Brazil signed a deal with Kuwait worth $70 million to acquire 20 single-seat A-4KU and three two-seat TA-4KU Skyhawk combat jets to form the core of the Brazilian Navy’s new carrier air wing. These aircraft became known as AF-1s and AF-1As in Brazilian service. You can read more about these aircraft, all of which are assigned to the service’s 1st Interceptor/Attack Squadron (VF-1), in detail here . The Skyhawks, which arrived in Brazil in 1999, only served on Minas Gerais briefly, with the Brazilian Navy retiring that ship in 2001. The aircraft were better suited to the larger deck of the São Paulo , regardless. AF-1 Skyhawks on board São Paulo in 2002., Rob Schleiffert/Flickr Unfortunately, São Paulo did not live up to expectations. Though the Brazilian Navy only officially retired São Paulo in 2017, that ship had already been in a largely inactivate state for more than a decade. An explosion in the steam system powering the ship’s catapults in 2004 killed one sailor and prompted a major overhaul that spanned between 2005 and 2010. The total cost of the upgrades and improvements, which included extensive work on the ship’s propulsion and electrical systems, updated catapults, a replacement Naval Tactical Data System, a new electronic support measures system, and more, along with a host of general maintenance, was around $19 million . This then required extensive sea trials and evaluations, which began in 2010. The ship was supposed to return to the fleet in 2013, but suffered a deadly fire in 2012, prompting new plans for more upgrades. By the end of 2016, São Paulo was still undergoing repairs and there were reports that it might take another decade to get the ship fully operational again. By the time the Brazilian Navy finally decided to just retire the ship in 2017, it was the world’s oldest commissioned aircraft carrier. In the better part of two decades that the flattop had flown the Brazilian flag, she had spent just 206 days at sea – less than a year in total – but had still managed to sail nearly 54,025 miles, according to Airway1 . She had conducted less than 600 launches of AF-1 jets. A Brazilian Navy AF-1 prepares to launch from São Paulo in 2002., Rob Schleiffert/Flickr The decision to retire the ship has left the future of the AF-1s in limbo. In 2009, the Brazilian Navy had hired the country’s preeminent aviation firm Embraer to conduct a deep modernization program on nine of the 20 AF-1s and the three AF-1As for a total cost of approximately $140 million. The resulting AF-1B and C variants, respectively, would have significant improvements, including all-new glass cockpits, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, digital radar warning receivers, and advanced pulse doppler EL/M-2032 radars from Israel’s Elta. The jets would also be able to carry new air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions and modern targeting pods. You can read more about the upgrade program here . Embraer only delivered the first and second AF-1Bs to the Brazilian Navy in 2015 and 2016, respectively. VF-1 got its initial two-seat AF-1C just last year. Whether Brazil decides to acquire the full fleet of AF-1B/C aircraft could be dependent on whether or not another carrier is in the country’s future. Brazil did acquire the ex-HMS Ocean , a helicopter carrier, from the United Kingdom in 2018 for approximately $115 million. However, the AF-1s cannot operate from this ship, now known as the Atlantico . The first AF-1C Skyhawk, Brazilian Navy There had been talk in the past about Brazil buying an entirely new aircraft carrier , as well as acquiring new carrier-based combat jets in the form of a navalized variant of the Saab Gripen . The Brazilian Air Force is the only foreign customer, so far, for the latest Gripen E/F variant . However, given the state of Brazil’s economy and more pressing naval modernization priorities , these proposals seem to have firmly taken a back seat in the Brazilian Navy’s future planning. As time goes on, if VF-1’s pilots cannot keep up their proficiency – if it hasn’t lapsed already – in carrier operations in some way, such as exchanges programs with the U.S. or French naval aviation communities, the unit could increasingly take on the appearance of a land-based tactical jet unit. This, in turn, could increasingly call into question the value of maintaining the squadron and its diminishing fleet of Skyhawks, which no other element of the Brazilian military flies. Short of the Brazilian Navy buying something like second-hand AV-8B Harrier jump jets to embark on Atlantico , which would then also need significant upgrades to be able to support those aircraft, the country’s fixed-wing carrier aviation capabilities may again be coming to an end for the foreseeable future. Brazil’s helicopter carrier Atlantico , the ex-HMS Ocean ., Brazilian Navy As for the future of the ex- São Paulo itself, is also uncertain, if Brazil’s experience of trying to get rid of Minas Gerais is any indication. Naval associations in the United Kingdom tried and failed to raise enough money to buy that carrier and turn it into a museum ship. In 2003, the flattop appeared for sale on Ebay via a seller who claimed be a legitimate intermediary for the Brazilian government. The auction site eventually pulled down the listing, which had reached a bid of nearly $8.9 million at the time, because it violated rules against selling military ordnance in the terms of service. A local auction in Brazil also failed to find a buyer and, in 2004, the carrier went to an ignominious end in a shipbreaking yard in India. An organization known as the Sao Paulo Institute-Foch is now hoping to buy the ex- São Paulo and convert it into a floating museum, according to Airway1 . It remains to be seen whether this will come to pass. The public auction in Brazil will reportedly occur tomorrow, Sept. 27, 2019. If you’re in Brazil this week and have at least $1.275 million to spare, you can try to make your own bid to become the next owner of this vintage aircraft carrier.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",U.S. To Spend Hundreds Of Millions To Replace A $5 Part In Revamped Nuclear Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Concerns about the reliability of commercial-off-the-shelf capacitors, each of which cost just $5, the Department of Energy had been planning to use in two future nuclear warhead designs will delay both programs by at least a year and a half and could result in up to a whopping $850 million in additional costs. The W88 ALT 370 warheads for the U.S. Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launch ballistics missiles and the U.S. Air Force B61-12 nuclear gravity bombs , the latter of which are already set to be worth literally twice their weight in gold each , are seeing impacts from the decision to switch to a more robust piece of circuitry. Charles Verdon, the Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), informed members of Congress of the issue during a hearing on Sept. 25, 2019. NNSA oversees the development, construction, and dismantlement of U.S. nuclear weapons. The W88 ALT 370 is an upgrade for existing W88 warheads that reportedly consists of improved arming, fuzing, and firing components. The B61-12 is a modernized variant of the B61 family of nuclear gravity bombs that leverages warheads from older B61-4 bombs and various components from those weapons, as well as from B61-3s, -7s, and -10s. It also adds a precision guidance tail kit. The B61-12s, which you can read about in much more detail in this past War Zone feature , will replace these older B61s, and potentially other nuclear bombs. The W88 ALT 370 and B61-12 designs both used the same commercial capacitors in an effort to help control costs. Verdon insisted to legislators that there was no indication that these components would fail under normal circumstances. USS Rhode Island fires a Trident II missile during a test in May 2019., USN “Early tests on the capacitors now in question and subsequent tests including component, major assembly, and full-up integrated system flight tests demonstrated that these components meet requirement today,” Verdon told lawmakers . “Industry best practices were used to stress the components beyond their design planned usage as a way to establish confidence that they will continue to work over the necessary lifetime of the warhead. During stress testing, a few of these commercially available capacitors did not meet the reliability requirements.” This, in turn, shook NNSA’s confidence that all of the capacitors would be able to work reliably across the expected life cycles of the W88 ALT 370s and B61-12s. These weapons are expected to remain in the active stockpile for at least between 20 and 30 years after they enter service. The U.S. Air Force had hoped to receive its first examples of the B61-12 next year . It’s unclear when the Navy might have originally expected to start getting the W88 ALT 370s, but NNSA had planned to finish construction of the first of these upgraded warheads by the end of this year . NNSA is now replacing the $5 capacitors with new, more robust ones that cost around $75 each . Verdon said that this could add between $120 and $150 million to the total cost of the W88 ALT 370 program and between $600 and $700 million to the B61-12 effort. He warned that the combined costs could potentially rise to more than a billion, depending on how the process goes. Each of these programs is now facing its own schedule delay of between 18 and 20 months, as a result. The W88 ALT 370 program’s total estimated cost is already around $2.7 billion. The total price tag for the B61-12 bombs is around $8.25 billion, with another $1.1 billion for the new precision guidance tail kits. “What we didn’t recognize, and one of the lessons we’ve learned, is the variability [in quality control] that can exist even within a given vendor just between different lots,” Verdon explained . “If you buy components and get different lots, there can be variability in how they are produced.” NNSA is now separately reviewing its procedures for acquiring and inspecting commercial-of-the-shelf components and is in discussions with vendors about ways to obtain more consistent quality in parts destined for nuclear weapons. “We’re going to look at it on a part-by-part basis. For those parts vendors that will have a hard time [meeting the requirements], we would look to bring those back in house,” he added , referring to the more costly option of the U.S. government re-taking responsibility for custom building certain components. Verdon also told legislators that NNSA had been able to leverage its experiences with the W88 ALT 370 and B61-12 programs to produce “design simplifications” on the future W80-4 and W87-1 warheads . The W80-4 is a life-extension upgrade for existing W80s found in the Air Force’s AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM) and it will also be used in the service’s future air-launched Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) cruise missiles. The W87-1 is a similar effort for W87 warheads, which are presently found on some Air Force LGM-30G Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and are set to go atop the future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) ICBMs. NNSA hopes this will lead to new cost savings that will help offset the issues with the W88 ALT 370s and B61-12s. US Air Force personnel work on an LGM-30G Minuteman ICBM in its silo., USAF Unfortunately, when it comes to nuclear weapons, any cost savings have to be balanced against the absolute need for the best possible safety and surety features. With America’s nuclear enterprise, this is called the concept of “ Always/Never ,” which refers to the desire for nuclear weapons to always function when you want them to and never when you don’t. Design flaws with multiple nuclear weapon configurations meant a number of already harrowing accidents during the Cold War could have been particularly catastrophic . One of these incidents, a 1980 fire in the engine of a B-52 loaded with nuclear weapons sitting on alert at Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota, was one turn of the wind away from becoming “worse than Chernobyl,” according to Dr. Roger Batzel, then-director of the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, or LLNL. You can read more about this particular accident in this recent War Zone feature . For the time being, the capacitor issue has not had any larger impacts on the futures of W88 ALT 370 or B61-12 programs. However, “there are vitally important programs for America, but there are no sacred cows, so we need to make sure 18-month, two year delays, cost overruns can be better understood so they can be avoided in the future,” Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee and Chair of the House Armed Forces Committee’s Strategic Forces Subcommittee, warned during the hearing . Congress is already engaged in an intense debate about modernizing America’s nuclear arsenal, broadly, which is expected to cost a whopping $1.5 trillion over the next three decades. As such, it is very possible that we will see additional changes to the character of both the W88 ALT 370 and B61-12 programs now that their schedules for both have grown by more than a year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2019","Navy Super Hornets Hit Big 80 Percent Readiness Goal, But Sustaining It Is Another Question (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says that its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , as well as its EA-18G Growlers , have hit an 80 percent mission capable rate target for the 2019 Fiscal Year. This is an important achievement for the service and a dramatic improvement over their abysmal availability rates at the end of the last fiscal cycle, which were around 50 percent, but serious questions remain about whether or not this is sustainable in the long term. U.S. Navy Vice Admiral DeWolfe Miller, Commander of Naval Air Forces, the service’s top aviation officer, also known as the “Air Boss,” made the announcement on Sept. 24, 2019. Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis had issued a memo in September 2018 that ordered the Navy to take all available steps to get its Super Hornet fleet up to 80 percent mission capable by the end of the Fiscal Year. The 2019 Fiscal Year officially ends on Sept. 30, 2019. That same directive called on the Navy, as well as the Air Force and Marine Corps to hit the same readiness target with their respective fleets of F-35s . It also called on the Air Force to achieve this goal with respect to its F-16 Vipers and F-22 Raptors . The Navy and Marines were supposed to do the same with their legacy F/A-18 Hornets , as well. Mattis made no mention of the EA-18G in his memo. With just days left in the fiscal year, it appears that only the Super Hornets and Vipers will actually attain this level of readiness. “This has been a year of results for Naval Aviation. I am incredibly proud of our Sailors, civilian teammates, and industry partners,” Vice Admiral Miller said in a statement . “They developed and implemented the NSS [Naval Sustainment System] and then drove readiness numbers that haven’t been seen in over a decade. Their results are incredible and their passion for improvement is inspirational.” A US Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet., ANG “This is the first year in some time that we have executed our allocation of flight hours completely,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Roy Kelley, the Commander of Naval Air Forces, Atlantic, said in his own statement . “That stands as a sign of health that we have a lot of ‘up’ aircraft, and that the parts are moving. We’re getting healthy and we’re on the right track.” U.S. military aviation communities, as a whole, have struggled to keep aircraft and helicopters flying after years of near-constant deployments to support a variety of operational demands, including, but certainly not limited to counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, among other locations around the world. Years of Congress passing short-term continuing resolutions to fund the government rather than actual annual budgets, together with the impacts of mandatory budget cuts under a policy known as sequestration, which began in 2011, only compounded the issue. On top of that, the Navy and its sister services were often presented with hard choices about where to trim back their budgets and often made nearsighted decisions to cut from operations and maintenance accounts instead of from high-end, big-ticket procurement items, which added personnel shortages and maintenance backlogs to the mix. By 2018, when Mattis issued his memo, things had reached crisis proportions . With all this in mind, its perhaps not surprising that the average mission capable rate, regardless of aircraft type, across the entire Naval Aviation Enterprise was hovering around 30 percent by the end of 2017. The Navy’s Super Hornets had an average mission capable rate of closer to 50 percent, but still well below the 73 percent target that the Commander of Naval Air Forces first laid out in the 1990s. An official US Navy briefing slide showing a steady decline in mission-capable rates across the Naval Aviation Enterprise since 1998., USN So, going from 50 percent to 80 percent mission capable in the space of 12 months is certainly impressive. But it’s also important to note that this is the mission capable rate, not the full mission capable rate. Full mission capable, also known as “Code One,” means that the aircraft can meet any assigned mission requirement. In addition, to reach the 80 percent goal, the Navy says it had to have at least 320 Super Hornets mission capable simultaneously, a target the service says it hit earlier in September. It then pushed the number of mission-capable F/A-18E/Fs up to 341. However, the Naval Aviation Enterprise as a whole reportedly has a total of 546 Super Hornets . Having 341 aircraft mission capable out of 546 planes yields a rate of around 62 percent, not 80 percent. The Navy’s own statement says that the 80 percent mission capable rate only applies to “operational” aircraft, but it is unclear what Super Hornets are in this category. It is possible that “non-operational” in this case could simply refer to aircraft undergoing or scheduled to undergo heavy depot maintenance. There is also still no word at all about the status of Navy and Marine legacy F/A-18 Hornets. The War Zone has already reached out for clarification and will update this story with any additional details we receive. Regardless, there are questions about how sustainable this mission capable rate may be in the long term. The Navy says, right now, it can only sustain approximately 320 mission capable Super Hornets and had to conduct a short-term readiness “surge” to get to 341. An F/A-18F Super Hornet lands on board the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis ., USN It’s also not clear whether the Navy had to cut back other flying operations in order to meet this goal. In June 2019, news emerged that the service was facing a funding shortage within its aviation communities, which would require scaling back flying time for some units. The next month, the Navy clarified that this was limited to Naval Air Forces, Atlantic and would primarily impact units equipped with aircraft other than the F/A-18E/F. East Coast fleets that would see cuts included those equipped with P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft, C-12 Huron utility turboprops, and MH-60R and S Sea Hawk helicopters. The one Super Hornet unit that was impacted was the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Demonstration Team, which saw a ban on scheduling any new flyovers or appearances at airshows. The team is assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 106 (VFA-106), the “Gladiators,” which serves as the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for Commander, Strike Fighter Wing, Atlantic Fleet. In this role, the squadron’s job is to ensure an adequate flow of pilots and maintainers to other Super Hornet units within the wing. Altogether, the Navy’s description of how its Super Hornets reached the 80 percent mission capable goal seem very similar to those regarding the Air Force’s disclosure earlier this month that it expected to hit the target with its F-16 Vipers. On Sept. 5, 2019, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Mark Kelly, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, told attendees at the 2019 Defense News Conference that the service’s active duty F-16s were above the 80 percent mission capable rate goal, but that Vipers in the “reserve component,” those in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, had not yet hit the target. A US Air Force F-16C Viper., USAF This did not stop Kelly from boasting that the F-16 might be the only aircraft type to meet Mattis’ requirements. The Pentagon and the Air Force had previously announced that no variants of the F-35 , nor the F-22 , would reach 80 percent mission capable by the end of the Fiscal Year. A host of issues, including spare parts shortages and maintenance backlogs , prevented the F-35 from reaching its goal, while the F-22 has long struggled with low availability rates simply due to the complexities involved in operating and maintaining that aircraft and its relatively tiny fleet size. In June 2019, U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Fighters and Bombers, said that the havoc that Hurricane Michael had wrought on Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, previously a major F-22 hub, in 2018, had actually improved readiness for the Raptors. This was because the service had been forced to consolidate the stealthy jets, which increased the total number of jets available in any form to other units. As such, there were additional backups available when aircraft needed to go in for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance or to help meet other spikes in operational demands . An F-22 Raptor links up with a tanker somewhere in the Middle East., USAF All told, it’s clear that the Navy, as well as the Air Force, have made important strides in improving the readiness of their F/A-18E/F and F-16 fleets respectively. The lessons the two services have learned over the past year will be extremely valuable going forward. At the same time, it’s unclear whether either type of aircraft has truly hit the 80 percent target, as Mattis intended. Even if they have, it’s unclear whether the two services will be able to sustain those mission capable rates for the Vipers and Super Hornets, or even keep them anywhere close to this high, going forward. Update 9/25/2019: The Navy has clarified what it means by “operational” F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers. “Operational F/A-18 E/F ‘Super Hornet’ and EA-18G ‘Growler’ include Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) from the nine operational carrier air wing squadrons that form the backbone of our Naval Aviation tactical airpower,” Greg Kuntz, the Communications Director for the Naval Aviation Enterprise, wrote in an Email to The War Zone . In addition, Kuntz said that U.S. Marine Corps legacy F/A-18 Hornets had hit “80% mission capable readiness benchmark several times throughout the past year.” This does not mean that the Marines have been able to sustain this mission capable rate for a protracted period of time, however.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 1, 2019",China’s Reported Plan To Deploy Weaponless Stealth Drones On Its Carriers Make Perfect Sense,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have received many questions regarding a report in the South China Morning Post that claims China’s Sharp Sword stealth flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) will be deployed aboard the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carriers in the not so distant future. The article states that according to its undisclosed sources, the drone would be unarmed and would work in a reconnaissance role. Readers seemed puzzled as to why this would be, but the reality is that it makes perfect sense and goes along with my thoughts on the topic dating back nearly a decade. Those unarmed stealthy drones would actually represent the most deadly aircraft in China’s carrier air wing. Here’s why. We have been closely tracking China’s remarkable progress in advanced , stealthy, unmanned aircraft technology over the years. Keeping in mind that Beijing only shows us what they want us to see, China is clearly and deeply committed to developing stealthily unmanned combat air vehicles and building out the command, control, and communications infrastructure needed to get the most of them in future conflicts. They likely got a huge boost in this expansive endeavor after America’s RQ-170 Sentinel stealth spy drone fell into Iranian hands back in 2011. But that’s beside the point. The fact of the matter is that straight-up combat punch is just one mission objective when it comes to China’s work in developing these aircraft—surveillance and reconnaissance are the others. Above all else, China needs to develop and deploy intelligence-gathering systems that will enable its anti-access and area-denial capabilities—especially its anti-ship ballistic missiles and long-range anti-ship cruise missiles . These systems require near-real-time targeting data to get their terminal targeting seekers looking in the right spot during their final attack stage of flight. This means having an asset that can data-link pre-launch targeting information and even updated targeting information to the missile during its mid-course stage of flight. China is set to unveil an updated version of its Dark Sword stealthy flying-wing drone at the military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the PRC’s founding on October 1st in Beijing., Chinese Internet Such an act can be done via a number of methods, although those methods become more limited during an actual conflict. For instance, shadowing a flotilla with a ship can provide this data during a time of peace, but not during a time of war. Satellites may be able to provide some capabilities in this regard, but they too have major limitations and can be jammed, blinded, or destroyed during a conflict Maritime patrol aircraft that can fly far from their bases and are optimized for detecting and classifying ships at sea are among the best tools for the job, but during a time of war, getting within radar detection range and being able to survive to provide sustained targeting information to missile units hundreds or even thousands of miles away is a very questionable proposition—especially when trying to do so against a U.S. Navy carrier strike group. The Aegis umbrella that is backstopped by E-2 Hawkeye early warning aircraft and fighter patrols makes successfully bringing a maritime patrol aircraft’s sensors to bear on such an armada very questionable if not impossible if open hostilities are underway. This is where two types of unmanned aircraft come into play. First off, there are high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) remotely piloted vehicles that can fly across vast distances and leverage their high-altitude perch to stay farther away from the deadly maritime targets they are trying to locate. Such a craft could loiter just beyond the perimeter of an enemy flotilla’s defenses while providing targeting data to missile units. It could then scoot away once the missiles are well on their way and sufficient telemetry has been communicated to them so that they have a high probability of hitting their targets. China has multiple HALE designs flying—such as the Guizhou Soar Dragon and the Shenyang Divine Eagle . While these drones are great for scanning huge swathes of ocean for potential targets of interest over many hours of flight time—like America’s MQ-4C Triton —they are still quite vulnerable and they have to sortie from land bases that could be thousands of miles from an area of interest. Just this long dispatch time alone is problematic for detecting armadas at sea. They also rely entirely on satellite data-links that could be degraded during a time of war. Still, they can cover a lot of ocean area and could be especially effective when their use is paired with other types of intelligence. Soar Dragon, Chinese Internet Devine Eagle, Chinese Internet The second is the medium-altitude, medium-endurance (MAME) classes of drones that could theoretically be launched off an aircraft carrier. Such a craft can expand the sensor reach of China’s ski-jump configured flattops and their escorts. What it lacks in extreme range or attitude, it can make up for in higher sortie rates, higher-transit to station times, and forward deployability. As China’s carrier capabilities push farther into ‘blue water’—far away from land where even divert airfields are not within reach of the carrier’s aircraft—MAME drones could give China the ability to push its sensor capabilities farther out without relying on very long-range patrol aircraft or HALE drones. Add in stealth capability, and such a drone could venture close enough to enemy ships to not only detect their presence, but to continuously relay targeting data as to their whereabouts in a survivable manner. This data could be used to direct anti-ship missile attacks from Chinese warships, the carrier’s strike fighter aircraft, or long-range anti-ship cruise and especially anti-ship ballistic missiles located on land or launched from lumbering missile carrier aircraft . Ideally, an attack would be coordinated to involve a number of these capabilities simultaneously, making it far more challenging to defend against. Stealthy carrier-capable MAME drones also could provide a means of relaying this information without using onboard satellite data-links. By ‘daisy-chaining’ a few of these aircraft together over a long distance, they can relay information from the forward-most craft across the others via directional line-of-sight data-link, which can be very hard to detect or disrupt. The last craft on that chain can then relay the information down to a surface entry point, such a Navy ship, where it can then be sent up to satellites overhead and back to missile units on land or in the air. Otherwise, satellite connectivity isn’t really needed at all for targeting as the Chinese carrier strike group could prosecute its own standoff attack using the drone’s line-of-sight data-link telemetry alone. Configuring a stealthy UCAV like drone, such as Sharp Sword —which has been in flight testing for nearly six years now—for this mission makes great sense. Eliminating its weapons carriage capabilities would probably be necessary to reliably launch it off China’s ski-jump equipped carriers that don’t benefit from a catapult’s assistance. A configuration without a weapons bay would allow designers to tailor the aircraft’s weight, sensor, and fuel load to the ski-jump’s limitations. And as you can see by what we just discussed, its unarmed ‘hunter’ role would be far more impactful than an armed one, anyways. Sharp Sword seen during early testing. The aircraft first flew years ago and has supposedly been greatly refined in terms of its airframe’s low observability since then. , Chinese Internet Another angle of the Sharp Sword prototype. , Chinese Internet That’s not to say that an armed variant isn’t possible—once China’s catapult equipped carriers come online it is nearly a given—and a land-based model with weapons bays would fulfill a traditional UCAV role. So, it’s not really a one configuration or the other proposition, but when it comes to hunting and fixing enemy carrier strike groups or logistical convoys far out to sea, a carrier-based reconnaissance version would be an absolute game-changer. It would also make China’s carriers much more potent force multipliers than they currently are. It’s also worth noting that such an aircraft could provide other intelligence gathering and communications relay functions when not hunting for enemy flotillas. Regardless of if it ends up being a variant of Sharp Sword—there are other potential contenders —the possibility that China will pair its somewhat limited fixed-wing carrier capability with a stealthy surveillance drone is extremely high. It fits exactly with their anti-access/area denial strategy track record and with how they have an uncanny knack for finding weaknesses in America’s and its allies’ combat doctrine to exploit. CASIC Tian Ying stealthy flying-wing drone is another possible contender for shipboard operations. We speculated that could be the case based on its beefy landing gear alone., Chinese Internet The U.S. Navy had passed over its own promising stealthy strike and surveillance UCAV program just a few years ago . Instead, it pushed to develop an unarmed tanker drone with some basic surveillance potential. While many, including the author, found that to be an incredibly nearsighted mistake, it is worth noting that the aircraft chosen, Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray design , was adapted directly from the aforementioned UCAV program. Literally, the UCAV demonstrator’s airframe was reworked for the tanker competition . The follow-on UCLASS program that was meant to leverage incredible promise the X-47B demonstrators showed when it came to realizing a high-end and stealthy UCAV capability aboard American supercarriers was passed over for a much less ambitious unmanned tanker program. The move was seen as a horrible one by many inside and outside the force. , USN Even though the American carrier strike group features a far more robust surveillance umbrella than China’s, it still could benefit from a sensor carrying drone that can range out very far while also featuring low-observable features to reduce its detectability. With this in mind, it won’t be surprising at all if we see a stealthier version of Boeing’s MQ-25 quickly follow its tanker progenitor, essentially returning the design back to its original surveillance and strike configuration. Lockheed Martin, whose flying-wing concept lost the MQ-25 tender, also saw this as an eventuality . Still, much of the Navy’s MQ-25 program isn’t just about the plane, it is also about developing and deploying the infrastructure and operating concepts needed to field a semi-autonomous drone from an operational aircraft carrier. So once that infrastructure is in place, adding capabilities should be quite easy, especially if it means leveraging the same basic airframe as the tanker model. It will be interesting to see what country fields such a capability first, but at this point, it seems that China is already pursuing it and its forces definitely have a more pressing need for it than those of the United States. Just as I predicted in 2012, the ability to provide targeting information to China’s long-range missile forces is essential not just when it comes to making those capabilities work, but also for the deterrence factor behind its anti-access, area-denial strategy. You can bet that just photos of a stealthy Chinese drone operating from the country’s growing carrier fleet will serve as a wakeup call for many in regards to the realities of a very much unmanned air combat future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 23, 2019",Air Force Set To Deploy Its Counter-Drone “Phaser” Microwave Weapon Overseas,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it will deploy a prototype of Raytheon’s Phaser high-power microwave counter-drone system for an operational evaluation within months. The service has been experimenting with a number of anti-drone directed energy weapons , which also include lasers, in recent years as the threat of small unmanned aircraft has grown . A Raytheon representative has said that a recent mass drone attack that caused significant damage to oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia has highlighted these concerns “to the nth degree.” The Pentagon announced the deal, worth almost $16.3 million, in its daily contracting announcements on Sept. 23, 2019. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is managing the program, which it says will include a year-long evaluation of Phaser at an unspecified location “OCONUS,” or “outside the continental United States.” Work under the contract is set to wrap up on Dec. 20, 2020, meaning that this field test is set to start in January at the very latest. AFRL has previously tested Phaser at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. “Experimentation includes, but is not limited to 12 months of in-field operation by Air Force personnel against unmanned aerial systems threats,” the contracting notice explains. “In addition, experimentation includes but is not limited to operator training, in theater maintenance of systems while collecting availability (full mission capable, partial mission capable, non-mission capable), reliability, maintainability and supportability data, and system operation against real-world or simulated hostile vignettes without disrupting other necessary installation operations.” Phaser in its current form is a containerized high-power microwave directed energy weapon. Raytheon says one of its goals is to eventually be able to scale down the system into more portable, flexible forms. Raytheon’s Phaser system., Raytheon Radars or electro-optical and infrared cameras help cue the system to its targets. It then projects a beam of microwave energy that aims to disrupt a drone’s internal systems, causing it to fall out of the sky or possibly initiate a pre-programmed emergency procedure where it tries to lands or return to a point of origin. Phaser has the ability to switch from “disrupt” to “destroy” mode, in which it can send a burst of microwave energy sufficiently powerful enough high to fry electronic components inside an unmanned aircraft. The exact effect could be dependant on the system’s range to the target and level of component hardening within the drone. Depending on the effective range of the system, it could potentially destroy various electronics on other aerial threats , including manned aircraft, helicopters, and missiles. Depending on how Phaser’s turret is configured, it is possible that this beam could be aimed at targets on the ground, as well. The U.S. military has already been investigating the potential uses for high-power microwave weapons in ground roles, especially for force protection purposes , such as stopping threatening vehicles before they reach a base. It isn’t exactly clear how wide an effective microwave beam the Phaser can fire, but it is known to have been designed to counter groups of drones simultaneously, giving it real anti-swarm potential. It’s unlimited magazine also would help in repulsing sustained attacks from multiple groups of drones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=b-p1HKTIvy8 Phaser is one of three high-power microwave counter-drone systems that the Air Force is testing. BAE Systems, Leidos, and Verus Research worked under a separate AFRL contract to build the containerized Tactical High-Power Operational Responder design, or THOR . The third system is known as the Counter-Electronic High-Power Microwave Extended-Range Air Base Air Defense, or CHIMERA . THOR, which is supposed to engage targets at shorter ranges, “just simply wasn’t able to hit targets that mattered for mission,” Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Will Roper told a gathering at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in March 2019 . “I have no doubt that eventually the program will be back, that they’ll have tackled their technology challenge, and they’ll be ready to take the next step.” Less is known about CHIMERA, which the Air Force says is focused on engaging threats at medium-to-long ranges. The service expects to take delivery of a prototype of this system some time in the 2020 Fiscal Year, which begins next month. Phaser, which Raytheon has been working on in cooperation with various branches of the U.S. military since at least 2013, could offer a capable and more immediate option. The Massachusetts-based defense contractor says the system downed 33 drones, two and three at a time, during one previous U.S. Army exercise. “The beam is like a searchlight from a lighthouse,” Don Sullivan, chief technologist of directed energy at Raytheon’s Missile Systems business, said in 2018 . “The fact that you can simultaneously track and immediately move to the next target to address not just a swarm, but multiple swarms, is a big advantage.” That last point has become an increasingly pressing concern. Defending against mass drone attacks, to say nothing of swarms of small unmanned aircraft networked together and operating an autonomous swarm, has proven to be very difficult. Just this month, 18 suicide drones struck Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq oil processing facility, the largest of its kind in the world, causing significant damage. Saudi Arabian air defenses were completely ineffectual in responding the attack, which the government in Riyadh , as well as that of the United States and others , say was at least Iranian-sponsored, if Iranian operatives did not carry it out directly. Wreckage of what Saudi Arabia says are Iranian-made suicide drones, in the foreground, as well as Iranian-made land-attack cruise missiles, in the background, that the country recovered after attacks on its oil infrastructure earlier in September 2019., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense “There are fairly recent incidents, for example in Yemen where a very large drone with a high explosive payload killed about 40 people, at a prayer ground of all places. And that was on YouTube. It was a real eye-opener,” Raytheon’s Sullivan told Popular Mechanics . “What happened in Saudi over the weekend [of Sept. 14-15, 2019] was kind of that raised to the nth degree.” The potential threat that Iran’s growing drone capabilities pose, even to larger militaries, such as that of the United States, was already on display earlier this year. In July 2019, U.S. Marines on board the U.S. Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer brought down two Iranian drones in the tense Strait of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, using all-terrain vehicles on the ship’s deck equipped with radio frequency jammers. The latest incidents in Saudi Arabia have also highlighted how low the barrier to entry is for attacks using large numbers of small unmanned aircraft and, as a result, how great the threat actually is, something The War Zone has called attention to multiple times in the past . Drone use among smaller state actors, as well as non-state groups, will only increase in the future, in general. Last year, an AFRL representative notably said they had visited Afghanistan in 2017 and saw insurgent drones routinely monitoring American activities with impunity. Afghanistan is a very likely location for the Air Force’s upcoming 12-month test of Phaser. It is also possible that given recent events, that the service may decide to shift the location of the test to Saudi Arabia. These same experiences in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq , Yemen , and most recently in Saudi Arabia, among other countries , have continually underscored how lower-end point defenses may be the only defense against low- and slow-flying drones. These threats are difficult, if not impossible for many traditional air defense systems to detect and engage. At the same time, close-in defenses that rely on conventional weapons, such as a rapid-firing gun, may also not have the magazine depth necessary to engage an entire swarm of unmanned aircraft. For instance, the U.S. Army has a trailer-mounted version of the U.S. Navy’s Mk 15 Phalanx Close-in Weapon System (CIWS) called Centurion , which features a 20mm Vulcan cannon , for defense against artillery shells and rockets and mortar bombs. It is now in the process of updating these systems to be able to engage small unmanned aircraft, as well. The U.S. Army is also upgrading its Stinger short-range surface-to-air missiles to be better able to engage low- and slow-flying unmanned aircraft. That service is also experimenting with the concept of countering swarms of small drones with its own swarms of suicidal drones, as well, another concept The War Zone has put forward for some time. The same realities apply in naval settings, as well. Most U.S. Navy ships have either Phalanx or the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) to provide close-in protection. That service has already deployed laser-based directed energy weapons on ships in an experimental capacity as possible options for tackle the increasing drone threat and there are navalized high-power microwave systems in development, as well. Directed energy weapons show real promise when it comes to countering the growing drone threat, but high-power microwaves are especially attractive because of their potential ability to knock multiple drones out of the sky at once and then quickly engage other swarms. How Phaser performs, or doesn’t, during its field test, will provide valuable additional information about the exact capabilities the U.S. military requires to respond to the already serious threat that small drones pose.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 19, 2019",U.S. Destroyer Arrives Off Saudi Arabia Amid Plans To Bolster The Kingdom’s Air Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has reportedly deployed the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Nitze to the northern end of the Persian Gulf ostensibly to help shore up Saudi Arabian air defenses in the wake of unprecedented mass cruise missile and suicide drone attacks on sites critical to the country’s oil industry. The U.S. military is now in the process of drafting up plans to send additional air and missile defense assets and other forces to Saudi Arabia, as well as the United Arab Emirates, to help shield against any future attacks. Existing Saudi surface-to-air missile systems and anti-aircraft guns, particularly those situated in close proximity to the Abqaiq oil processing facility, were notably ineffective in repelling the attacks. Make sure to read our complete analysis on the strikes and the greater issues surrounding them, including the inability of modern air defense systems to deal with drone swarms, by clicking here. CBS News was first to report the movement of the Nitze on Sept. 20, 2019. Later that same day, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford announced plans for a “moderate” deployment of additional personnel to Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the near future, though they also stressed that no firm decisions had been made about the composition or total size of that force or where it would be positioned within the region. This comes a day after Saudi Arabian authorities presented the remains of various missiles and drones that they recovered after the attacks on Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field, as well as other detail about the incidents, which occurred on Sept. 14-15, 2019. Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Saudi Arabia says that the weapons involved came from Iran and were too short range to have flown to their targets from Yemen. The government in Riyadh has not yet blamed a specific group, though U.S. officials say they have separate evidence, which has not been presented publicly, showing that Iran directly carried out the strikes and that they originated in that country. A map showing Abqaiq and Khurais.  The solid blue and red circles indicate what the Saudis estimate the maximum range cruise missiles and suicide drones to have been, making impossible for them to have flown from Yemen., Saudi Arabian Ministry of Defense Nitze is part of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, which has been in the Middle East since May 2019 . The USS Abraham Lincoln , its air wing, and escorts rushed to the region ahead of schedule following the U.S. government’s announcement that month that intelligence showed the increased potential for attacks on American military personnel and other interests by Iran or its proxies. Armed with two Mk 41 Vertical Launch System arrays, with 96 launch cells between them, and equipped with the powerful Aegis radar and associated combat system, the Arleigh Burke class represents the most capable air defense system mankind has ever created. Each launch cell can accommodate a variety of weapons, including a single SM-2 , SM-6 , or SM-3 surface-to-air missiles or four smaller RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrows . Just having the ship in this location, where its radar and other sensors may be able to better detect missile or drone launches, provide early warning, and identify their points of origin, may also simply have a deterrent effect. The destroyer is also armed with Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles in some of those launch cells, which could launch retaliatory strikes on Iran over the attacks in Saudi Arabia, something the U.S. government is now reportedly considering . The ship could also work to quickly destroy the launch sites of any drone or cruise missile it detects going forward, if that information becomes available. It is interesting to remember that USS Nitze was involved in Tomahawk strikes on Houthi-controlled radar sites in Yemen in October 2016 after the Yemeni rebels fired anti-ship cruise missiles at American warships. If nothing else, the ship adds another layer of defense, and an especially capable one, against any additional attacks in the immediate future. This could be very reassuring to Saudi Arabia, which saw its air defenses situated around Abqaiq proved to be completely ineffective during the incidents last weekend. Satellite imagery of the oil processing facility has suggested that its point air defenses at the time of the attack may have consisted of a single battery of Shahine surface-to-air missiles and an array of Oerlikon GDF 35mm automatic guns. As of this week, emplacements that had held two other Oerlikon GDF batteries were empty, but it is unclear if this occurred before or after the strikes. At most, there would have been three sets of these guns. A battery of long-range Patriot surface-to-air missiles was also present to the southwest, having apparently shifted from another position to the northeast of the site. Again, it is unclear exactly when this movement occurred. Shahine, also known as the R460, is a version of the French-made Crotale that Thales-CSF developed specifically for Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s. The major difference is that Shahine’s launch units and its air search radar are mounted on armored, tracked chasses derived from the French AMX-30 main battle tank. Standard Crotale uses unarmored 4×4 wheeled carriers. Shahine’s launchers also carry six missiles instead of the usual four. As with Crotale, Shahine cues its command-guided missiles with a combintion of radar and electro-optical and infrared cameras to zero in on their targets. This system has been in operational use in Saudi Arabia since 1980. Components of a Saudi Arabian Shahine surface-to-air missile system, including two launcher vehicles and an air search radar vehicle in the middle., Government of Saudi Arabia Starting in 1988, Saudi Arabia also began acquiring Skyguard fire control systems to improve the capabilities of its Oerlikon GDFs, which the country had purchased more than a decade earlier. The complete Skyguard system includes an air search radar, a fire control radar, and an optical tracking system. The video below shows Romanian Oerlikon GDF guns in action during an exercise. Shahine can operate in an entirely automatic mode, while Skyguard can be set up so that the associated guns automatically lock on to the targets that the system detects. The maximum target detection range, under optimal conditions, for both systems, which were intended to look for large aircraft and helicopter-sized threats, is just under 12 and a half miles. This is beyond the maximum effective range of both Shahine’s missiles and the Oerlikon GDF’s 35mm shells. The range at which these systems could have detected the smaller cruise missiles and suicide drones that Saudi Arabia has said were involved in the attacks would likely have been much shorter than that and other ground clutter may have helped mask their approach. All told, even if the systems were operating in their most automated modes, Saudi air defenders would have had just minutes—or seconds—to spot and then attempt to engage those threats. The Patriot battery in the area with its more powerful AN/MPQ-53 radar may have offered more advance warning, but it could still have had trouble separating the small, low-flying, and the case of the drones, slow-flying threats from background ground clutter, especially depending on its exact position in relation to the attacks. Abqaiq, as well as Khurais, are full of complex, metallic, radar-reflecting structures that could make spotting and engaging missiles or drones at very low altitudes potentially challenging from certain angles. We also have no way of knowing what the alert posture was for the Saudi Arabian forces around Abqaiq and what direction their radars would have been focused on, if they were even switched on at all. There are reports that have indicated that the country’s air defense networks, as a whole, have been almost exclusively pointed south toward Yemen, given the threat from Houthi rebels. The Patriot battery near Abqaiq, with its directional phased array radar, now shows signs of having been reoriented to the north in the aftermath of the attacks. In addition, where ever the point of origin for the attacks turns out to have been, if the cruise missile and suicide drones struck their targets from the northwest, as the Saudis, as well as the Americans, have asserted, this could have been a deliberate choice on the part of the attackers to try to avoid Saudi air defenses. It may also have simply been a way of an attempt to mask where the attacks originated from. Nitze deployment off the coast is certainly a first step toward increasing the air and missile defense capabilities in the region and, perhaps more importantly, just the ability to better monitor the air space in and around the northern end of the Persian Gulf. The additional American deployments, which Secretary of Defense Esper and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dunford said they would have more details on next week, will almost certainly include additional Patriot batteries and associated radars, among other assets. The United States had already announced plans to deploy Patriots to Saudi Arabia in July 2019 . Esper and Dunford also said that the U.S. government would look to fast-track additional military aid to the Saudis, which could prove controversial. Many members of Congress have sought to slow the flow of arms to Saudi Arabia over allegations of war crimes in Yemen and the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last year. US Army troops practice loading a Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates., US Army In addition, Esper and Dunford called upon other members of the international community to consider contributing to the increased air defenses in Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S.-backed maritime security effort in and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz , which is also aimed at deterring Iranian aggression. Saudi Arabia itself has previously said it has reached out to South Korea about unspecified air defense assistance. “Regardless of where you think it came from, the fact is, the Saudis were attacked by both drones and cruise missiles and are still vulnerable to attack,” Esper said. It is important to note that Abqaiq is the world largest oil processing facility and has been responsible for approximately 10 percent of oil production worldwide. This makes the limits of the Saudi’s previous defense posture all the more glaring. It is, of course, worth remembering that no air defense network is perfect, or anywhere close to perfect, something the War Zone covered in great depth as part of our initial analysis of the attacks. No matter what additional air and missile defense assets arrive in Saudi Arabia, there could continue to be potential threats to facilities, such as those in Abqaiq. The previous attacks also highlight the immense burdens placed on defenders to protect against even relatively modest standoff strikes and underscore the rapidly evolving risk calculus for even major military powers when considering risks from missile and saturating drone attacks. “No single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that,” Dunford said at the press conference late on Sept. 20, 2019. “A layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk.” It’s also worth noting, that while The Kingdom is a U.S. ally and a strategic concern due to its oil production, it is also its biggest foreign customer of American air defense systems. Just recently, the Saudis splurged on what would be an unprecedented upgrade to their air defense ecosystem worth tens of billions of dollars—huge business for the defense industry in the United States. But those upgrades are focused more on countering ballistic missiles and traditional threats, not swarming drones or hordes of low-flying, relatively crude cruise missiles. The Pentagon’s reactionary move to backstop the existing Saudi air defense network could also be seen in part as a move to stand behind the weapon systems the Saudis are buying or have already bought, and especially considering the Trump administration’s close ties to the Saudi royal court. The Houthis, for their part, have claimed that they will stop firing missiles and suicide drones into Saudi Arabia entirely and will continue with that moratorium if the Saudis return the gesture and cease strikes on them. The Yemeni rebels have proposed such ceasefires in the past, without meaningful results in either direction, and it is unclear if this offer is genuine or is officials in Riyadh accept it in an effort to deescalate tensions. Iran continues to deny any involvement in the latest attacks on Saudi Arabia and also says it will not sit down to talks with the United States unless the U.S. government eases sanctions. This looks unlikely to occur given that U.S. President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Iran’s central bank on Sept. 20, 2019. Iran has also threatened to retaliate if the U.S. military launches any strikes against its territory. “We have many other military options available, should they be necessary,” Esper said at the press conference. “We urge the Iranian leadership to cease their destructive and destabilizing activities and to move forward on a peaceful diplomatic path.” There’s no indication that the Iranians feel inclined to change course yet, but whether that leads to more direct action from the United States or its partners remains to be seen. In the meantime, the U.S. government seems focused on bolstering Saudi Arabia’s defenses against any new attacks with assets such as the Nitze .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 5, 2018",CIA Releases Photo Taken Just Before Its Operatives First Entered Afghanistan After 9/11,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The CIA has been publishing some very interesting information related to Operation Jawbreaker, its foray into Afghanistan just days after the 9/11 attacks, including a highly intriguing image showing its armed operatives inside a Mi-17 Hip helicopter, likely the same one that would ferry them and bags full of millions of dollars from Uzbekistan into Afghanistan. That act would be the first American operation in the Taliban-controlled failed state after 9/11 and would begin a war in that country that is ongoing still to this very day. The image shows the open rear of a Russian-built Mi-17 with heavily armed men sitting on ammunition cans in the back with just ropes tied around them to ensure they don’t fall to their death if they slip out the back during flight. The mission depicted took place on September 19th, 2001, just eight days after the attacks on 9/11. The CIA says it was to pick up $3M in cash in three cardboard boxes. That money would be used to pay the Northern Alliance to spearhead the fight against the Taliban and to buy the allegiance of local warlords. One man is seen holding an early version of the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. The other has a tricked-out M4 with an M203 grenade launcher, a Trijicon Reflex sight, and what looks like a Surefire M500 flashlight attached. An extra magazine is also seen attached to the one loaded into the weapon’s magazine well. Both are also carrying sidearms. Beyond that, the two men are casually dressed and only the one with the M249 appears to be wearing body armor in the form of a vest from and wearing an American Body Armor. One is wearing a flight helmet, while the other is not, as well. Also visible is a box of Nestle bottled water and a crew chief preparing the helicopter for flight. The cabin is packed full of other indiscernible items, but we do know that $3M in cash was part of its cargo manifest. Maybe the Nestle box was actually packed with greenbacks, which would make a lot of sense. On September 26th, 2001, the modified Mi-17 “91101” would infiltrate at night into Northern Afghanistan and America’s mission in that country would officially begin.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 21, 2020",Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray Carrier-Based Tanker Drone Demonstrator Flies For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based tanker drone test asset, known as T1, has flown for the first time at MidAmerica Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. The company is developing the Stingray for the U.S. Navy and plans to continue testing T1 in the coming years as it works toward the first flight of a full engineering and manufacturing development prototype in 2021. T1, short for “Tail 1,” which also carries the U.S. civil registration code N234MQ, conducted an autonomous taxi and takeoff and then flew an approximately two-hour-long predetermined route on Sept. 19, 2019 . Boeing test pilots oversaw the unmanned aircraft’s flight from a ground control station at MidAmerica Airport, where this complete initial flight test program will occur. The drone arrived at the airport, which is co-located with the U.S. Air Force’s Scott Air Force Base, in April 2019 . Boeing had conducted a variety of ground tests at its St. Louis plant before that. “Today’s flight is an exciting and significant milestone for our program and the Navy,” U.S. Navy Captain Chad Reed, the service’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) program manager, said in a statement . “The flight of this test asset two years before our first MQ-25 arrives represents the first big step in a series of early learning opportunities that are helping us progress toward delivery of a game-changing capability for the carrier air wing and strike group commanders.” “Seeing [the] MQ-25 in the sky is a testament to our Boeing and Navy team working the technology, systems, and processes that are helping get [the] MQ-25 to the carrier,” Dave Bujold, Boeing’s MQ-25 Program Director, said in a separate press release . “This aircraft and its flight test program ensures we’re delivering the MQ-25 to the carrier fleet with the safety, reliability, and capability the U.S. Navy needs to conduct its vital mission.” T1 takes off from MidAmerica Airport., Boeing T1 received its experimental airworthiness certificate earlier in September, according to Boeing. This is a little over a year after the company won the $805 million contract, to develop and build the MQ-25, beating out General Atomics and Lockheed Martin . This was a major win for the company and a vindication of its pioneering unmanned aircraft developments in the early 2000s, despite years of subsequent disappointments, as the War Zone explored in-depth shortly after the contract award. Experience with the test asset will help inform work on engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) prototypes, the first two of which the Navy expects to take delivery of in 2021. Boeing’s contract requires it to supply a total of four of these prototypes, along with ground control stations and other ancillary equipment and services, to the Navy by 2024 . T1 on the ground., Boeing “Part of what we’re doing by flying this test asset this year is figuring out how fast can we go,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Brian Corey, the Program Executive Officer for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons, said at the Navy League’s 2019 Sea Air Space symposium in May 2019 . “How much work can we get done on that vehicle before we build our first [contracted] vehicle?” “By the time the Navy’s assets are jumping in the air, we will already have had thousands of test hours on the ground and hundreds in the air,” Boeing’s Bujold had told Defense One in an interview the month before. The T1 test asset itself is a modified version of the unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) demonstrator that Boeing had initially developed for the Navy’s abortive Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS), a saga the War Zone has previously covered in detail , and which eventually evolved into the current UCA program and the MQ-25 Stingray. The MQ-25 could have a revolutionary impact on the Navy’s carrier air wings and how they conduct operations . It will also ease the strain on the service’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , which presently spend considerable flight hours acting as small tankers for other carrier-based aircraft. You can read more about how the Stingray could change how the service’s carrier air wings operate in this past War Zone story . With T1 now flying at MidAmerica Airport, we may begin to learn more about where Boeing expects to take this initial stage of the MQ-25’s development and what capabilities the unmanned aircraft already has now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 1, 2020",Air Force Says It Will Be Years Before Boeing’s Faulty New Tankers Are Fully Operational,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has admitted that it will not be able to deploy its new KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tankers on operational missions for at least another three to four years, due to persistent technical and quality control problems . This comes as the service continues to take delivery of the aircraft, which have hundreds of issues still left to fix, and that appear to have extremely limited utility in the interim. The mounting delays could have cascading impacts on its plans to retire older KC-135 and KC-10 tankers in the coming years. U.S. Air Force General Maryanne Miller, head of Air Mobility Command, which oversees the bulk of the service’s cargo and tanker fleets, gave reporters the update on the long-troubled KC-46 program on the last day of the Air Force Association’s main annual convention outside Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18, 2019. The service finally accepted the first Pegasus from the manufacturer, Boeing, in January 2019, years behind schedule, after the company agreed to a roadmap for resolving significant remaining technical problems. At that time, there were three so-called “Category One deficiencies,” the most serious category covering problems that prevent an aircraft from properly carrying out core missions. One relates to the boom operator’s remote vision system (RVS), one has to do with the aircraft’s boom, and the third is a boom problem that may be tied to the RVS issue. On Sept. 11, 2019, the Air Force revealed that a fourth Category One deficiency, having to do with the aircraft’s cargo locking system , had also emerged and would need fixing. This is to say nothing of quality control problems on Boeing’s production line that have led to hazardous foreign object debris ending up inside completed planes, which, in turn, have necessitated extensive and costly inspections. This year, the Air Force stopped accepting KC-46s on multiple occasions over FOD, leading to additional delays. The service’s original plan was to have received 18 of an initial batch of 52 Pegasus tankers by the end of 2017. As of September 2019 , the service had taken delivery of 18 aircraft and accepted future delivery of another one. A KC-46 lands at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas in July 2019., USAF “When we accepted the KC-46 with known Cat One deficiencies, we did so with the belief that it offered the fastest route to achieve limited operational capability and meet an urgent warfighter requirement,” General Miller said . “Eight months have passed since our first delivery and Boeing has not made the progress needed in addressing this deficiency,” she added, referring to the RVS specifically. “This is a pass-fail requirement,” she continued . “We’ll get it [the KC-46A] in the fight in the next four years.” The RVS has been a particularly glaring issue, given that it is central to the Pegasus’ ability to perform its core mission. Unlike previous Air Force tankers, where an operator would lie or sit in the tail section of the jet to control the boom during refueling operations, that individual now sits in the main cabin. They control the boom via a complex stereoscopic vision system that blends two- and three-dimensional video feeds from electro-optical and infrared cameras mounted at the rear of the plane. The issue is that testing has shown that this arrangement does not always give the operator, who has to wear special 3D glasses, an accurate sense of where the boom actually is, which can lead them to move it erratically, raising the risks that it may end up damaged from the excessive forces or smack into the receiving aircraft. General Miller said that boom operators, who are responsible for an “inherently dangerous” job, have the equivalent of 20/50 vision and limited depth perception using the current system. In medical terms , 20/50 vision is a level of near-sightedness where a person is able to see something clearly at 20 feet that an individual with unimpaired vision can see without issue at 50 feet. A view of the boom operator’s station inside the KC-46., USAF One of the other Category One deficiencies specifically has to do with a separate problem of the boom scraping against planes during refueling, which the Air Force believes is a direct result of the RVS issues. You can read more about how the RVS is supposed to work and the problems it has experienced so far in this past War Zone piece . As part of the acceptance agreement earlier this year, Boeing agreed to redesign the RVS entirely, a process the Air Force has already acknowledged could take between three and four years to complete. General Miller’s statements would seem to confirm the War Zone ‘s past analysis that this could only prevent the tankers from being able to conduct meaningful real-world operations in the interim. It is very probable that the service will also need to put boom operators through at least a remedial training regimen when the new RVS system gets installed on the aircraft due to what could be substantial differences in its functionality over the existing arrangement, which would contribute to this delay in reaching initial operational capability. There is a separate Category One issue with the boom itself, where it has difficulties staying connected to the receiving aircraft, especially in lower speed flight regimes. This has notably been an issue in testing with fully-loaded A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft, though it could potentially impact the refueling of other slower-flying planes. The Air Force has accepted that Boeing’s current design met its original requirements and has agreed to pay the planemaker $55.5 million to make the necessary changes to the boom. On Sept. 16, 2019, the Department of Defense Inspector General announced it would be investigating if the service adequately followed the appropriate systems engineering processes when it developed the boom requirements. Whatever the investigators find, the Air Force hopes to have the boom issue resolved by 2021. A closeup of the KC-46’s boom, with elements of the RVS’ camera arrangement also visible on the underside of the aircraft’s rear fuselage., USAF It’s important to note that the KC-46A also has an important secondary cargo and personnel transport mission, as do the Air Force’s existing KC-135s and KC-10s, which it could potentially perform in the interim. However, the service has now banned the aircraft from carrying any such loads until Boeing can resolve a problem with cargo locks on the main cabin floor that emerged during a recent long-range, multi-leg, operational test and evaluation flight. “Prior to departing for each of these missions, aircrew fully installed, locked and thoroughly inspected each restraint, and performed routine inspections of the restraints in flight,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Damien Pickart, an Air Mobility Command spokesperson, told Defense News earlier in September 2019. “Despite these safety measures, the unlocking of cargo floor restraints occurred during flight, although no cargo or equipment moved and there was no specific risk to the aircraft or crew.” Unsecured cargo runs the risk of shifting in flight, potentially injuring personnel inside the aircraft or causing physical damage. Depending on the exact load configuration, a dramatic shift in weight could prove catastrophic to the plane’s performance and lead to a crash or other serious mishap. A view inside the KC-46’s main cargo cabin., USAF There exact root cause of this issue is unclear and there is no firm schedule for when the Air Force expects Boeing to resolve it, though it is “a fairly simple design solution,” Jamie Burgess, the KC-46 program manager at Boeing, told Defense One . The Air Force said that it might use cargo straps to secure cargo inside the aircraft until then. What this means, in the meantime, is that the KC-46s will not be able to deploy operationally as either tankers or transports and will have extremely limited capabilities to perform those functions even in non-combat scenarios, such as during training exercises or supporting testing of other aircraft. The Pegasuses were notably absent from Air Mobility Command’s recent Mobility Guardian 2019 exercise , the largest of its kind since the Air Force rebooted the annual event in 2017. This is the Air Force’s premier air mobility exercise, which also involves aircraft and personnel from multiple foreign allies and partners. The ability to provide large scale tanker and other logistical support during sustained operations is a growing concern within the service. Mobility Guardian and similar, smaller exercises are part of a larger effort to ensure that the Air Force can rapidly deploy to and operate in a particular theater of operations, potentially in the face of significant hostile opposition during a major conflict, issues The War Zone has previously covered in-depth . A Boeing infographic showing the KC-46’s features, including its multi-role capabilities., Boeing General Miller also said that there were another 500 smaller, unspecified issues with the aircraft that still need to be resolved, as well. Given the Air Force has already accepted 19 of the aircraft and is expecting to take delivery of three more tankers every month for the foreseeable future, it is unclear how much it might ultimately cost and how much time it could take the Air Force to bring the entire fleet up to the same standard. The kind of acquisition process, known as concurrency , has caused significant issues in the operation and sustainment of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter fleets across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. It is worth noting that, unlike the F-35, the Air Force has a fixed contract with Boeing for the KC-46, which has forced the company to pay millions out of pocket to resolve various issue already. The service has also withheld more than $500 million to date over the firm’s failure to meet the contract’s stipulations. Delays in getting the KC-46s operational are also forcing the Air Force to reconsider its plans to begin retiring existing KC-135s and KC-10s in the coming years.  “I’d love to slow down the retirement [of the KC-135] because I have to keep booms in the air,” General Miller remarked . A KC-135 flies in the foreground as a KC-10 prepared to refuel a KC-46., USAF This is at odds with written responses that Barbara Barrett, the present nominee to become the next Secretary of the Air Force, provided to Congress last week. She told legislators that it was her understanding that the Air Force would hit its internal threshold to being retiring tankers in November 2019. “Once tanker inventories reach 479, it is my understanding that the Air Force will begin divesting legacy tankers (96 KC-135s and all 59 KC-10s),” she wrote. “At the current delivery rate of three KC-46 aircraft per month, I understand the Air Force expects to reach that number by November.” It’s hard to see how this could still be the case given the details that General Miller has now disclosed. While the Air Force is certainly continuing to take deliveries of KC-46s, by Air Mobility Command’s own assessment, those aircraft are simply not capable of reasonably performing the tanking mission in their present configuration. It’s also not clear what this might mean for Boeing’s existing and potential foreign sales of the Pegasus. Japan has ordered two KC-46s and is interested in buying four more . Israel is reportedly leaning toward buying the tankers, as well. Hopefully, the present schedule will hold and within four years the KC-46 may finally meet basic expectations. For the time being, however, the service will have to continue to rely on its KC-135 and KC-10 fleets, while it is stuck paying to take delivery of and sustain new tankers with hundreds of remaining issues that it largely can’t use.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 17, 2019",Here’s All The New Info You Need To Know In The Aftermath Of The Saudi Oil Facilities Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabia has offered the first look at evidence it said it had collected after the unprecedented strikes on the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field this past weekend, which Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for . Saudi authorities said that missiles and suicide drones employed proved Iran had sponsored the attacks and that the weapons could not have flown to their targets from Yemen, views that the United States shares. However, Riyadh stopped short of blaming any particular party and significant questions remain as to the actual point of origin of the strikes. Make sure to catch up on the general details about these strikes as they are known in our previous post here and our initial, deeper analysis and commentary on why the attack succeeded, the realities of air defense system capabilities, and the larger issues at play here . Saudi Arabian Colonel Turki Al Malki, the top spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, presented the remains of multiple missiles and unmanned aircraft during a press briefing Riyadh on Sept. 18, 2019. He also said that the attack on Abqaiq consisted of 18 suicide drones, while the strikes on Khurais involved four cruise missiles. Three more cruise missiles, which appeared to be heading for Abqaiq, reportedly crashed before reaching their target. The attacks on the two locations occurred on the night of Sept. 14-15, 2019. The attacks came from the north, were “unquestionably sponsored by Iran,” and “did not originate from Yemen despite Iran’s best efforts to make it appear so,” Al Malki said during the press briefing . He further described the incident as “an attack on the global economy,” but did not specifically name the group or groups that Saudi Arabia may believe were responsible or where exactly those individuals launched the weapons in question from. Al Malki’s full briefing is available below: The Houthis’ main area of control is in southwestern Yemen, which is roughly 780 miles from Abqaiq and a slightly shorter distance to Khurais. The distance from the extreme northeastern corner of Yemen, where the rebels have had little to no control is around 530 miles from those sites. Abqaiq, specifically, which the Saudis now say was exclusively targeted by unmanned aircraft, is around 330 miles from southern Iraq and southwestern Iran. It’s also just 200 miles or so across the Persian Gulf from Iran. A map from Al Malki’s press briefing showing the locations of Abqaiq and Khurais. as well as Afif and Dwadmi, where additional attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure occurred in May 2019., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense A map with various range rings applied around Abqaiq and Khurais., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense Saudi Arabia described the cruise missiles they recovered pieces of as a variant of Iran’s air-launched Ya Ali , though there is no evidence as yet that aircraft launched the weapons in question. Initial observations showed that these weapons were similar, if not identical to the Quds 1 , a missile that the Houthis claimed to have first employed in June 2019 and revealed to the public a month later. That missile is ground-launched. The exact range of these missiles is unknown, but experts have placed it at around 435 miles based on the limitations of its engine, which appears to be a Czech-made TJ100 turbojet. This would be the same general range as the Ya Ali. We also don’t know the maximum range of the triangle-shaped suicide drones, which Saudi Arabia has referred to as “delta wings,” but they do appear relatively small. Al Malki’s briefing linked the design to one that appeared in 2014 at an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) exhibition, which has not been seen among the Houthis extensive drone arsenal , at least as of yet. The Saudi Colonel also showed items related to suicide drone strikes the Houthis claimed responsibility for on oil-related facilities in on Afif and Dawadmi, which occurred in May 2019, saying that the two incidents were directly related. This suggests that the Saudis may be of the belief that these earlier attacks may have originated from the same or similar locations outside of Yemen. A slide from Al Malki press briefing showing “delta wing” drones that Saudi Arabia said it recovered after the earlier attacks on Afif and Dawadmi. Saudi authorities say the same drones were also used to attack Abqaiq., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense It’s also worth noting that Saudi Arabia has incorrectly identified wreckage from past Houthi attacks and it is possible that we have not yet seen the full extent of the Yemeni rebels’ capabilities , which is at least the result of active Iranian support, if not direct shipments of completed weapons from Iran. After Malki’s press briefing the group made a televised claim to have a new suicide drone, which they called the Qasef 3, with an improved jet engine, implying added range, though there is no proof yet that this unmanned aircraft exists or that it was involved in any previous attacks. United Nations investigators in the past have also noted the rebel’s dubious past claims to have drones, which U.N. reports refer to as UAV-X , that can fly in excess of 900 miles. The Houthis also claimed they had footage from one of their drones striking the Abqaiq facility to prove they had carried out the attack. However, they appear to have only shown manipulated and dated Google Earth imagery of the site. The rebel group also does not appear to have the beyond-line-of-sight data links that would be necessary to have recorded this footage during the attacks. The evidence does seem to increasingly be pointing to a launch site somewhere other than Yemen, as well as Iran’s support for whoever carried out the attacks, but it also remains largely circumstantial. Without knowing the exact capabilities of the missiles and suicide drones in question, it is difficult to say conclusively where they came from. A collage of images relating to the “misfired” cruise missiles, which Saudi Arabia says landed at three separate locations, indicated by red ovals on the map, north of Abqaiq. A line also shows a potential flight path based on those locations, which traces back to southern Iraq., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense U.S. officials have claimed that the launch sites were inside Iran itself, but other reports have pointed to possible locations in southern Iraq. There is also the possibility that there were multiple, physically separated launch sites, which could potentially include boats in the Persian Gulf. If the missiles and suicide drones did fly from locations in southwestern Iran, it is also very likely that they would have had to cross over a part of Kuwait in order to reach their targets in Saudi Arabia from the north, as both American and Saudi officials have asserted. This raises questions about how this would have been possible without Kuwaiti authorities being aware. There is unconfirmed video , seen below, purporting to be of missile or drone-like objects flying over Kuwait on the night of Sept. 14, 2019, which the Kuwaiti government is now investigating . https://youtube.com/watch?v=9Absk3U3jaA Of course, as we at the War Zone noted in our initial analysis , air defense networks are hardly infallible and detecting low-flying missiles or small unmanned aircraft, and especially large volumes of them, can be particularly challenging. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that Saudi Arabia’s own defenses at Abqaiq are present, but somewhat limited considering it’s the largest facility of its type anywhere in the world, which, before the attacks, was responsible for the production of approximately 10 percent of the world’s oil. The point defenses partially rely on fairly dated Shahine surface-to-air missile systems—although they were likely upgraded in some manner—a variant of the French Crotale , and arrays of Oerlikon GDF 35mm guns aided by Skyguard fire control radars . There is no indication that whoever launched the attacks even concerned themselves with attempting to destroy those defenses first. Clearly, they were not effective in repelling the attack. The United States reportedly has radar tracks and other intelligence to support its conclusions about the point of origin of the attacks, though the U.S. government has not yet been able or willing to release that information to the public. An anonymous U.S. official reportedly told CBS News that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the operation, but under the condition that it would be impossible to trace it back to Iran. Depending on the state of the wreckage, Saudi Arabia or its partners may be able to glean additional details from the guidance systems on the weapons. The Saudis were previously able to trace a Houthi suicide drone boat back to Iran by downloading pulling GPS data from its navigation system. For the moment, the Saudis do appear to be cautiously avoiding direct attribution for the attacks and they have called for an independent United Nations investigation into the incidents. A previous U.N. review of attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman earlier this year, which the United States and others have also accused Iran of being involved in, said an unspecified “state actor” was responsible. A briefing slide showing damage at Abqaiq after the attacks., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense Another briefing slide showing damage at Khurais., Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense The United States, which had been more open with its accusations, is also reportedly seeking a response from the United Nations Security Council. The Iranians, for their part, continue to deny any involvement whatsoever and have threatened to retaliate if the U.S. military launches strikes against targets within its borders. The Houthis separately issued their own threats, including against the United Arab Emirates , which is curious given that the UAE recently announced the end of its involvement in Saudi-led coalition operations against the Yemeni rebels. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will look to impose even more sanctions on Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is now in Saudi Arabia, declared the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais to have been an “act of war.” Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator from South Carolina, who has been a principle confident of Trump’s in the past year or so, also echoed that same sentiment . US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at left, sits with Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed Bin Salman, on Sept. 18, 2019., US Department of State Still, despite some calls for a U.S. military response, there appears to be no consensus within the U.S. government about how to proceed. These divisions have been perhaps most visible in Tweets between Graham and Trump, in which the Senator suggested that the decision not to strike Iran after the IRGC shot down a U.S. Navy drone in June 2019 was a sign of weakness. The President responded angrily and said his decision not to proceed with the retaliatory operation had actually been a show of great strength. In the meantime, the Pentagon has said it will continue to work to support the defense of Saudi Arabia, as well as providing assistance for the ongoing investigation into the attacks. On Sept. 18, 2019, the U.S. Air Force also sent a pair of fully-armed F-15E Strike Eagles , together with a C-130H Hercules carrying support personnel and equipment, from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, where American forces are expanding their presence. This was ostensibly part of an exercise to demonstrate the ability to rapidly reposition assets in the region and conduct operations from alternate bases , if necessary. The Air Force has been increasingly interested in developing these capabilities , in general, but this particular movement also highlights how the United States might be able to quickly respond to crises in the Kingdom from its existing bases in the region. An F-15E Strike Eagle departs Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates for Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia as part of an exercise on Sept. 18, 2019., USAF Saudi Arabia has now also formally joined the new U.S.-backed maritime security mission in and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz . Riyadh has also reached out to other partners for support, notably announcing discussions with South Korea about unspecified efforts to improve its air defenses. South Korean defense contractors have been already quietly expanding sales and other cooperation to the Kingdom. Any responses to the attacks, including military action, may only come after the end of the annual gathering to mark the opening of the latest sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, which officially began yesterday. Trump is scheduled to address to this body on Sept. 24, 2019, and the topics of Iran and Saudi Arabia are almost certain to be major topics of discussion between various national delegations now descending on the United Nations’ headquarters in New York City. “Iranian officials will never talk to America … this is part of their policy to put pressure on Iran,” Ayatollah Khamenei, had said on Sept. 17, 2019, dismissing the prospect for any negotiations between the two countries in New York. “Their policy of maximum pressure will fail.” This position may soften depending on whether or not the United States and Saudi Arabia can build significant international consensus regarding Iran’s direct culpability in the recent attacks. That same consensus may also lower the threshold for some form of military response against Iran. Whatever happens, we have now seen what is likely just the first tranche of evidence surrounding the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais and more is almost certain to emerge in the coming days or weeks. In the meantime, tensions in the Middle East are escalating yet again and it’s unclear what it may take to avoid a conflict of some kind following this “act of war.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 1, 2019",Is Raytheon’s Pint-Sized Peregrine The Air-To-Air Missile The Pentagon Has Been Waiting For?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Raytheon recently unveiled a new medium-range missile design that is roughly half the size of the company’s existing AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM, but that it says will have equivalent and in some cases superior performance. The new weapon, called Peregrine, could effectively double the number of missiles that fighter jets such the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter or F-22 Raptor can carry internally, greatly increasing their magazine capacity when they are in their most stealthy configurations. The Massachusetts headquartered defense contractor revealed Peregrine publicly for the first time at the Air Force Association’s main annual convention outside Washington, D.C., on Sept. 16, 2019. The new missile is presently an internally-funded project and the plan is to offer it as a complement to the AIM-120, as well as the AIM-9X Sidewinder , both of which are Raytheon products, according to Aviation Week . The company says that Peregrine will have at least as much reach as an AMRAAM and the maneuverability of a Sidewinder, but in a package just six feet long and weighing only 150 pounds. The AIM-120 is around 12 feet in length and tips the scales at around 345 pounds. “Peregrine will allow U.S. and allied fighter pilots to carry more missiles into battle to maintain air dominance,” Dr. Thomas Bussing, the Vice President of Raytheon Advanced Missile Systems, said in a statement . “With its advanced sensor, guidance and propulsion systems packed into a much smaller airframe, this new weapon represents a significant leap forward in air-to-air missile development.” Concept art of the Peregrine missile., Raytheon Raytheon has otherwise offered limited details so far about its missile’s exact capabilities and features. Mark Noyes, Raytheon Missile Systems Vice President of Business Development and Strategy, told Aviation Week that Peregrine will have a “multi-mode autonomous seeker” and a “new, high-performance propulsion section,” but declined to offers specifics. The guidance system is tri-mode, according to FlightGlobal , but Raytheon would not say what functionalities it has exactly. A combination of the radar homing capabilities of the AIM-120 with the imaging infrared seeker of the AIM-9X would be the most likely options. This would offer an alternative means of finding the target in the event of electronic warfare jamming during the terminal phase of the missile’s flight. It similarly could rely on the radar seeker if the target’s defensive countermeasures blinded or confused its infrared optics. The third method of operation could be a capability to actively home in on a target’s electromagnetic emissions, such as those from its own radar. A data-link, which it will absolutely have, will only add to the missile’s range and ability to more easily kill targets at closer ranges. You can read all about how a data-link and lock-on-after-launch capability enhances an air-to-air missile’s capabilities dramatically in this previous piece of ours. Given the very conventional cylindrical shape of the missile’s body as seen so far in Raytheon’s concept art and physical models, the Peregrine uses an advanced rocket motor for propulsion. It’s also unclear what AMRAAM variant Raytheon is comparing Peregrine’s range to, as the capabilities of the later AIM-120C, and especially the AIM-120D, are very different from those of the earlier AIM-120A and B variants. Publicly available estimates put the AIM-120D’s maximum range at between 75 and 100 miles , which is also dependent on a wide variety of factors, including the state of the launch platform, such as its altitude and speed. “It will be beyond-medium-range. I can’t go into specifics, as you can appreciate,” Raytheon’s Noyes told FlightGlobal . “But it can do everything from short-range to beyond-visual-range to beyond-medium-range.” A multi-pulse rocket motor using improved, high-grain propellant might be able to provide this kind of range performance in a smaller package. Northrop Grumman uses similar rocket motor technology to give the AGM-88G Advanced Antiradiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) significantly greater range over the existing AGM-88E AARGM , but without increasing the weapon’s overall length. Raytheon itself has been investigating a high-grain propellent rocket motor as part of possible updates for the AIM-9X, something The War Zone recently covered in-depth . A US Navy briefing slide on the AARGM-ER showing the significant internal space devoted to its improved rocket motor., USN Advanced warhead technology, or possibly the elimination of the warhead entirely in favor of a hit-to-kill design that physically slams into its target to destroy it, could allow for more space to go to the propulsion system and its fuel, as well. Peregrine has a blast-fragmentation warhead, according to Aviation Week , but this conflicts with Raytheon’s own concept art, which only shows two brown bands on the body. These denote the presence of low-order explosives and are typically indicators of a missile’s rocket motor. A yellow band, for high explosives, generally shows the location of a warhead. “It will go supersonic and that’s attributable to that new lightweight airframe and high-performance modular control system,” Raytheon’s Noyes told Aviation Week . “That permits it [to] go and do incredible maneuvers, especially at the endgame where it’s needed most,” he continued, describing the kind of agility that would also be necessary for a hit-to-kill weapon. Raytheon concept art of Peregrine showing “live” missiles with only two brown bands., Raytheon Peregrine’s extreme maneuverability is the product of a thrust vectoring system, according to Flight Global . This feature is derived from technology developed for the AIM-9X. Peregrine doesn’t represent the first time a company has sought to develop a miniaturized beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. Lockheed Martin touted a very similar weapon, called Cuda, in the early 2010s , though it has largely disappeared from the company’s marketing in recent years. The Air Force has also been exploring this category of missiles in recent years through programs such as the Small Advanced Capability Missile (SACM) and Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM). From what we know of Cuda , this weapon was to offer a shorter range than the AIM-120 and was also expected to be hit-to-kill. Curiously, all of the concept art and models for this missile, however, showed a yellow band indicating a warhead in the forward body and what looked to be a pre-fragmented “sleeve” that would turn into a hail of shrapnel after the detonation. Concept art of Cuda showing a yellow band at the front behind what appears to be a fragmentation sleeve., Lockheed Martin It’s also worth noting that Raytheon lost the AIM-260 Joint Air Tactical Missile (JATM) competition to Lockheed Martin, but the company is still reportedly developing the Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW). Peregrine may leverage design features from the company’s JATM proposal or its work on LREW. Whatever the case, any half-size medium-range air-to-air missile could offer significant benefits to a modern combat jet, especially stealthy designs that have to carry their weapons internally to maximize their radar-evading capabilities. At present, the F-35, for example, can only carry four AIM-120s internally, while the F-22 can carry six in its main weapon bay. Peregrine offers the potential for those aircraft to double their magazine capacity without any major modifications. Lockheed Martin is also working on an upgrade for the Joint Strike Fighters, called Sidekick , that would allow them to carry three AMRAAMs in each of their bays. These aircraft could then be able to carry a dozen of Raytheon’s new missile. It would also solve the F-35’s problem of not having an American dogfight missile available for internal carriage. Even if Peregrine’s range turns out to be significantly less than the AIM-120D, the ability for stealthy aircraft to carry relatively large numbers of them in combination with full-size AMRAAMs, or future missiles, such as the AIM-260, could be extremely beneficial. The AIM-260, which you read about more in this past War Zone story , aims to be an AMRAAM-sized weapon with considerably greater range and other improvements. An F-22 Raptor fires an AIM-120., USAF A mixture of Peregrines and other weapons, including the AIM-260 and future subvariants of the AIM-9X, could offer pilots additional options for engaging targets and defending themselves. With its multi-mode guidance system, Raytheon’s new missile may have nascent air-to-surface capabilities that could also make it a useful tool for engaging other target sets, including pop-up air defense threats . Regardless, it will be extremely hard to jam, deceive, or outmaneuver. The value of Peregrine’s compact size isn’t limited to stealth fighter jets, either. Advanced fourth-generation fighter jets could massively increase their magazine depth, as well. It could be a useful addition to larger aircraft, even stealth bombers, such as the future B-21 , as an option for emergency self-defense against incoming missiles and other threats. It would also be an ideal armament option for smaller unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), which look increasingly set to become an important component of the aerial combat ecosystem in the future . Still, there are additional questions. If it has the same maneuverability as an AIM-9X, but the range of an AMRAAM, and a tri-mode seeker, would there still be a high-demand for AIM-9X outside of the demand to equip aircraft with wingtip rails? Likewise, where does the AIM-120 fit in? If this has the range of an AIM-120D, then that missile would only seem to offer more utility for taking down larger targets at the loss of major magazine capacity. If Peregrine has a similar range to the AIM-120C, but not the AIM-120D, it will be interesting to see if it cannibalizes some of that market share. Also, how much will it have to compete with USAF-funded missile programs that are ongoing, the details of which remain tightly guarded? Does Raytheon see this as a middle-end capability that will exist between the AIM-260 and AIM-9X once that new AIM-260 is in service? That would help offset some of the losses the company will experience from being knocked off its throne as America’s primary medium/long-range air-to-air missile supplier. But above all else, this could satisfy one of the F-22 Raptor pilot community’s biggest wishes—having more missiles to play with. The F-35 as well, but to a lesser degree at this time. Stealth fighters like the Raptor don’t require the long-range capability that the AIM-120D provides as they can get closer to their aerial opponents while remaining undetected under many circumstances. So, exchanging missile range for greater magazine depth is a very logical tradeoff for 5th generation fighter crews. 4th generation fighters, on the other hand, would put a higher premium on missile range to better offset their survivability deficiencies. Raytheon has not yet offered any details about a potential schedule for developing and testing Peregrine before formally bringing it to market. Aviation Week noted that the company had trademarked the name in August 2018, though it is still unclear how far along the project is already. The War Zone will certainly be keeping a close eye on this project, which could be an extremely important addition to the U.S. military’s aerial arsenal, as well as those of foreign customers, especially those also flying stealthy jets, such as the F-35, in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 14, 2019",The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Is Getting An F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has permanently loaned one of its remaining F-117A Nighthawk stealth combat aircraft to the Reagan Presidential Foundation, for eventual display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California. President Reagan was a major proponent of the then top-secret F-117 program , at one point even personally inviting the United Kingdom to become a partner in it. The Nighthawk will join a number of other storied aircraft at the museum. The F-117A Nighthawk destined for the Reagan Presidential Library is one of a dozen the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, or NMUSAF, has set aside to demilitarize and deeply modify so that it can loan them to museums, including those within the service itself, as part of the U.S. Air Force Heritage Program, Brian Brackens, an Air Force spokesperson, told The War Zone in an Email. NMUSAF has already taken delivery of its own F-117, which joins a pre-production YF-117 in that museum’s collection. Another 51 Nighthawks are still at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada and the service eventually plans to physically destroy the remaining 40 examples per Congressional mandate, as The War Zone was first to report . Development of the F-117 and its immediate predecessors certainly predates Reagan’s administration. The aircraft’s manufacturer Lockheed, now Lockheed Martin, had been at the forefront of the development of stealth technologies since the 1950s. The company’s Advanced Projects Division, better known as Skunk Works, developed the Have Blue stealth jet demonstrator in the 1970s and flew it for the first time just short of a year after President Jimmy Carter took office. Carter was still President when the development of the F-117, under program Senior Trend , formally began in 1978. An F-117 Nighthawk at Tonopah Test Range Airport in the 1980s., USAF It was the Reagan Administration that oversaw much of the Nighthawk’s development and its transition to operational status while still remaining in the heavily classified “black” realm. The first YF-117 flew some six months after Reagan’s inauguration in January 1981. The plane’s very existence remained secret until November 1988, less than six months before President George H.W. Bush took office. Though the program was top-secret, Reagan was certainly very impressed with the aircraft and considered employing them operationally during his tenure. In 1986, the U.S. Air Force’s 4450th Tactical Group, technically equipped with A-7 Corsair II aircraft, which served as a cover for the F-117s, received notice that they could be called upon to fly their first-ever combat mission in Libya. Earlier that year, Libyan agents had bombed the La Belle discothèque in what was then West Berlin , killing two American troops and a Turkish civilian and wounding more than 200 more people. Concerns about compromising the F-117 program eventually led non-stealthy U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft to conduct retaliatory strikes in Libya as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon . The Nighthawk’s first combat mission eventually came under President H.W. Bush during the American intervention in Panama in 1989, nicknamed Operation Just Cause . Reagan was also interested in offering one of America’s most prominent allies, the United Kingdom, a chance to acquire their own fleet of F-117s. In 2017, unsealed U.K. government records showed that the President had approached his British counterpart at the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, about joining the program in 1986. This was reportedly in part because of the United Kingdom had allowed the use of bases in its country for the El Dorado Canyon strikes. Former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, left, and former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, right, meet in 1990., Press Association via AP “Dear Margaret, I am delighted to hear that you will be able to see Cap [Caspar Weinberger, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense] to discuss the special program I wrote you about… I look forward to receiving your reaction. Sincerely, Ron,” one letter said. Someone had also written “STEALTH” lightly in pencil on the missive. “Dear Ron, I was immensely impressed by your splendid achievement: three cheers for America! … I was also very touched by the generosity of the offer of participation which [Cap] brought,” Thatcher had replied. Two Royal Air Force pilots had a chance to evaluate the aircraft directly, but the United Kingdom decided against buying any Nighthawks while the program was still “black.” Lockheed did pitch a derivative of the F-117 to the RAF again after the aircraft emerged into the public domain, but the U.K. Ministry of Defense again declined the offer, a separate story you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The F-117 will be in good company at the Reagan Presidential Library, as well. The museum already has a U.S. Navy F-14A Tomcat fighter jet painted to represent an aircraft that took part in the Gulf of Sidra Incident off the coast of Libya in 1981. During that altercation, a pair of F-14s shot down two Soviet-made Libyan Air Force Su-22 Fitter combat jets. The F-14 Tomcat on display at the Reagan Presidential Library., Lisa Barnum via Wikimedia A VC-137C that was used as “Air Force One,” a customized derivative of the Boeing 707 airliner, is also on display. The Air Force first began flying this aircraft, also known as SAM 27000 , in 1972, under President Richard Nixon and served President’s Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, as well. Under Carter, it flew the triumphant U.S. Men’s Hockey Team to Washington, D.C. after their victory against the Soviet Union at the 1980 Olympics. Carter’s last trip onboard came in 1981, when Reagan sent the former president and the jet to repatriate the last American 52 hostages that Iran had previously that Iran had held in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution against the Shah. Reagan is understood to have been its most prolific passenger, however, logging approximately 675,000 miles in travel on the plane in total across his two terms. It took him across the world, including to the three overseas summits he held with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. His last flight aboard SAM 27000 was in January 1989, when it flew him and former First Lady Nancy Reagan back to California after George H.W. Bush’s inauguration. President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan wave from the doorway of SAM 27000., Reagan Presidential Library SAM 2700 remained in service in the role as Air Force One until 1990, when the first of two new Boeing 747-based VC-25A Air Force One jets arrived. President Reagan had overseen the program to acquire these aircraft and Nancy Reagan was heavily involved in the crafting of their interior decor. The older VC-137C remained available as a backup aircraft and continued to perform other VVIP transport duties and ceremonial roles, including flying the body of former President Nixon to his final resting place at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. Its last flight was to ferry President George W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush to Texas in 2001. That same year, the Air Force retired it for good and turned it over to the Reagan Presidential Foundation. It now sits in the museum alongside a VH-3 Marine One helicopter , which Reagan also flew on during his two terms, and limousines and other vehicles that were part of or otherwise related to the motorcades he used during his presidency. The elaborate display of SAM 27000 at the library is absolutely breathtaking. SAM 27000 now on display at the Reagan Presidential Library., Reagan Presidential Library It’s not clear yet when the F-117 will go on display at the Reagan Presidential Library. When it does, though, it will join a short list of just four other F-117s that have been modified and placed on public display. The Nighthawk is sure to become another major draw for the museum, both for individuals interested in the President’s history and legacy and aviation enthusiasts, among whom the Nighthawk continues to be a hot topic of interest more than a decade after its official retirement .

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 27, 2024",Pentagon Orders Sudden Deployment Drill Of Unprecedented Size For Its Sealift Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Transportation Command, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command and the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration, kicked off a massive snap sealift exercise yesterday across the United States. It involves an unprecedented 28 ships from the Ready Reserve Force , a fleet of support ships with merchant marine crews that would be vital during any large scale conflict, but which has experienced serious readiness problems in recent years leading to concerns that they would be unable to support a sustained conflict abroad. The exercise, aptly nicknamed Turbo Activation, began on Sept. 16, 2019 , and involves crews from the Ready Reserve Force getting no-notice orders to “activate” their ships and get them ready for operations. The general goal of these exercises, four of which generally occur every fiscal year, is to validate the readiness of the vessels involved and test the ability of merchant mariners to get them operational within an assigned timeframe. How long a crew has to prepare varies from ship to ship and can be anywhere from four to 20 days . “The activated ships are directed to transition from a reduced operating status to a fully crewed status, with the quarters made habitable and cargo gear ready, within five days,” according to a press release from U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM). “Activations are commonly followed immediately by a sea trial.” The release does not say what ships have gotten activation orders, but does say that they are the Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) Ready Reserve Force, as well as from Military Sealift Command’s (MSC) “surge” fleet. These are spread around ports on the East and West Coasts of the United States, as well as ones on the Gulf of Mexico. The homeports of the ships in the Ready Reserve Force, as of December 2017., MARAD As of March 2019, the surge fleet included 15 roll-on/roll-off (RORO) cargo ships, while the Ready Reserve Force had 46 more ships. MARAD’s contingent 35 more RORO vessels and 11 “special mission ships,” which include tankers and ships with specialized capabilities, such as heavy lift cranes and aviation maintenance shops. One of the special mission ships, the M/V Cape Ray , notably carried elaborate equipment to support the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons in 2014. Merchant marines serve aboard both MSC and MARAD ships, but the crews of the former also include military personnel. When ships from MARAD’s Ready Reserve Force activate, they come under the direct operational control of MSC. Another approximately 60 U.S.-flagged commercial ships are part of the U.S. government’s Maritime Security Program and could get pressed into service during a crisis, but are not part of the standing reserve fleets. During any major contingency, these vessels would provide absolutely vital logistics capabilities, especially it there was a need to move large contingents of ground forces into a theater during the early phases of a particular operation. During sustained operations, these ships would become a critical link in the logistics chain . The RORO cargo ship M/V Cape Isabel arrives in San Diego during a Turbo Activation exercise in 2017., USAF So, it makes good sense to ensure that reserve fleets are ready and able to respond, if necessary. However, Turbo Activations, which first began in 1994, are typically relatively small affairs, often involving between three and five ships in total. “These exercises typically involve only a few ships, but this event targets 28 vessels for activation to provide a better assessment of the readiness of U.S. sealift forces than can be accomplished with fewer activations,” U.S. Transportation Command’s statement said . “This scale will also stress the underlying support network involved in maintaining, manning and operating the nation’s ready sealift forces.” This stress testing is particularly important at present given very serious concerns about the readiness of these ships, which emerged in detail earlier this year. As of March 2019, of the combined 61 ships in MSC and MARAD’s reserve fleets, 13 of them, or more than 20 percent of the total, were not mission capable. Another six were missing their certificate of inspection, a legal requirement for their operation under U.S. law. A “readiness snapshot” of MSC and MARAD reserve fleets as of March 2019., MARAD Even ships listed as mission capable have not always been able to meet their activation requirements. Turbo Activation exercises between 2010 and 2018 involved 127 attempted activations, in total, 10 percent of which were unsuccessful, according to a study from the RAND Corporation earlier this year. Some ships took part in more than one exercise during this period and failed multiple times to pass muster. A graph showing successful and unsuccessful activations during Turbo Activation exercises between 2010 and 2018, by ship., RAND With this in mind, it’s perhaps not surprising that the decision to dramatically scale up this particular exercise came only very recently. “The increased scale of this iteration [of Turbo Activation] was decided Sept. 10, during discussions between TRANSCOM and Navy leadership as part of an effort to better validate readiness,” U.S. Navy Captain Kevin Stephens, a TRANSCOM spokesperson, told The War Zone by Email in a follow-up. These are serious issues when one considers that the U.S. military’s activated 40 of these ships – 12 more than TRANSCOM is looking to put to sea in this latest exercise – in 2003 to support the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Though certainly a major conflict, that was still a relatively modest affair compared to what an extended, high-end conflict against a “global competitor,” such as Russia or China, might look like. Any conflict in the Pacific region, in particular, where “ tyranny of distance ” will be more pronounced and logistics chains will be spread across thousands of miles of open ocean, would see heavy demands on MSC and MARAD’s sealift capabilities. This isn’t even taking into account growing threats to logistics vessels and concerns about the availability of ships and other assets to escort them , which could lead to losses and further strain the reserve fleets’ overall capacity. The first-in-class guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke , at far left, sits next to, left to right, the M/V Cape Race , M/V Cape Ray , and M/V Cape Rise , all of which are part of MARAD’s Ready Reserve Force., USN The War Zone has explored these separate issues on multiple occasions in the past. This also comes as the U.S. Marine Corps is looking to move to a more distributed concept for sealift operations, a radical shift away from the traditional focus on large amphibious warfare ships, which you can ready about more in this recent feature . The Marines have already been experimenting with using reserve fleet ships for more limited deployments to help free up traditional amphibious ships for higher priority missions. All told, whatever the results of this greatly expanded iteration of Turbo Activation are, and no matter how many ships actually activate successfully, seeing what has been working, or not, to increase the readiness of MSC’s and MARAD’s reserve fleets will be extremely valuable for ensuring that these ships are indeed available when it matters most.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 13, 2019",Here’s The Air Force’s Questionably Ambitious Plan To Develop New Fighters In Five Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s top acquisition official has given new details about an ultra-ambitious plan to push defense contractors to design and build new fighter jet designs at a rate of once every five years. It’s a concept that is completely reversed from how the U.S. military has handled its latest fighter jet program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , and one that faces its own significant challenges in producing viable results. Defense News ‘ Valerie Insinna was first to report on what Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, is now calling the “Digital Century Series,” on Sept. 16, 2019. The concept is set to become a central component of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which is seeking to develop a host of new air superiority aircraft, and capabilities to go with them , that could begin to supplement existing advanced fighter jets, such as stealthy F-35s and the F-22 Raptors , as early as 2030. The War Zone recently published an in-depth analysis of the evolution and current state of the NGAD effort, which you can find here . “Based on what industry thinks they can do and what my team will tell me, we will need to set a cadence of how fast we think we build a new airplane from scratch,” Roper told Defense News . “Right now, my estimate is five years.” “I may be wrong,” he continued. “I’m hoping we can get faster than that – I think that will be insufficient in the long term [to meet future threats] – but five years is so much better than where we are now with normal acquisition.” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, speaks at the Air Force Association’s main annual convention on Sept. 16, 2019., USAF Roper has called his plan the Digital Century Series in reference to the U.S. Air Force’s “ Century Series ” fighter jets that it paid to develop in the 1950s, starting with the North American F-100 Super Sabre . Roper’s main goal is to get away from ponderous and costly acquisition cycles with lengthy development periods before production of aircraft can even begin. He also views the concept as a way to keep potential major opponents constantly off balance and guessing as to what kind of combat aircraft the United States might deploy next. As a hypothetical, he described the following scenario to Defense News : “Every four or five years there was the F-200, F-201, F-202 and it was vague and mysterious [on what the planes] have, but it’s clear it’s a real program and there are real airplanes flying. Well, now you have to figure out: What are we bringing to the fight? What improved? How certain are you that you’ve got the best airplane to win? … “How do you deal with a threat if you don’t know what the future technology is? Be the threat – always have a new airplane coming out.” Roper identified three key underlying principles that he feels will enable the Digital Century Series concept. These are “agile software development,” “open architecture systems,” and “digital engineering,” according to Defense News . The first term refers to a process common in the software industry where programmers rapidly generate computer code to support various functions on an aircraft or within its individual systems, test it out, and release it. Programmers then immediately solicit feedback and begin incorporating improvements in subsequent software builds. Open architecture simply refers to a system that is designed to be modular, both in terms of hardware and software, allowing for the rapid integration of new and improved capabilities in the future. This could include the replacement of entire systems, such as radars and other sensors, or the additional added functionality to existing components. Digital engineering is perhaps the most important part of Roper’s vision, involving dramatically increasing the use of digital modeling and rapid prototyping to speed up the development of aircraft and reduce the amount of initial testing of those designs before production can begin. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works has been a particular pioneer in these kinds of processes. Northrop Grumman and Boeing, America’s other two major producers of combat aircraft, have also been working to make more use of high fidelity digital modeling in the development, as well as in the production of planes . This includes modeling for stealthy aircraft, such as the F-35 and B-2 , which have designs that require extreme precision to ensure they maintain their radar-evading features. Roper then explained to Defense News how he envisioned the acquisition cycle for a Digital Century Series aircraft to go. He said that some number of companies would get contracts to develop a new fighter jet. Each firm would have to produce a high fidelity digital model of their design and then similarly simulate the production and repair processes, with an eye toward simplifying processes whenever possible and thereby reducing costs and maintenance requirements. The Air Force would then down-select to one design. This entire process would take five years. The winning company would then get a contract to build 24 planes per year for at least three years. This would lead to a fleet of 72 aircraft, the minimum that Air Combat Command says it needs to sustain actual combat operations, according to Roper. As this firm is getting production underway, the Air Force would begin the process all over again. Altogether, its radical concept, even if it’s one that Roper has described in more general terms since April. It’s also one that has a number of inherent challenges that it’s unclear if the Digital Century Series will be able to surmount. For one, Roper’s view of the original Century Series as a period where the Air Force deliberately hired various companies to rapidly build small fleets of new aircraft isn’t entirely in line with the actual history. For example, the first of the designs, the F-100, leveraged considerable design experience from the earlier F-86 Sabre , which first flew in 1947, in order to go from a mock-up in 1951 to a flying prototype in 1953. A YF-100 Super Sabre prototype., USAF The next aircraft in the series, the McDonnell’s F-101 Voodoo was a redesign of an aircraft, the XF-88 , that the company had first received a contract to build in 1947. The first Voodoo entered service in 1957. Some of the Century Series aircraft did progress in development at faster paces, but it was hardly a given, and the total production numbers in most cases were hardly small. The only design that entered service, but didn’t have a production run of more than 500 aircraft was the F-106 Delta Dart . Not counting the F-110 Spectre, an iconic aircraft that was subsequently redesignated as the F-4 Phantom II , the F-106s actually stayed in Air Force service the longest. Air National Guard units retired the last of the Delta Darts in 1988, nearly 30 years after their introduction. The F-104 Starfighter had the shortest American service life, heading into retirement after 17 years, though it remained in foreign service for decades afterward. Four of the first 10 aircraft designs – the F-103 , F-107 , F-108 , and F-109 – also never saw series production at all. Roper’s model seems to largely assume that the truncated and heavily digitized acquisition process will either somehow be able to avoid selecting designs that do not perform as expected or that these failures won’t be detrimental in any way to the overall concept. This would also require stable budgets to ensure that there are no schedule slips that could also have cascading impacts on the overall concept. A mock-up of the North American XF-108 Rapier, a Century Series design that did not enter production., USAF It’s also worth noting that in the 1950s, there were a wide range of companies capable of producing contemporary combat jet designs. Bell, Convair, Lockheed, McDonnell, North America, and Republic, all designed aircraft in the Century Series. Other companies, including Douglas, Grumman, and Fairchild, and Vought, all built fighters for the U.S. Navy during the same period or proposed aircraft to the Air Force, but did not receive contracts. Today, there are just three major companies in the United States that produce military jet aircraft of any kind and one of them, Northrop Grumman, hasn’t produced a manned fighter jet of its own in decades. Roper noted that smaller companies could team with one of the big three to help bring new technologies and design concepts to the table. At the same time, it’s hard to see his vision of a heavy focus on rapid, digital prototyping and leveraging of existing knowledgebases as doing anything but fostering a preference for iterative and evolutionary rather than revolutionary designs – just as was the case with the original Century Series in reality. The F-106 was a direct outgrowth of the F-102 , originally being designated the F-102B, and the design for the failed North American YF-107 Ultra Sabre used the F-100 as a starting place. One of three YF-107A prototypes., USAF Small fleets of advanced aircraft have typically proven to be difficult and very costly to operate and maintain . It’s hard to see how the Air Force will be able to fly less than 100 examples of multiple distinct aircraft designs simultaneously, even for relatively short periods of time, without having to establish complex logistics chains to support them, especially during sustained operations . Beyond all this, it seems almost worthless to compare what it takes to develop next-generation stealthy aircraft to what is required to devise even advanced fourth-generation fighter jet designs. The existing experience globally with fifth-generation aircraft has typically been protracted and expensive development cycles, regardless of the capabilities of the final product. Again, the requirement for a five-year schedule to go from a digital design to a production-ready stealthy aircraft would seem to favor iterative designs to even have any real chance of meeting that goal. This, in turn, calls into question whether or not any potential opponent would truly be kept guessing between the development of one aircraft and the next. The Air Force released the video below, which offers a vision of what aerial warfare might look like in 2030, including new manned fighter jets and “ loyal wingman ” drones, in 2018. “It’s a concept that implies turning the aerospace industry upside down,” Stephen Trimble, Aviation Week’s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , told us for our recent NGAD feature even before the exact details of the Digital Century Series had emerged. “The Air Force wants contractors to put their focus mainly on cutting-edge design, then leave the production and sustainment phase open to competition. It’s the only way the Air Force can pump out new aircraft types every three years, rather than one every 15-20 years. And that approach also incentivizes industry to allow the Air Force to retire aircraft as soon as they become obsolete, rather than keep them propped up for decades with expensive incremental upgrades.” Even then, the goals seem particularly lofty. Roper’s concept has also emerged as the Air Force appears to increasingly be moving away from traditional fighter jets, as well as manned ones, in general. With this in mind, together with the other issues noted above, it would seem very likely, if not probable, that the Digital Century Series would at least include some unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), if it doesn’t consist of them entirely. Roper himself is also a major advocate for Skyborg , an Air Force effort focused on developing “open architecture” software and other components necessary to rapidly turn drones, or even potentially manned aircraft, into autonomous UCAVs. The Digital Century Series could easily lead to other distributed capabilities across the various fleets of aircraft, all of which might be networked together, but with particular designs optimized for specific roles, such as sensor platforms or weapon trucks . The Air Force plans to use Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie unmanned aircraft as the initial testbed for Skyborg., USAF Unmanned aircraft, even advanced UCAVs, are inherently more disposable than manned aircraft, have no need for complex life support and safety systems, and offer designers the freedom to craft an aircraft without any other requirements that a human pilot imposes. That last factor also means that necessary flying time, such as the need for constant proficiency training, is reduced if not largely eliminated, which, in turn, lowers operating and maintenance costs massively. You can read more in great detail about the benefits that advanced unmanned designs might offer, broadly, in this past War Zone feature . In fact, that piece largely described what Roper is proposing, but strictly for unmanned aircraft. All told, Roper may be talking about a Digital Century Series of fighter jets in a way meant to hearken back to the original Century Series of manned fighters, but any actual results may be a much more diverse mix of “aircraft” designs, many of which may never have a pilot on board.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 19, 2019",Everything You Need To Know About The Attacks On Saudi Arabia’s Oil Facilities (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two days after major attacks on two oil industry sites in Saudi Arabia, significant questions remain about who was actually responsible and how they prosecuted the strikes. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have taken credit for the operation, which caused extensive damage to the world’s largest oil processing facility and led to a partial shutdown that has immediately resulted in a five percent cut in global oil production . The United States has disputed this, accusing Iran of being directly involved and saying the strikes did not appear to have originated on Yemeni territory. President Donald Trump has pledged to help the Saudis defend themselves, but has also said that he’s in “no rush” to respond to the incidents. The strikes occurred on the night of Sept. 14-15, 2019, at the Abqaiq oil processing facility, which is situated around 40 miles southwest of the port of Dammam on the Persian Gulf, and the Khurais oil field, which is further to the southwest. Saudi officials have stated that there were no casualties arising from the attacks and that the large resulting fires were under control. On Sept. 16, 2019, Saudi Arabian Colonel Turki Al Malki, the chief spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis, told reporters that the country was conducting an investigation into the incidents. â€œThe preliminary results show that the weapons are Iranian and we are currently working to determine the location [of the launches],” Al Malki said . “The terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed.” To give a general sense of the distances involved, it is roughly 780 miles from the Houthis’ main areas of operation in southwestern Yemen to Abqaiq, though it is only around 530 miles from there to the extreme northeastern corner of Yemen, where the group exercises no control. The refinery is also around 330 miles from southern Iraq and around 200 miles across the Persian Gulf from Iran. A map showing the general location of the Abqaiq oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, near Dammam, and the Khurais oil field to the southwest., Google Maps Al Malki did not specify what kinds of weapons caused the damage at Abqaiq and Khurais or offer any details about how Saudi authorities had arrived at the conclusion that whoever was responsible had not fired them from Yemen.Â “Saudi Arabia is capable of defending its lands and people and can respond strongly to these attacks,” Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry also said in a separate statement that did not attribute the attacks to any particular party. the Saudis have also requested that the United Nations conduct an independent assessment. First 3m resolution ğŸ›°ï¸ image shows burning #oil facility at #Abqaiq on September 14, 2019 via @planetlabs. More in this updated @nytimes article with some quotes from yours truly on increase use of #drone attacks https://t.co/R8IGz1JUVU pic.twitter.com/hE5CYkToeB — Wim Zwijnenburg (@wammezz) September 14, 2019 The U.S. government has released a number of annotated satellite images of both sites following the attack from commercial imagery provider Digital Globe. Unnamed American officials have also told various news outlets that these images, along with other intelligence, show that the strikes came from the west-northwest , but have provided little corroborating evidence to support this assertion. Â It is important to note that the direction of the impact points does not automatically give one the direction of a drone or missile’s launch site. Using waypoints, a weapon could fly a more complex route to the target, possibly with an eye toward dodging defenses or masking its point of origin. US Government handout US Government handout US Government handout US Government handout A key factor in the U.S. government’s assessment appears to be the belief that the Houthis do not have suicide drones that could cause the level of damage seen at Abqaiq and Khurais and with sufficient range to have been able to execute the strikes from southwestern Yemen proper. In addition, the Houthis have claimed that they launched 10 drones, but have, so far, declined to offer any evidence to substantiate that.Â Unnamed American government sources have said that the intelligence indicates between 17 and 19 total impact points . Other U.S. government sources have said that more than 20 drones or missiles may have been involved, but not all of them reached their targets. It is possible that the Houthis launched a mixed strike with both suicide drones and missiles, something they have done before , and they may have only decided to disclose to the total number of unmanned aircraft for some reason. Iran has categorically denied being involved in any way. Houthi unmanned aircraft designs, as well as those of their missiles, many of which are seen in the video below, show clear hallmarks of at least Iranian support , if not simply direct deliveries of at least some of those weapons to the Yemeni rebels. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SNeblGR05xE “Remember when Iran shot down a [U.S. Navy] drone, saying knowingly that it was in their ‘airspace’ when, in fact, it was nowhere close,” President Trump Tweeted out on Sept. 16, 2019. “They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. Weâ€™ll see?” Remember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their â€œairspaceâ€ when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. Weâ€™ll see? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019 “Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked,” Trump had written in another Tweet the day before. “There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!” Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019 At the same time, this support from Iran has also given the Houthis an increasingly extensive drone and missile arsenal of ever-increasing capabilities. This has grown this year to include Quds-1 ground-launched land-attack cruise missiles, which the Yemeni rebels have already employed against targets in Saudi Arabia, albeit those targets were significantly closer than Abqaiq and Khurais.Â The series of videos below show the Houthis launching a Quds-1 at Abha International Airport Â in southern Saudi Arabia in June 2019, as well as security camera footage from inside the main terminal during the strike and additional views of the resulting damage. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cVADHyxA8Ks The Quds-1 is externally similar to Iran’s Soumar ground-launched cruise missile, but is significantly smaller based on video and pictures of the weapon the Houthis released in July 2019. Experts have assessed that the Yemeni weapon’s range is also shorter based on its the smaller, less efficient engine. So, while the Soumar can reportedly hit targets just under 840 miles away, Quds-1 may have a range of half of that , or less. This could have made it difficult, if not impossible for the Houthis to have launched these missiles from southwestern Yemen, though it might have been possible to do so if they could find a way to infiltrate into the northeastern part of the country. The Yemeni rebels have also struck Saudi oil pipelines with drones much further to the west in the past, but still at ranges in excess of 500 miles from their base of operations in Yemen.Â This again would raise the possibility that the Houthis might have been able to move their launchers into the northeastern portion of the country in order to conduct the strikes, or that they have increased the range of these weapons. Whatever the mix of weapons involved, and their respective launch sites, unconfirmed images have appeared online that do show what looks to be the wreckage of a Quds-1 in the Arabian Desert that failed to reach its target, strongly suggesting that those missiles were part of strikes. The War Zone has a separate analysis of the technical issues surrounding the strikes in Saudi Arabia coming shortly that will cover much of these factors in greater depth. Whether or not the missiles, as well as any drones, actually flew from Yemen, if they used an unusual vector of attack, it may have further limited the Saudi military’s ability to respond to the strikes at Abqaiq and Khurais. The Houthis have been launching drones and missiles, include short-range ballistic missiles , at targets in Saudi Arabia for years now. Saudi authorities have claimed that the country’s air defenses, including Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries and F-15 fighter jets , have intercepted a significant number of these incoming threats. However, there has been evidence that the Saudis may have been, at best, inflating the number of successful intercepts and downplaying the scale of damage that the Houthis have been able to cause over the past two years or so. In July 2019, the U.S. military confirmed that it was preparing to deploy its own Patriot battery to Saudi Arabia , as well as potentially fighter jets and other personnel in the future, to bolster the country’s air defense.Â It is also worth remembering that no air defense system is perfect and that low-flying drones and cruise missiles can be particularly difficult to spot, track, and shoot down, to begin with. The Saudi Arabians are hardly the only country to experience this reality first hand. Of course, that didn’t stop Russian President Vladimir Putin taking the opportunity to pitch possible sales of his country’s S-400 surface-to-air missile system to Saudi Arabia, something officials in Riyadh have already reportedly pledged to buy in principle in the past. US Army personnel practice reloading a Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates in January 2019., US Army If the missiles did not originate from Yemen, but instead came from the northwest, one prospective launch site location would have been within southern Iraq. If Iran had launched missiles from their own territory, or from a boat in the northern end of the Persian Gulf, the weapons would have had to follow a route using waypoints to hit from the northwest. It is worth noting that, in May 2019, the U.S. government first announced it had intelligence that indicated Iran might be preparing to launch attacks on American military personnel or other interests across the Middle East. This assessment was reportedly based, in part, on satellite imagery that appeared to show elements of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) loading large missiles â€“ possibly cruise missiles â€“ onto boats in the Persian Gulf.Â The United States has since accused Iran of being responsible for a number of waterborne attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman earlier this year. The Houthis have also claimed multiple attacks on military and commercial ships in recent years, using unmanned, explosive-laden boats at least built with technology sourced from Iran. Just how independently they may have been conducting those operations from their Iranian benefactors is unclear. The exact nature of these activities, or how confident the U.S. Intelligence Community was in that assessment, also remains unclear. A reportedly declassified, but unreleased satellite image showing the purportedly missile-laden boats has yet to emerge publicly. The U.S. government says it is now trying to declassify separate intelligence imagery related to these latest strikes in Saudi Arabia that would bolster its case, as well. An attack originating from Iraq could still be tied to Iran via powerful militias it supports that country, who have recently found themselves reportedly targeted by Israeli airstrikes . That same stream of intelligence starting in May had included information that pointed to the IRGC attempting to goad these groups into launching attacks on American interests within Iraq . This raises the possibility that the IRGC could be treating the Quds-1 missile as a design specifically intended for proxy forces that offers some deniability given that it is distinct from weapons Iranian forces employ themselves. There were reports that unnamed Iraqi intelligence officials had blamed Iranian-backed militias for the strikes in Saudi Arabia, but there is no hard evidence to support this as yet. Iraq’s government has officially denied any involvement, as well as that the strikes originated from its territory. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi did speak by phone on Sept. 16, 2019. “On his part the U.S. Secretary of State said the information they have confirms the Iraqi governmentâ€™s statement that its territory was not used to carry out this attack,” according to a readout of the call from Abdul Mahdiâ€™s office.Â So #KSA confirms that its investigation are still going ahead despite Sec of State Pompeo saying Â â€œthe information they have confirms the #Iraq governmentâ€™s statement that its territory was not used to carry out this attack'. A subtle diss to from the Saudis. https://t.co/FZ18qm9QlG — Riam Dalati (@Dalatrm) September 16, 2019 The U.S. State Department has yet to release any statement of its own. There are separate reports that the Iraqi government has made new moves to increase how much direct control the country’s military has over various militias, including Iranian-backed groups, collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces , or PMF, which continue to enjoy considerable autonomy. The United States has been pressuring Iraq to do more on this front for some time and there is no evidence one way or another that this is connected to the strikes on Saudi Arabia. (in a decision that came right in the middle of the Saudi Aramco attacks/debacle and swirling rumours that those were launched from Iraqi territory – this all not confirmed or proven by anyone) — John Davison (@JohnDrtrs) September 16, 2019 Of course, no matter which one of Iran’s proxies was responsible for the strikes on Saudi Arabia, or if Iran itself was responsible, the incidents have underscored just how vulnerable a significant portion of the world’s oil production actually is. As noted, Abqaiq is the largest oil production facility in the world and the Saudi government’s decision to shut down half of it equates to cutting back five percent of global output. This strikes immediately caused the price of crude oil to spike. BREAKING: Brent crude oil surges more than 17%, WTI crude oil surges more than 14% after attack on Saudi oil facility cut production over the weekend https://t.co/5pjnGl9LzW pic.twitter.com/DQWun1L6wO — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) September 15, 2019 At the same time, Saudi Arabia has not called on the other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) bloc to increase production to meet the shortfalls, saying it will mitigate supply issues by tapping into its own reserves. President Trump has also authorized the release of oil from American national reserves, if necessary.Â The question, now, largely becomes one of how the Saudis and its international partners, primarily the United States, will respond in order to make clear that this kind of action isn’t tolerable. Trump has already indicated that the United States will defer to authorities in Riyadh, though it remains to be seen if this will actually be the case.Â At the same time, the American president has insisted that disruptions in Middle East oil production are of limited concern to the United States itself, given increased U.S. production. “But will help our Allies!” he Tweeted on Sept. 16, 2019. Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We donâ€™t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019 Whether this takes the form of more sanctions, which the United States has steadily heaped on Iran in the past year or so, or more direct action remains to be seen. Any form of military action would almost certainly provoke additional tit-for-tat responses from Iranian forces, or their proxies, which could lead to a cycle of escalation and concerns about a broader conflict that would be devastating for the region as a whole and could have far-reaching economic impacts . It’s also not clear then what benefits Iran itself would necessarily derive from such a provocative act, especially if they launched the weapons from their own territory. This does not preclude those within the Iranian government, such as the IRGC, who might have devised and carried out the strikes from overestimating their ability to conceal their involvement, otherwise underestimating the risks associated with the plan, or simply not caring. So far, the United States has resisted direct military action, even in response to the shootdown of the U.S. Navy drone in June 2019. The U.S. government has decided instead to focus on bolstering defenses throughout the region and taking other deterrent measures , while working to establish new security constructs with allies and partners with varying degrees of success.Â Trump has also offered repeatedly to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without preconditions to try to deescalate tensions that have been brewing between the two countries for months now. Iran has rebuffed these offers, calling for relaxed sanctions and other concessions before any possibility of talks.Â Still, the U.S. President may be increasingly frustrated with Iran’s negative responses to his offers. On Sept. 15, 2019, he Tweeted out a denial that he had ever proposed meeting Iranian officials without conditions, despite video clips and official statements where he clearly makes this offer. President Trump says a meeting with Iranâ€™s President Rouhani could happen with â€œno preconditions.â€ Your thoughts? pic.twitter.com/VmJmP3fQv1 — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 31, 2018 What the Saudis publicly determine from their investigation may prove to be the deciding factor. There are already indications that support for the country’s war against the Houthis may be flagging. In August 2019, the United Arab Emirates, the second-largest contributor to the Saudi-led coalition, officially terminated operations against the rebels and withdrew a significant amount of its forces from the country, in large part because it had made the country a target for Iran and its proxies.Â The UAE has now also held direct meetings with Iranian authorities, indicating an effort to for the two countries to come to some new understanding, and continues to decline to blame Iran directly for the tanker attacks off its coastline in the Gulf of Oman earlier this year. Of course, it is worth noting that just today, Iran did seize a UAE-flagged ship , accusing it of being involved in fuel smuggling . What appetite there might be in Saudi Arabia for a more open conflict with Iran, or one between the United States and Iran where it could easily find itself in the crossfire, is unclear. Vice President Mike Pence’s Chief of Staff also sought to downplay Trump’s “locked and loaded” rhetoric today, claiming it was just a reference to the security that increasing energy independence has offered the United States. Pence's chief of staff deserves some kind of prize for spin: ""I think that 'locked and loaded' is a broad term and talks about the realities that we're all far safer and more secure domestically from energy independence."" https://t.co/7uYnQCdaRS — Gregg Carlstrom (@glcarlstrom) September 16, 2019 Trump himself has now said that he “would certainly help” Saudi Arabia if they were “ under attack ,” but that the United States is in “ no rush ” to respond directly to the strikes and wanted to avoid a conflict with Iran. The President did not explain how his definition of “under attack” might differ from the level of attacks that Saudi Arabia is experiencing now. Unfortunately, what is clear is that the strikes on Abqaiq and Khurais are unprecedented in scale and scope, no matter who carried them out. The Saudis and their partners, such as the United States, will not be able to ignore these attacks and the calls for some form of more direct response to Iran may become increasingly inescapable. UPDATE: 5:20pm ESTâ€” Trump has now made additional statements regarding Iran, saying that he believed that he believed it would be proportional to strikes Iran in response to the strikes in Saudi Arabia. He also said that the United States was “more prepared than any country in history” for a potential war.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 19, 2020",The Air Force’s New T-X Jet Trainer Now Has An Official Name And Designation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force has just disclosed its official name and designation for its new jet trainer—the T-7A “Red Hawk.” The announcement came at the Air Force Association’s symposium that opened today outside of Washington, D.C. Acting Air Force Secretary Matt Donovan disclosed the jet’s official moniker while standing with one of the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, Colonel Charles McGee —a highly decorated veteran with a whopping 409 combat missions spread across WWII, Korea, and Vietnam—by his side. McGee and his Red Hawk squadronmates not only bombed and strafed the Nazis with amazing acumen, they also did the same to racial biases and the artificial limitations placed on African Americans’ service. The unit was known for their bright red tail flashes on their P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs, a tradition that still continues with the unit that bears the name “Red Tails” to this very day. 100th Fighter Squadron jets of the Alabama ANG proudly display red tails on their Block 30 F-16Cs. The unit’s lineage connects it directly with the Tuskegee Airmen. , USAF Donovon stated: “The name Red Hawk honors the legacy of Tuskegee Airmen and pays homage to their signature red-tailed aircraft from World War II…  The name is also a tribute to the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, an American fighter aircraft that first flew in 1938 and was flown by the 99th Fighter Squadron, the U.S. Army Air Forces’ first African American fighter squadron. … The T-7A will be the staple of a new generation of aircraft… The Red Hawk offers advanced capabilities for training tomorrow’s pilots on data links, simulated radar, smart weapons, defensive management systems, as well as synthetic training capabilities.” I can’t think of a better name for the clean-sheet trainer design that will build much of the force’s future pilot cadre. The T-7 is being built by Boeing with their help of their Swedish partners on the program—SAAB. Boeing won the T-X contract a year ago in the face of stiff competition. The win was much more than a realized opportunity to build 351 trainers to replace the flying force’s venerable T-38 Talons—and possibly many more of the jets for foreign air arms and to fill additional roles within the Pentagon’s air combat portfolio—it was a lifeline to Boeing’s St. Louis tactical aircraft production facility and more. You can read all about what this win meant for Boeing in this past editorial feature of mine. Boeing’s two T-X—or should I say T-7—prototypes just made their combined 100th flight and the program is accelerating. USAF Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said the following about the T-7 at the symposium: “The distance between the T-38 and an F-35 is night and day… But with the T-7A the distance is much, much smaller, and that’s important because it means the pilots trained on it will be that much better, that much faster at a time when we must be able to train to the speed of the threat.” It’s worth noting that another T-7 does exist internationally. Japan’s basic flight training aircraft, the Fuji T-7 . Callbacks to the USAF’s WWII heritage have become almost standardized in new aircraft naming convention. The force’s next stealth bomber was named the Raider after the Doolittle Raiders that were the first to respond to the attacks on Pearl Harbor with an offensive strike. Before that, the force’s skipped forward in its rebooted trainer designation sequence to name its new primary trainer the T-6 Texan II after the North American T-6 Texan of WWII fame. USAF Regardless, here’s to the new T-7 Red Hawk, hopefully, the airplane will prove worthy of its new name in the decades to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",China Appears Set To Unveil Very High-Speed Drone During Big Military Parade In Beijing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China will be marked by a huge military parade that will pass through Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on October 1st. In preparation for this massive event, parade rehearsals are underway under extremely tight security . These rehearsals have included a number of previously unrevealed weapon systems. The one that has caught our eye the most is a wedge-shaped aircraft that appears to be a very high-speed drone. Although we have to note that this is speculative and based on the limited information available, the shape of this does not appear to be new. Satellite images have been floating around showing a similar platform for a number of years, with the best image emerging last year from the PLAAF airbase near Malan in Xinjiang province. The image shows a number of drones laid out on a ramp area. All are known aside from the wedge-shaped one. UASvision.com , which did a writeup on the image when it first surfaced, estimated its dimensions as 40 feet long by roughly 18 feet wide. The rumor of the potential existence of a number of increasingly complex, high-supersonic, or even hypersonic developmental Chinese drones goes back the better part of a decade. Eastpendulum.com has kept a close eye on developments in this shadowy space and has uncovered a number of patents that match the planform in question. A number of flight tests likely supports the existence of this craft, and possibly its developmental progenitors , which would be just one of multiple extremely high-speed weapons capabilities China is developing. It’s thought that the craft is launched from an H-6 bomber , or at least was for testing. How successful this system was or what state it currently is in operationally speaking is unknown, but the fact that China may be about to parade it around is indicative of it at least approaching an operational state. As far as what it does, it isn’t clear. It could be a survivable reconnaissance drone that can rapidly collect regional intelligence without being tied to the predictable orbits of satellites. In fact, it would be even more useful if those satellites were outright destroyed or disabled during a conflict , which is an increasingly real possibility. On the other hand, it could be a high-supersonic or even hypersonic cruise missile, or even a strike asset that can be reused, or both. It just isn’t clear at this time. China’s high-end unmanned combat air vehicle ambitions are something we have been following very closely in recent years . This is not the only indication of a Chinese unmanned system that is capable of greater than subsonic speeds. In June of 2018, The War Zone reported on China’s supersonic fighter-like drone program. So, the country clearly has a multi-layered advanced unmanned aircraft development strategy, with the very high-speed drone that is being wheeled around Beijing likely sitting at the top of that organization chart performance-wise. Even if this craft is part of a larger, ongoing, evolutionary research and development initiative, it’s still a significant development. Some will comment that the aircraft in question looks like a Lockheed D-21 drone . That is somewhat true and it is also a fact that China was able to recover the wreckage of the last operational D-21 flight that was lost over the country nearly five decades ago. Whatever information they could glean from that wreckage likely influenced not just this aircraft’s design, but pretty much all of the country’s indigenous high-performance aircraft programs that came after it. So it is unlikely to be any sort of a copy, although the D-21’s influence may be present. The high-speed drone is not the only surprise in store for the parade on October 1st. A subsonic unmanned combat air vehicle will be displayed as will be an unmanned underwater vehicle. This is in addition to other new weapons, like multiple-launch rocket systems and missile systems. There could also be a surprise in the air. China has a number of major, but secretive aerospace programs, including two bombers , that are deep development. Rumors have swirled that one of the bombers could make an appearance at an event related to the 70th anniversary of the PRC’s founding. We will keep you up to date as to new information regarding exactly what China is planning to unveil during its big and heavily militarized birthday bash on October 1st. Update: 12:00am PDT— I was giving it some thought and a second alternative is that this craft could be a supersonic target drone that may even have a secondary reconnaissance potential/function. Having a very high-speed target drone to test against China’s increasingly capable SAM systems and air-to-air missiles would be very beneficial. Just something to think about, although I find it far less likely than what is described above.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 14, 2020",Airspace Closures For “Storm Area 51” Have Been Posted,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Maybe the most aggravating and stupid online movement I have seen in a long while is “Storm Area 51.” You can read about its ridiculous backstory here, but even the guy that inadvertently started it and the website that promoted it is now warning potential ‘stormers’ that they shouldn’t go , as doing so puts themselves and the local populous in the tiny little community of Rachel, Nevada in danger. They even liken it to being “Fyrefest 2.0.” The military and law enforcement have taken the event seriously , although just how prepared the locales that are at the focus of the ordeal are for a possible human invasion remains very much in question . Regardless, temporary flight restrictions have been posted in advance of next weekend in two key locations. You can see my comments on the unfortunate and bizarre event below. I take a very dim view of those that are taking part in this and of the people who have actively been promoting it or even monetizing it. Once again, there is zero proof that anything having to do with aliens or UFOs have any relation to Area 51 . As for the TFRs, one of them will exist along the northwest edge of ‘the box’ of restricted airspace and land that surrounds Area 51. Its northern edge butts up close to Rachel, Nevada, home of the famous Little A’Le’Inn motel and restaurant. It was here that the core ‘Alienstock’ event was supposed to be held, but preparations for that event, which was slated to draw thousands, appeared to disintegrate last week. At least that was what was being reported. Now Alienstock is being held in Las Vegas and the planners are threatening legal action against the Little A’Le’Inn for continuing to use the event’s name. In fact, according to some reports, the Little A’Le’Inn is still planning to hold some form of the event. This is one of just a number of structured events surrounding Strom Area 51. The reality is that the border of Area 51 and the famous main gate that leads to the clandestine base is located literally in the middle of nowhere. There are no services to support large groups of people. There isn’t even fuel to gas your car up with. The closest gas station is 50 miles to the south. The idea that thousands, or even tens of thousands, could descend onto Rachel ill-prepared to sustain themselves is a disaster in the making, especially for the tiny population that lives out there, primarily to be left alone. The TFR will be active from September 19th to the 23rd and range from the ground all the way to 18,000 feet. Only military aircraft are allowed overhead and even law enforcement and medical helicopters are subject to tight restrictions in order to enter the closed-off airspace. One can only imagine that the military will have plenty of airborne assets in place to tightly monitor the border with Area 51 in this area. The base already has a cadre of resident HH-60 Pave Hawks that run security operations over the base’s sprawling territory and beyond. FAA FAA The other TFR that has been posted is to the south, along the southern reach of the Nevada Test And Training Range where primary access to the Department Of Energy’s Nevada Test Site , now known as the Nevada National Security Site , is located. It was just last week that a pair of Dutch Youtubers were arrested for trespassing beyond the site’s perimeter. Another deeper incursion into the area last January ended with the driver being shot dead. The powers that be likely see this area, which is far closer to Las Vegas, as one where there is a high likelihood that ‘stormers’ will gather and potentially try to move into restricted territory. Beyond that, I am not aware of any events going on in this area related to Storm Area 51, but there very well could be. It’s also worth noting that this restriction is from the ground up to 7,000 feet. Airliners do skirt this area when approaching and leaving Las Vegas, so that makes some sense. FAA FAA One can imagine how this whole ridiculous thing has become a security and planning nightmare for the military , local law enforcement, and the county governments that are supposed to stay ahead of and deal with this kind of thing. Because of its largely nebulous nature, even getting an idea of how many people will actually show up has to be a fool’s errand for military intelligence personnel that are tasked with keeping an eye on and helping with security preparations for this event. Finlay McWalter/wikicommons The TFRs also make sense as having news helicopters and helicopter tour companies from Las Vegas active over these areas would complicate aerial surveillance substantially and just add to the level of promotion and commotion surrounding the event. The news helicopters also have very long-lens videography equipment that isn’t exactly welcome near Area 51. Drones are the other issue. The TFR closes the airspace to them as well, and one can only imagine how many of them would clutter up the sky if indeed thousands show up out there. Some of those drones would also likely cross the border. With this in mind, we may see some serious counter-UAS capabilities in the area for this event. When people say Rachel is tiny, it’s hard to convey just how tiny. This image shows the community minus a few outlying ranch facilities. , Google Earth What this all boils down to is how many people will actually show up? Maybe it will just be hundreds of people. But that still is a major issue for the surrounding communities. If thousands do show up, it will likely be a disaster and the area will be trashed after revelers depart on fumes. Whatever the case, we will know just how big of a storm Storm Area 51 causes when it all goes down next weekend.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2019",RAF To Sell-Off Its BAe 146 Military Transports That Also Cart Around the Royals,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Air Force is looking to sell off its four BAe 146 jet transports. Two of these are presently configured specifically for VIP missions, including flying around members of the country’s Royal Family , as well as senior government and military officials, while the remaining pair are set up as small airlifters. Over the years, the four-engine jet aircraft, which have excellent short takeoff and landing capabilities and rough field performance, have flown missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Jane’s 360 was first to report on potential sale after noticing the U.K.’s Defense Equipment Sales Authority (DESA) had included the aircraft in a brochure at the biennial Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI), which opened on Sept. 10, 2019, and closes today. The RAF’s No. 32 Squadron , “The Royal,” operates both the VIP versions, known to the service as BAe 146 CC.2s, as well as the BAe 146 C.3 transport variants. It is “too early in the process to be discussing out-of-service dates and replacements [for the BAe 146s],” an unnamed U.K. Ministry of Defense source told Jane’s . DESA included of the planes in their brochure for purposes of “testing the market’s appetite for a potential sale in the future,” they added. In recent years, the RAF has looked to divest a number of aircraft, including C-130J Hercules and its R.1 Sentinel intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as part of efforts to draw down and consolidate its forces after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan in 2014. There could certainly be interest from both commercial and military buyers in the four-engine jets if they were to come up for sale. An RAF BAe 146 CC.2., Crown Copyright Developed in the 1970s by Hawker Siddeley and then British Aerospace (BAe), the BAe 146 was primarily intended to be a small regional airliner that could operate from relatively small airports and fly quietly so as to be less disruptive to communities below. The planes had impressive short takeoff and landing capabilities and good performance from unimproved runways, even being able to operate from roads. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CqvQLvXdFQY Marketed for a time as the Whisperjet, those same features gave it clear potential as a military aircraft, as well. BAe proposed airlifter, aerial refueling tanker, and carrier onboard delivery versions. The company even built a demonstrator of a Sideloading Tactical Airlifter (STA) variant with a mock aerial refueling probe over the cockpit, which was based on a commercial cargo version called the Quiet Trader. The BAe 146 Sideloading Tactical Airlifter demonstrator., Crown Copyright Despite these proposals, purchase orders for BAe 146s came almost exclusively from commercial operators. This continued when production shifted to the Avro RJ-series variants, beginning in 1993. The RJ-series aircraft replaced the BAe 146’s Avco Lycoming ALF 502 with improved LF 507 models featuring a digital control system, as well as new digital avionics. British Aerospace produced a total of 221 BAe 146s of all types, while Avro, and later BAE Systems, built 166 RJ-series versions. In 1983, however, the RAF had leased two BAe 146s, which they referred to as CC.1s, to evaluate them as a possible replacement for the aging Hawker Siddeley Andover twin-engine turboprops that the Queen’s Flight used to support the Royal Family. The following year, the service purchased the two CC.2 variants for this role. A third example arrived at the Queen’s Flight in 1989, but was sold in 2002. For its VIP mission, the BAe 146 offered dramatic improvements over the older Andovers, being able to fly 60 percent further than the 1960s-era turboprops, as well as carry more passengers in greater comfort. Standard airliner variants of the aircraft can carry between 70 and 112 passengers, but with their more luxurious, business jet-like interiors, the CC.2s can accommodate 19 passengers , in addition to the crew of six. In 1995, the RAF combined the Queen’s Flight with No. 32 Squadron, which also had a VIP transport role. As part of the process, it also eliminated its practice of having aircraft dedicated to supporting the Royal Family and began operating the CC.2s in a broader VIP and light airlift capacity. In these roles, the aircraft supported British operations in Iraq intermittently between 2003 and 2011 and also took part in the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011. The RAF purchased another two BAe 146s second hand from TNT Airways , a Belgian freight airline, in 2012. These were so-called “ Quick Change ” or QC versions with interiors that could be rapidly reconfigured to accommodate passengers, cargo, or a mix of both. These variants also have a large rear cargo door for relatively easy loading and unloading of palletized cargo, a feature carried over from the original Quiet Trader and STA variants. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RFB0rf0ujVc Hawker Beechcraft, under contract to BAE Systems, modified these planes into the C.3 configuration and delivered them to No. 32 Squadron in 2013. The conversion process included the addition of various self-defense features, including decoy flare dispensers and a directional infrared countermeasures systems, or DIRCM. DIRCM systems typically use a suite of sensors to spot and track incoming infrared homing missiles, and then use turreted lasers to blind or confuse the seekers on those weapons. The CC.2s had already gained a DIRCM suite from Northrop Grumman in the 1990s, which then evolved in the following years. The original installation was a system that included two turreted lasers mounted on the rear fuselage. The two aircraft eventually gained a sponson with a third, improved turret under the forward fuselage. Eventually, Northrop Grumman provided the latest generation of its AN/AAQ-24 Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system to replace the turrets in all three positions. This is the same configuration found on the C.3s at present, as well. An RAF BAe 146 CC.2 with the intermediate DIRCM configuration with the two original turrets at the rear and the improved turret under the forward fuselage., Crown Copyright “The 146’s defensive aids suite (DAS) also offers government ministers and high-ranking military leaders protection during visits overseas where a risk to security is perceived,” according to the RAF’s own official page on the aircraft. DIRCM is particularly valuable for defeating shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS . The aircraft’s four engines, rare for a plane this size, also offers valuable redundancy in case one of the turbofans fails for any reason. The C.3s supported British operations in Afghanistan, which finally came to a close in 2014. Since then, the CC.2s and C.3s have continued to be available for VIP and light airlift duties anywhere the U.K. armed forces may be operating. The plane’s short takeoff and landing and rough field capabilities have already proven their worth in combat zones. An RAF BAe 146 C.3 at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan in 2014., Crown Copyright The BAe 146 continues to be popular with airlines and freight services, including those that operate in more austere locations. A number of examples are in service commercially as water bombers for forest fire fighting operations, as well. As noted, if the RAF decides to go ahead with the sale of the jets, they could easily find their way to civilian operators. Still, given the present configuration of the CC.2s and C.3s, especially defensive features, they could be very attractive to military operators, too. Back in 2009, BAE Systems had offered an upgrade package for second-hand BAe 146s and RJ-series aircraft, known as the BAe 146M , that included a new glass cockpit, defensive systems, and additional fuel tanks for extra range. The defense contractor said it could configure these aircraft for airlift missions, as well as for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and aerial refueling tanker roles. Promotional artwork of BAE Systems’ BAe 146M conversion. The aircraft has some notable features in common with the C.3 configuration, including its defensive suite., BAE Systems The aircraft’s nascent quiet operation and its general airliner appearance could also make it ideal for support discreet operations, including those by special operations forces. The U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), for instance, notably flies a fleet of C-146A Wolfhounds , a militarized version of the Dornier Do 328 twin-engine turboprop light transport, in civilian style paint schemes, for exactly these sorts of missions. AFSOC also has other, smaller civilian-styled planes it hard originally acquired for this role, but has increasingly shifted them to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and advisory missions. Depending on what state the RAF offers the CC.2s and C.3s in, it is also possible that private individual could purchase one or more of them. The VIP-configured CC.2s would offer greater capacity than many business jets, but without having to pay the operating costs associated with full-size airliners . The BAe 146’s operational capabilities would also open up a greater number of airports and airfields to fly to and from , including smaller private airstrips. There’s no word yet on when the four planes might officially hit the market or what the price point will be. The total costs associated with purchasing and modifying the two BAe 146s into the C.3 configuration in 2012 was nearly $73 million , or more than $80 million in 2019 dollars. However, the RAF has been selling off relatively low-mileage C-130Js at a fraction of the cost of a new example. We will have to wait and see when, and in what state, the RAF’s BAe 146s actually come up for sale, but it seems very likely that they will get another lease on life with a new operator, either in the commercial or military realm.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2020",This Spin Recovery Clip From Microsoft’s Upcoming Flight Simulator Is Absolutely Insane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Do you know what aviation needs really badly right now? A new version of the long-defunct and much beloved Microsoft Flight Simulator. Not just to get young people interested in the hugely inaccessible world of flying, but to leverage new technology that can nearly mirror putting them in the cockpit of an actual aircraft. Thankfully, Microsoft feels the same way and sees a great opportunity to relaunch what was a lucrative sub-brand in an entirely different gaming and simulation environment. So far, they have released a teaser video of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 at the E3 Expo back in June. While it was gorgeous, it was cinematic in nature and didn’t show much of what the actual flying would be like. But today, they quietly distributed a clip that shows what appears to be an uncannily real flight model and the graphics to match. Here is the video from Microsoft showing early flight model development for spin entry and recovery in a Cessna 172 with a G1000 glass cockpit and below that is the teaser video shown at E3: For anyone who as spun a Cessna, that video looks eerily lifelike. Every undulation, and especially the recovery, seems exact and this is an early example of the flight model. It will only get better. Paired with the fantastic graphics that are already evident in the trailer and this clip, as well as a virtual reality user interface, Microsoft’s FS reboot could mark a revelation in the accessibility of flight. Sure, the G forces aren’t there, but compared to playing Flight Simulator on a 17 inch CRT monitor of yesteryear, this is a different beast entirely. At one time, flight simulator games were hot items , with multiple private/commercial and military iterations filling the shelves of mall software stores like Babbages and Software Etc. Not long after Flight Simulator X came out in 2006, the genre began to fade. It has since turned into somewhat of a boutique affair, with highly specialized game makers like Eagle Dynamics producing incredibly detailed flight simulators—so detailed in fact that many seem to have just passed them over due to perceived time commitments and knowledge base needed to even get started. That’s really too bad because Digital Combat Simulator is absolutely amazing for what it is and it has embraced virtual reality as the future of the genre overall. In fact, I would posit that a good portion of DCS users play the military aircraft simulation more for flight than fight. Using it as a stand-in for something like Flight Simulator, spending more time doing aerobatics, exploring, and mastering landings and takeoffs, than playing highly complex campaigns and cooperative missions that are so real, one mistake equals a quick and somewhat final death (have you ever manually started an F/A-18C switch by authentic switch just to respawn?). The truth is that you can play DCS and have a ton of fun doing it without learning what every knob does or how to use the aircraft’s complex navigational and mission avionics. You can even auto-start the planes with one key. Eagle Dynamics has really missed the boat not getting this reality across to prospective players—that there is scalability in terms of realism for the user—and that’s why they could be wounded by a product like Microsoft Flight Simulator that will cater to a huge swathe of perspective virtual pilots. In fact, potential users know this already as many have grown up with various iterations of the product or at least understand what it is and why it was such a big deal. This is especially true if Microsoft gets independent studios to provide highly advanced modules for their base software, just like DCS today. As such, you could execute high-fidelity carrier operations in a Super Hornet, or go on leisurely sightseeing tour a Cessna all within the same software suite. Also, what’s so exciting is that hardware capabilities have finally caught up with flight simulator software makers’ ambitions. Few systems were able to smoothly run FSX well over a decade ago. Today, powerful graphics cards and processors can offer smooth framerates even in the VR environment. This is a huge deal when it comes to user experience and the potential future growth of the Microsoft Flight Simulator brand. Regardless of how the relatively small consumer flight simulation industry will react to FS2020 after enjoying nearly a 14-year vacuum since the franchise’s last release, the biggest impact it could have is on a whole new generation of potential pilots, engineers, and aerospace industry workers who haven’t benefitted from a modern and highly accessible flight simulation experience in their lifetime. And boy does the aviation world need it. Young people have largely been disenfranchised from the world of aviation . Getting access to light aircraft is prohibitively expensive. Actually keeping up your qualifications or even one day owning a plane is also seen as the domain of the rich. Engineering-wise, young people have been shown that if they are talented in STEM they can make huge salaries while being pampered in a creative corporate tech environment, so why would they go work for Boeing or Lockheed or Textron, let alone smaller and far higher-risk firms? I truly believe this shift in STEM talent is part of what’s to blame for developmental debacles like the 737 MAX, KC-46, and F-35, and so many other major programs. A lot of young engineering cream is rising to Silicon Valley, not Everett or Fort Worth. That’s not to say that there aren’t super talented young people working on these programs, but if you talk to enough people on the inside, recruitment in the engineering and computer sciences fields has become an existential issue. The same thing can be said for those who actually fly the planes. With a huge demand for cockpit crews , wages are rising and competition has become more fierce for pilots internationally. The Pentagon is surely feeling the sting of this reality. The pilot seat was once seen as a lucrative and vaunted job within our society—right up there with architects and medical doctors. But in recent decades, that perception has dramatically lost its luster . Endless stories about pilots living at or below the poverty line with hundreds of thousands of dollars in flight school debt, sleeping on friends couches and working grueling schedules for little pay, far eclipsed the old perceptions of the career aviator. For a new generation that is focused on work-life balance, these perceptions are akin to kryptonite when it comes to bringing new pilots into the fray. One thing that can help overcome this roadblock is seeding the passion for aviation early via flight simulation—letting young people feel as if the joy of flight is right at their fingertips and that they can even be good at it without ever spending hundreds of dollars on an introductory flight. The addition of VR makes the computer flight experience all that much more exciting and real. Even still in its infancy, VR puts you in the cockpit. You are there . It is nothing like using a monitor or a head tracking device. I can only describe it as absolutely revolutionary. This technological leap equates to a powerful opportunity for the aviation community and industry. With a computer that costs a couple thousand dollars and software that takes zero fuel to run, requires no insurance, no ramp fees, and no maintenance, we can now put young people in the cockpit and give them an experience that is remarkably real. Flight Simulator 2020 is the key here. It can consolidate all of this into a sleek, reliable, scalable package that could even be able to reach across the computer gaming divide from the expensive personal computer to the relatively inexpensive gaming console. The fidelity may be inferior to its PC counterpart, but the penetration into a far larger user base is undeniable. With all that in mind, I don’t think FS2020 looks to be a cool product that has been long in waiting. I think its existence is directly tied to the future of aviation. If the aerospace industry were smart, they would capitalize on Microsoft’s endeavor and see that as many kids as possible get access to this game in a virtual reality setting alongside an instructor, which doesn’t even have to be physically present. In fact, they can sit right next to them in the cockpit in VR while being thousands of miles away. It’s a small investment to see that the future of aerospace engineering and our aviation industry remains strong and replete with plenty of aviators to fill cockpit seats and to buy airplanes, as well as a solid pool of talented engineers to design the next breakthrough in aerospace technology and skilled workers who will keep those technologies functioning. In fact, the Pentagon is already missing the boat on this. Think about what they spend on air show demonstrations a year? An F-16 costs $20,000 per hour to fly. Each air show appearance equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sure, seeing a Viper blast through the sky and talking to people that actually fly and maintain it is a hell of a recruiting tool, one that remains totally relevant. But for that same amount of money, how many young people could the USAF give an hour of free virtual flight instruction to at their school? It’s something to really think about. Finally, I want to expand on that instruction part. Nothing is like the real thing. No matter how good the sim is, it isn’t actually flying. But the fact that this level of technology is now available to the consumer means that a lot of the basics can be learned at home, in VR. From mastering core procedures, to working an aircraft’s avionics, to basic flying skills, they can be learned in your living room or in a nearby office building. Instructors can be right there to help guide a pilot’s skillset without even being in the same country. In other words, MS2020 could be the perfect platform for migrating a portion of the private pilot’s or light sport aircraft license curriculum into the distributed desktop/virtual environment. Then, after solidifying virtual skills, a student can more efficiently spend the money required to port them over in the actual cockpit. This concept could drastically help increase the private pilot pool and make the general aviation industry healthier as a whole. It also tears down the barriers to entry, which don’t just include cost, they also include convenience. With all that said, If FS2020 ends up being the scalable, high-quality product that is built from the ground-up for VR that I think it will be, it could be and should be transformational for the aviation industry. And that’s no spin.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 8, 2019",Navy Carrier Group Sets Sail Without Its Carrier As Maintenance Troubles Plague Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ticonderoga class cruiser and three Arleigh Burke class destroyers assigned to the Truman Carrier Strike Group have left ports along the East Coast of the United States for a scheduled deployment, but without two key components, the Nimitz class carrier USS Harry S. Truman or its air wing. The flattop has been sidelined since experiencing an electrical malfunction last month and the U.S. Navy does not know yet when, or if, it will be able to join its escorts. The predicament has also added to an existing shortage of deployable carriers on the East Coast, which could limit the service’s ability to respond to a crisis. USNI News was first to report the deployment on Sept. 12, 2019. The carrier-less Surface Action Group (SAG) presently consists of the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Normandy and the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Farragut , USS Forrest Sherman , and USS Lassen . The leadership of Destroyer Squadron 28 (DESRON 28) is in charge of the force and the SAG includes 15 additional personnel, including maintenance personnel and other technicians, to provide support that usually comes from a carrier’s crew during deployments. MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters from Helicopter Maritime Squadron 72 (HSM-72) are also assigned to the ships. “This group is going to deploy more than likely to multiple regions, and they are going with a much higher-end capability, with helicopter detachments with significant anti-submarine warfare capability, significant air defense capability, as well as strike warfare capability,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis, commander of U.S. 2nd Fleet, told USNI News . “So really a full-up group, minus the carrier and the air wing. But a full-up, very capable group is going off to do the nation’s bidding in this great power competition.” Lewis did not say where the ships would be deploying. The last outing for the complete Truman Carrier Group, which wrapped up in December 2018, took the ships to the U.S. 2nd and 6th Fleet Areas of Responsibility, which include a portion of the North Atlantic and waters around Europe and much of Africa, respectively. The deployment could also take some of the ships into various strategic bodies of water in the Middle East, which is under the purview of U.S. 5th Fleet. USS Farragut , USS Forrest Sherman , and USS Lassen , as seen from the USS Normandy , during the Truman Carrier Strike Group’s Composite Training Unit Exercise in July 2019., USN “The situation with Truman frankly is unfortunate; obviously we’re working really hard to fix it and we will fix it, but it’s unfortunate – nobody wanted that to happen certainly,” Lewis added . “But we’re going to make this into what it really is, which is, we’ve still got a massive capability that’s going forward on time, and that will be even more amplified when Truman comes out.” When, or even if, Truman will be able to join her escorts on the deployment is unclear. Lewis declined to give USNI News a projected date for when the carrier’s required maintenance would be completed. “USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) has experienced an electrical malfunction within the ship’s electrical distribution system requiring analysis and repair,” Captain Scott Miller, a spokesperson for U.S. Fleet Forces Command, had told USNI News back on Aug. 30, 2019. “The ship is working closely with technicians from Norfolk Naval Shipyard to determine the cause and scope of the issue. The safety of the ship’s crew and reactor plants are not affected.” The carrier, together with its air wing and escorts, had completed a Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) in July 2019, ahead of the deployment. The malfunction appears to have occurred sometime after that, and while details remain limited, the incident was serious and complex enough that repairs are only beginning now and personnel are still continuing to assess the full extent of the damage, according to USNI News . Truman had already been at the center of a still curious controversy earlier this year, which saw plans to retire the carrier earlier than expected appear and then quickly get reversed in the face of a massive backlash from Congress, a chain of events the War Zone analyzed in-depth at the time. Truman underway in the Atlantic, with Lassen following behind, during the Truman Carrier Strike Group’s Composite Training Unit Exercise in July 2019., USN Vice Admiral Lewis downplayed the situation, pointing to the ability of the SAG to perform the bulk of the core missions the full Carrier Strike Group was slated to conduct during the deployment. “There’s no doubt the carrier and the embarked air wing brings amazing strike capability and deterrent capability wherever it goes, but short of that, this is really going a long way towards the kind of capability we need to have at sea that can go across all mission sets,” he explained . It’s certainly true that anti-submarine warfare, something that the SAG is very capable of performing, is high on the list of priority mission sets for any forces deploying to 2nd Fleet. The Navy highlighted increased submarine activity in the Atlantic, primarily from Russia , as one of the primary reasons for reactivating this command in 2018. Anti-submarine warfare, together with air and missile defense , are also important missions in and around Europe, too, including in the Norwegian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea . All of the ships in the SAG have significant surface warfare capabilities, as well, and will be carrying Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles to prosecute targets on land , if necessary. Navy surface warships also often provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities off the coasts of known hotspots, such as Libya and various countries in the Middle East , both with onboard sensors and their MH-60R helicopters and any drones they might have embarked. MH-60Rs have also been called upon to provide airlift and other support to American forces, including special operations forces, that are conducting counter-terrorism and other limited operations ashore, in the past. A brief summation of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 46 (HSM-46), Detachment 8’s activities in 2014, while embarked on the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate USS Simpson , from the squadron’s annual command operations report for that year, as an example of how Navy surface warships and their embarked aircraft have provided intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and other support to forces ashore in the past., USN via FOIA At the same time, the Navy cannot know for sure what contingencies the SAG may be called upon to respond to during the course of its deployment. The service’s long-standing policy of regular carrier deployments around the world is specifically intended to help ensure there is a flattop nearby during any potential crisis. “ Where are the carriers? ” is a common refrain, inside the U.S. government and out, when geopolitcial tensions around the world threaten to turn ugly . No other ships in the Navy’s fleets can support the same kind of sustained forward-deployed air combat operations or move those capabilities quickly into a particular region where established facilities on land may be lacking or otherwise unavailable. The ships in the SAG have a much more limited capacity to conduct protracted operations, especially strikes on land, with just their guns and missiles, especially given how difficult it is to reload their Mk 41 Vertical Launch System arrays at sea. Beyond that, carriers also have less tangible, but no less real psychological capabilities and the United States regularly uses them as a way to “show the flag” in order to try to deter potential opponents. “There’s no question that not having the aircraft carrier, it does detract from the symbolism and the deterrent effect, no question,” Vice Admiral Lewis himself acknowledged . “The aircraft carrier is a behemoth beast with an amazing capability that, it shows up off your shores, and if you’re not our friend you become our friend quickly if you know what’s good for you.” Of course, this is not the first time the Navy had formed a surface action group or that a carrier has missed its deployment, either. In 2013, the first-in-class USS Nimitz , homeported on the West Coast, found itself in a similar situation and joined its escorts months after they had deployed . Two years later, the East Coast-based USS Dwight D. Eisenhower couldn’t make its deployment due to extended maintenance issues, so Truman went instead . In recent years, the Navy has been working on new deployment methods to both be better prepared for unforeseen contingencies and to make its operations less predictable for potential opponents, concepts that the War Zone has explored in the past . Truman and Normandy sail together in July 2019., USN The Navy has also been exploring concepts of operation based around smaller surface action groups . The service has said that Truman having to stay behind will give it a valuable opportunity to see how the remaining SAG performs in a variety of capacities. However, this particular situation underscores a number of ongoing issues that continue to impact the Navy’s ability to operate in a truly flexible and responsive manner. At present, Eisenhower is the only carrier available for deployment on the East Coast in any way. Unfortunately, it just recently finished a major 18-month maintenance period and is still in the process of re-certifying its crew . The USS Abraham Lincoln is already on deployment in the Middle East, having deployed there earlier this year ahead of schedule ostensibly to respond to lingering concerns about potential attacks from Iran or Iranian-backed proxies. USS George Washington is in the midst of an extensive refueling and complex overhaul , or RCOH, which began in 2017 and is scheduled to get finished in 2021. USS John C. Stennis was only recently reassigned to Naval Station Norfolk in order to get it prepared for its RCOH, slated to begin in 2021. Lastly, USS George H.W. Bush began a scheduled, but more limited maintenance availability in February, which was supposed to take 10 months. However, due to massive maintenance backlogs, the Navy now expects the process will take more than two years to complete. USS George H.W. Bush enters a dry dock at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in February 2019., USN Completing maintenance on schedule has been a major issue across the Navy’s surface and submarine fleets in recent years, with increasingly cascading effects on readiness as vessels sit idle and unavailable for deployment waiting their turn at a limited number of shipyards . You can read more in detail about the various factors that are causing trouble for the Navy’s carrier fleets in this recent War Zone feature . How this reality might impact Truman ‘s ongoing maintenance at present, or how that carrier’s unforeseen maintenance period may impact scheduled repairs to other ships, remains to be seen. Truman is scheduled to undergo its own RCOH starting in 2024. “They’re in the process of repairs and identifying all the root causes that they can at this point. There’s still some unknowns,” Vice Admiral Lewis told USNI News . “We fully intend to deploy the aircraft carrier at a later time.” In the meantime, for better or worse, Truman ‘s escorts are heading out without her.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 31, 2019",Navy Training Squadron Receives First E-2D Hawkeye With New Aerial Refueling Capability,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first non-developmental E-2D Advanced Hawkeye with an aerial refueling capability has officially joined the U.S. Navy’s fleet, marking the first step toward fielding these aircraft across the service’s carrier-based airborne early warning squadrons. Giving these already game-changing aircraft the ability to refuel in mid-air will significantly increase their endurance, something The War Zone has already explored in-depth in the past. Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 120 (VAW-120), the “Greyhawks,” based at Naval Station Norfolk in Virignia, took delivery of the new E-2D on Sept. 9, 2019. The Navy had already received three E-2Ds with the aerial refueling conversion for developmental purposes and is expecting that the new aircraft will reach initial operational capability next year. The service’s plans to acquire Advanced Hawkeyes with this capability trace back at least to 2014 . “This is an important day for naval aviation as we continue to increase our capabilities and maintain our competitive edge in the skies,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Roy Kelley, the commander of Naval Air Force Atlantic, said in a statement . “This capability will extend the endurance of Hawkeyes, increasing the Navy’s battlespace awareness and integrated fire control – both from the air and the sea.” VAW-120 is what is known as the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for the E-2D, and as such, is responsible for training aircrews and maintainers for operational Hawkeye units. The squadron is also responsible for training related to the C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft, which is a derivative of the E-2, for the time being. The Navy is in the process of replacing the C-2A with the CMV-22B Osprey , a decision the War Zone has previously covered in detail . One of VAW-120’s existing E-2Ds without the aerial refueling probe lands on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln ., USN “Aerial refueling capability is a game-changer for the E-2D community and future operations in the high-end fight,” U.S. Navy Commander Scott Wastak, VAW-120’s commanding officer, also said in a statement. “We will now begin to train instructor pilots and refuel with several different Navy and Air Force tanker aircraft, including F/A-18s.” The Navy expects to buy at least 29 E-2Ds with the aerial refueling probe, which adds approximately $2 million to the aircraft’s unit cost, which had previously been around $169 million, according to official budget documents . The service plans to have two operational airborne early warning squadrons flying the new subvariant of the aircraft by the end of 2020. As of 2018, the Navy and Northrop Grumman were still in negotiations about modifying the 45 E-2Ds that the Navy already has to bring them in line with new aerial refueling-capable configuration. The upgrades have an estimated cost of around $6 million per aircraft . An aerial refueling capable E-2D assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 (VX-1) links up with a US Air Force KC-10 tanker during a test in 2018., USN The E-2D is already an immensely capable and critical component of the Navy’s Carrier Air Wings. The aircraft provide vital airborne early warning and battle management functions, “quarterbacking” carrier aviation operations from the air and keeping watch for potential threats, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . The Advanced Hawkeyes have also become a central node in the Navy’s cooperative engagement capability (CEC) efforts, which include service’s overarching Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter-Air (NIFC-CA) networking concept, which The War Zone has covered extensively . In this role, E-2Ds can already significantly extend the reach of both the carrier air wing’s aircraft and weapons on ships in the carrier strike group. The data fusion and relay functions the aircraft provides also allows those other assets to engage targets beyond the range of their own sensors, something you can read about in more detail here . Aerial refueling capability will allow the E-2Ds to fly further from the carrier itself with less risk, giving the strike group’s operations ever great reach, and will simply allow them to remain on station longer. A typical Advanced Hawkeye mission now lasts around four hours, two and a half of which are on station. With aerial refueling, the Navy plans to extend total mission time to seven hours , five of which will be on station. Now that VAW-120 is receiving the first E-2Ds with the aerial refueling probe, the squadron’s instructor pilots will also likely begin exploring the new concepts of operations that the aircraft enables and providing their own additional feedback. That Navy is also separately looking to shake up how it conducts aerial refueling operations within the carrier air wing, in general, through the future introduction of the MQ-25A Stingray tanker drone. VAW-120’s new E-2D comes into to land at Naval Air Station Norfolk on Sept. 9, 2019., USN The new E-2Ds may also create new issues that will need to be resolved, especially when it comes to the human factor. Craig “Slim” Picken, a veteran E-2C Naval Flight Officer, told The War Zone in a lengthy interview that he felt he was lucky never to have had to fly in an E-2 with an aerial refueling capability, explaining: “The Hawkeye is a very uncomfortable airplane. “The three Naval Flight Officers (NFO) in the back sit sideways for four-plus hours in a dark tube, on a de-armed ejection seat, with the nose of the airplane slanted 12 degrees nose-up. The vibration of the then four monstrous (now eight) propeller blades was loud and exhausting. “The air conditioning never worked well, either. Thus, the guy furthest aft always froze his ass off while the NFO closest to the radar boxes burned up. “There were five radios with constant chatter, 20 or more airplanes to control, and radar systems that required constant attention, and so on. “It was busy. I was always thankful that the airplane didn’t have in-flight refueling capability. The torture was limited to five hours. A single flight was tiring. Two in the same day was exhausting!” All told, it’s safe to say that the Navy’s airborne early warning squadrons are set to gain impressive new capabilities as aerial refueling-capable E-2Ds begin arriving in increasing numbers over the next year. At the same time, the service may now need to also explore ways to ensure that crews can handle the added stresses of much longer-duration missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 29, 2020",USAF F-35As and F-15Es Flatten ISIS “Infested” Island In Iraq With 80K Pounds Of Bombs (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and F-15E Strike Eagles dropped 36,000 kilograms, or nearly 80,000 pounds, of bombs on an island in Iraq’s Tigris River that ISIS had been using as a transit hub to move men and materiel from Syria and other points west deeper into Iraq. However, an official press release from the U.S.-led coalition fighting the terrorists in Iraq and Syria did not say that strikes had killed any militants or destroyed any specific targets. At the same time, the statement’s wording suggests the airstrikes may have actually been a so-called “ terrain denial ” operation to simply blast away vegetation and other natural cover that might have offered concealment for ISIS, also known as Daesh, and their supply caches. The strikes occurred on Qanus Island in the Tigris on Sept. 10, 2019. Qanus is approximately 175 miles northwest of Baghdad, some 55 miles southwest of the Kurdish regional capital in Erbil, and around 100 miles east of the Syrian border. The sorties were ostensibly supporting the 2nd Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) Battalion’s still-ongoing ground clearance operation, nicknamed Operation Black Dirt, to root out ISIS elements in the area. Though the U.S.-led coalition, known formally as Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), declared that it had destroyed the terrorist’s “physical caliphate” in December 2017, the group has continued to be a persistent security threat in both Iraq and Syria. “We’re denying Daesh the ability to hide on Qanus Island,” U.S. Air Force Major General Eric Hill, presently commander of Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR), the coalition’s main special operations component , said in a statement. “We’re setting the conditions for our partner forces to continue bringing stability to the region.” The general location of Qanus Island within Iraq., Google Maps A dated satellite image from 2002 offering a closer view of the general area, with Qanus Island, almost entirely covered in green foliage, at center. , Google Maps However, exactly what this particularly massive burst of airstrikes achieved is somewhat unclear and the coalition did not immediately offer information about what types of aircraft were involved, how many total planes actually conducted strikes, or what munitions they employed. Official pictures that accompanied the press release did show F-35As and F-15Es, both of which are presently forward deployed to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, taking part in the operation. There are also presently Air Force B-52H bombers deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which would have been well suited to this mission, but there is no indication that they participated. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter prepares to head out to conduct strikes on Qanus Island., CJTF-OIR The F-15Es appeared to be carrying loads of at least five 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-guided bombs. The Joint Strike Fighters had their external wingtip rails for the AIM-9X Sidewinder fitted, but did not appear to be carrying any of those air-to-air missiles. They were not carrying any other external ordnance, suggesting that they were likely each carrying two additional GBU-31/Bs. Airmen finish loading GBU-31/B JDAMs on an F-15E Strike Eagle ahead of airstrikes on Qanus Island., USAF It would have taken 40 of these JDAMs in total to account for the 80,000 pounds of bombs the U.S. military says it dropped on Qanus Island. Official video footage of the strikes, seen near the beginning of this story, does not show 40 separate impacts, though it very possible that it does not cover the full extent of the operation. In addition, despite identifying Qanus Island as a transit hub for ISIS movements, the coalition has not specified if the strikes were targeting any personnel, structures, or supplies. “Coalition Forces used 80,000 pounds of munitions on the island to disrupt Daesh the ability to hide in the thick vegetation,” is how the release described the objective of the airstrikes. The description sounds very much like what the U.S. military calls “ terrain denial ,” which literally involves using air and artillery strikes, among other methods, to physically destroy foliage, rock outcroppings, and other types of natural cover to prevent enemy forces from using them. The War Zone has reached out for clarification, but, at the time of writing, we have not yet received a response. The Air Force notably conducted a number of similar missions in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2017, involving B-52H bombers armed with unguided bombs, something The War Zone was among the first to report on . There is no indication that the strikes on Qanus island involved any dumb bombs and the strike video shows all the hallmarks of precision-guided munitions, including the near-perfect and highly efficient spacing between impact points. The mission to simply evenly saturate the island with bombs would have offered a “targeter’s dream” of sorts. A B-52H bomber carrying a load of JDAMs under its wings. These bombers conducted terrain denial strikes in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2017 using unguided bombs., USAF “Area denial missions can range from shaping enemy force maneuvers to denying key terrain to the enemy,” an Air Force public affairs officer had told The War Zone in November 2017. “These terrain denial strikes are useful in enabling freedom of maneuver for our forces, elimination of cover and concealment by enemy forces, an [sic; and] affecting enemy pattern of life in such a way that allows us to gain invaluable intelligence on their networks.” Given how the U.S.-led coalition has framed ISIS’ use of Qanus Island, conducting a terrain denial mission there would offer many of the same benefits. It would deny the terrorists a concealed base camp, which could include man-made structures and fortifications that make use of natural cover. It could also disrupt their operations in the area more broadly and potentially force them to move out into the open, at least in the immediate future. At the same time, if these airstrikes were indeed part of a terrain denial mission, it only serves to underscore how ISIS continues to enjoy considerable freedom of movement within Iraq nearly two years after the U.S.-led coalition declared that the group was no longer able to actively control physical territory. Denuding an island of vegetation to prevent the terrorists from using it as a base of operations points to the limits of the Iraqi government’s ability to exert control in many areas. This also follows a recent U.S. government inspector general report that highlighted significant shortfalls in the Iraqi military’s ability to conduct its own aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, including having just one Chinese-made CH-4B drone that is mission capable. USAF F-35A that was involved in the operation refueling from a KC-10 Extender. , USAF Concerns have been building for some time that various unrelated tensions, including Turkey’s separate campaign against Kurdish groups that it views as terrorists, could be giving ISIS space to consolidate their resources and regroup in Iraq, as well as neighboring Syria. A recent string of reported Israeli strikes targeting Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and other Iranian interests in the country have added yet another dimension to what is already a complicated geopolitical environment. The apparent Israeli air campaign led the Iraqi government to declare in August that it would prohibit foreign military aircraft from flying any missions inside its airspace without prior approval on a case-by-case basis. The U.S. military said it would abide by this decision , but also began talks with Iraqi authorities about how exactly to proceed in the future. These strikes, directly in support of an ISOF operation, were clearly conducted in coordination with the government of Iraq. Whatever the exact targets of the Air Force’s extensive airstrikes on Qanus island were, it certainly makes clear that ISIS remains a real threat and one that Iraqi authorities, together with the U.S.-led coalition, continue to take very seriously. UPDATE: 7:30pm EST— The CJTF-OIR Media Operations office has declined to say whether or not the objective of these particular strikes on Qanus Island were part of a terrain denial mission. However, they did confirm that coalition forces have conducted terrain denial strikes in the past. “The island is believed to be a major transit hub and safe haven for Daesh,” the media operations office added in their statement to The War Zone . “Currently the investigation is still ongoing so we cannot disclose the number of militants on the Island at the time of the operation.” It is not clear if this is a routine investigation. We have reached out again for additional clarification. UPDATE: 9/11/19— The CJTF-OIR Media Operations office has provided the additional clarifying statement: We would call this a terrain denial mission and Iraqi-led ground clearance operation. The ground assessment is being conducted by the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service. We will have to refer you to them for details about the assessment. The coalition applies rigorous standards to our targeting process and takes extraordinary efforts to protect noncombatants. We cannot speculate on the outcome of an ongoing assessment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 8, 2019",Army Night Stalker Chinook Teamed Up With Bomb-Slinging Drone In Complex AI-Enabled Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment recently took part in a test at the U.S. Navy’s Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake . Personnel flying onboard an MH-47 Chinook special operations transport helicopter directly controlled an MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone, which then launched a GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition at a target. Other individuals on the ground then redirected the small glide bomb to another target mid-flight. Altogether, this single experiment offered a window into U.S. military advances in manned-unmanned teaming, networked munitions, and artificial intelligence. U.S. Army Brigadier General Walter Rugen, the director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team within the service’s new Futures Command, first disclosed the test at the Association of the U.S. Army’s “Hot Topic” forum on aviation on Sept. 5, 2019. The experiment itself had occurred at China Lake in California on Aug. 28, 2019. “We really worked hard on our unmanned systems, our architecture, our automation, and our interfaces up at China Lake against a real threat,” Rugen explained. The officer added that his team at Futures Command is heavily focused, in general, on efforts to “weld the air-ground team tighter and tighter into a pretty solid punch for any potential enemy.” Rugen offered limited details about the test scenario, such as what the final assigned target was or what it was supposed to represent, or the overall simulated threat environment. The original target was a surrogate surface-to-air missile system in a mock urban setting, according to Defense News . A US Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone in Iraq., US Army The test was reportedly the first time a Gray Eagle had launched a Dynetics GBU-69/B, an increasingly important weapon in the U.S. special operations community’s arsenal. This 60-pound class small glide bomb is already in service on the U.S. Air Force’s AC-130W Stinger II and AC-130J Ghostrider gunships. Rugen also disclosed that the individual on the MH-47 in control of the MQ-1C directed the drone to fire its munition at the target using a tablet device. It is not clear how long the two aircraft were working directly together. After the Gray Eagle released the bomb, personnel in a tactical operations center (TOC) on the ground took control of it using a two-way datalink. In March 2019, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), working in cooperation with Dynetics, announced they had completed an initial series of tests of the newest Block I GBU-69/B, which incorporates an X-Net two-way datalink from Raytheon. A GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition falls onto a target during a test., Dynetics With the TOC now in control of the weapon, an artificial-intelligence driven Army networked sensor system on the ground, known as the Architecture, Automation, Autonomy, and Interfaces (A3I), determined there was a higher priority target in the same general area. Personnel in the command center subsequently redirected the bomb in flight, which then successfully hit its new mark. The Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team had developed the prototype A3I system in nine months together with the Army Special Operations Command, as well as unspecified representatives from academia and the defense industry. It’s not clear what types of sensors were actually involved, but the network could have been able to spot potential threats using a mix of various systems, such as infrared imaging, radars, and electronic support measures, categorizing and geolocating them. After that, an algorithm would have been able to use preset variables to determine that there was a more pressing target for the GBU-69/B to strike, with the system at least suggesting another target. The potential value of this combination of manned-unmanned teaming, networked munitions, and automated targeting could be immense. Rugen himself noted that simply enabling personnel in nearby manned aircraft or on the ground to take direct control of an orbiting drone could be extremely useful in speeding up the time it takes between identifying a target and engaging it. “What if the squad leader could just grab the sensor because we have the hierarchy?” he said, rather than having to verbally communicate the location of the target to pilots potentially sitting thousands of miles away. The U.S. military has already made significant progress in developing similar capabilities, largely beginning with the fielding of the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver ( ROVER ) system that allows personnel on the ground to see what the sensors on aircraft flying above see in near-real-time nearly two decades ago. Networked munitions only add additional flexibility to the situation, offering personnel on the ground the option to jump in and redirect a weapon in flight to attack a more pressing target. It could also help ensure that no weapon hits a target after its already been destroyed, improving targeting efficiency and reducing the total number of munitions an aircraft may need to employ to ensure the destruction of multiple targets in the same area. The Air Force is in the midst of its own similar project, known as Golden Horde , with many of the same goals in mind and that potentially could turn groups of cruise missiles and glide bombs into swarms that can work together autonomously. From what The War Zone has heard about the Golden Horde initiative, it is seen within the Air Force as extremely important and a potential game-changer for future conflicts. The same general idea could spread to other systems, as well, like unmanned aircraft and hypersonic weapons, all working together across an integrated network. It could also tie into the development of swarms of small “suicide drones,” concepts the U.S. military has tested at China Lake in the past, among other locations. The Army is itself in the process of exploring the idea of using swarms of small unmanned aircraft to counter hostile swarms, as well. This added networking capability also means personnel in the air or on the ground have more opportunities to shift a munition away from innocent bystanders who might suddenly appear in the area. This latter point could be especially important in future conflicts involving fighting in dense urban environments, or “megacities,” an area of growing concern for the U.S. military as a whole. Developments in artificial intelligence-enabled sensor networks, such as A3I, could be the glue that truly “welds” all of this together as Brigadier General Rugen described, being able to fuze information together form a massive array of sources much faster than any human being. This would give all personnel involved a “common picture” of the battlefield in a readily accessible format that identifies known friendly positions and hostile threats, potential objects of interest, and more. It’s that same architecture that could offer a stepping stone to even greater autonomy on the battlefield, especially when it comes to unmanned aircraft, including true unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), and pilot-optional systems. The Air Force is pursuing a number of similar developments with a particular eye toward revolutionizing air-to-air combat . The Army has also been working for years to expand manned-unmanned teaming capabilities between existing AH-64 Apache gunship helicopters and the MQ-1C, as well as smaller RQ-7 Shadow drones. So, with that in mind, it’s not surprising that the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team is at the forefront of all of these developments. The Army wants its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft , an outgrowth of the larger Future Vertical Lift program, to be pilot-optional and is also developing a number of systems to be able to rapidly offer unmanned functionality across its fleets of existing helicopters and in future rotorcraft designs . The War Zone has been following FARA and these other developments very closely and you can read about them more in these past stories . A design based on Sikorsky’s advanced S-97 compound helicopter, seen here, is one of the contenders for the Army’s FARA program., Sikorsky As it stands now, the systems involved in the test at China Lake are still a ways away from being ready for prime time. It reportedly took Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft seven total sorties to deliver all the necessary equipment to the range in California. “We can’t sustain that,” U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 5 Cory Anderson, the Army Special Operations Aviation Command branch chief for unmanned aerial systems said, according to Defense News . “We believe we can get it down to a two C-17 load-out just by minimizing the [power] generational requirements alone.” Even so, the test at China Lake is a clearly a significant step forward for the Army, with Brigadier General Rugen calling it “our first jump into algorithmic warfare.” There may come a time in the not-so-distant future where advanced helicopters order fleets of drones around the battlefield to engage targets semi-autonomously, or even autonomously, based on the data an overarching network of sensors generates automatically.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to the seat of power for major militaries around the globe, gargantuan structures are par for the course. The Pentagon in Virginia may be the most famous, but Russia’s imposing Ministry of Defense headquarters is also highly impressive, and China’s Ministry of National Defense building in Beijing is also well known. When it comes to Egypt, even though it has one of the most powerful militaries in the region, some sort of iconic headquarters for the country’s Ministry of Defense doesn’t come to mind, but that is about to change—dramatically. As part of a larger initiative to move government offices to a new administrative capital city roughly 20 miles to the east of sprawling, crowded, and in some cases crumbling, Cairo, the Egyptian MoD is pioneering the effort with an extremely large, elaborate, and highly unique installation. Referred to as the “Octagon” because it is made up of the eight outer “nested” octagon-shaped buildings, with two more at its hub, and what looks like the ability to add another two within that hub in the future. Cairo is seen on the left, with the new MoD headquarters location where the red arrow is placed, roughly 20 miles outside of central Cairo. , Google Earth The hub and spoke design has been implemented with plenty of additional land for other installations and facilities to be added inside its second and third outer rungs, as well. The layout is also designed to organize and reflect the central command apparatus with the outer octagons housing each of the countries four service branches— the Egyptian Army, Egyptian Navy, Egyptian Air Force, and Egyptian Air Defense Forces. So, it’s something of a grand manifestation of the Egyptian Ministry of Defense’s organizational chart as much as it is an architectural statement. Regardless, from space, the project looks like an alien base out of a science fiction movie. Google Earth The elaborate compound started construction in 2016. Within a matter of months, the blank desert landscape was being transformed into a sprawling installation unlike any other on the planet. As you can see in the image below dated November 2016, each ottoman is similar in configuration and there appear to be tunnels that run between each one and the two inner two octagons. Google Earth There are some clear tactical benefits to the design. Spreading the MoD’s functionality across multiple interconnected facilities offers survivability from limited attacks. Giving each service two well-spaced octagons also offers some redundancy should one be struck, at least depending on the functions and systems each one holds. Like America’s Pentagon, having three distinct ‘nested’ structures within each octagon also provides resiliency if one part of the facility is attacked. Isolating the sides and layers of each octagon into individual structures that are interconnected means that the entire installation wouldn’t be destroyed as the result of one explosive attack. A close-up of just one of the fascinating “octagan” structures that makes up the facility. , Google Earth Beyond those potential merits, the size of the new military district overall, and just how elaborate it is, is somewhat bewildering. We cannot find an estimate of how much it cost, but suffice it to say that is far from cheap. I originally became aware of the project when Mahmoud Gamal posted about it on Twitter. As you can see below, the design definitely takes into account ancient Egyptian architecture: Some other renderings of the project are floating around the internet. Eventually, the idea is that the entire new administrative capital will feature lush landscaping and a central city complete with multiple skyscrapers rising from the desert floor. You can see in the image below the overall plan for the military district in Egypt’s new administrative capital. It includes an air base, housing, and tons of space for expansion. User Minymina at Skyscrappercity.com User Minymina at Skyscrappercity.com User Minymina at Skyscrappercity.com The project began in 2015 as a major vision of the then-new President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as a way to solve logistical issues due to Cairo’s crowding and to jumpstart a new image of Egypt that was divorced from the political turmoil that descended upon the country as part of the Arab Spring. Some posit that it is like a monument to el-Sisi himself and have drawn parallels to it and the notoriously expensive building projects of the pharaohs long ago . www.newcapitalcompound.com/ Some of the tens of billions of dollars needed to jump-start the project have come from Arab gulf states, China, and other foreign investment, as well as land sales and other Egyptian government fundraising initiatives. Apparently, the project’s future is in doubt due to lack of funds to complete its multiple phases, as well as due to major logistical issues with building an entirely new city in the Egyptian desert and finding the people to actually build it. This may not impact the Ministry of Defense district, but it could leave its surroundings in something of a zombie state if funding and other major challenges aren’t solved. It will be interesting to see how this remarkable site evolves over time. We will keep scanning satellite imagery and will report back with new developments when they occur.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The F-35A Is Set To Finally Get Chaff Countermeasures To Confuse Enemy Radars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force is hoping to integrate a new, advanced chaff countermeasure onto its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters next year, according to a report. The cartridges, which release radar reflective material to blind and confuse enemy aircraft and air defenses, are a staple across many of the service’s other combat aircraft , but have been curiously absent from the stealthy F-35’s otherwise extensive defensive suite . Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor Steve Trimble, a good friend of The War Zone , was first to spot the detail on Sept. 9, 2019. The Air Force included the information about the new chaff cartridge, known presently as the ARM-210, in a draft environmental impact statement , dated August 2019, regarding the basing of F-35s at various Air National Guard facilities. The report includes a host of information on how the aircraft might impact their surrounding environments , including the potential release of countermeasures, such as infrared decoy flares and chaff. “The ARM-210 chaff proposed for use by the F-35A is currently unavailable and undergoing operational testing,” according to the environmental review. “It is expected to be available for use in 2020.” It is unclear whether this applies to the U.S. Marine Corps F-35B or U.S. Navy F-35C variants, as well, or any of the three variants in service with foreign air forces. The F-35’s use or potential use of chaff has long been something of a debate, in general. Recent U.S. military budget documents and other sources make no mention of it among the aircraft’s expendable countermeasures – flares and towed decoys – which had suggested that it was, indeed, a capability the Joint Strike Fighter lacked and might not necessarily have needed given its stealthy design. An image showing the general layout of the defensive systems on a Marine Corps F-35B. The general location of the infrared countermeasures (IRCM) dispensers, as well as Radiofrequency Countermeasures (RFCM) dispenser, loaded with flares and towed decoys respectively, are the same as on the F-35A. The IRCM dispensers will likely be used to fire the new ARM-210 chaff cartridges in the future. , Lockheed Martin However, F-35 simulators have included the ability to replicate this functionality, according to Trimble. He also noted that a briefing in 2018 from U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, then head of the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), had included a reference to “advanced chaff” as being part of the still-in-development Block 4 upgrades for the Joint Strike Fighters. The ongoing testing of the ARM-210 now confirms that at least the Air Force plans to integrate chaff into its F-35As in the near future. This cartridge’s specifications, and how it differs from RR-180 and RR-188 types the service already has as a countermeasure option for other combat aircraft, is unclear. “ARM-210 chaff is similar to the RR-180 and RR-188 chaff currently in use by the F-16, F-15, and A-10 aircraft proposed for replacement [with the F-35],” the environmental impact report says, without offering any other details. “A  bundle of chaff consists of approximately 5 to 5.6 million fibers that are cut to reflect radar signals, and when dispensed from aircraft, form an electronic ‘cloud’ that breaks the radar signal and temporarily hides the maneuvering aircraft from radar detection,” it says more generally. Chaff, which dates back to World War II , originally consisted of aluminum strips cut to various lengths. More modern examples, use metallicized synthetic fibers, which help them hang in the air longer, offering more persistent effects . The Armtec RR-188, for example, uses bundles of aluminum-coated silica fibers . There have been a number of chaff releases within the United States in the past few years as part of training exercises that have highlighted just how long-lasting and far-ranging the clouds can become depending on release altitude and environmental factors. The size and composition of the fibers are directly connected to what radar bands the chaff affects, which can make them particularly effective against specific threats. See-through display examples of the US Navy RR-129 chaff cartridge, at bottom, and RR-144 at top, as well as loose fibers, at right. This gives a good general sense of the payloads inside the RR-180s and -188s. , USN The ARM-210 designation would suggest that the new cartridge is another Armtec product. The company, a division of Esterline, which is now itself a subsidiary of TransDigm Group, uses this nomenclature internally for its countermeasure products, which include both chaff and flares. Armtec’s RR-180s and -188s are already significant improvements over the older RR-170-series. These newer cartridges fit into the same one-inch-by-one-inch slots in U.S. military countermeasures dispensers, but hold two self-contained chaff payloads that fire separately. Each one provides the same level of defense as a single RR-170. What this means is that the RR-180s and -188s effectively double the amount of chaff an aircraft can carry in the same dispenser. The exact construction of the chaff payload in the ARM-210 could be even more effective and long-lasting. At the same time, a 2014 brochure from Esterline interestingly says that the company offered “Specialized tactical and training variants developed for F-22 and F-35 platforms.” It’s not clear whether this meant that the Air Force and other F-35 operators had intended to employ RR-180s or -188s on their jets or if the ARM-210 has been in development at least that long. Part of a 2014 Esterline brochure that mentions Armtec chaff cartridges for the F-22 and the F-35., Esterline So, it is possible that differences between the ARM-210 and its predecessors have to do more with the location and configuration of the F-35’s internally-mounted countermeasures dispenser than with the payload itself. This could have precluded the jets from effectively releasing the existing cartridges. It’s also unclear then if the ARM-210 is the planned “advanced chaff” that Vice Admiral Winter had mentioned in 2018 or an interim development to ensure the F-35 has this capability in the near term. The Block 4 upgrades are still years away from getting implemented across the U.S. military’s Joint Strike Fighter fleets. Still, whatever the ARM-210’s exact capabilities are, it will certainly add another important tool in the F-35’s defensive toolbox. As The War Zone has explored in-depth in the past, the Joint Strike Fighter’s stealthy capabilities do not obviate the need for additional countermeasures, including flares, decoys, and electronic warfare systems . https://youtube.com/watch?v=MFWoYKkKFyE In particular, many stealthy fighter aircraft, such as the F-35, have designs where the front aspects of the aircraft are best optimized to hide from high-frequency fire control radars. In extremely broad terms, they are less capable of evading lower frequency radars or when flying away from a radar of any kind. This reality already underscores the value of towed decoys, especially for when the aircraft exit the target area after their mission. It also highlights how it would be valuable for the jets to be able to create their own electronic smokescreen using chaff plumes. Those same chaff clouds could help give F-35s additional protection and freedom of maneuver during extended engagements, especially when it is carrying weapons externally in a non-stealthy configuration. Of course, chaff isn’t impenetrable, either, and the F-35’s ability to employ the ARM-210 will not replace any of the jet’s other extensive defensive features, including advanced towed decoys, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . But, with potential adversaries continually working to improve their air defenses constantly, stealthy aircraft such as the Joint Strike Fighter will face ever more threatening environments that will demand a broad mixture of defensive capabilities to ensure they can successfully complete their missions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 23, 2022",Watch Japan’s Giant US-2 Amphibious Flying Boat Land In An Amazingly Short Distance,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The ShinMaywa US-2, which is a direct outgrowth of the half-century-old US-1 design it replaced, provides search and rescue, maritime patrol, firefighting, medical evacuation, and logistical support capabilities for the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force. It was the largest amphibious flying boat in production up until China bested it with their AG600 amphibian that first flew in 2017. But that aircraft isn’t yet operationally deployed, the US-2 is, and it recently displayed its somewhat astonishing short-takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities to onlookers at the Red Bull Air Races in Chiba. Check out the clips below. Although the US-2 may look like the flying boats of yesteryear, it is a remarkably modern aircraft. It features a glass cockpit, a digital flight control system, and four Rolls-Royce AE 2100J turboprop engines that pump out 4,600hp each. In its firefighting configuration, she can deploy an impressive 15 tons of water. Performance-wise, the US-2 is no slouch. It cruises along at 300mph at 20,000 feet and has a range just shy of 3,000 miles. It can also land in some really rough seas, with waves up to around nine feet tall. Yet what’s most impressive, as the videos above showcase, is the US-2’s short-takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities that are made possible primarily by a blown flap and flight control system arrangement. This not only allows for very short and slow takeoffs and landings, but it also gives US-2 pilots a unique level of controllability even at very slow speeds. Basically, the US-2 makes its own lift and control surface pressure. Check out this diagram to understand exactly how the system works: Unknown The aircraft’s big wings, large flaps, draggy boat hull, and its quartet of six-blade props that can be thrown into reverse also help greatly with its ability to plop down in a very small stretch of water. For a country of islands, the US-2 makes a ton of sense, but the only drawback to it is that it costs a lot of money. The price of the sixth one ordered in 2013 was $156M. Only half a dozen of them exist even though the first one took to the air in 2003. Two more are currently under construction and, clearly, their high cost is at least somewhat a result of there being such low production numbers. Still, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and Greece have all expressed interest in the type. The deal with India for a dozen of the planes, which has been an on-again, off-again affair, has each aircraft costing about $113M. For comparison, the largest of the 737 Max aircraft has a list price just shy of that number—that is before its big controversy began. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7mqL_lgE5OE https://youtube.com/watch?v=SEnfrb3Rr7s The US-2 has only grown more relevant since entering service in 2007. Many countries are facing challenges in littoral regions that they weren’t just a decade ago. The rise of China, in particular, and Beijing’s extraterritorial claims , has put a new premium on the capabilities that a big amphibian can provide. Hence the reason China itself developed the AG600 at substantial cost. Beyond that, the fact that these planes can also be formidable firefighters when needed is a huge advantage that countries outside of the Indo-Pacific region may find very attractive. If the US-2’s unit price can drop significantly via additional orders and a more mature aircraft production line overall, it would make it all that much more attractive to potential buyers that would be otherwise deterred by its current price tag. Regardless, the mighty US-2 is one impressive machine to watch in action. The fact that it can land on a runway just as easily as it can on the water, and do so in a very short distance, makes it a heck of a versatile beast—one that is also reminiscent of days gone by when flying boats graced the skies on a regular basis around the globe.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 2, 2019","You Can Buy Paul Allen’s Octopus, Arguably The World’s Most Incredible Yacht","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you are a fighting ship aficionado, you probably also have at least a tangential interest in big yachts. Sometimes the line between the two categories of vessels blurs to the point of near indistinguishability . All my life I have been fascinated with the world’s ultimate private ships, both old and new. Today, even in a competitive era of ever-larger mega yachts that can rival cruise ships in size, it’s not just about mass, it’s also about quality and creative ship design, which can border on downright genius. Maybe the smartest mega yacht of them all design-wise is the late Paul Allen’s Octopus , an iconic vessel in the yachting universe and one that you can now own for $325,000,000—roughly the price of five G650 Gulfstream jets. The Microsoft co-founder and legendary entrepreneur’s death has led to the liquidation of many of his most prized, but eccentric belongings. From the world’s largest aircraft that was built to put satellites into orbit, to his mint and very flyable MiG-29UB Fulcrum jet fighter, much of the contents of Allen’s incredible toy chest are being sold off to the highest bidder. His beloved Octopus is now part of what is something of the world’s most outlandish estate sale. Built by Lurrsen and delivered in 2003, at that time she was the world’s largest yacht, but she quickly lost that crown as part of an ongoing competition among the world’s yachting billionaires to have the biggest boat. Today she doesn’t even make the top ten list in terms of length (414 feet), but she certainly does in terms of displacement, which sits just shy of 10,000 tons—eclipsing the displacement of a Ticonderoga class guided-missile cruiser . Burgess Yachts listing Octopus can accommodate 26 guests in 13 cabins, many of which are suites. Her crew of 63 is spread out in 30 cabins. Just as a reference here, at full load, she has a crew to guest ratio of nearly 2.5 crewmen per guest. For comparison, the crew to guest ratio on Royal Caribbean’s Anthem Of The Seas has a ratio of .31 crewmen to each guest. The Seaborne cruise line’s super up-market and small-sized ship fleet, like the Seaborne Odyssey , has about a .73 crewmen per guest ratio. Of course, during parties, the vessel can accommodate hundreds of people temporarily. Octopus has an incredibly classy exterior design that is somewhat timeless when compared to more exotic and bland looking yachts that sail the high seas these days. This is in part due to its purpose—it is both a pleasure yacht and an exploration vessel. Burgess Yachts listing The utilitarian half of Octopus’s personality shows through in her overall design. Case in point, her large floodable well-deck in her stern that holds a yellow submarine named Pagoo. Pagoo can embark ten people on up to eight-hour-long underwater adventures. The sub can dive as deep as 1,000 feet . ISE Ltd. built the submarine , which has huge glass portholes for its occupants to gawk out of, for Allen. Pagoo in Octopus’s well-deck., Unknown View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melissa Boloña (@melissabolona) #findthebell RT @PaulGAllen : ROV control room. ROV now at 1525 M, more than half way there, another hour to bottom pic.twitter.com/48jHZJPi — Casey Holdahl (@CHold) August 23, 2012 An unmanned remotely operated vehicle that can dive far deeper—thousands of feet below the surface of the ocean—is also stored and deployed from here along with the ship’s primary tender, Man Of War. Allen’s obsession with aviation also injected some warship-like qualities into Octopus . She has two landing pads—one on the bow and a very large one on the stern. The stern pad is co-located with a huge helicopter hangar capable of easily storing two helicopters— Allen’s Sikorsky S-76C and his MD-902 NOTAR Explorer. Such a large hangar bay—or just any hangar bay at all—is quite unique even in the mega yacht universe. The ship’s hull opens up in multiple places to deploy beach clubs and water toys, along with Octopus’s myriad tenders—seven are embarked including Man Of War. Octopus also has missionized spaces that can be reconfigured for different exploration voyages. Its well-deck can also accommodate specialized gear depending on what the goal of the mission is and what partners are embarked aboard, or on nearby on support and scientific vessels, to accomplish it. And it has accomplished some very high-profile missions indeed. Burgess Yachts listing It found the USS Lexington at the bottom of the Coral Sea and the USS Indianapolis as well as the Japanese battleship Musashi near the Philippines. It even recovered the ship’s bell from the sunken HMS Hood . She has also executed Arctic and Antarctic expeditions with the help of her hardy steel hull that is Ice Class 1A rated , including traversing the Northwest Passage. But it’s not as if Octopus is all business and no play, far from it in fact. The primary purpose of the vessel is still to entertain its guests like nothing else can. Seattle’s Jonathan Quinn Barnett designed its interior, which carries over its exterior’s blending of classical nautical design cues with a modern flare. The vessel is equipped with a large pool that can be converted into a dancefloor via a retractable glass system and is replete with a top-of-the-line lighting system. You can see Octopus in party mode in this photo and this series of photos. Burgess Yachts listing She also features an absolutely top-notch recording studio—another one of Allen’s great loves was music. Many hitmakers have recorded in the sea-borne studio , such as Mickjagger, Usher, Johnny Cash, Bono, and god knows who else, but rest assured the secret list is extremely impressive. Of her eight decks, one is entirely dedicated to the owner alone. It features a private entertaining lounge with a full bar, its own jacuzzi, and dining area, as well as its own dedicated elevator, one of two on the entire ship. A library, bar, movie theater, gym, observation lounge, and a complete dive center—with its own hyperbaric chamber —are all available to guests. The rear landing pad doubles as a basketball court, which makes sense as Allen owned the Portland Trailblazers. The list of accouterments goes on and on. It even has a glass-bottom viewing area! The best collection of photos showing off Octopus’s endless features are in the videos posted below: When it comes to its powerplant, Allen spared no expense. The ship runs off a diesel-electric arrangement with eight diesel generators powering two electric motors that provide six megawatts of juice to drive her screws. It’s supposed to be remarkably efficient, giving the ship the ability to cruise a whopping 12,500 miles at 12.5 knots on a single tank of gas and hit a top speed of 19 knots. Paul Allen described his passion and amazement for the project in his 2011 autobiography, according to Bloomberg , stating: “When I first stood on the bridge, I felt as though I was on a spaceship,” he wrote, adding that with features including a pool, basketball court, movie theater, a recording studio with ocean views, “all my passions come together in one moveable feast.” … “It’s less a Bentley than a Range Rover,” Allen said in the memoir, adding that “Octopus has realized every mission I had in mind for her.” Burgess Yachts listing Overall, even though Octopus is 16 years old, it remains one of, if not the top yacht in the world. Not in size, but in quality, thoughtfulness of its design, timelessness, features, quality of construction, and especially versatility. In fact, from what I can tell, its selling price is substantially more than what Allen paid for the vessel in 2003. This is a very rare reality in the world of large vessels where depreciation driven by a tiny customer base can be absolutely brutal. You need extremely deep pockets not just to buy Octopus , but to keep it running. The rule of thumb is that a yacht costs roughly ten percent of its total cost to operate annually. So in this case, at least according to the sale price, we are talking $32.5M every year. But that number is probably even higher considering all the unique toys embarked aboard her and the specialized crew needed to maintain and operate them. Octopus at night., Buhleedat/wikicommons Security is a big part of this. A mega yacht is a huge and slow target literally floating on the water. Considering the wealth and notoriety of the owners of these types of vessels and their guests, enemies and nefarious opportunists are not hard to come by. With this in mind, a highly-trained security team is needed to stand round-the-clock vigil. There have been many reports that Allen had a team of ex-Navy SEALs onboard to protect Octopus . I have no idea how accurate that often repeated rumor is, but would you be surprised if he didn’t seek the most talented operators with vast experience in the maritime operating environment to protect his pride and joy? I mean, when you own something this expensive already, why not? So, for the richest human beings on the planet, a ‘for sale’ Octopus represents a very rare opportunity to snap up a vessel that has stood the test of time when it comes to the hardest to impress community in the world. And a ship that is uniquely capable of grand discoveries and adventure, as well as throwing unrivaled parties on the French Riviera. In fact, Octopus is still arguably the best design that can actually wear both hats, with other exploration-capable yachts looking far less glamorous and luxurious. Burgess Yachts listing While other yachts may be far larger, like Azzam for instance, or a bit more flashy and entertainment-focused, like Serene , Octopus still seems to have its tentacles wrapped tightly around the “best overall yacht in the world” mantle, and that my friends comes at a very high price to whoever will call her theirs next. Octopus is currently co-listed for sale by Fraser and Burgess .

No, I did not screw those metrics up, the video below shows a test being conducted on an object that is moving far beyond the threshold of hypersonic speed (Mach 5) just a few feet over the desert floor near Alamogordo, New Mexico. Make sure your audio is on for this, the sound alone is worth the click: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edwards Air Force Base (@edwardsairforcebase) So, what on earth could they be testing at those speeds on the rocket sled track? Well, pretty much any component that has to work while accelerating to and traveling at hypersonic speeds. And this is a very big deal these days as the Pentagon is clawing to get its hands on basically any Hypersonic weaponry it can. Sensitive guidance and control systems will have to be able to survive heavy acceleration forces and high thermal stresses in order to make America’s hypersonic dreams a reality. Coatings and construction materials also need to be put to the test before a heavy investment into flight-testing prototypes is made. And this is on top of other scientific high-speed research that is ongoing at any given time at Holloman’s High Speed Test Track.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 8, 2020",Air Force Touts B-1B Bomber’s Potential To Carry Huge Hypersonic Missiles And External Stores,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-1B fleet may be tired and war wary after constant deployments overseas, but the USAF is continuing to look at how to improve the aircraft’s combat punch as it enters the back end of its career. This goes far beyond adding new avionics to its flight deck , new sensors , and communications gear. The flying force is now exploring ways to give the heavy-hitting Bone even more magazine capacity than it already has and the ability to carry outsized hypersonic missiles in its internal weapons bay. The core of these exploratory efforts is centered around two latent features that were built into the swing-wing bomber’s design many decades ago. The B-1B was built with external hardpoints to carry large nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. These hardpoints were never really activated in a significant manner operationally, that is aside from the one under its right ‘neck’ area that it has used to mount the Sniper Advanced Targeting pod in recent years . The cruise missile racks themselves were pulled out of service completely following the B-1B losing its nuclear delivery role due to the START treaty. B-1B with cruise missile mounting racks attached to external hardpoints during testing. , USAF By introducing new racks for these pylons, the B-1B could carry even more weaponry than it currently does, and weapons of shapes and sizes that are not conducive to the dimensional confines of its internal weapons bays. As for that internal weapons bay—actually, the Bone has three—the front two are connected by a common bulkhead that can be repositioned in order to create a much larger continuous bay. Doing so could allow for the carriage of large hypersonic missiles that require big boosters to get their vehicles up to speed and altitude. Currently, the B-52 is being allocated for the hypersonic weapons truck role , with external pylons specially engineered to weapons weighing tens of thousands of pounds. Yet the Bone’s potential ability to also carry these weapons, and do so internally, would add tremendous value to the aging and increasingly finicky to operate type. A B-52 carrying an captive carry prototype of the hypersonic AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, last June. , USAF All this and more was being put up for discussion at the 412th Test Wing and Global Strike Command’s “expanded carriage demonstration” that occurred on August 28th, 2019, at Edwards Air Force Base. At the gathering, industry partners were brought in to take a look at what the Air Force was thinking of for its middle-aged bomber in order to springboard development of these and other concepts centering on expanding the B-1B’s weapons carrying capability. An Air Force news item about the show and tell session reads in part as follows: “The purpose of the demonstration was to show that we’re still able to move the bulkhead from the forward intermediate bay to the forward location; increasing the intermediate bay capacity from 180 inches to 269 inches, said Lt. Col. Dominic Ross, B-1B program element monitor, AFGSC. “Additionally, we demonstrated that we can still carry weapons externally on six of the eight hard points, which increases our overall carriage capacity.” “It increases the magazine capacity of the B-1B. Currently we can carry 24 weapons internally, now it can be increased to potentially 40 based on what type of pylon we would create,” Ross said. “This gets the B-1 into the larger weapons, the 5,000 pounders. It gets it into the hypersonics game as well.” Ross said that the B-1B was designed with eight hard points to carry weapons, as well as a moveable bulkhead… For the select industry partner open house of sorts, a B-1B was loaded-up with a mock-up hypersonic missile attached to the same smart bomb-capable Conventional Rotary Launcher now used in the B-52H’s weapons bay. In addition, a Joint Air-To-Surface Standoff Missile, also known as the AGM-158 JASSM, was attached to the same hardpoint that currently carries the Sniper Targeting pod as an example of how the Bone’s latent hardpoint attachments can be used to carry high-end weaponry. The JASSM and B-1B combination was the all-star of the multi-national cruise missile strikes on Syria in April of 2018. A photo of industry partners and USAF personnel taken at the event.

This is normally where the Sniper targeting pod goes. , U.S. Air Force photo by Richard Gonzales The Small Diameter Bomb II, also known as Stormbreaker , was also on display at the event. If it was integrated on the B-1B, it could potentially carry throngs of these all-weather precision glide bombs at one time. In some cases, this would allow the Bone lay waste to entire airfields, port facilities, armored formations, and other large target sets with pinpoint precision on a single pass, while also staying outside the heart of enemy air defenses. GPS-guided JDAMs on the left and SDB II Stormbreaker on the right. , U.S. Air Force photo by Richard Gonzales The Air Force news item continues: Capt. Timothy Grace, test weapons systems officer, 419th FLTS, provided technical expertise about the B-1B aircraft used for the demonstration and was able to explain to the group how the proposed concept is relevant to the warfighter. “I wanted to make sure it was tested correctly and reviewed it to make sure it’s relevant to the warfighter,” Grace said. “And absolutely, there are things we can use this for.” Another point he made was how quickly the bulkhead modification can be accomplished, and then reversed. “It’s not a permanent modification, it’s something that can be done through a few work shifts with the Maintenance (Flight),” he said. “So depending on what the targets are that we’re going after, the weapons we need to carry, we can move that bulkhead, and do the external carriage.” From a commander’s viewpoint, the expanded carriage would open up better planning options, said Col. Richard Barksdale, 28th Operations Group commander, from Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. “It would basically increase the weapons capacity to make the bomber more efficient, so that we’re able to strike more targets with the same aircraft,” Barksdale said. “It would allow us to more efficiently plan for targeting and use fewer aircraft with fewer aircrews in harm’s way to strike the same number of targets. It would also decrease the support required, whether that’s tankers or other support assets.” Barksdale compared the added capability to having “more arrows in the quiver of the B-1.” “It really shows the aircraft was originally designed for that capability; to move that bulkhead forward and make a larger bay, it shows the forethought of the original engineers and now, that can potentially come into fruition,” Barksdale said. “To me, just the opportunity to increase the weapons load capacity is pretty exciting. It’s a pretty impressive capability.” Ross said the initial idea was brought forth from B-1B crews, including himself. He previously served as a B-1B weapons systems officer, and then as a pilot. This demonstration occurred at a very interesting time in the B-1B’s service life. During the Obama Administration, there was an initiative that looked to potentially convert the type into arsenal ship of sort s, loaded with a larger number and larger variety of precision-guided munitions, including long-range standoff weaponry. Before that, the B-1R supercruising region bomber upgrade was also floated, a potential initiative that also would have seen external stores stations be used operationally as mission requirements dictate. Neither of these programs came to fruition. Fast forward to today and the B-1B fleet has found itself in an amazingly poor readiness condition . It has also been the source of headlines as of late due to systemic issues with critical life safety systems that have led to its grounding on multiple occasions for significantly long periods of time. The fleet is now being dug out of its dilapidated state by taking a much-needed pause in deployments, but its future remains, well, up in the air, to a certain degree. USAF B-1B upgrade programs as of 2018. , USAF industry briefing slide Even though it is slated to serve into the 2030s , at which time the B-21 Raider will replace it in full, just this week the USAF brass hinted that it will once again look to retire certain ‘legacy’ systems in order to free up funds for new weaponry and other initiatives. Of the bomber force, the B-1B is the only one at risk of being on the chopping block. It will be interesting to see what comes of all this, but releasing the B-1B from the weapons carriage restrictions that are currently in place due to the configuration of its internal weapons bays may significantly change the Pentagon’s rationale for keeping it around in the short and long term. Also, being able to carry more weapons on external stations, and integrating smaller, but more numerous types, like Stormbreaker, may help provide that arsenal ship-like capability that was seen as so attractive just a few years ago. In addition to JASSM, the B-1B is capable of employing its anti-ship cousin, the stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile , better known as LRASM. With more hardpoints, it could make the B-1B an even more capable stand-off anti-ship strike asset than it already is. These features and the ability to haul around the USAF’s new golden child—hypersonic weapons—may just give the Bone the reprieve that it suddenly finds out it desperately needs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 23, 2019",Putin Demands Response To U.S. Tomahawk Test Despite Having Treaty-Busting Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has formally directed the country’s authorities to devise a “symmetric response” to the U.S. military’s recent test of a land-based Tomahawk cruise missile launch, a weapon system that the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, had prohibited. Of course, the most logical course of action is for Russia to publicly “unveil” the INF-breaching missiles it is already understood to have developed and fielded, which led to the collapse of the agreement in the first place. However, the Kremlin may need to wait to do so in order to maintain its claim that it does not already have these weapons. Putin made his announcement during an open meeting with permanent members of Russia’s Security Council on Aug. 23, 2019. The Russian President had already pledged some form of response immediately after the Tomahawk test this past weekend, which The War Zone covered in-depth . The Kremlin had also previously warned that it would deploy its own post-INF weapon systems if the deal collapsed, while at the same time continuing to deny that it already had at least one of these systems in service. The United States withdrew from the bilateral deal on Aug. 2, 2019, after arguing for years that Russia had deployed a treaty-breaking land-based cruise missile called the 9M729, also known as the SSC-8 Screwdriver to NATO. “Considering the newly emerging circumstances, I instruct the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and other specialized agencies to analyze the level of the threat, which the above-mentioned U.S. moves are creating for our country, and take comprehensive measures for preparing a symmetric response,” Putin told the assembled officials . With the INF now gone, as noted, the most obvious course of action for Russia is to now publicly deploy the SSC-8/9M729. The INF prohibited the United States and Russia from developing or fielding any land-based conventional or nuclear-armed missiles of any type with maximum ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles, though it did provide some leeway for ground-based testing of naval systems. The SSC-8 is widely believed to be a ground-launched derivative of Russia’s combat-proven Kalibr sea-launched land-attack cruise missile. Russia did publicly display a missile launch canister that it said was for the SSC-8/9M729, but also asserted that it was INF-compliant, in January 2019. The Russians did not show the actual missile, which made it impossible to independently assess those claims. You can read The War Zone ‘s full analysis of the Kremlin’s claims here . The existence of this missile may also require the Kremlin to give any “new” weapon a separate nomenclature to assert that it is indeed a new development. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZlTEoy-NXZA The Russians may also need to first announce they are “developing” and “testing” this missile and allow for some amount of time before officially fielding it. This is especially likely given Putin’s criticism of the rapidity with which the U.S. military demonstrated a post-INF missile system. “It is noteworthy that the tests of a missile with characteristics prohibited under the treaty were conducted just 16 days after the completion of the procedure of denouncing that treaty initiated by Washington,” Putin added at the meeting . Russia asserted for years, without providing any hard evidence, that the U.S. military’s existing and planned Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense sites in Europe also violated the INF since they used a version of the Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS). Though variants of the Mk 41 can launch Tomahawks, among other weapons , the U.S. government said that the versions for Aegis Ashore were not capable of firing INF-breaching missiles. The Kremlin continued to dispute this, but also rejected offers to conduct inspections. So, depending on how long the Russians decide they need before the SSC-8/9M729 can make its public debut, they may look to take more immediate courses of action. One possibility is that Russia will simply claim it has modified the older SSC-7 , also known as the Iskander-K or 9M728, to increase its range. The SSC-7/9M728 was already right at the edge of the INF’s range limits and it might be possible for engineers to increase its fuel load by reconfiguring various internal components or reducing the size of its warhead. The missile that Russia claimed was actually the SSC-8/9M729 was itself a longer, modified SSC-7/9M728, though the Kremlin said this new weapon actually had less range than its predecessor. However, doing this might imply that the SSC-7/9M728 was itself in violation of the INF. The treaty stipulated that designers had to craft compliant missiles in ways that prevented them from being quickly modified to increase their range. Another option would be to follow the U.S. military’s path and quickly build a ground-based launcher for unmodified Kalibr cruise missiles, especially given the SSC-8/9M729’s reported commonality with this design. In addition, Russia already reportedly tested Kalibr derivatives from fixed test launchers on land, which was allowed under the INF as long as the final system was not land-based. However, this could look more like an improvised capability than an operational one, which does not seem to be what Putin has in mind. Beyond that, despite Putin’s call for a “symmetric response,” it is also possible that the Kremlin may choose to demonstrate weapon systems that would have already been outside the bounds of the INF’s restrictions. For instance, Russia has publicly said that it is developing a host other strategic weapons intended to defeat missile defenses, such as those the United States is developing and fielding. By every indication, the Kremlin’s real issue with Aegis Ashore was and continues to be Russia’s fears that America’s missile defense shield could negate its deterrent capability, something that it, at least in its present configuration, is incapable of doing. “Our work to develop the most advanced weapon systems that are truly unrivaled in the world was prompted and, it can be said, was provoked by the unilateral pullout of the United States of America from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ,” Putin added at the meeting on Aug. 23, 2019, underscoring this point. Russia has been developing advanced ballistic missiles , hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , nuclear-powered cruise missiles, and nuclear-powered nuclear-armed long-range torpedoes in recent years with the goal of negating missile defenses. A prototype of the nuclear-powered cruise missile, which is called Burevestnik, or a related test article, is widely thought to have been involved in a still-nebulous accident two weeks ago. Russia has now admitted that this incident, which killed at least seven people, involved a nuclear-powered missile , though it has not specifically said it was Burevestnik, which is also known to NATO as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall. The exact scale and scope of the accident, including the extent of any radiation leaks , remains unclear and the Kremlin has reportedly taken steps that appear to be intended to conceal that information. All told, concerns are growing that the United States and Russia may be heading toward a new arms race now that the INF is gone. Unfortunately, the available evidence strongly suggests that the two countries are already well on their way, if they aren’t in the midst of this type of competition right now. With Putin’s marching orders in hand, the Russians will now be moving to demonstrate some type of post-INF missile system in the near future, regardless of whether it is actually new or not.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Coast Guard has rescued hundreds of people across the Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane Dorian using helicopters operating from a little known and secretive U.S. Navy submarine test base situated on one of the islands in the archipelago. The Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center’s detachment on Andros Island’s main job is managing expansive test ranges so the Navy can conduct various underwater tasks, such as measuring the acoustic signatures of submarines and validating those signatures before deployments, as well as anti-submarine and electronic warfare research and development activities. As of Sept. 6, 2019, the Coast Guard had deployed seven MH-60T Jayhawk and six MH-65 Dolphin helicopters to AUTEC’s facilities on Andros Island. The service has saved at least 205 people in the Bahamas since it began operations in the aftermath of Dorian on Sept. 2, 2019. Fixed-wing Coast Guard aircraft, including its HC-130 Hercules rescue planes , have been operating from bases in Florida to conduct aerial surveys and other search and rescue functions, as well. Elements of the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, as well as U.S. civilian agencies, have also been involved in the American response to the disaster and more active-duty personnel, as well as elements of the National Guard, could be deploying to the Bahamas soon. Hurricane Dorian had first made landfall in the Bahamas on Sept. 1, 2019, causing devastation across numerous islands in the country, including the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. There have been at least 30 confirmed fatalities so far, but Bahamian officials have warned this could rise dramatically in the coming weeks given that thousands of people are still unaccounted for. Pictures and video that have emerged so far show extensive damage and scattered debris. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Xu_dMPadvIY “Our emergent priority is to get the critically wounded out and help the government of the Bahamas get the infrastructure back up so it’s safe, sanitary and livable – at least on a temporary basis – for those folks,” U.S. Coast Guard Captain James Passarelli, chief of staff of the service’s 7th District, told CNN . “Most of the operations to date have been relocating and transporting the critically injured to a higher level of medical care.” Using AUTEC’s Bahamian base makes good sense. The site has 12 helipads and associated helicopter support facilities necessary for Navy and contractor-operated helicopters performing work on the nearby ranges. there is also a nearby airstrip. Beyond being able to help on Andros Island itself, from there, it’s less than 150 miles north to Great Abaco or Grand Bahama. It’s around a 100 miles from the Florida mainland to Grand Bahama, but closer to 200 miles from there to Great Abaco. The Coast Guard has made use the central location of the Navy facilities in the past to support responses to previous hurricanes , as well as counter-narcotics missions . A map showing the general location of AUTEC’s facilities on Andros Island. Great Abaco is visible at the upper right-hand corner, with Grand Bahama directly to its west., Google Maps A satellite image of Andros Island, with AUTEC’s main facilities to the right. The island’s main airport is also visible to the left. The island is also a popular tourist destination., Google Earth A closer look at AUTEC’s “Site 1” on Andros Island., Google Earth The area also happens to be home to a particularly deep stretch of water called the Tongue of the Ocean , or TOTO, located to the east of Andros Island. TOTO is around 150 miles long, has a general width of around 20 miles, and is up to 6,000 feet deep at certain points. More importantly, it’s a u-shaped trench that has a relatively flat bottom and is well shielded from ambient ocean disturbances and noise by Andros and other islands, reefs, and shoals that surround it. This makes it an ideal area for AUTEC to test submarines and other underwater systems, as well as anti-submarine weapons and sensors on surface ships and aircraft. It is about as close to a laboratory setting in the real world as you can get and it’s relatively easy to cordon off while testing and other activities are ongoing. One of the primary activities that the Navy conducts within AUTEC’s deepwater ranges, formally known as the South TOTO Acoustic Facility (STAFAC), is measuring the acoustic signatures of submarines. This is done for testing purposes, as well as to validate and confirm that a submarine’s signatures are what they should be before an operational deployment or following major maintenance and refitting. A map showing AUTEC’s deepwater ranges, as well as the site of its main facilities and various outstations., USN Using various equipment, including High Gain Measurement System (HGMS) arrays on the seafloor that you can read about in more detail here , personnel record radiated noise as a submarine passes through the range. A submarine’s survival in a combat situation, as well as its ability to sneak into target areas undetected, is directly linked to how quiet it is. Facilities like AUTEC are vital to the Navy’s development of noise-reducing features for new and existing submarines, as well as concepts of operation to help further mitigate their acoustic signatures. There are other similar underwater test bases elsewhere in and around the United States, including the Navy’s Southeast Alaska Acoustic Measurement Facility (SEAFAC), situated north of Ketchikan, Alaska, and Navy’s Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD) in Bayview, Idaho. Pictures and diagrams of the HGMS arrays at SEAFAC in Alaska. STAFAC off Andros Island has a similar setup., USN In addition, AUTEC’s ranges offer sufficient space for surface ships and aircraft to test how good their sensors are at detecting underwater targets and how well their weapons, such as improved versions of the Mk 48 torpedo , are at engaging them. Submarines can then test their own countermeasures and tactics through limited, mock combat, which can involve surrogate and otherwise simulated threats. A full list of AUTEC’s capabilities also notes that it supports research and development of anti-torpedo countermeasures , mine warfare systems , and various other underwater capabilities . AUTEC also provides similar services to NATO allies as part of the alliance’s Naval Forces Sensor and Weapon Accuracy Check Sites program, or FORACS . The facilities on Andros Island are also connected to AUTEC’s main headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida, and the two can share information during tests in near-real-time. In addition, the base operates an Electronic Warfare Threat Simulator (EWTS) that can “generate complex, dynamic, electromagnetic signal environments at the radio frequency (RF) level” to support additional research and development work on the surface and in the air. The threat of adversaries employing various kinds of signal jamming and spoofing against U.S. naval forces during an actual conflict has only grown in recent years, making systems such as the EWTS ever more essential for creating truly real-world representative threat environments for both testing and training purposes. For the moment, AUTEC’s much more visible role will be in supporting the continued disaster relief efforts in the Bahamas. With Dorian now moving up the East Coast of the United States, the Coast Guard’s helicopters, as well as other U.S. military and civilian elements, may move their activities onto other impacted islands. For that to happen, Bahamian authorities and their American and other international partners will need to work to open airports and other facilities first. On Sept. 4, 2019, four Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors flew an Air Force Airfield Assessment Team into the Bahamas to begin surveying the state of available sites. A member of the Air Force Airfield Assessment Team prepares to board a Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey at Homestead Air Reserve Base in Florida ahead of flying to the Bahamas on Sept. 4, 2019., USAF In the meantime, the Navy’s vital submarine test base on Andros Island will continue to serve as an important staging point for the Coast Guard live-saving operations throughout the Bahamas.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 27, 2019","“B-21s With Air-To-Air Capabilities,” Drones, Not 6th Gen Fighters To Dominate Future Air Combat","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is still working to iron out just what it thinks air-to-air combat will look like a decade from now and what types of aircraft it will need to come out on top in any future fight. As part of its ongoing Next Generation Air Dominance program, or NGAD, the service is exploring a wide array of manned , unmanned , and pilot-optional concepts , as well as advanced associated technologies, including increased network connectivity and autonomous capabilities . At the same time, however, it has steadily moved away from plans for a once much-touted sixth-generation fighter jet. A number of senior Air Force leaders have offered updates about NGAD recently , all of who stressed that the final force mixture will include a variety of different platforms, as well as munitions and other systems , all tied together at various levels. This could include manned aircraft networked together with “ loyal wingman ” drones, fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), swarms of low-cost unmanned aircraft, and more . “If we were to characterize it [NGAD] as a fighter, we would be… thinking too narrowly about what kind of airplane we need in a highly contested environment,” U.S. Air Force Major General Scott Pleus, who is currently Director of Air and Cyber Operations for Pacific Air Forces, recently told Air Force Magazine . “A B-21 [Raider stealth bomber] that also has air-to-air capabilities” and can “work with the family of systems to defend itself, utilizing stealth – maybe that’s where the sixth-generation airplane comes from.” The Air Force Research Laboratory released the video below in 2018 , which shows various notional advanced capabilities, including a manned sixth-generation fighter jet and loyal wingman drones, which could be in service in the 2030 timeframe. It’s not clear if he literally meant an aircraft as large as a B-21 Raider, or the B-21 Raider itself, acting as a manned component of the Air Force’s future air-to-air combat ecosystem or if he was simply referring to repackaging the stealth bomber’s state-of-the-art features and capabilities in something like a very stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). However, The War Zone has pored over the available information about the B-21 on a number of occasions and explored how the bomber itself could serve in multiple roles, including in an air-to-air capacity . A tailless, stealthy, comparatively long-range tactical jet that many had labeled a sixth-generation fighter had been the focus of the Air Force’s plans for dominating the air-to-air realm through the middle of the century up until recently. The fiscal realities of producing such an aircraft that would require a long development period would have made it very unlikely to materialize even before the USAF shifted its focus on the matter. If anything, a heavily upgraded “F-35E” variant of the Joint Strike Fighter is far more likely to serve in the role of a future manned tactical fighter for the USAF based on fiscal constraints alone. Case in point, in December 2018, the Congressional Budget Office released an assessment that the Air Force’s previously proposed Penetrating Counter Air aircraft could have an average unit cost of around $300 million, even with a relatively large order of more than 400 aircraft. This was more than three times the price the service was paying at the time for new F-35As. The unit costs of all three Joint Strike Fighter variants have since decreased further. This further reinforces the pipe dream that is developing and producing a ‘sixth generation’ fighter, at least in a traditional sense. Regardless, the Air Force is still very much working out what it wants from NGAD, which traces its immediate roots back to at least 2015 with the start of an “F-X Development Plan.” The next year, the service published a study titled “ Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan ,” which initially to a program called Penetration Counter Air (PCA) that, in turn, has evolved into the current effort. A briefing slide from 2015 with a timeline for an “F-X Development Plan” at the bottom, showing an expectation that the aircraft would hit “Milestone B,” or engineering and manufacturing development phase, by the end of 2022., USAF The Air Force had planned to complete additional studies to determine its future air superiority requirements by mid-2018, but this ended up being pushed back to the middle of this year, according to a backgrounder from the Congressional Research Service. This would have brought it in line with parallel U.S. Navy efforts, which had also evolved from a future fighter jet concept, known as F/A-XX , and was sometimes confusingly also referred to as NGAD. In this same time frame, the language surrounding the Air Force’s NGAD project has steadily moved away from talking about actually developing a new fighter jet. In April 2018, senior Air Force leaders told Congress they had recognized there was “no ‘silver bullet’ solution” when it came to developing a new air combat platform. Concept art from Lockheed Martin of a notional tailless stealthy sixth-generation fighter jet engaging a threat with a directed energy weapon., Lockheed Martin Another sixth-generation stealth fighter concept, again including a directed energy weapon, from Northrop Grumman., Northrop Grumman The Air Force’s latest budget request for 2020 Fiscal Year budget asks for more than $1 billion to conduct additional studies into both aircraft and weapon systems under NGAD. “The 2030+ Air Dominance candidate concepts consist of operational analyses, threat studies and technology candidate assessments and prototyping to identify operational concepts and technologies that improve persistence, survivability, lethality, connectivity, interoperability and affordability in 2030 and beyond,” the service’s budget documents say in outlining the plans for the upcoming fiscal cycle. You can read the complete relevant sections from the Fiscal Year 2020 budget request below: DOD DOD Of course, while the Air Force is clearly still very far from settling on any mix of platforms that will provide its future tactical air combat capabilities, there are some indications as to where the service’s general thoughts may be trending. PCA had initially focused heavily on some form of manned sixth-generation fighter jet, but as NGAD has evolved, it has steadily shifted more and more toward unmanned and pilot-optional concepts linked together by powerful networks so that they can operate at least semi-autonomously, if not autonomously, as necessary. “[NGAD] really does diverge away from a platform-centric way of doing air superiority,” Major General Pleus explained Air Force Magazine . “We’re going to have to up our game in all areas.” In the future, manned aircraft may still act as limited, centralized forward controllers for the Air Force’s unmanned air combat fleets. At the same time, the Air Force is actively exploring systems that could potentially rapidly turn any aircraft into an autonomous platform as part of its Skyborg program . Though the Air Force has declined to confirm if this remains the case, the service had previously decided that the B-21 Raider itself would be pilot optional, as well. The unmanned components of NGAD, whatever they turn out to be, may be more complex than just pure drones that may or may not be capable of working together with manned aircraft as “ loyal wingmen ,” too. An emphasis on modular physical structures, as well as software architecture, offers the possibility that a platform that begins in one form may quickly grow into one that can operate with or without crew and with or without any kind of direction from a manned aircraft or a ground station. In addition, the line between aerial weapons and unmanned aircraft may also become increasingly blurry. For years now, the Air Force has been touting plans to develop and acquire fleets of unmanned aircraft that will be “ attritable .” This is typically understood to mean that they are cheap enough to procure that commanders can use them in riskier ways without worrying about the costs to replace them, but it is not supposed to be a synonym for “expendable” or “disposable.” The prime example of such a system is Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie drone, which the Air Force is now experimenting with. This concept may be evolving, as Steve Trimble, Aviation Week’s Defense Editor and a good friend of The War Zone , noted from remarks that Acting Secretary of the Air Force Matt Donovan made at the third annual Defense News Conference on Sept. 4, 2019. The Air Force’s top civilian specifically talked about investments in “ low-cost single-use aircraft ” as part of NGAD. As Trimble highlighted in a series of Tweets, this would not only mean that these platforms could be used in a disposable fashion, but that they would be, by definition, disposable after a single sortie. This would be a significant departure from the commonly accepted understanding of “attritable” and create a class of systems that would lie somewhere between highly networked munitions – something the Air Force is already working on through its Golden Horde program – and more traditional unmanned aircraft. Extremely long-range air-to-air missiles, even anti-aircraft cruise missiles, possibly traveling at hypersonic speeds, might fit this general description, as well, though the U.S. military does typically make hard distinctions between these types of weapons and anything it would define as an “aircraft.” Beyond that, in 2017, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency did outline a concept for a “ flying missile rail ” that a combat aircraft would carry like a stores pylon, but that would then detach and fly away on its own like a miniature UCAV. This unmanned platform would then fire its missiles at the intended target, extending the overall engagement range of those weapons and their overall tactical flexibility. Donovan may have also been referring to investments the U.S. military has already made into small, low-cost, disposable drones, which, so far, have been largely focused on logistical missions. Examples of this work would be DARPA’s Inbound, Controlled, Air-Releasable, Unrecoverable Systems ( ICARUS ) program and the U.S. Marine Corps’ Supply Glider effort. A drone that startup Otherlab unveiled in 2017 for the ICARUS program, which is made primarily from industrial cardboard., Otherlab There is also a possibility that Donovan could be referring at least in part to a broader concept of acquiring more aircraft faster, but with shorter life cycle expectancies. In April 2019, Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, proposed just such a concept and likened it to the service’s relatively fast development and acquisition of the “ Century Series ” fighter jets from the 1950s and 1960s. Those jets, which had designations beginning with F-100, hence the nickname, were not supposed to last for decades, though they weren’t supposed to be disposable either. In 2018, now-retired U.S. Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, who was then head of Air Force Materiel Command, used somewhat similar language to describe the deliberate acquisition of aircraft with no long-term sustainment plan. These planes would not be disposed of after a single mission, but the service would still effectively plan from the beginning to throw them away at the end of a potentially short service life. Roper’s and Pawlikowski’s concepts may be more in line with what Donovan actually meant with his description of planes that are “single use,” rather than platforms the Air Force plans to sustain and upgrade for decades. The goal here would be to encourage rapid development cycles and reduce the costs of initial acquisition of aircraft and establishing the supply chains necessary to support them in the long term. None of these concepts are really all that original. In, 2016, The War Zone proposed all of them and many more in a highly detailed feature on unmanned air combat systems intended for a higher-end fight and why they had mysteriously disappeared from the Air Force’s nomenclature and public persona, which you can read here . You can also read about how many of these general ideas were becoming evident even longe before then . Stress and fatigue testing of a Northrop Grumman X-47B unmanned aircraft ., Northrop Grumman In recent years, sustainment costs, broadly, have only become an increasingly serious concern for the Air Force, as well as the other branches of the U.S. military, especially when it comes to complex manned platforms, such as the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Fleet size and the readiness of those fleets are also highly pressing issues. So, at least in the near term, it’s not surprising that NGAD may end up focusing more on exploring available lower-cost options with distributed capabilities as alternatives to traditional air combat assets with highly centralized capabilities, such as manned fighter jets packed with ‘exquisite’ technologies. In the Air Force’s mind, “this is not going to be a 2040 version of the F-22, an aircraft that can close almost any kill chain the Air Force has today all by itself,” Steve Trimble, who has been actively following the evolution of the service’s aerial combat concepts, told The War Zone by Email. “This is going to be a family of aircraft, with each optimized to close one or two links of the chain. … In the near-term, of course, it will begin by pairing F-35As and F-22s with the XQ-58A as a Loyal Wingman. Over time – at least a decade or more – the Air Force hopes to transition to the new approach with capabilities dispersed among multiple types of networked aircraft.” B-21 rendering., Northrop Grumman “It’s a concept that implies turning the aerospace industry upside down. Generally speaking, prime contractors today lose money on designing aircraft, break-even during development and production and make the real profits during sustainment,” he continued. “The Air Force wants contractors to put their focus mainly on cutting-edge design, then leave the production and sustainment phase open to competition. It’s the only way the Air Force can pump out new aircraft types every three years, rather than one every 15-20 years. And that approach also incentivizes industry to allow the Air Force to retire aircraft as soon as they become obsolete, rather than keep them propped up for decades with expensive incremental upgrades.” At the same time, Trimble noted that NGAD’s present form may not be it’s last and that changes in leadership and budgets could impact how it continues to evolve as time goes on. Regardless, the picture that is emerging is of a cocktail of systems, many of which are unmanned—from extremely stealthy, B-21 like UCAVs to attritable drones—and the complex networks that will enable them, not of one single extremely high-cost program or aircraft type. All told, it remains very much to be seen what combination of platforms and capabilities the Air Force will determine it needs to “dominate” future opponents in the air in the decades to come. But whatever it ends up looking like, some platinum-plated sixth-generation manned super fighter is very unlikely to be a part of it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Upgrades Needed For Sustained F-22 Operations During A Crisis In Europe Axed For Border Wall,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon says it will defer building various facilities to support rotating deployments of F-22 Raptors to Germany as part of a larger reallocation of military funds to support wall construction along the United States’ southwestern border with Mexico. Delaying the planned work, which included setting up a dedicated repair center that would be able to maintain the composite structures , exotic coatings, and other elements of the stealth fighter’s sensitive radar-absorbing skin, could have significant impacts on the Air Force’s ability to operate these jets for sustained periods in the region during a crisis. On Sept. 4, 2019, the U.S. military announced it would redirect a total of $3.6 billion in funding to wall construction. All of these funds came from spending that Congress had approved between Fiscal Years 2017 and 2019 to support 127 individual military construction projects within the United States and elsewhere around the world, including the F-22-related work at Spangdahlem Air Base . The installation currently hosts a squadron of USAF Block 50 F-16CJ/DJ Vipers. Back in February 2019, President Donald Trump had declared the situation on the southwestern border to be a national emergency , which has enabled the Department of Defense to use provisions in the National Emergencies Act to redirect military construction funds to support building new border barriers without Congressional approval. “I have determined that 11 military construction projects along the international border with Mexico, with an estimated total cost of $3.6 billion, are necessary to support the use of the armed forces in connection with the national emergency,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper wrote in a letter to Representative Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat and present chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, on Sept. 3, 3019. “The funds being made available are associated only with deferred military construction projects that are not scheduled for award until fiscal year 2020 or later.” What Esper’s letter doesn’t note is that many of the 127 military construction projects in question have already been in the works for years and that raiding funds earmarked for those projects will almost certainly lead to significant delays in their implementation. This, in turn, could have cascading impacts on the operational plans many of these projects were meant to support. Case in point, the F-22 projects at Spangdahlem, which Congress enacted funding for in the budget the for the 2017 Fiscal Year. That year, the Air Force asked for a total of $21.28 million to support Raptor related construction at the base. This was broken into three separate projects: a new F-22 low observable/composite repair facility, upgrading infrastructure/communications/utilities related to Raptor operations at the base, and upgrading hardened aircraft shelters there to accommodate the stealth fighters. A satellite image of Spangdahlem Air Base as of 2017., Google Earth All three of these projects are tied to the U.S. government’s European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), now known as the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), which has focused on various efforts to improve NATO’s ability to deter potential Russian aggression in Europe. The Air Force’s specific goal with these infrastructure investments is to be able to support extended contingency deployments of up to a dozen F-22s at a time to Spangdahlem, which is situated deep in the western portion of Germany near the borders with Belgium and Luxembourg. The service otherwise has a single squadron of non-stealthy F-16C/D Viper fighter jets forward deployed to the base. “Spangdahlem’s geographic location and available ramp space make it an ideal location as a 5th Generation fighter rotational hub,” Air Force budget documents for the 2017 Fiscal Year explain. “Building 5th Gen capability at Spangdahlem supports future interoperability training, as well as demonstrates the capacity to generate 5th Gen operations if required, in order to deter potential adversaries by increasing the presence of U.S. forces in Europe through additional rotations.” F-22s arrive at Spangdahlem for a rotational deployment in 2018., USAF The infrastructure, communications, and utilities upgrades, the smallest of the three projects, with a total cost of $580,000, is not among those that the Pentagon is deferring to pay for border wall construction. The other two, which the Air Force planned to finally award contracts for next year, are on the list. The official project descriptions for the low observable/composite repair facility and hardened aircraft shelter upgrades in the Air Force’s budget documents don’t mince words about the importance of these facilities. “Existing facilities do not have either the capacity, or the proper configuration to support maintenance on the larger F/A-22 aircraft and its composite coating system,” the entry for the repair center says, using an alternative designation for the Raptor. “If not provided, the twelve F/A-22 aircraft required for the ERI contingency mission will not be adequately accommodated for critical L/O composite coatings maintenance and other repairs to be provided in this facility.” “Existing HAS/PAS [hardened aircraft shelters/protected aircraft shelters] are not configured for the F/A-22 aircraft … [which] have a vertical exhaust feature that requires roof penetration and ducting to support engine ignition in an enclosed space,” shelter upgrade section notes. “Without vertical ventilation systems in place, equipment and facility structures will be damaged, including risk of fire. The health and safety of personnel in the vicinity of aircraft firing engines in shelters not adequately vented is at risk. If the new ventilation cannot be provided, the F/A-22 supporting the ERI contingency mission at Spangdahlem AB will have no shelter facilities in case of enemy attack, making the assets vulnerable to destruction.” You can read the full relevant portions of the Air Force budget documents below: DOD DOD To be clear, the Air Force does deploy F-22s to bases in Europe , including Spangdahlem , already, but for relative-short term stints. Spangdahlem needs the infrastructure upgrades in order to be able to better support more sustained contingency operations in the event of an actual crisis and to keep jets deployed in these scenarios better protected against any potential strike. As it stands now, Raptors make use of less robust hangars during trips to Spangdahlem. The Air Force is already concerned that established bases are increasingly vulnerable to standoff attacks and hangars of any kind, not to mention rows of stealth fighters exposed on the ramp, would be primary targets for a potential adversary during a major conflict. An F-22 taxis away from a hangar at Spangdahlem during a deployment there in 2015., USAF An F-16C Viper fighter jet sits inside one of Spangdahlem’s hardened aircraft shelters., USAF The F-22’s significant and complex maintenance and logistical demands, particularly when it comes to its stealthy skin, are hardly unknown. The War Zone has written extensively about these factors , which, combined with the relatively small size of the fleet as a whole, have long contributed to historically low readiness rates limited their operations to select bases in the United States and around the world. As of the 2018 Fiscal Year, the mission capable rate for these stealth fighters was still hovering around 50 percent. In 2018, the Government Accountability Office issued a harsh report that recommended the Air Force work to consolidate its relatively small number of F-22s at fewer bases in the United States to maximize resources. The destruction that Hurricane Michael wrought in 2018 on Tyndall Air Force Base, a major Raptor hub, has added additional impetus to pursue that restructuring. That same review discussed making changes to the Air Force’s deployment models for the Raptors to further help reduce maintenance and logistical strains across the fleet. Making infrastructure investments to better support F-22 deployments to potential crisis areas will also help increase the fleet’s flexibility when it matters most. In addition, the new low observable/composite repair facility could help support other stealth fighter jets, including F-35 Joint Strike Fighters . The Air Force budget documents themselves highlight how it would help turn Spangdahlem in a hub for fifth-generation fighters, broadly, not just the F-22. F-22s parked in the open at Spangdahlem during a rotational deployment in 2018., USAF As the Air Force, as well as the Marine Corps and Navy, increasingly integrate their respective F-35 variants into routine operations , there will only be an increasing need for specialized facilities to support them, especially in event of a high-end conflict requiring sustained operations. A number of NATO members are also in the process of fielding F-35 fleets and the total number of operators within the alliance could grow even further in the coming years, too. Military construction projects are often painfully long-lead-time affairs, in general, requiring sites surveys, environmental impact studies , and otherwise taking the steps necessary meeting a host of building codes and other requirements. This goes double for work in foreign countries that often have their own unique regulations. So, deferring the F-22-related work in Germany, which has already been two years in the making, will only further push back the timetable for when these new facilities may actually be available for use. This means that any Air Force planning around being able to deploy F-22s to Spangdahlem for extended periods will be similarly delayed, as will efforts to establish the base as a regional hub for fifth-generation fighter operations, in general. To be clear, as far as we know, America’s most capable air-superiority fighter – an aircraft designed to take on Russia  – cannot sustain forward operations in mainland Europe during a crisis without these upgrades. Of course, it remains to be seen how Congress responds to the Pentagon’s shifting of funding to border wall projects, whether it approves additional funds to cover the new shortfalls, and when. In the meantime, the Air Force’s ability to deploy F-22s, and potentially F-35s, to Spangdahlem for extended periods of time will remain limited.

"Chris ""Ox"" Harmer","Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Marine Boss’s Audacious Plan To Transform The Corps By Giving Up Big Amphibious Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month General David Berger, the 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), released two documents, titled 38th Commandant’s Intent and 38th Commandant’s Planning Guidance , respectively. While there was nothing unusual about the process, the vast majority of newly confirmed CMCs in recent history have released similar documents or messages, the content was nothing short of astonishing. CMC Berger’s intent and guidance, if implemented, will change the way the Marine Corps is organized and the way it operates. Bergers’s vision will also have a significant impact in terms of how the Marine Corps buys weapons, what weapons it buys, and how the Navy supports the Marine Corps with amphibious assault ship procurement, force structure, and operations. Finally, it will inevitably spark a renewed debate about overlapping roles and missions between the Marine Corps and the Army. Taken together, General Berger’s documents are the most visionary, disruptive, and transformational guidance issued by any of the service chiefs since the end of the Cold War. General David Berger., DoD Starting Off With Same Stuff, Different Day The Planning Guidance document starts with a robust, but routine declaration of the traditional role of the Marine Corps as the most flexible and responsive military force in the US arsenal. “The Marine Corps will be trained and equipped as a naval expeditionary force in readiness and prepared to operate inside actively contested maritime spaces in support of fleet operations. In crisis prevention and crisis response, the Fleet Marine Force—acting as an extension of the Fleet—will be first on the scene, first to help, first to contain a brewing crisis, and first to fight if required to do so.” General Berger’s vision of the Marine Corps as an afloat emergency response force is largely consistent with how the Navy and Marine Corps have operated together since WWII. Marines stationed on Navy amphibious assault ships, known as the “Gator Navy,” conducting rotational deployments and serving as a ready force to quickly respond in a crisis. In the recent past, the analogy of the Marines “kicking down the door” in order to secure a foothold in contested terrain until the Army can establish a heavier and more permanent presence with greater numbers has been used. That posture is consistent with what General Berger is advocating here. Marines aboard the dock landing ship USS Ashland brief for an amphibious operation that will be part of exercise Talisman Sabre., USMC Organizing Around The MAGTF And MEU The primary organization the Marine Corps uses to accomplish missions across the range of military operations is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The most common iteration of the MAGTF is the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) stationed afloat on board the ships of a Navy Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The MEU includes a Ground Combat Element (GCE), which includes an infantry battalion reinforced with armor, artillery, and combat engineers. There is also an Aviation Combat Element (ACE) that includes rotary and tilt-wing aircraft, and fixed-wing jets—AV-8B Harriers or F-35B Lightning IIs. Lastly, there is a Combat Logistics Element (CLE) that provides a range of vital support functions for expeditionary missions. At any given time there is at least one MEU, and usually two, rotationally deployed at sea, plus another MEU forward deployed in Japan on a heightened state of readiness, always deployable on a short timeline. The MEU is also the smallest standard MAGTF configuration. One step up from the MEU is the Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) and the largest standard type of MAGTF is the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). As an example of how the MEU functions as a force in readiness during rotational deployments, in August of 2001, the Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), consisting of USS Peleliu (LHA-5), USS Dubuque (LPD-8) and USS Comstock (LSD-45) embarked the 15th MEU and departed the West Coast. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, elements of the 15th MEU combined with the 26th MEU to airlift Marines from those and other Navy ships located in the Northern Arabian Sea and flew them 400 miles north to a point about 100 miles southwest of Kandahar, Afghanistan. There they established Forward Operating Base Rhino, also known as Camp Rhino, the first U.S. land base established in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. That is a textbook example of how the MEU construct is supposed to function in practice. The 15th MEU started a normal peacetime rotational deployment, which rapidly turned into an actual combat operation which was largely executed with personnel and equipment organic to the MEU. In any case, General Berger’s opening statement about the Marines functioning as a sea-based expeditionary force in readiness is essentially the same doctrinal verbiage we have heard for several decades, with a few tweaks. Slightly different than previous CMCs in delivery, perhaps, but in terms of substance, it is purely a case of same stuff, different day. But shortly after this introduction, the Commandant’s planning guidance got very interesting. USMC Challenging The Longest Held Assumption About USMC And USN Force Structure Based on numerous studies and assessments, the Marine Corps has long maintained that it has a requirement to retain two Marine Expeditionary Brigade Assault Echelons (MEB AE) worth of forcible-entry capability. In order to support that requirement, the Navy needs to maintain 34 amphibious warfare ships, or 17 ships per MEB. When forward presence requirements in Japan are added to the requirement to support two MEB AEs, the Navy force structure required to support all this is 38 amphibious assault ships. This is the first assumption challenged by General Berger’s guidance, which states: “We will no longer use a ‘2.0 MEB requirement’ as the foundation for our arguments regarding amphibious shipbuilding, to determine the requisite capacity of vehicles or other capabilities, or as pertains to the Maritime Prepositioning Force. We will no longer reference the 38-ship requirement memo from 2009, or the 2016 Force Structure Assessment, as the basis for our arguments and force structure justifications.” It is hard to overstate how dramatic that statement is. General Berger is essentially saying that the foundational assumptions upon which the Marine Corps is organized and what it needs from the Navy in terms of amphibious assault ship support will no longer guide future planning and procurement. The MEU and amphibious assault ships are not going away overnight, but they are no longer going to be used as the primary basis for planning force structure across the Marine Corps. The vast majority of Marine Corps procurement programs since the end of the Vietnam War have taken place with the intent for that equipment to work within an operational construct centered on MEU deployments onboard amphibious assault ships. General Berger is removing that planning and procurement constraint. USN The Reality Of Amphibious Assault Ships And Long Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles You might wonder why General Berger is rejecting the long-held basis for Marine Corps MAGTF and Navy amphibious assault ship force structure. The most obvious reason is that he is simply responding to the reality of modern Anti Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM). Up until relatively recently, in order to sink a modern warship, you needed to bring something really big to the fight—another warship, a submarine, a warplane, or a big minefield. In terms of the ASCM threat, the first time modern warships were systematically targeted by ASCMs was in 1982 during the Falklands War , when Argentinian naval aircraft, using air-launched Exocet ASCMs, sank two Royal Navy ships and damaged a third. At the time, ASCM technology was extremely expensive, rudimentary, and somewhat limited in terms of proliferation. As a result, the ASCM threat was vague and not fully understood. To be clear, from the mid-1970s on, the Red Fleet of the Soviet Union had a massive ASCM capability, but that capability was almost exclusively sea-based. Soviet cruise missile submarines and surface combatants would have had to put to sea and transit a significant distance from their home ports in order to effectively target U.S. Navy ships. That particular ASCM threat was well understood and could be detected and mitigated. In any case, the fact that a modern NATO member Navy suffered heavy losses due to ASCMs employed by a less capable adversary was a wakeup call for the U.S. Navy. The threat from ASCMs was no longer confined to just near-peer competitors like the Soviet Union. The Navy, which was on the cusp of deploying the Aegis anti-air and anti-missile combat system onboard the Ticonderoga class cruisers, would have to be prepared to defend against ASCMs from multiple potential adversaries. The lead ship in the class, USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) was commissioned just seven months after the Falklands War ended. There were only four of them in service by May 1987, when a heavily modified Iraqi Dassault Falcon 50 business jet fired two Exocets at the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate USS Stark in the Persian Gulf during the Tanker War sideshow to the Iran-Iraq War. The missiles killed 37 U.S. Navy sailors, injured 21 more, and left the frigate severely damaged. So, since the 1980s, the Navy has operated under the assumption that in any hostile, opposed scenario, the big, slow, vulnerable amphibious assault ships would be escorted by Ticonderoga class cruisers, or the follow-on class of ships, the Arleigh Burke class destroyers. Those escorts were assumed to have a robust capability to defeat inbound ASCMs targeted at the amphibious assault ships. While the assumption that the Ticonderogas and Arleigh Burkes could defend amphibious assault ships against the ASCM threat was reasonable in the past, there are two recent developments that invalidate that assumption. USS Bonhomme Richard fires a Sea Sparrow missile. , USN First, some of the Ticonderoga class cruisers and Arleigh Burke class destroyers have been modified with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (ABMDS) capability. Ships that are tasked with ABMDS missions are tied to a specific geographic area in order to perform that mission, thus making them unavailable to escort amphibious assault ships. The demand signal for the Navy to provide ABMDS coverage is significant , and ship deployments are a zero-sum game . No matter how capable a Ticonderoga or Arleigh Burke is, it can only be in one place at a time. Beyond that, while it is possible for a single Aegis-equipped ship to perform both ABMDS missions and provide defense against ASCMs, it takes some amount of time and crew proficiency to switch between ABMDS and ASCM modes. Only a small handful of ships with the lastest Aegis upgrades can perform both simultaneously. This leads us to the second factor, which is the threat to amphibious assault ships from ASCMs has gotten much more capable, prevalent, and dispersed. Today China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are all mass producing ASCMs that are technologically advanced, reliable, relatively cheap, and mobile. As an example of this, 30 years ago, Iranian ASCM capability was static and highly detectable. Today, Iranian-supported Houthi rebels are driving ASCMs around in trucks in Yemen, targeting shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis are far from the only non-state actors using ASCMs. During the 2006 Lebanon War, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah attacked and damaged an Israeli Sa’ar 5 class corvette using an ASCM. Point being, amphibious assault ship operations are potentially threatened not only by state actors, but by less predictable and potentially more hostile non-state actors. In short, the threat from ASCMs has evolved faster than the organic self-defense capabilities amphibious assault ships are equipped with. The kinetic self-defense capabilities that amphibious ships currently have included the Phalanx Close In Weapons System (CIWS), a radar directed Vulcan cannon capable of firing approximately 100 rounds of 20mm ammunition per second; the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), a lightweight and short-range missile; and the RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM), a larger, medium-range missile, which, when it comes to amphibious ships, are only found on LHAs and LHDs. Additionally, when it comes to non-kinetic defenses, the Mk 53 Nulka missile decoy system is deployed, as is the AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite . While all of these defensive systems are capable, they are nearing the maximum technological limits of their efficacy and may not be able to provide adequate protection against advanced ASCM threats, especially at very high volumes. At the same time, the ABMDS ships that are supposed to protect the amphibious assault ships are being increasingly tasked with other missions in other locations. Yes, there are some promising technologies, such as laser and microwave anti-missile systems, which might eventually provide amphibious assault ships with greater self-defense capabilities, but these are still unproven. Right now, General Berger has reached the reasonable conclusion that the Navy cannot adequately protect amphibious assault ships full of Marines and their equipment, so he is directing the Navy and Marine Corps to find a better way to keep Marines deployed near potential crisis zones. Russia’s Bal coastal defense system is designed to keep enemy amphibious fleets at bay. , Russian MoD Anti Access Area Denial Weapons Are Even More Problematic The proliferation and dispersion of ASCMs are in and of themselves very difficult problems to deal with. The recent emergence of even more complex Anti Access Area Denial (A2AD) weapons is an even more difficult challenge to handle. While A2AD describes a capability or characteristic rather than a specific weapon system, of which anti-ship cruise missiles are a part, in this context it primarily refers to Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBM) which have been tested and deployed by China and Russia. Additionally, hypersonic missiles are in development and will probably reach initial capability in the near future. Regarding the dual-threat of ASBMs and hypersonic missiles, the Navy will continue procuring advanced versions of the Arleigh Burke class destroyers for the foreseeable future. Those ships have a robust and validated ability to defend against ASCM, as well as the ability to perform the ABMDS mission, and with continued upgrades, could provide an effective defense against ASBMs. But the capabilities of existing ASCMs and ASBMs, when merged with the potential of hypersonic missiles, threaten to present an overlapping field of combined capabilities that will simply overwhelm the defensive capabilities of even the most advanced Burkes . The amphibious dock landing ship USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26) and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Momsen (DDG 92) transit in the eastern Pacific Ocean. , USN General Berger explicitly acknowledged the high cost and vulnerability of amphibious assault ships when he wrote that the Navy and Marine Corps could not continue on the current path of “heavily investing in expensive and exquisite capabilities that regional aggressors have optimized their forces to target…” The first ASBM to reach operational capability was the Chinese Dong Feng 21D (DF-21D), which has since been supplemented by the more reliable, more accurate, and longer-range Dong Feng-26 (DF-26). Combined with China’s burgeoning fleet of space-based sensors and unmanned aircraft these weapons are capable of detecting and engaging amphibious assault ships out to 1,000 nautical miles and beyond from their launch positions, which could include China’s artificial islands in the South China Sea . The Chinese ASBMs were originally capable of only being ground-launched from mobile land-based Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) systems. The capability to launch from aircraft , and even potentially ships and submarines, is in development. Accordingly, not only is the ASBM threat itself significant, based on the diverse and dispersed launch platforms, these ASBM will be virtually impervious to preemptive strike. In addition to the current operational ASBM, both China and Russia are developing hypersonic weapons that will be even more difficult to defend against than ASBMs. It is also more than simply a case of amphibious assault ships and escort ships not being able to protect themselves against long-range ASCMs and ASBMs. New developments in Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) submarine technology adds another layer of complexity. Amphibious assault ships have to get relatively close to their objective to launch their smaller beach landing craft. Between ASCMs, ASBMs, submarines, and modern surveillance capabilities, the weapon engagement zone that amphibious assault ships would have to transit in order to be in a position to launch their smaller landing craft is being pushed out hundreds of nautical miles and beyond. That is simply too big of a vulnerability to accept. China’s DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile. , AP The Organizing Construct Is No Longer A Limiting Factor Either General Berger’s guidance not only removed the amphibious assault force structure paradigm as a planning requirement, it also removed the MAGTF as the go-to organizational construct. Up until now, the MAGTF was the organizational element that all Marine Corps operational planning was based on. If the Marines are going to do a mission, the first thing they do is plan to execute that mission using a MAGTF table of organization. That is no longer going to be the default organization. “Likewise, we are not defined by any particular organizing construct – the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) cannot be our only solution for all crises,” Berger wrote. Like amphibious assault ships, the MAGTF will not be disappearing anytime soon either, but the Marine Corps force planners will no longer operate on the assumption that the MAGTF is the only option available to them. General Berger goes on to observe that “the current force is not organized, trained, or equipped to support the naval force.” In other words, the current construct consists of the Navy transporting Marines on deployment and into battle. Berger sees the proliferation of ASCM and ASBM weapons as being significant enough that the Marines are going to have to start thinking about how to fight at sea in cooperation with the Navy, instead of merely fighting from the sea towards land. As an example of this, the Marines have been testing the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) onboard amphibious assault ships not merely as cargo to transport from one spot to another, but as an auxiliary weapons system that can be launched from onboard the ship. As this following picture shows, Marines aboard USS Wasp (LHD-1) recently demonstrated their ability to strap a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) to the deck and use its 25mm gun as an auxiliary weapon system for the ship, too. It is reasonable to expect that in the new deployment model, the Marines will also validate their ability to operate from austere and dispersed locations using HIMARS, LAVs, drones, and other relatively light and mobile systems . Places like remote islands and inland airstrips will increasingly become areas where Marines will need to seize and hold so that other forces can stage from those locales. Marine Pfc. Matthew Bell aims an FGM-147 Javelin as part of a simulated small boat attack on amphibious transport dock ship USS Arlington (LPD 24) during the Carrier Strike Group FOUR (CSG 4) Amphibious Ready Group, Marine Expeditionary Unit exercise (ARGMEUEX)., USN What Is Driving This Fundamental Change? We started this article by observing that this guidance from General Berger was the most disruptive and transformational guidance issued by any service chief since the end of the Cold War. This leads to the question, what is driving this effort to radically transform the way the Marine Corps and Navy operate and fight together? In short, General Berger sees the future threats as being even more dispersed and capable then they are today, and in response is initiating a massive, fundamental reorganization and modernization of the Marine Corps. He is willing to trade force structure and legacy assets in order to free up the budget required to do so. He writes: “Force design is my number one priority. If provided the opportunity to secure additional modernization dollars in exchange for force structure, I am prepared to do so…however, doing so will not be easy. It will require divesting of legacy capabilities that cannot be economically adapted to meet the demands of the future, while also taking calculated risks in some areas.” Every service has its sacred cows. The ability to conduct an amphibious assault from sea to land is the fundamental capability that has defined the Marine Corps since before World War II. General Berger is willing to give up a significant part of that ability in order to transform the Marine Corps to perform the missions he sees as more likely and relevant in the future. In short, General Berger sees the Marine Corps as being currently manned, trained, and equipped to execute an amphibious assault mission that he believes will either be irrelevant or impossible to execute in the near future. Giant amphibious assault ships that are packed with Marines and their gear and vehicles have long been the cornerstone of the USMC’s strategy. This could change in a major way under thew CMC., USMC So What Replaces Amphibious Assault? What’s The New Defining Capability? To be clear, the Marine Corps is not giving up operating from the sea towards land. What General Berger is directing, however, is that the Marine Corps conduct these operations in a much different manner. Broadly speaking, if the intent and guidance is implemented, what will happen is that the Marine Corps will shift from putting a single relatively large organization, like a MEU, on a few big expensive amphibious assault ships, to dispersing a larger number of smaller units on more numerous, less expensive ships, and even potentially existing supply and logistics vessels. Clearly, the Gator Navy will continue to support Marines for the foreseeable future, it will just look different, and probably smaller overall. As General Berger writes: “It would be illogical to continue to concentrate our forces on a few large ships… We need to change this calculus with a new fleet design of smaller, more lethal, and more risk-worthy platforms…. Naval forces will persist forward with many smaller, low signature, affordable platforms that can economically host a dense array of lethal and non-lethal payloads.” As reported by National Defense Magazine , Lieutenant General Eric Smith, head of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, recently said that unmanned systems will play a central role in the new operating model. “We’re interested in all platforms — surface, subsurface and aviation… [We want] unmanned systems that are truly numerous because there is a quality in quantity in this particular regard,” he explained. “We’re looking for things that can do reconnaissance, that can do a radio relay, we’re looking for some lethal payloads.” This is the first information we have seen from the Marine Corps that gives more detail to General Berger’s guidance. Much more numerous, smaller ships, equipped with numerous, small unmanned systems that operate in the air, on the ocean surface, and beneath the surface. These drones will be capable of gathering information, serving as communication relays, and have an offensive capability. The first iteration of this capability will be a vertical takeoff drone equipped with radar with other variants and capabilities sure to follow. Currently, the Marine Corps’ MUX initiative seems to directly cover these capabilities. Overall, we have heard a lot about distributed combat operations . This is what it will look like, with smaller contingents of Marines operating onboard a variety of ships, and operating drones and other agile systems that can be ported around with ease from those platforms. Concept art showing a hypothetical MUX solution from Bell aboard a San Antonio class LPD. , Bell How Do The Expeditionary Transfer Dock and Expeditionary Sea Base Fit In? The Navy is currently procuring both the Expeditionary Transfer Dock (ESD) and Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) ship classes. Both types are designed to provide mobile sea bases that in turn provide logistics and operational support to rotationally deployed forces. The ESD essentially functions as a seagoing pier to facilitate cargo transfers at sea if a port is unavailable. While a seagoing vessel cannot replicate the full capability of a port, the ESD provides enough functionality to logistically sustain combat operations in a low threat environment. The ESB has a greater operational focus , capable of persistently hosting helicopters and personnel and functioning as a “mother ship” for smaller vessels. Together, the ESD and ESB platforms will provide mobile, expeditionary support for the new Marine deployment model. The Expeditionary Sea Base USS Lewis B. Puller. , USN As an example of this, in 2017, the Navy forward-deployed USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3) to the Middle East. Puller is the Navy’s first purpose-built ESB. Given that the ESD and ESB are both almost twice as big as the biggest amphibious assault ships currently in the Navy inventory and lack any self-defense capabilities against ASCM or ASBM weapons, it is reasonable to conclude that these specific platforms will be given significant, dedicated external protection by the Navy in terms of surface combatants standing guard duty nearby. While using an extremely large, slow, hard to maneuver, and impossible to hide ships like the ESD and ESB may seem to be exactly the opposite of what General Berger is looking for, taken in context, these support ships are compatible with this statement: “The focal point of the future integrated naval force will shift from traditional power projection to meet the new challenges associated with maintaining persistent naval forward presence to enable sea control and denial operations.” These huge vessels offer persistence like no other and do so at a fraction of the procurement cost of an amphibious assault ship. They are super flexible and can help enable other assets brought into their area of presence for a more finite period of time. This is also entirely consistent with what a lot of strategists have been advocating in terms of distributed warfare doctrine. Dispersing combat elements makes those forces more defensible, survivable, and lethal. The Navy is already working on the so-called Adaptive Deck Launcher (ADL) that will give smaller ships and possibly supply ships the same missile launch capability as high-end surface combatants. Of course, the smaller, cheaper, more numerous ships that would operate in the distributed warfare doctrine model would not have as many missiles as a Navy surface combatant, but could potentially use the ESD or ESB as a storage hub for reloading missiles at sea. In all, the concept of sea bases and smaller and more numerous forward-deployed ships offers more options, flexibility, and force resiliency than the more rigid doctrine of placing the majority of the Marine Corps’ resources only into a traditional ‘Gator Navy’ concept of operations and the procurement strategy that supports it. It also can keep potential enemies off-balance both tactically and strategically as switching up procurement priorities and having more lethal ships in more places presents far more challenging problems to solve and a good dose of the unknown compared to the current construct. USNS Montford Point (T-ESD 1) and vehicle cargo ship USNS Bob Hope (T-AKR 300) are moored alongside each other during vehicle transfer operations. Notice the LCAC in one of the docking lanes aboard the Expeditionary Transfer Dock. , USN Does This Redefine The Relationship Between The Army and Marine Corps? The Army and the Marine Corps exist in a constant state of low-grade tension regarding roles and missions. It is beyond dispute that the two services have overlapping areas of expertise and operations. For example, while the Army does not have the advanced amphibious assault ships that the Marine Corps has access to through the Navy, it does have a significant beach landing and logistics force . Interestingly enough, the Army recently decided it would sell off much of its fleet of logistics ships. Although those plans remain in flux, with the sale of the USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda , one of the US Army’s most capable ships, being announced and then canceled shortly thereafter, the fact remains that the Army and Marine Corps have significant overlap in roles, responsibilities, and capabilities. To be clear, the Army’s fleet of ships is still obviously intended to operate in a low-risk environment, and not remotely comparable in size, range, or combat capability of the Navy’s fleet of amphibious assault ships that the Marine Corps uses. As an example of this redundancy, over the last 18 years since 9/11, the Marine Corps has conducted a lot of long-duration combat operations on land, far from the sea. What General Berger is proposing is that the Marine Corps return to a more maritime-centric focus, rotationally deployed at sea, working in closer cooperation with the Navy. While the Marine Corps is not giving up entirely on the amphibious assault mission, General Berger is clearly saying that the current fleet of amphibious assault ships is simultaneously too expensive to risk in many opposed landing scenarios and is also increasingly incapable of defending against modern ASCM and ASBM missiles. Accordingly, the Marine Corps will start looking to operate off of more numerous, less expensive, less detectable ships. This focus seems to move the Marine Corps away from its current overlap with the Army in terms of conducting long-term land-based operations. If that’s the case, this seems to be a move that will actually decrease tension between the Army and Marine Corps in terms of roles and missions. Marines forcing entry into a structure in Fallujah, Iraq., USMC Will This Actually Happen? General Berger should be commended for being proactive and taking the institutional risk of admitting the current force structure and operational norms of his service are both too costly and inadequate to deal with future threats. With that said, his is just one voice in determining the strategy, policy, and force structure. The single most important strategy and policy guidance is not a document, it’s the budget. Every year Congress passes a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As one of my former superiors in the Pentagon observed while we were laboring on the since canceled Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), “All this strategic guidance is just words on paper. Nobody really cares. You want to know what the strategy and policy is? The budget. The budget is the strategy. The budget is the policy. Everything else is just talk.” He had a point. I am not willing to say the NDAA makes all other strategy and policy documents irrelevant, but of all the strategy and policy documents out there, the NDAA is the most relevant. All of our force structure in terms of personnel is a direct result of previous NDAAs. Every weapon system we have today and can use, or every alternative capability we want, need, and don’t have, is a result of those NDAAs. Which brings us back to General Berger’s intent and planning guidance has the potential to have a massive impact on future NDAAs. An F-35B Lightning II aircraft assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 265 (Reinforced) lands on the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1) as it transits the Coral Sea. , USN How Will This Affect The Shipbuilding Budget And Program? If General Berger’s intent and guidance gets traction and results in significant and fundamental changes that will show up in future NDAAs, the Navy will buy fewer large amphibious assault ships and more numerous, cheaper, smaller, more agile vessels, as well as sea bases. The newest of the sea bases, the USNS Hershel “Woody” Williams (T-ESB-4) was launched last year. The fifth ship in the combined class of ESD/ESB ships, the USNS Miguel Keith (T-ESB-5), was recently launched and will soon be deployable. In fact, Berger’s vision is already becoming a reality, considering the Navy just ordered two more of these ships and a third as an executable option. In terms of the Navy’s larger shipbuilding budget and program, the U.S. industrial base is on the ragged margins of viability. At less than 300 commissioned warships, the Navy is the smallest it has been since well before World War II. Given the decrepit state of the Navy’s shipyards, even if the industrial base could provide enough new ships to meet the Navy’s ambitious goal of growing to 355 ships over the next 15 years, it is unlikely that the Navy could conduct the required maintenance to keep those ships operational. This leads us to the uncomfortable, but necessary discussion on how much longer the Navy will continue to buy big amphibious assault ships, or at least at what rate, now that General Berger is saying they are too expensive and too vulnerable to put in harms way under some very real combat scenarios. Given the fairly limited shipbuilding industrial base, it seems likely that the NDAA will continue to procure amphibious assault ships for the foreseeable future as the Navy starts to buy the smaller ships that will supplement the amphibious assault ship fleet. While the new guidance does not appear to envision completely replacing the amphibious assault ship fleet, the NDAA is the epitome of a zero-sum game. If the NDAA redirects budget dollars to buy smaller ships and drones, inevitably there will be less money left over for amphibious assault ship procurement. In essence, the NDAA will probably continue to mandate procurement of amphibious assault ships in the immediate future in order to preserve the ability of the industrial base to produce whatever comes next. Once that is decided, if indeed the CMC gets his way, some major shifts in the shipbuilding plan could very well be realized. USS Arlington (LPD-24) under construction., Huntington Ingalls The New Strategy Of Distributed Lethality Is Coming Into Focus What General Berger has proposed is a partial rejection of the status quo and a challenge to embrace a fundamental shift in Marine Corps doctrine. The legacy approach, which is currently centered on the MAGTF as the primary organizational construct and the Navy’s fleet of amphibious assault ships as the primary vehicle on which Marines conduct rotational deployments and maintain a forward presence, will be replaced with the new guidance. That is a welcome development and he gives a good deal of specific direction on what he wants to see happen, i.e., Marines deployed on smaller, cheaper, more numerous ships equipped with distributed firepower, etc. When combined with Lieutenant General Smith’s comments about unmanned systems functioning across the full spectrum of combat operations, a new overlying strategy of distributed lethality is coming into focus. While General Berger’s intent is clear, none of this has actually happened yet, and the process of shifting from the current model of MEU deployments aboard amphibious assault ships to the new model will be complicated. For example, is the new approach of basing Marines on smaller, more numerous ships equipped with distributed sensors and weapons intended to supplement the amphibious assault ship capability, or eventually replace it? Putting Marines on more numerous, smaller ships seems to be a play to reduce the risk of any single ship being damaged or sunk by enemy action, but will those vessels have enough firepower and defensive capabilities of their own to operate in an opposed environment? If detection capabilities combined with ASCM and ASBM weapons are pushing the engagement zone out to 1,000 nautical miles and beyond, will further advances in detection and targeting capabilities make the new class of as yet unidentified and undesigned smaller ships equally vulnerable? To be clear, this is not a criticism of General Berger’s intent or guidance, it is just an acknowledgment that he has started a necessary process, but the eventual outcome of that process is still not clear. Marines stand watch aboard a U.S. Navy ship., USMC Congratulations Are In Order The nature of warfare is constantly changing, and the way strategy and policy are developed and implemented through the NDAA has to change to keep pace. Regardless of how this process actually turns out, General Berger and the Marine Corps deserve congratulations for starting this conversation about fundamentally reassessing the future of the force and how to respond to modern and rapidly evolving threats. Here’s hoping the other services follow suit. Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Chris ""Ox"" Harmer Contributor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 27, 2019",European Missile Maker and Polish Defense Giant Join Forces On New Tank Destroyer Concept,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. European missile consortium MBDA and Polish defense conglomerate PGZ have signed a deal to work together on a proposal for Poland’s tank destroyer competition. The two firms are working on a number of concept designs that combine tracked vehicle chassis from PGZ’s subsidiaries with MBDA’s Brimstone guided missile , some of which could be attractive to customers on the export market. MBDA’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom signed the cooperation deal with PGZ at a ceremony at the MSPO International Defense Industry Exhibition in Poland on Sept. 4, 2019. The trade show runs through Sept. 6. The two companies have been increasingly working together on a number of defense projects since 2017. This has now expanded into competing in Poland’s new tank destroyer project, which is broadly seeking replacements for vehicle-mounted examples of the Soviet-era 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank guided missile, also known as the AT-3 Sagger, including the 9P133 4×4 wheeled anti-tank vehicle. “Pairing the combat-proven MBDA Brimstone missile with the diverse range of current and future Polish platforms provides the ability to deliver rapid military capability for Poland and for wider markets, whilst strengthening our co-operation with PGZ Group on missiles,” Adrian Monks, MBDA U.K. Sales Director in Poland, said in a statement . “We can integrate on all Polish vehicle types quickly and without any significant technical complexity,” Monks separately told Shepard in an interview at MPSO. A Polish 9P133 wheeled anti-tank vehicle fires a 9M14 Malyutka missile during an exercise in 2014. This is the main system Poland wants to replace with a new tank destroyer., Necro34 via Wikimedia The Polish tank destroyer effort does not specify that any competitors must use a particular chassis, wheeled or tracked, in its submission. The biggest requirement is for a system that can “counter massed armor formations,” almost certainly driven by growing security concerns in Poland in recent years about potential Russian aggression. Poland shares a border with Russia’s highly militarized Kaliningrad region. It is also a NATO member and would be among the nearest to potentially respond to any crisis in the Alliance’s Baltic State members of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Studies have repeatedly warned about how quickly a large conventional force would be able to occupy those three small countries during a major conflict. Similar concerns have driven significant reinvestment in various ground combat capabilities, including tanks , other armored vehicles , and anti-tank weaponry , among various NATO members , especially the United States , in recent years. With this in mind, MBDA and PGZ have already shown a number of vehicle designs based on the chassis from the AHS Krab 155mm self-propelled howitzer, as well as the venerable BWP-1 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), the Polish produced version of the Soviet BMP-1 . The Krab concept, seen in the picture at the top of this article, along with one of the BWP-1 proposals, simply attaches large box launchers to the top of the chassis. The Krab-based vehicle has three eight-round launchers, while the BWP-1 one has a single 12-round launcher. A tank destroyer concept involving a modified BWP-1 infantry fighting vehicle with a box launcher mounted in the rear deck., MBDA It’s not clear if these launchers are derived from an earlier palletized design that MBDA had pitched to Poland last year, which also offered a relatively simple way to add Brimstone to a variety of ground platforms. The European missile conglomerate has also proposed similar modular launchers in order to integrate Brimstone with the German Boxer wheeled armored vehicle for the British Army. Another, more complex BWP-1 proposal involves modifying the entire rear section of the BWP-1, which troops would ride in the standard configuration, to accommodate a tilting 12-round launcher that folds down flush with the vehicle’s deck when not in use. This could help make it difficult for the enemy to identify tank destroyers from standard IFVs. Another BWP-1-based tank destroyer concept with a launcher that folds flush with the rear deck when not in use., MBDA Brimstone would make any of these configurations formidable given the missile’s own capabilities. Similar in general appearance to the American AGM-114 Hellfire , this weapon has both millimeter wave radar and laser guidance systems, allowing it to engage opponents at night, in bad weather, or on a battlefield full of smoke and other obscurants. It also has an inertial navigation system autopilot to get it to the general target area at extended ranges before it begins searching out its target autonomously. Still, the MBDA-PGZ partnership certainly faces competition. Lockheed Martin’s Polish subsidiary is in the running and will likely propose a ground-launched Hellfire option. An Israeli team consisting of IMI Systems and Elbit Systems is submitting a proposal, which may be based around the MAPATS anti-tank guided missile. Another division of MBDA is even working together with Estonia’s Milrem to pitch a design that uses the MMP anti-tank guided missile. This could also use a chassis based on the Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System unmanned ground vehicle, or THeMIS . Even if the MBDA-PGZ pair-up doesn’t win Poland’s tank destroyer competition, the two definitely see their shared entry as part of a larger effort to expand cooperation to potentially include export sales of various systems. The new agreement between the companies includes an important technology transfer component wherein Polish ammunition company MESKO SA will produce Brimstone missiles locally. Brimstone was originally intended for use on fixed and rotary-wing aircraft and Poland could easily adopt the missiles on a variety of different platforms in the future. In August 2019, the Polish government announced plans to actually kick off a long-awaited program to acquire new attack helicopters to replace the country’s aging Soviet-era Mi-24 Hind gunships . “Qualification is minimal, we have a combat-proven missile, which has been fired from many different platforms, fast jets, helicopters, land and maritime,” MBDA U.K.’s Polish Sales Director Monks told Shepard . That last part could mean that a Brimstone-armed tank destroyer might also have a possible short-range coastal defense role, as well, something that Poland could be interested in given its Baltic Sea shoreline . MBDA has also explored integrating Brimstone onto variants of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, an aircraft that Poland is also becoming increasingly interested in acquiring . The Polish government had been advocating for increasing defense ties with the United States, in general, in recent years, including more permanent basing of American troops under a proposal now commonly referred to as “ Fort Trump .” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated the U.S. government’s broad support for this increased cooperation during a recent visit to Poland, but offered few hard details on what changes might be coming in the near future. Dummy Brimstones on a triple launch rack for fixed-wing aircraft., Joseph Trevithick In addition, MBDA’s press release specifically notes the potential for export sales of Polish Brimstone-armed platforms in the future. The BWP-1 proposals could be especially attractive given that thousands of BMP-1s and various derivatives remain in service around the world. PGZ could offer to convert existing vehicles to any of the proposed configurations, presenting a lower-cost option for acquiring more modern anti-tank capabilities. A revival of the earlier palletized launcher concept, which could work with an even wider array of vehicles, could be popular for the same reasons. All told, whether or not Poland picks a vehicle armed with Brimstone for its new tank destroyer, it is very possible that similar vehicles will appear in service elsewhere in the world in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2020",The AIM-9X Sidewinder May Finally Evolve Into A Completely New And Longer-Range Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to air-to-air combat, no missile on earth is as iconic as the AIM-9 Sidewinder. It has seen service in many forms and adaptations for over six decades and its continued development is as much a history lesson in jet-age air combat as anything else. Now, Raytheon and the Pentagon are quietly working at developing the next major capability leap for the Sidewinder that will take full advantage of many other developments that have been incorporated into the missile in recent years. As a result, the AIM-9X may finally morph into a missile that is made up of components that are all, or nearly all, different than those found on its predecessor, the AIM-9M. Arguably the biggest upgrade the Sidewinder had ever seen came in the form of the AIM-9X, which entered service in 2003 and brought with it major and long in the works changes in capabilities, including high-off boresight targeting , thrust vectoring, and an advanced imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. Today’s AIM-9X Block II, also known as the AIM-9X-2, which just entered service in 2015, offers another big leap in capability with its data-link and lock-on-after-launch capabilities, among other improvements. These advances are in addition to the missile’s constantly improving software that makes the most out of its latest physical additions and enhancements. A breakdown of the major components of the AIM-9X Block II., USN Still, the AIM-9X wasn’t a totally new missile. Its rocket motor, fusing system, and warhead, among other smaller components, are decades old as they were ported over from the AIM-9M that proceeded it. Raytheon carried over many of these components again to the Block II configuration. The improved missiles did include “a new processor, a new battery, an electronic ignition safe/arm device, and the DSU-41/B Active Optical Target Detector fuze/datalink assembly,” in addition to software upgrades, according to Pentagon reports . US Marines load an AIM-9M Sidewinder onto an F/A-18 Hornet., USMC But the AIM-9X may change again and more dramatically in the not so distant future. Even though the AIM-9X Block III was officially canceled in the 2016 Fiscal Year budget, which came out in 2015, each subsequent budget request has asked for money to continue to develop similar features. Most notably, this includes an entirely new motor that would make use of decades in rocket technology advances. The so-called “highly-loaded-grain, high-performance motor, and radiofrequency cook-off sensor” would give the AIM-9X significantly enhanced range. The planned Block III configuration had also included a new, safer insensitive munitions warhead design. A part of the Navy’s budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year asking for continued funding to support work on “highly-loaded-grain, high-performance motor, and radiofrequency cook-off sensor” for the AIM-9X., DOD The same line in the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget request., DOD Just on Aug. 29, 2019, Naval Air Systems Command announced its intention to negotiate a new deal with Raytheon to conduct “continued software support, future software growth development, software improvements, trade studies, technical support, and risk reduction efforts,” as well as perform “trade-studies and analyses to investigate and support future capabilities” with regards to the AIM-9X. So it is clear that the AIM-9X is still very much a work in progress, with Block III-like features on the way. Exactly how much extra range a Block III AIM-9X might offer remains unclear, but our sources have said the missiles could be able to fly as much as 50 percent further than what it can in its current form. The Navy itself said the goal was a 60 percent increase in total, which the missile would gain from the improved rocket motor, new flight programming, leveraging its cook-off sensor, and by receiving mid-course updates from its launch platform. Either way, this would equate to a huge boost in combat capability and it would push the AIM-9X even farther into the intermediate-range envelope than it already is. Currently, the AIM-9X Sidewinder has a published range of roughly up to 20 miles, although the unpublished numbers are usually more impressive. Still, range figures overall are dubious at best and the missile’s true real-world range is based on the flight profile dictated by each engagement, which can vary wildly. In other words, that range can be drastically reduced to just handful of miles if a lot of maneuvering energy is needed to reach its target. A good look at the AIM-9X’s imaging infrared seeker., USN The AIM-9X, as it sits today, is really more than a short-range dogfighting air-to-air missile. Under certain conditions, its imaging infrared seeker can see well beyond the distance it can actually travel. It is also adept at striking targets on the surface of the earth as a secondary formal capability. With the addition of the data-link on AIM-9X Block II, the Sidewinder provides a lock-on-after-launch capability, meaning it can be fired at an enemy without first locking its seeker on to the target. Lock-on-after-launch capability is especially important for stealthy fighters with weapons bays, such as the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , but it also provides more flexible targeting for 4th generation fighters that mount their missiles externally. A US Navy briefing slide from 2016 giving a general sense of the capabilities of the AIM-9X and AIM-9X Block II compared to the older AIM-9M., USN In addition, the networked AIM-9X is far smarter than its predecessor and, paired with new software, its range is increased due to more intricate and specific flight models that the missile will employ depending on the tactical situation and data-linked telemetry updates from the aircraft it is launched from. Furthermore, the Block II AIM-9X allows for targeting of enemy aircraft even if the target is outside of the range of its seeker. The fighter will feed the missile telemetry from its sensors—primarily its radar, but potentially also its passive electronic warfare suite, and soon, at least in some cases, its IRST —until it flies close enough to the target to lock on with its own seeker. This means that even in bad weather and obscured environments, the AIM-9X can be just as lethal at the edge of its engagement envelope. It also enables third party targeting data to feed to the launching aircraft, which could help cue the missile to targets a pilot cannot “see” using their own onboard sensors alone. This is especially useful when a fighter is operating in a stealthy, electromagnetically silent mode, in which its own radar would not be activated. A slide from a 2016 briefing showing the AIM-9X’s various possible methods of engagement., USN So, with all this in mind, it really is time to get the Sidewinder a new motor to take even more advantage of its data-link capabilities, in effect turning a short-range missile into an intermediate-to-medium-range one that can work substantially further out than the within visual range arena. Every platform that carries the AIM-9X could benefit from this, but the F-22, in particular, which only recently received AIM-9X capability, could squeeze a lot more capability out of its flank weapons bays that house Sidewinders. A networked AIM-9X also means better survivability for F-22s as they can remain farther outside detection range of enemy aircraft when employing the longer-range Sidewinder variant. The F-35, which has a sensor suite that could make uniquely potent use of the AIM-9X Block IIs lock-on-after-launch capability, would also greatly benefit from a Sidewinder that features extra range, especially when it comes to hitting targets to the side or even behind the aircraft during dogfights. Also, longer-range Sidewinders, carried externally , would provide valuable BVR capability in addition to the two AIM-120s that can be carried internally at this time. US Air Force airmen move a trailer loaded with AIM-9Xs., USAF Eventually, the F-35’s internal AIM-120 carriage capability could increase to six missiles , but until the “Sidekick” modification is actually fielded, the four missiles the jet can carry internally will remain something of a limitation. Carrying Sidewinders externally may trade some low-observability for the stealth fighter, but it seems as if the latest iteration of the Sidewinder may actually include some stealthy features to help overcome this. Though the AIM-9X Block III was officially scrapped four years ago, in December 2017, the U.S. Navy and the Air Force began buying dozens of Block II+ missiles, specifically for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Navy’s order included missiles for Marine Corps F-35Bs. Australia , Israel , and the Netherlands , have also since purchased these missiles for their F-35s. “The Block II+ provides increased survivability over the Block II for the F-35,” according to a Selected Acquisition Report that the Pentagon sent to Congress in 2017. The missile, also known as the AIM-9X-3, “incorporates specialized external materials to enhance aircraft platform survivability,” the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget request highlights book , which came out that same year, added. So, it appears as if the enhancements under AIM-9X Block II+ include stealthy coatings and possibly even structures to the baseline AIM-9X Block II design. This along with the F-35’s canted wingtip pylons likely help offset at least some of the radar cross-section increase that comes with when carrying Sidewinders externally. A US Air Force F-35A with a training version of the AIM-9X under its left wing and an empty launch rail under its right., USAF As for any plans to migrate the AIM-9X into the F-35’s weapons bays, there is no word on this that we know of, but it seems highly logical. If and when Sidekick is deployed, being able to carry four AIM-120s and a pair of AIM-9X Block IIs internally would substantially add to the jet’s full-up stealth air-to-air combat flexibility. What remains unclear is when the new motor might get integrated into the AIM-9X Block II+ configuration and if it will also come with changes to the missile’s warhead and other improvements to the missile. It is very possible that when the Navy decided to shelve the full Block III upgrade program, it decided to spiral the individual improvements into smaller updates. With the new data-link capability, integrating a new motor should have become a more pressing and logical next step. As recently as 2019, budget documents show that this and other improvements are still in development, so exactly when they might arrive and if they will come as a complete package or appear piecemeal remains to be seen. But regardless, with this latest contracting announcement posted, we will probably see a longer-range, fully modernized, and more deadly Sidewinder sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Air Force Wants Super Realistic Mock Launchers So It Can Replicate An S-300 SAM System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force wants to buy two life-size mock transporter-erector-launchers, or TELs, that mimic the physical look, as well as radar and other signatures, of those associated with Russia’s S-300PMU-1 and -2 air defense systems. The service needs them to support realistic training exercises and test events within the sprawling Utah Test and Training Range , or UTTR. The planned purchases may be related to the U.S. military’s acquisition of at least two mobile radars from Ukraine in the past year or so that may be related to the S-300. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) says it expects to issue a formal solicitation to buy the “high-fidelity SA-20 transport/erector/launcher (TEL) surrogates” later in September 2019. It had first announced it was interested in buying the faux TELs on Aug. 29, 2019. SA-20 is a designation the U.S. military and NATO use that covers both the S-300PMU-1 and -2, which are also sometimes referred to as the SA-20A and SA-20B respectively. “High-fidelity surrogates are necessary to provide training of cognitive skills to live air crews,” AFMC’s contracting announcement explained . “New advancements in technology require these surrogates to be signature accurate to assist in training.” The Air Force says that the mock TELs have to have a radar cross section (RCS) that is representative of the real thing, but they are also interested in surrogates that have appropriate electro-optical and infrared signatures, as well. The latter could be achieved by installing systems within the mockup that produce a thermal signature in line with the engine and auxiliary power units on real examples. An actual Russian TEL associated with the S-300PMU-1/2 air defense system., Sputnik / Mikhail Fomichev The contracting documents do not specify the exact kind of TEL the Air Force wants, but they do include images of existing mockups of the version based on the 8×8 MAZ-7910 heavy truck chassis . Russia also produces semi-trailer launchers for the S-300PMU-1/2 system with various trucks able to act as the prime mover. A number of potential American opponents, including Iran and Syria , operate examples of this air defense system. There is also no requirement for the mock TELs to be mobile themselves, with the contracting notice very clearly outlining a requirement that two personnel be able to make them ready for transport to any location within the UTTR within 30 minutes. After arriving, two individuals must be able to set them up within 30 minutes. An example of mock TEL for the S-300PMU-1/2 system that the Air Force provided with its contracting announcement in its “deployed” configuration., USAF Another example of a surrogate TEL with its tires removed, showing the fixed skids that actually keep it in place., USAF Buying the surrogates makes good sense from testing and training perspectives. The Air Force, along with the rest of the U.S. military, constantly strive to make training exercises as realistic as possible to best prepare forces to recognize and react to threats and hazards they may encounter on a real battlefield. Realism is also extremely important when it comes to evaluating new systems , including sensors and countermeasures on aircraft. The U.S. military has acquired actual examples of foreign military equipment in the past, and continues to do so today, to use as surrogates for test and training purposes. They have also simply provided an opportunity glean all sorts of potential intelligence information from them through a process known as Foreign Materiel Exploitation , or FME. There are already examples of the S-300 series at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). However, doing so can be expensive and complicated and maintaining those systems can be equally arduous. They’re also often too valuable to actually destroy. So, surrogates offer lower-cost alternatives to provide a host of different capabilities and, in some cases, may be expendable by design . It may also be extremely useful just to generate the same kind of emissions associated with the threat, such as a fire control radar. The U.S. military employs Joint Threat Emitters (JTE), a valuable system the War Zone has covered in depth in the past, to simulate a host of air defense threats in this way. A Joint Threat Emitter., USAF Unfortunately, when it comes to actually training pilots to search for, spot, and target simulated hostile systems, such as the S-300, during training exercises, this may not be realistic enough. The JTEs look nothing like actual surface to air missile systems when viewed through an aircraft’s sensors, such as radars in ground search or synthetic aperture modes or electro-optical or infrared cameras. That’s where something like the mock S-300PMU-1/2 TELs would come in. From the contracting documents, it also appears that the Air Force is looking to blend surrogate systems with either real examples or JTEs in order to create a larger simulated S-300PMU-1/2 site. Air Combat Command has a need to “replicate the physical threat representative multi-spectral (Electro-Optical, Infrared, and Radar Cross Section [RCS]) signatures located in close proximity to the radar signal emitter,” one notice explains . With this in mind, it is possible that the mock TEL purchases may be tied to the secretive delivery of an unspecified “mobile radar” from Ukraine at Roland R. Wright Air National Guard Base, which is co-located with Salt Lake City International Airport, in January 2019. This was part of a contract that nearby Hill Air Force Base, which is the base that oversees the UTTR, was managing. In September 2018, the U.S. Army had also taken delivery of another Ukranian radar. This system, a trailer-mounted 36D6M1-1, is a modernized version of the Soviet-era Tin Shield air search radar, which is associated with the S-300 series. The complete air defense system also includes a separate fire control radar. A Ukranian 36D6M1-1 radar in its deployed configuration. , Ukroboronprom The contracting documents do not say that the mock TELs are supposed to reflect any particular potential opponent or threat environment. The Air Force may simply be interested in replicating the capability it has at the NTTR at another location in order to increase its overall capacity to conduct training and testing activities that require replicating this level of air defense threat. Whoever supplies them, in the end, will have to paint them in a desert camouflage scheme. This could simply be to help mask them visually within the wide expanses of the UTTR. It could also point to an actual desert training scenario. It is interesting to note that the S-300PMU-2s that Syria began acquiring in 2018 were painted green like their Russian counterparts. Iran’s S-300PMU-2s do have a desert tan scheme. Whatever the case, the surrogate TELs will definitely help the Air Force simulate a more complete S-300PMU-1/2 system within the UTTR without the difficulty and expense of acquiring and maintaining actual examples. In doing so, the service will be able to add valuable extra realism to any testing to evaluate the performance of sensors and countermeasures against this threat or to help prepare pilots potentially face these air defenses in a real-world combat situation.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 7, 2020",Trump Tweets Intelligence Image After Iran’s Rocket Explosion And Offers Them “Best Wishes”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have taken the highly unusual step of releasing an official and relatively high resolution annotated U.S. intelligence image of the recent failed space launch at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Space Center via Twitter and confirmed that it involved a Safir space launch vehicle. Trump also declared that the United States had no hand in the accident and offered Iran “best wishes” and “good luck.” It’s unclear if the President, who recently reiterated his willingness to meet with Iranian officials to try to de-escalate growing tensions , meant that to be an insult. Trump sent out the Tweet with the message and attached image on Aug. 30, 2019 . A black box at the upper left-hand corner appears to be a redaction of a previous classification marking. The social media post also indicates that the U.S. Intelligence Community refers to this particular launch pad as “Semnan Launch Site One.” This method of disclosure is unprecedented, but The War Zone , among others, has long reported that Trump routinely appears to send out missives on social media after receiving briefings, including those involving sensitive intelligence and military matters. Reports first emerged about the accident on Aug. 29, 2019, and Iran has since confirmed that it occurred. “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV [space launch vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump wrote in his Tweet. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.” The image shows extensive damage to the gantry, transporter-erector-launcher vehicle, and various other supporting vehicles, equipment, on and around the launch pad. The exact source of the imagery is unclear. The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One. pic.twitter.com/z0iDj2L0Y3 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019 Its resolution is significantly higher than is typically found on commercial satellite images. It could be from a U.S. intelligence satellite. The low angle of the shot also raises the possibility that an unmanned aircraft took the picture. The U.S. has used stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel drones in the past to spy on sites inside Iran. There is a visible flash reflected in the image and you can see hands, arms, the outline of a phone, all indicating that this is a picture of a physical photograph. It is very possible, if not probable, that Trump took the picture with his cell phone and posted it online. This could also account for what appears to be a slight bend in the image at the edges, though this could also indicate a panoramic image stitched together from multiple pictures. Those visible lines may also be from the printer. I THINK the image Trump tweeted was panchromatic (attached gif shows it split into rgb channels) – I don't know any UAVs that use panchromatic in the visible range (?), so that could suggest previously classified satellite? pic.twitter.com/k1j1Kv9YRm — Nathan Ruser (@Nrg8000) August 30, 2019 Regardless, it is definitely distinct from the images that a satellite belonging commercial imagery firm Planet Labs took of the site on Aug. 29, 2019, which subsequently became public via the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey that same day. Maxar, another commercial imagery company, also released additional imagery. Those pictures were the first indications that something had gone wrong with Iran’s latest attempted Safir launch. “This look likes the space launch vehicle blew up on the launch pad,” Dave Schmerler, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute, told NPR after sharing the images with them. “This failure happened maybe a couple of minutes before the image was taken.” Multiple satellites capture failed #Iran satellite launch at Imam Khomeini Spaceport. Images via @maxar and  @planetlabs (analysis by @DaveSchmerler @MIIS ) pic.twitter.com/FG85bR6PzE — Christoph Koettl (@ckoettl) August 29, 2019 “It was due to some technical issues and it exploded,” an unnamed Iranian official told Reuters . “Our young scientists are working to fix the problem.” Reuters said he offered no additional details about the incident. It’s unclear what the payload on top of the rocket might have been, but earlier in August, Iran had indicated that the Nahid-1 communications satellite was ready for launch. It seems all but certain that the accident destroyed whatever payload or payloads were present. In January 2019 , Iran made another rare acknowledgment of a failed satellite launch at Imam Khomeini Space Center. It remains unclear what happened, but Iran did release video of a newer Simorgh space launch vehicle blasting off successfully from the center. The Payam-e Amirkabir satellite, which Iran had officially said was an earth observation type for scientific research, however, never reached orbit. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSaLQOU9jT0 Trump’s statement that the United States was not involved in this latest accident comes amid reports and rumors that the U.S. government had been launching covert operations to sabotage Iran’s ballistic missile development programs and other related work. Just recently, The New York Times reported that an unrelated American cyberattack in June 2019 had severely hampered Iran’s ability to monitor maritime activities in the Strait of Hormuz and plot attacks on or attempts to seize foreign ships. This did not prevent Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from taking control of the British flagged tanker Stena Impero , along with two other ships , between July and August. Of course, even without Trump’s Tweet, there is no other hard evidence that U.S. had any involvement in the Safir’s apparent explosion. Iran has conducted eight launches using this rocket, at least three of which are known to have failed. The President’s offer of “best wishes” to Iran is curious given that the U.S. government’s position, as well as that of some of its allies, especially Israel, is that the Iranians are using their nascent space program as a cover for long-range ballistic missile developments, including the possible development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). As such, the United States routinely criticizes space launches just as it does any other Iranian missile test. With this in mind, it is certainly possible that Trump meant his condolences as a backhanded insult. The President is certainly not above disparaging opponents , both foreign and domestic, on Twitter and in public, as well as outright threatening them , too. At the same time, this does also follow Trump’s latest public offer to meet with Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Aug. 26, 2019, at the G7 summit in France. The President has proposed such meetings in the past, as well. “I have a good feeling. I think he [Rouhani] is going to want to meet and get their situation straightened out. They are hurting badly,” Trump told reporters. “They can’t do what they were saying they were going to do because if they do that, they will be met with really very violent force. So I think they are going to be good.” President Donald Trump speaks to the press at the G7 summit on Aug. 26, 2019., Michael Kappeler/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images Since May, the U.S. government had continued to warn about the potential for attack from Iran or its regional proxies against its interests or those of its allies. Iran did shoot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4A drone in June, which almost touched off retaliatory strikes . There have been a number of attacks on tankers in the Middle with links to Iran , as well as the aforementioned IRGC seizures of the Stena Impero and other ships. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have notably stepped up attacks against Saudi Arabia, as well. There are also growing indications that Israel has increased its own campaign against Iran and its proxies through the Middle East, reportedly expanding strikes into Iraq and launching renewed operations in Lebanon . Still, there have been hopes that things may finally be trending in the opposite direction. A U.S.-backed maritime security mission in the tense Strait of Hormuz, so far, appears to have deterred further Iranian attempts to seize any ships. “I’m not sure I’m ready to call the crisis over yet, but so far so good,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on Aug. 28, 2019. “We hope the trend lines continue that way.  And we hope that the parties, that the Iranians would agree to talk – meet and talk and help us resolve these issues.” So far, Iran has refused to meet with the United States until it rolls back sanctions and has also called on the U.S. government to respect the terms of a controversial deal of its nuclear program, which the Trump Administration withdrew from in 2018 . Whether Trump’s Tweet over the Safir accident helps lead to any new movement on the diplomatic front remains to be seen. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 25, 2019",Check Out These Photos Of USAF B-2s And RAF F-35Bs Flying Together For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers are in the United Kingdom to conduct various training exercises in the region and one of them recently made a very significant first-ever visit to Iceland. Now, in another notable first, a pair of the flying-wing bombers have taken to the skies together with two of the U.K. Royal Air Force’s F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . The integration training flight off the coast of Dover in the United Kingdom actually took place on Aug. 29, 2019, though the Royal Air Force and U.S. Air Forces in Europe only announced it today. In addition to this being the first time that RAF F-35Bs have flown with B-2s, it is also the first time the bombers have flown with any F-35s from a foreign air force. The three B-2s first arrived at RAF Fairford on Aug. 27, 2019. “This flying integration builds on the work of Exercise Lightning Dawn in Cyprus and the visit of RAF F-35 Lightning to Italy … where in both cases it had the opportunity to prove itself among other NATO allies who also operate the aircraft,” U.K. Defense Minister Mark Lancaster said in a statement . “NATO is the bedrock of Euro-Atlantic defense, and those secure foundations continue to be reinforced by the training exercises being completed between the Royal Air Force and our special friends in the US Air Force.” The two US Air Force B-2s and two RAF F-35Bs pose against the Dover countryside on Aug. 29, 2019., Press Association via AP Crown Copyright The RAF conducted Exercise Lightning Dawn in April 2019 and subsequently deployed its F-35Bs for actual combat operations over Iraq or Syria two months later. In July 2019, the RAF’s Joint Strike Fighters, together with F-35s from the U.S. and Italian Air Forces, took part in another first-of-its-kind training exercise . A core component of the multi-national F-35 program has been about enabling the different operators, particular those of whom are NATO members, to further increase their ability to conduct operations together and exchange information using the jet’s powerful sensor fusion capabilities. That latter point means that Joint Strike FIghters will be able to “quarterback” and act as key leaders during future coalition operations. A US Air Force B-2 stealth bomber flies in formation with two RAF F-35Bs past offshore wind turbines on Aug. 29, 2019., Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright In the United Kingdom has been especially keen to explore the expanding potential for cooperation that the Joint Strike Fighters afford. U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs have been training alongside their British counterparts already ahead of plans to deploy onboard the first-in-class aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth when it sets out on its inaugural operational deployment, which is slated to occur in 2021. The ship is presently on its way to the United States where it will embark front-line Marine F-35Bs for the first time for operational trials to support preparations for that cruise. In addition, F-35s, as with other fifth-generation fighter jets, are expected to operate in areas that are too dangerous for non-stealth aircraft to venture. The B-2s, as well as the future B-21 Raider stealth bombers , also exist to provide the ability to strike targets deep within dense hostile air defense networks. As such, it is possible that future coalition operations, including those with NATO members in the lead, could include F-35s and B-2s operating in these denied areas where it could be important for them to understand how to at least coordinate their activities. A picture of B-2, serial number 82-1071, also known a the Spirit of Mississippi, as seen from another aircraft during the combined USAF-RAF training mission on Aug. 29, 2019., Crown Copyright “Our Royal Air Force friends are integral to the 509th Bomb Wing mission,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Rob Schoeneberg, a member of the Wing’s 393rd Bomb Squadron and the commander of the Bomber Task Force presently at RAF Fairford, said in his own statement about the training mission. “The beauty of our partnerships is that we get to understand how they see the world. Working alongside international fifth-generation aircraft provides unique training opportunities for us, bolsters our integration capabilities, and showcases the commitment we have to our NATO alliance.” Beyond the immediate value of the integration training, as Lieutenant Colonel Schoeneberg noted, sorties involving one of America’s most capable combat aircraft together with the most advanced jets now in service within NATO, send a general signal about the alliance’s capabilities. The United States has already stepped up routine deployments of B-2s and other bombers to Europe in recent years, primarily as part efforts to deter any potential Russian aggression and reassure allies and partners in the region. At the same time, they have become visible parts of major training exercises across Europe, including the B-2’s very public first-ever visit to Iceland just this week. As The War Zone already highlighted at the time , sending the stealth bomber there was a significant demonstration of the Air Force’s efforts to explore and expand its ability to use less common locations to support operations involving its most advanced combat aircraft . This could be especially important during a future high-end conflict or other crisis in which established bases, such as RAF Fairford, may become unavailable . https://youtube.com/watch?v=1aq6-LTu_uI All told, as NATO members, including the United States, continue to deploy more and more F-35s and integrate them into their routine operations , and if American bomber deployments to the region continue as they have been, it seems likely that we will only see more exercises that involve cooperation and coordination between them in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 16, 2019",USAF MC-130J Spec Ops Transport Flies Through Taiwan Strait With U.S. Spy Plane Nearby,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force MC-130J Commando II special operations transport made a rare trip through the highly sensitive Taiwan Strait today, flying along the so-called “ Median Line ” that serves as the de facto boundary between Taiwan and mainland China. There was a variety of other interesting military aerial activity in the area around the same time, including an RC-135W Rivet Joint spy plane flying what appeared to be an intelligence-gathering operation just to the south and still unidentified aircraft flying an orbit within the Strait itself. It also came at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments, as well as those between authorities in Tapei and Beijing, have flared over a host of issues, including Taiwanese plans to purchase advanced American Block 70 F-16 Viper fighter jets, ongoing protests in Hong Kong , and U.S.-China trade disputes. The MC-130J, serial number 12-5763, was one of those assigned to the 17th Special Operations Squadron, part of the 353rd Special Operations Group at Kadena Air Base in Japan. The aircraft, using the call sign Singe 11, left Kadena on Aug. 29, 2019, and was visible using online flight tracking software as it passed north to south through the Taiwan Strait. It then turned southeast into the Bashi Channel, which sites between Taiwan and the Philippines. It’s not entirely clear what the aircraft’s ostensible mission might have been. The skies above the median line are technically in international airspace. For their part, Taiwanese authorities said that there was “ nothing abnormal ” about the MC-130J’s actions within the Strait. The U.S. Navy often conducts Freedom of Navigation patrols, or FONOPs, through the Strait to assert its right to sail unimpeded through international waters and to demonstrate the U.S. government’s ongoing commitment to Taiwan. Just on Aug. 23, 2019, the San Antonio class amphibious ship USS Green Bay sailed through , the latest in a number of such transits by American naval vessels this year. In 1979, The United States recognized China’s communist government as the sole legitimate government in the country. At the same time, Congress passed a law stipulating that the U.S. government would continue to reserve the right to sell arms to Taiwan, and otherwise cooperate with authorities there, until such time as the island’s final status was resolved. China views the island as a rogue semi-autonomous region and has repeatedly threatened a military intervention if officials there attempt to declare full independence. MC-130J Commando II, serial number 12-5763, the same aircraft that flew through the Taiwan Strait on Aug. 29, 2019., USAF Naval FONOPs are not uncommon in the region, but similar aerial activity is much rarer. In June 2019, a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, which also has significant electronic intelligence-gathering capabilities , flew through the Strait at the same time the Chinese aircraft Liaoning was sailing below. In another instance in 2011, Chinese fighter jet scrambled to try to intercept an Air Force U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane as it flew between Taiwan and the Mainland. The U.S. military far more regularly uses aircraft, as well as ships , to challenge Chinese claims in the South China Sea and other outlying areas. Conducting this kind of sortie in the Taiwan Strait, which by definition places the plane relatively close to the Chinese mainland, could be considered more provocative than these other flights that are largely over the open ocean. It’s hard to say whether or not the sole purpose of the flight was a FONOP, either. The MC-130J may have been slated to head south from Japan for another reason, possibly to take part in exercises in and around the Philippines. Mission planners could have then decided to combine that transit with a flight through the Taiwan Strait. Official pictures show that Air Force CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors from the 21st Special Operations Squadron were training together with the Nimitz class carrier USS Ronald Reagan and her associated strike group, in the Philippine Sea last week. The 21st is another unit assigned to the 353rd in Japan, but which is based at Yokota Air Base. MC-130Js also act as special operations tankers for the CV-22s, as well as special operations helicopters, and could have been working together with these assets as part of ongoing exercises. A CV-22 Osprey from the 21st Special Operations Squadron takes off from the USS Ronald Reagan in the Philippine Sea on Aug. 19, 2019., USN It’s also interesting to note that an Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint spy plane, using the call sign Ronin 71, was flying an orbit in the Bashi Channel at the same time the MC-130J was passing through the Strait. Rivet Joints are among the service’s most capable intelligence collection platforms and have powerful equipment to spot, geo-locate, and categorize various emitters, including communications nodes and air defense radars. It is quite possible, in not probable, that Ronin 71 was monitoring how China’s air defense network responded to Singe 11 flying through the area. Communications chatter could offer useful information about Chinese standard operating procedures. The aircraft would also have been able to gather information on the locations and types of radars and other emitters associated with the country’s air defenses, which could help in the creation of an up-to-date “ Electronic Order of Battle ” for the Peoples Liberation Army’s assets in the region. Of course, the RC-135W flight may well have been pre-planned separately, as well, despite the fact that it likely had a chance to gather especially valuable information given the presence of the MC-130J. It may have also been related to a separate B-52 bomber flight in the South China Sea. Just the day before the MC-130J flight through the Taiwan Strait and the B-52 mission, the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer conducted another FONOP past Fiery Cross and Mischief Reefs, also in the South China Sea, which China claims as its national territory, which may have also stirred up Chinese activity worth snooping on. Regardless, Rivet Joint flights occur with some regularity across the Western Pacific and the Air Force has applied a number of nicknames to routine missions in established operating areas in the region in the past. These have included Diamond Wind sorties in the East China Sea, Misty Wind flights in and around the Philippines, Sapphire Wind patrols in the South China Sea, and Opal Wind missions in a broader generalized area southeast of Okinawa, which would primarily consist of the Philippine Sea. Two redacted pages, side-by-side, from the 2010 annual command history for Air Combat Command, showing various nicknamed Rivet Joint operating areas in the Pacific region., USAF via FOIA Friend of The War Zone @AircraftSpots also noticed a curious unidentified aircraft flying a pattern inside the Taiwan Strait after the MC-130J left. Here’s what they could share with us about this mysterious track: “Shortly after the MC-130J left, an aircraft using a miscoded hex code of 000001 began flying a race track pattern over the Taiwan Strait and after roughly 25 minutes in the pattern, the aircraft continued northbound through the Strait. I was unable to find the identity of the aircraft.” The track of the unidentified, miscoded aircraft., via @AircraftSpots Whatever the exact reasons for the MC-130J’s trip, as well as the activities of the mystery aircraft and the RC-135W, the flights in the Taiwan Strait are unusual and almost guaranteed to draw a rebuke from China. The sorties come as relations between Washington and Beijing are increasingly strained. On Aug. 20, 2019, the U.S. government formally approved a long-reported proposed sale of advanced Block 70 F-16 Viper fighter jets sale to Taiwan, something the Chinese government has historically said would cross a major “red line.” China subsequently threatened to impose sanctions on any companies involved in the sale. The month had also begun with a still very nebulous collision between a Taiwanese cargo ship Yutai Number One and an unknown Chinese warship. Taiwan’s Coast Guard subsequently denied reports that parts of a radar from the People’s Liberation Army Navy ship had fallen onto the deck of the Yutai Number One during the accident. There have been few other updates about the incident. American, as well as Taiwanese, support for protesters in Hong Kong who have been calling for greater freedoms for months has also enraged Chinese authorities.  On Aug. 29, 2019, China announced it was conducting what it claimed was a routine rotation of troops in and out of People’s Liberation Army garrison in that semi-autonomous region. This seemed to be a clear attempt to intimidate demonstrators and followed a highly publicized mass mobilization of paramilitary People’s Armed Police in the neighboring Shenzhen region earlier in the month, ostensibly for an exercise. China had also blocked a planned port visit by two U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong on Aug. 13, 2019. Another American warship found itself denied entry to the port of Qingdao in northeastern China just this week due to escalation tensions. All of this is against the backdrop of an ongoing U.S.-China trade war, which has recently seen President Donald Trump approve more tariffs on Chinese goods and call for all American countries to stop doing business in China completely. If relations between the United States and China continue to degrade, which looks very likely, at least in the near term, one has to wonder whether we may see U.S. military aircraft conduct increasing sorties through the Taiwan Strait to complement the existing naval activity in the region. If that happens, it could lead to escalating Chinese responses, as well. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Around The Globe Indo-Pacific News & Features Taiwan"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",New Space Command’s Flag Sure Looks A Lot Like Old Space Command’s Flag,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in nearly two decades, the U.S. military again has a dedicated U.S. Space Command to oversee activities in this increasingly critical domain. With the large amount of hype surrounding its re-establishment, many may not realize that the United States previously had a Space Command between 1985 and 2002. This latest iteration even comes along with an insignia that takes virtually all of its cues from the logo for the previous incarnation of the command, but in a more modern, slicker-looking package. U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Roger Toberman, together with General John Raymond, who is now head of Space Command, unfurled the revised colors during a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House on Aug. 29, 2019. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom have been outspoken advocates for the creation of Space Command, as well as the possible establishment of an entirely new branch of the military, were also present, as was Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. “This is a landmark day, one that recognizes the centrality of space to America’s national security and defense,” Trump said in a brief speech at the event. “It’s going to be a whole different ballgame.” “We are at a strategic inflection point. There is nothing that we do [as a joint force] that isn’t enabled by space. Zero,” General Raymond said in his own short remarks. “Our goal is to actually deter a conflict from extending into space. The best way I know how to do that is to be prepared to fight and win.” In spite of these commends, as noted, U.S. Space Command had previously existed from 1985 until 2002 , when it was folded into U.S. Strategic Command. In recent years, though, space, U.S. military activities there, and their vulnerabilities during a major conflict have become a point of increasing concern, especially as potential opponents, such as Russia and China have worked to develop various anti-satellite capabilities. These are trends and developments The War Zone has been following closely . This subsequently led to the decision to reboot Space Command, which now has the following four core missions: Deterring potential adversaries in space. Protecting U.S. military space assets from those potential adversaries. Overseeing the continued function of vital military space-based capabilities, including, but not limited to early warning , GPS navigation and satellite communications. Supporting and maintaining the forces necessary to conduct these missions. We don’t know for sure if the official descriptions of the symbolism of the various pieces of Space Command’s new logo are the same as they were for the original insignia. However, the two designs do have virtually all of the same basic graphical elements, such as four large stars, an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and quiver of arrows in the other, and a globe with a pair of orbital paths marked out. The logo for U.S. Space Command as it existed from 1985 until 2002, at left, and the new version of the logo, at right., DOD Here are the official descriptions of the meanings of the various components of the previous Space Command insignia: “The dark blue disc encircled by a white band with narrow yellow borders inscribed “United States” at top and “Space Command” at bottom in dark blue letters, provides the background and symbolizes the space environment. “The eagle and shield, a traditional symbol of American strength and vigilance, is positioned above a light blue elliptical globe with light landmasses and dark blue grid lines to represent the expansion of this strength and vigilance into space. “The globe, as viewed from space, symbolizes the Earth as being the origin and control point for all space vehicles and represents the area of operations of the United States Space Command. “Encompassing the elliptical globe are two yellow orbital paths crossed diagonally, each bearing a yellow polestar detailed light tan and signifying the worldwide coverage provided in accomplishing the surveillance, navigation and communications missions. “The gold-brown eagle, detailed in dark brown and highlighted light tan, with a white head and tail; and yellow beak, eye, and talons detailed in light tan, is grasping in his right talon a green olive branch, detailed in dark green, and in his left talon 13 arrows with white arrowheads and feathers, and light tan shafts. The eagle is flanked by an arc of four yellow stars detailed in light tan, and symbolizing the fusion of the four armed services into a unified command.” The re-establishment of Space Command may just be the start of larger reorganizations within the U.S. military with regards to space. There has been a considerable amount of debate within the Pentagon and Congress about how best to ensure that the U.S. military is giving the appropriate amount of attention and resources to space-related issues in recent years. The possibility of creating an entire sixth military branch, which could end up called the Space Corps or Space Force, has also emerged, but would take an act of Congress. Many legislators remain unsold on the idea. You can read more about these ongoing debates in these past War Zone stories . It remains to be seen when, or if, a new Space Force actually comes into being. In the meantime, Space Command is back once again amid broad bipartisan support within the U.S. government and looks set to be flying its new flag for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2021",Army Spending Millions To Trial Three Light Tactical Vehicles Including One It Already Uses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has selected three different light tactical vehicle proposals to compete in its Infantry Squad Vehicle program. At the same time, the decision to proceed with the project at all, which has been ongoing in some form for five years now, seems somewhat curious. The service has already bought hundreds of examples of one of the vehicles in the running, which is also in service with U.S. Special Operations Command, to meet the same requirements. A team-up between Oshkosh Defense and Flyer Defense, another consisting of SAIC and Polaris, along with General Motors, all received $1 million contracts on Aug. 23, 2019 . The Army expects to take delivery of two examples each of the three prototype designs – six vehicles in total – for testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland by Nov. 13, 2019 . The service then hopes to award an initial contract to the competition’s winner for 651 vehicles in March 2020. The final order could potentially grow to up to 2,065 Infantry Squad Vehicles (ISV). Flyer Defense will be in charge of designing the vehicle they are proposing in cooperation with Oshkosh Defense. This will almost certainly be a variant of the Flyer series of light tactical vehicles, which you can read about in more detail here. Flyers are already in active service with U.S. special operations forces, as well as limited regular Army use , which could give the design a leg up in the competition. SAIC and Polaris have teamed up to deliver prototypes based on the latter company’s Deployable Advanced Ground Off-Road design, or DAGOR. Polaris originally developed this vehicle for U.S. Special Operations Command and other international special operations forces customers. The standard Flyer 60 and DAGOR vehicles have very similar overall dimensions and both weigh in at around 4,500 pounds. The basic Flyer 72 is longer and wider and weighs around 1,000 pounds more. The Flyer variants and DAGOR all feature turbodiesel engines that can also run off JP8 jet fuel. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9G4rI-2AKZY General Motors will deliver a militarized version of its Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison pickup truck. The U.S. Army did previously test a militarized, hydrogen fuel cell-powered version of the ZR2, called the ZH2 , but there is no indication yet that GM will propose this particular variant for the ISV competition. The potential to covert ZR2s to use the ZH2’s hydrogen fuel cell system in the future could still be a plus for this entrant given the service’s increasing concerns about providing the necessary fuel to units during any future high-end combat operations, something The War Zone has previously examined in detail . The Chevy ZH2., GM The ostensible goal of the ISV program is to provide added capabilities for Army light infantry units, including airborne and airmobile elements, that otherwise have not typically had the benefit of significant numbers of organic light tactical vehicles. As the name implies, the basic requirement is to be able to carry a standard nine-person infantry squad. These vehicles would improve the mobility of small units, as well as offer them a means to more readily transport heavier weapons, such as heavy machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, and anti-tank guided missiles . The ISVs are not intended to replace any existing vehicles that are already in service, such as the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), which is now entering service with the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps. The program, which evolved from the Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULTV) effort that began in 2014, has been looking at designs that are significantly smaller and lighter weight than the JLTV, or the Humvees that those vehicles are replacing. The desire for a vehicle that is itself easier to move around and deploy has been a major driving factor for the ISV program, as well as a host of other, similar efforts across the U.S. military in recent years. The need for an “ internally transportable ” design that fits inside a wide range of aircraft and helicopters has been a common theme across those projects. A key Army requirement for the ISV has been that it needs to be able to squeeze inside a CH-47 Chinook. It’s already possible to do this with a Humvee, but with considerable effort . Smaller all-terrain vehicles that have less payload capacity than the proposed ISVs will also fit . At the same time, while the ISV could certainly boost the mobility and firepower of light infantry units, it seems worth questions whether running a new competition after all these years is the best course of action for the Army. The service has already spent considerable time and energy testing a variety of commercial-of-the-shelf options or commercial derivatives, including one based on the Jeep Wrangler . Hendrick Dynamics Jeep Wrangler-based Commando, which the Army previously evaluated., Hendrick Motorsports The fact that the service had already decided to go ahead and buy nearly 300 Flyer 72s, which it designated as M1297 Army Ground Mobility Vehicles (A-GMV), only raises additional questions about whether the separate ISV effort is a valuable use of time and resources. The M1297 itself is based on the U.S. Special Operations Command’s Flyer 72 configuration , known as the M1288 GMV 1.1, which has been in service for years and has been involved in combat operations in the Middle East. The Army’s own budget documents treat GMV 1.1, AGMV, and ISV as being components of one larger effort. This is to say nothing of similar efforts within the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps that have led to the acquisition of a variety of internally transportable light tactical vehicles in the past two decades. Some of these projects trace their roots all the way back to the 1990s. The Air Force’s Guardian Angel Air-deployable Rescue Vehicle, a variant of the HDT Storm , yet another light tactical vehicle design in US military service., USAF If the ISV competition settles on a Flyer variant, the Army will have paid at least $2 million to effectively pick a vehicle it is already using. If it picks one of the other contenders, it will then end up with two distinct fleets of vehicles that meet the same basic requirements, which could increase logistical, maintenance, and training demands and associated costs. Divesting the M1297s could potentially recoup some funds, but not the sunk costs already spent on things such as training personnel to use them. On top of all this, there has been increasing debate within the U.S. military about whether a vehicle that meets the basic ISV requirements is suitable for even limited combat operations against opponents with access to man-portable anti-tank guided missiles , mines, and improvised explosive devices , let alone a high-end fight. Adding additional armor and other defensive features can only increase the base weight. This, in turn, could limit any design’s ability to be internally transportable and air-droppable, as well as just its basic off-road mobility. The Army itself is in midst of a separate competition to potentially acquire a new light tank to provide more heavily armored support airborne and other light infantry forces. The 82nd Airborne Division has already begun receiving ex-Marine LAV-25A2 light armored vehicles in the meantime. With all this in mind, it will be interesting to see who the Army declares as the winner of the ISV program next year, if those trials continue on schedule, and how many vehicles it actually buys in the end.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 18, 2019","51 F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Jets Remain In Inventory, None Destroyed Since 2008 (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a decade after the F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jet’s official retirement, it remains a hot topic of discussion and speculation , especially given that some of the aircraft are still flying . The War Zone can now confirm that the Air Force still has 51 of the aircraft in its inventory and has not destroyed any of the aircraft since 2008, despite a Congressional mandate two years ago to dispose of four of them annually . We can also explain what happened to an F-117 that bystanders recently spotted on a flatbed semi-trailer on a road near the Air Force’s Plant 42 complex in southern California. The War Zone has been working for months to obtain new details about the state of the F-117s, both by contacting the Air Force directly and through the Freedom of Information Act, which continues to prove to be curiously difficult. Brian Brackens, an Air Force spokesperson at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, provided the updated information in an Email on Aug. 28, 2019. The remaining Nighthawks are still at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada. Lockheed Martin only ever built 59 F-117s, along with five pre-production YF-117s, so 51 aircraft represent the bulk of the total production run. This largely dispells persistent rumors over the years that the Air Force had been quietly destroying the remaining aircraft, possibly by simply burying them out at Tonopah. Until 2016, there was a legal requirement to keep the F-117s in so-called “ Type 1000 ” storage, meaning that they would be maintained in a state where they could be returned to active service relatively quickly, if necessary. The annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the 2017 Fiscal Year nullified this and replaced it with the four-per-year disposal plan. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio subsequently developed what it calls a “migration plan” for how to get rid of the F-117s. Some of the best pictures in over a decade of F-117s flying. The images were taken in Panamint Valley in March of 2019., Adrian Harrison/ @adrianh The officially retired aircraft have been remarkably active in recent months. , Adrian Harrison/ @adrianh “The Air Force planned to dispose of one F-117 in FY17 and approximately 4 every year following, however, there was a requirement for an environmental impact study prior to operating a Media Blast Facility,” Brackens, the Air Force spokesperson, told The War Zone in his Email. “That study delayed construction and completion of the facility until this year.” “Media blasting” in this instance refers to using abrasives to remove the sensitive radar-absorbing material coatings that cover the F-117’s skin. This is a notoriously complex process. The material also happens to be highly toxic and requires personnel performing the blasting to wearing head-to-toe protective gear and utilize specialized facilities. The Air Force had to go through this process with a YF-117 pre-production aircraft, serial number 79-10781, in order to send that aircraft to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in 1991 for display. Workers went so far as to spray-paint the phrase “ Toxic Death ” on the aircraft’s bare skin afterward. You can read all about that Nighthawk, and the other work required to make it ready for display, in this past War Zone piece . The “Toxic Death” F-117 in flight circa 1991., Public Domain So, it’s not surprising that the Air Force would have to complete a rigorous environmental impact study before opening up the new dedicated facility at Tonopah to perform this work on dozens of F-117s. At a rate of four-a-year, this site will have to be active for nearly 13 years in order to dispose of 51 Nighthawks. It is also not clear how, or if, the Tonopah media blasting facility’s operations might differ from how Air Force has performed this work in the past. The Air Force initially told The War Zone that it had destroyed an F-117 at Plant 42 in the 2017 Fiscal Year, as planned, as a proof of concept, but this turned out to be in error. As such, it remains unclear where the Nighthawk that bystanders had spotted on a highway in southern Nevada back in 2017 was headed and why. F-117 photographed on a flatbed heading south in Nevada in 2017. This is likely the aircraft that was on its way to be destroyed as a proof of concept. , Courtesy of Randy and Brett Lockheed Martin did destroy a YF-117, with the serial number 79-10784, at its facilities at Plant 42 in 2008 . This was as a proof of concept for a possible method of disposing of the Nighthawks, which may have helped inform the Air Force’s current “migration plan.” F-117 destroyed at Plant 42 in 2008 as part of another invasive disposal study that occurred right after the type’s official retirement., USAF Brackens, the Air Force spokesperson, did confirm that another Nighthawk did arrive at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force on Aug. 22, 2019. This was very likely the aircraft that bystanders saw near Plant 42 the week before, where it could have undergone media blasting or other demilitarization before getting flown to Wright Patterson. It also is possible that the one that emerged in 2017 was in the process of being demilitarized in order to go to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force and this second wrapped-up example is headed for a different fate. There are indications that a number of other museums are trying to acquire F-117s, as well. F-117 partially disassembled on a flatbed truck photographed near Plant 42 in mid-August, 2019., Christopher McGreevy/ @ohwiss Another view of the F-117 partially disassembled on a flatbed truck near Plant 42., Christopher McGreevy/ @ohwiss A closer look of the other side of the F-117 partially disassembled on a flatbed truck seen near Plant 42 in mid-August, 2019., Christopher McGreevy/ @ohwiss With the new media blasting facility, the “remaining F-117A aircraft will continue to be disposed of in accordance with the Migration Plan at the rate of approximately four aircraft/year,” Air Force spokesperson Brackens explained in his Email to The War Zone . It remains unclear what the Air Force, or private contractors, might be doing with the remaining F-117s in the meantime. It is obvious from pictures and video that seem to emerge with relative regularity that some of them are still flying, despite there no longer being a requirement to keep them in Type 1000 storage. YF-117, serial number 79-10781, in its now somewhat censored form on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force., USAF There have been rumors that some of the aircraft might have returned to service secretly, flying missions in the Middle East, but there is no hard evidence to support those claims and there are also alternative explanations. The War Zone has previously explored the possibilities in a pair of features you can find here and here . For what it’s worth, U.S. Central Command, Air Force Material Command, and Hill Air Force Base, have all responded to Freedom of Information Act requests regarding possible regeneration of the Nighthawks for combat missions by saying they could find no such records. The Air Force Safety Center also said it had no record of any mishaps involving F-117s anywhere in the world since 2014 in response to another FOIA, despite reports of an inflight emergency that led to an emergency landing during purported combat operations in the Middle East. It remains more plausible that some of the F-117s are involved in ongoing research and development efforts . This could include using them as stealthy targets to test new sensor systems, including infrared search and track (IRST) systems that are set to become prevalent on U.S. military fighter jets in the coming years. You can read more in detail about how the Nighthawks remain valuable assets for supporting this kind of work here . The lessons the Air Force learns at the media blasting facility at Tonopah, and otherwise during the disposal of the remaining F-117s, may also be useful in the future. The service will face similar issues when it finally retires its fleet of B-2 Spirit stealth bombers. If there are no more delays in the Air Force’s disposal plans, it will still take more than a decade before the service destroys its last F-117. So, while it seems like the jets have truly entered their twilight period, we may still be seeing some of them flying over the American southwest for years to come. Author’s note : The original version of this story said that an F-117 with the serial number 80-0784 was destroyed in Fiscal Year 2017, but this appears to have been in error. There is no known F-117 with this serial number. YF-117, serial number 79-10784, was destroyed at Plant 42 in 2008. We have reached out to the Air Force for clarification. Update 8/29/2019: The Air Force now says that its original statement that it had destroyed an F-117 in Fiscal Year 2017 was entirely in error and this story has been updated to reflect this clarification. The full statement that Air Force Spokesperson Brian Brackens sent in an Email on Aug. 29, 2019, is as follows: “The previous info was a mistake on our part as we misread older documentation. No F-117 aircraft was destroyed in FY17 and the YF-117 with the serial number 79-10784 was destroyed at Plant 42 (Palmdale, CA) in 2008.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 18, 2021",Russia Claims A Grabber Arm Equipped Il-76 Will Launch And Recover Hypersonic Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Gromov Flight Research Institute has revealed a concept for a system that it says will allow an Il-76 Candid airlifter to launch and recover hypersonic flight test vehicles using an extendable arm mounted in its main cargo bay. While similar in some respects the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Gremlins program , it’s not at all clear how the Russian system would actually work, especially when trying to grab super-fast-flying test vehicles straight out of mid-air. Gromov , also known by its Russian language acronym LII, presented concept art for what it blandly titled a “universal system with a booster for high-speed UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] tests” at the biennial MAKS air show outside of Moscow. The show, which is going on at Zhukovsky International Airport , where Gromov is also based, formally opened on Aug. 27, 2019. There is no indication that there is an actual example of this system that is at all functional and available for use in any capacity. The core of the system itself is a modular “universal booster,” or UB, which can accommodate either a high- or low-thrust rocket motor, depending on the test parameters. “The system is designed for flight research and tests on a universal flying test-bed of objects with a hypersonic ramjet engine (scramjet),” the placard at MAKS explained. The display shows three sizes of scramjet-powered vehicles that can fit on the UB, but it is possible that it could support other hypersonic flight testing, as well. The printed description says that the booster can accommodate flight test articles weighing up to three tons and just shy of 20 feet long. With the larger rocket motor in place, the UB should be able to propel any such object to at least Mach 3 or 4, at which point, if it is powered by a scramjet, the engine would be able to take over. Courtesy of Michael Jerdev / @Muxelaero Courtesy of Michael Jerdev / @Muxelaero Then there’s the modified Il-76 testbed. It “provides an air start, towing in the airflow, reboarding of flight test objects, [that are] different in purpose and mass-dimensional characteristics, including objects with a scramjet,” the displays read. The graphic shows a cutaway of the Il-76 with a crane-like arm that is affixed to the floor in the center of the cargo bay. It then extends out through the Il-76 Candid’s rear clamshell doors and folds down into the slipstream below the aircraft. Based on the description from Gromov, the aircraft could simply fly with it in that position to gather basic aerodynamic data or release it for a full flight test. Gromov has a small number of Il-76LL testbed aircraft that it could modify in the hypersonic launch and recovery aircraft. One of them is seen here during a test of the Aviadvigatel PD-14 turbofan engine in 2015., Alex Snow via Wikimedia However, there are absolutely no details on how the aircraft would go about rendezvousing with a test vehicle after a flight or recovering it. There a number of historical examples of how one might go about doing this, typically involving extendable grabbier-like arms. During the 1950s, the U.S. Air Force experimented extensively with deploying and retrieving fighter and reconnaissance aircraft from modified bombers to extend the smaller aircraft’s range. There were also tests of tiny “parasite” escort fighter, the XF-85A Goblin , which the service hoped might offer bombers an organic fighter defense during long-range missions. In the 1970s, Boeing revived the concept of an Airborne Aircraft Carrier (AAC), which would have used a modified 747 airliner to launch and recover 10 “microfighters.” It would have also had a boom in order to refuel them in mid-air. Concept art showing Boeing’s 747 AAC., Boeing via Boeing-747.com The unmanned aircraft that Dynetics is developing now for DARPA’s Gremlins program have a probe that locks into a towed drogue. The recovering aircraft – presently a specially configured C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft – then reels into position so that a grabber arm can pull it inside. But recovering subsonic manned or unmanned aircraft is worlds different from trying to snatch a hypersonic vehicle, which, by definition is designed to fly at speeds of Mach 5 or more, out of the air. It would have to dramatically decelerate for the Il-76 to even have a chance at retrieving it. It’s not even clear if a hypersonic vehicle would be able to remain stable and airborne at such a low speed. If Gromov can make the arrangement work, the Russians might gain some extra flexibility when it comes to flight testing hypersonic unmanned aircraft and weapons. The U.S. Air Force has similarly begun buying air-launched Generation Orbit X-60A hypersonic test vehicles specifically in order to help with the rapid testing of systems and materials at hypersonic speeds. However, these are expendable and need a specially configured launching aircraft. If it turns out the arm is only capable of deploying test articles into the slipstream or releasing them, that still might be useful enough to justify the expense of developing and installing the conversion. It is also possible that Gromov could adapt it to work with subsonic unmanned aircraft, along the lines of America’s Gremlins, or some other kind of optionally expendable cruise missile-like drones . The extra standoff range that hypersonic systems offer make them particularly well suited to employment from non-stealthy platforms , such as a modified Candid, in general, since it means they can stay relatively far away from enemy air defenses during launch and recover. Even so, modifying Il-76s with the grabber arm system would seem far more complicated and risky than simply integrating various hypersonic weapons onto existing platforms, including Russia’s strategic Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack bombers and shorter-range Tu-22M Backfire bomber. The Russians have already modified a number of MiG-31 heavy interceptors to carry the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic missile. It will be certainly interesting to see if the Il-76 hypersonic air-launch and recovery testbed ever actually emerges and what its capabilities might be if it does.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2019",“We’re Buying This One?” Turkey’s Erdogan Asks Putin In Front Of Su-57 Fighter At Air Show,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the biennial MAKS air show outside of Moscow alongside Turkish President Recep Erdogan today, a clear display of solidarity between the two leaders that can only send a clear message to the United States . Erdogan also made an offhanded comment about buying Su-57s during the event. This is something the Kremlin has already offered and that The War Zone had noted was likely given the spat over the F-35 between the United States and Turkey due to the latter’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 air defense system. MAKS, a Russian-language acronym that translates as International Aviation and Space Salon, opened on Aug. 27, 2019, at the Zhukovsky International Airport, which is also home to the Russian government’s Gromov Flight Research Institute aerospace research and development center, and will run through Sept. 1. Erdogan and Putin toured other parts of the show together beyond the Su-57, receiving briefs about various aircraft and helicopters. Back in Turkey, as the show was getting underway, Russian personnel were unloading another delivery of missiles and other equipment related to the S-400 surface-to-air missile system. On Aug. 26, 2019, the Pentagon had also announced it would finish formally removing Turkey from the F-35 program by March 2020 . “I am glad to welcome the participants and guests of the International Aviation and Space Salon, and above all, our good friend, President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan,” Putin said during the open ceremonies with Erdogan standing next to him. “I am sure that all our foreign partners and, of course, our Turkish friends, the Turkish delegation will be interested in the achievements of the domestic, Russian aviation industry and the technical capabilities of the last generation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, and this will open up new opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation.” “Close cooperation, dialogue between Russia and Turkey rests on historical, deep, rich roots,” Erdogan said, through a translator, in his own remarks . “We believe that our cooperation with Russia will give impetus to a new development of events – both in the aviation sector and in the field of space technology.” Photographs and videos from MAKS show Putin and Erdogan touring a wide array of military and civilian aircraft and helicopters, including the new Mi-38 medium-lift helicopter and the new Ka-62 light transport helicopter . The pair of world leaders also toured an Irkut MC-21 airliner, which is still in development, as well. Putin and Ergodan sit inside a VIP configured Mi-38 helicopter at MAKS 2019., Anadolu Agency Putin and Erdogan, along with their entourages, exit the MC-21 airliner on display at MAKS 2019., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik via AP Erdogan also got a chance to look inside an Aurus Senat luxury sedan , which is an offshoot of the development of the Russian President’s newest limousine, which the War Zone has previously covered in detail . Aurus also designed a plush VIP interior for a Kazan Ansat transport helicopter that was also on display at MAKS. Putin and Erdogan seen through the open rear door of the Aurus Senat., Russi Aleksey Nikolskyi / Sputnik via AP The most eye-catching stop, though, was when Erdogan got a close-up look at the Su-57. In May 2019, Sergey Chemezov, head of Russia’s top state-run industrial conglomerate Rostec, told Turkish state-run media outlet Anadolu Agency that the Kremlin would be willing to step in and sell Turkey these advanced combat jets if Ankara found itself cut off from the F-35, just as The War Zone had predicted . So far, there has been no formal announcement from Turkey that it has accepted any Russian offer regarding the Su-57. “So now, we are going to buy this one [the Su-57]?” Erdogan had asked Putin as they walked near the example on display. “You could,” Putin said in response, after which the Turkish president laughed. The U.S. government has all but formally ejected Turkey from the Joint Strike Fighter program over the purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems. The United States and other NATO members were concerned that the Turkish military operating both systems simultaneously could expose sensitive details about the stealth fighter’s radar signature and other capabilities to the Russian government. The saga has also been tied up in otherwise worsening U.S.-Turkish relations over a number of issues, which you can read about in more detail here and here . Putin and Erdogan examine an Su-57., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik via AP In July 2019, the first shipment of S-400 related equipment arrived in Turkey , pushing the spat past the point of no return, at least when it comes to the F-35. The Turkish government is still receiving additional portions of its order. At the time of the first deliveries, the Pentagon had already been working out its plan to remove Turkey from the F-35 program and is continuing to implement those decisions . Turkish companies have been responsible for the production of hundreds of different components for the Joint Strike Fighters and are the sole producers of a significant number of them, which has required the U.S. government to find new sources. “900-plus parts will all be sourced in the U.S. initially.  We are well down the pathway, have been working it for almost a year now, in one form or another,” Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord told reporters at the Pentagon on Aug. 26, 2019. “We still are on the path to be out of Turkey by the end of March 2020.” Lockheed Martin, the F-35’s prime contractor, is responsible for finding those new suppliers, though the U.S. government is underwriting at least some portion of the costs of doing so. The Pentagon has not yet determined what it will do with F-35As already officially delivered to Turkey, which had remained in the United States for training purposes. Those aircraft at still at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Turkey is working on its own indigenous stealth fighter program, known as the TF-X. “The TF-X, which is our fifth-generation military aircraft, is the apple of our eye,” Erdogan had said on stage with Putin. “We showed a typical model of this aircraft in June of this year at an exhibition in Paris and demonstrated all its qualities.” However, it remains to be seen how the chill in U.S.-Turkish relations might impact that program . Chemezov had also said any Su-57 sale could include industrial cooperation to support work on TF-X. Erdogan has previously announced plans to cooperate with Russian in some fashion on the production of the new S-500 air defense system, as well as the S-400. Whatever the case, Turkey isn’t expecting TF-X to make its first flight before 2025 and the country’s Air Force may need an interim solution to fill the gap it now has its aviation modernization plans. The Turkish government had planned to buy as many as 116 F-35s, primarily to replace its aging F-4 Phantom II combat jets. Turkey could also conceivably purchase advanced fourth-generation combat jets, such as the Su-35 Flanker-E or MiG-35 Fulcrum-F , from Russia to meet more immediate demands.

A graphic depicting an Su-57 advanced combat jet is seen at right, while another on the left shows a MiG-35., Mikhail Metzel/TASS There are also reports that the Turkish military is hoarding spare parts for its various blocks of F-16C/D Viper fighter jets in case the United States imposes more serious economic and other sanctions over the S-400 deal. There are concerns this could also impact a variety of other defense projects that U.S. and Turkish firms are working together on. As such, depending on what sanctions the U.S. government applies in the end, and when , it is possible that Turkey and Russia may also expand cooperation to other aerospace and industrial projects, military and otherwise. In May 2019, Russia also announced it was moving to begin serial production of the Su-57. Turkish orders would certainly help inject additional resources into that effort. The Kremlin has also reportedly been courting China and India as potential export customers. However, the Chinese have one stealth fighter entering active service and another in development and the Indians have already dropped out of the Su-57 program once before. What the future of Turkish and Russian cooperation in any defense sector might look like in the future remains to be seen, but Erdogan’s policies seem to be pulling his country toward a larger rift with the United States and, to a lesser extent, partners in Western Europe . At the same time, Putin has been more than happy to build a close relationship with the Turkish President, as was clearly visible at MAKS, and bring him further into Moscow’s sphere of influence.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 13, 2020","Wait, The USAF Is Spending Hundreds Of Thousands Airlifting Two Dodge Chargers To The UK?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two Dodge Charger chase cars the Air Force uses to help U-2 Dragon Lady spy planes land are hung up in red tape at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey as the service works to clear them to fly aboard one its transport aircraft to RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom. It’s not entirely clear how this has happened or why the Air Force has chosen what will invariably be the very costly option of shipping these cars via airlifter across the pond, to begin with. The Air Force first revealed the cars’ predicament in a news story on Aug. 21, 2019. It’s not clear when the cars first arrived at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), but they were there at least as of Aug. 12. Four days later, the 305th Aerial Port Squadron received orders to get them ready to go to RAF Mildenhall. An unspecified support truck is also part of the prospective shipment. The Air Force utilizes chase cars to help U-2s land, as well as take off, at bases in the United States and abroad. The Dragon Lady is notoriously challenging to land given that it only has a pair of fixed landing gear in the center fuselage, offers limited overall visibility to the pilot, and a glider-like design that can stay aloft even at relatively low speeds. The plane’s long slender wings are so efficient that the design’s very first flight occurred accidentally during a ground test. While on the ground, the U-2 utilizes a “pogo” gear under each wing, which both fall away after takeoff, to keep stable. When landing, the pilot has to keep the aircraft relatively stable and centered until they’re just a few feet off the ground, before effectively stalling the aircraft and falling the rest of the way. A Chevy Camaro chase case follows a U-2 as it taxis at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates with its pogo gear in place., USAF Initially, the Air Force used T-33 jet trainers to help act as spotters to talk pilots in. The service quickly shifted to chase cars that would speed down the runway right behind the Dragon Ladies and assist with the landing process. The drivers are all U-2 pilots themselves, so they know exactly what factors are at play. The video below offers a look into how U-2 chase car drivers help the Dragon Ladies get back down on the ground. Various makes and models of cars, sometimes derived from police car configurations, have performed this role over the years, including various models of Chargers, which have been in service for years now. Pontiac GTOs , Chevy Camaros, and even a Tesla S , have performed these duties, as well. NASA has also employed at least one Charger to support its ER-2s, which are variants of the spy plane converted to perform scientific and other research tasks. A Ford Mustang chase car the Air Force employed in the case car role in the 1980s and 1990s. These particular cars were based off of the V8 Special Service Package (SSP) that Ford had developed first for the California Highway Patrol., USAF “The chase vehicles we received have no Air Transportability Test Loading Agency certification,” U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Ryan Murray, the 305th’s load planning supervisor, said . “They have no fixed area to be restrained or tied down in the aircraft, so there’s no black and white way on how to transport them. When they arrive to our area like that, they are deemed non-airworthy and that’s when we have to figure out how we can load them safely or we may have to make the call that we can’t load it.” The Air Force’s official news story did not say what aircraft the service intended to ship the chase cars on. There are C-17 Globemaster III airlifters and KC-10 Extender tankers, the latter of which have an important secondary transport capability that you can read about more here , based at JBMDL that could handle the mission. A C-17 Globemaster III from the 732nd Airlift Squadron, one of the units based at JBMDL., USAF As of Aug. 21, the 305th was coordinating with Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA), which is based at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, to get the two cars certified. This has included taking measurements and weights of the vehicles in order to develop a load plan for the vehicles. “We have to do a full inspection of the vehicle to see how much weight is on each individual tire, both axles weighed together, the total weight of the vehicle, ground clearance and check the overhang on the front and rear of the vehicle to see if it can go up an aircraft ramp or not,” Staff Sergeant Murray explained . “Once we have those measurements, an ATTLA engineer takes the info to create a certification on how to move that cargo.” It’s true that airlifting the cars by aircraft, just like airlifting any cargo, is more complicated than just loading them on and tying them down. Loadmasters must ensure the exact distribution of the weight doesn’t dangerously impact the aircraft’s handling and that the vehicles remain firmly in place during flight. A sudden shift in weight could have deadly consequences . That said, it’s not clear why the Air Force doesn’t have standardized loading plans for the Dodges or certifications for these particular cars, or other chase cars, in order to send them overseas. The U-2s generally use a number of well-established operating locations, which would all have equally known demands for chase cars. As noted, the service has been using chase cars to help U-2s land for decades and has been using various Charger models, specifically, for years now. The aforementioned Tesla S supported Dragon Lady operations at RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom in 2017 , though we could not quickly determine its current location and status. “If ATTLA is unable to certify the vehicles for flight, the vehicles may potentially be shipped by boat or sourced at the end destination,” the Air Force said in its story. This raises additional questions about why the service is even shipping these cars to RAF Mildenhall, at all. We don’t know how much it might cost in the end to put the Chargers through the certification process and the total expense the Air Force will incur to fly them to RAF Mildenhall, but we can estimate the basic cost of the flight from New Jersey to the United Kingdom, which would be around eight hours long. The cost per flight hour to operate various Air Force aircraft fluctuates due to a number of factors, but, as of 2013 , it was $23,811 for the C-17 and the $21,10 for the KC-10. Use the larger C-5 Galaxy at that time ran $78,817 per hour. This means the flight alone would cost about $190,000 at least just to get the cars to RAF Mildenhall, plus nearly an equal amount for the airlifter to return to the United States afterward. This could be offset to some degree if there is cargo that could be flown on the return leg, though. There’s no requirement for the Chargers specifically to perform this function. As noted, various other vehicles have met the performance requirements necessary to act as chase cars and could accept the other requisite modifications, including installation of various radios, necessary for this mission. The Air Force has said itself that it could source vehicles in the United Kingdom if it comes to that. A pair of Pontiac G-series chase cars next to a U-2 spy plane at Osan Air Base in South Korea in 2015., USAF It is possible that RAF Mildenhall, specifically, doesn’t have chase cars in place, but U-2s do regularly visit RAF Fairford. This brings up the question of why there isn’t a permanent fleet of chase cars available in the country already, part of which could be temporarily redeployed to RAF Mildenhall, or why the Air Force doesn’t just send them to Fairford as usual. It seems difficult to believe that these bases, which have motor pools, would find it difficult to maintain a small fleet of appropriate cars to support Dragon Lady operations, as necessary. Having fleets of chase cars in place at any established base that is at all a regular U-2 deployment location would certainly seem more cost-effective than having to fly in chase cars to these locales constantly or even sporadically. This could also be particularly important in the future if there is a need to rapidly deploy or reposition U-2s to meet operational demands, but airlift assets are strained or otherwise prevented from reaching forward-deployed sites. We will have to wait and see when and if the Air Force does get the two Chargers certified to fly to the United Kingdom. Depending on how long it takes, especially if they can’t get approval, it will only underscore the question of whether it would have made more sense just to buy suitable vehicles there in the first place. A Charger Police Interceptor sells for roughly $33,000 to $40,000 in the United States. With chase car modifications, let’s say the cost is $45,000 per vehicle. That means that a fleet of four vehicles could be bought and stationed in the UK for the estimated price of just the inbound leg of the proposed mission, based on generalized figures. Certainly, there are similar off-the-shelf vehicle options available in the United Kingdom, too. It sounds so grossly illogical and wasteful that only the Department of Defense could come up with such a rationale to support it. At the very least, it seems like a case of remarkably poor planning. Then again, maybe there is something we are missing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Russia Changes Position On Radiation Leaks Again Weeks After Nuclear Missile Explosion,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s state environmental monitoring agency has acknowledged the presence of four radioactive substances in Severodvinsk, a city less than 20 miles from the site of a still very mysterious explosion during the test of an unspecified nuclear-powered missile. The new details continue to suggest the incident was related to the development of the nuclear-powered cruise missile Burevestnik , but they also raise further questions about how transparent the Kremlin is being about the scale of the accident that killed at least seven people. Personnel from the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia, better known by its Russian acronym Roshydromet , took water samples from areas near Severodvinsk between Aug. 10 and Aug. 23, 2019, and found traces of the radionuclides strontium-91, barium-139, barium-140, and lanthanum-140, according to a statement . These substances experience fast radioactive decay and the press release indicated that the brief spike in ambient background radiation that Severodvinsk authorities reported after the missile test accident was attributable to inert gasses released as a result. The incident itself occured on Aug. 8, 2019, at a missile test site adjacent to the village of Nyonoksa, approximately 18 miles to the west of Severodvinsk and The War Zone has been following the steady trickle of new information that has emerged since then very closely . This statement would seem to contradict the Russian Ministry of Defense’s initial reports that the accident had not resulted in any radiation leaks whatsoever. Officials in Severodvinsk had subsequently retracted their statements about increased background radiation. A map showing Nyonoksa, marked at left, and Severodvinsk, at right., Google Maps Since the accident, however, Russia has admitted that the system it was testing was a nuclear-powered missile and that it contained a nuclear “ isotope power source ” at the time of the explosion. However, Russian officials have blamed the explosion itself on a non-nuclear liquid-fueled rocket motor. The Kremlin has publicly acknowledged the development of Burevestnik , also known to NATO as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, but has not officially confirmed it was testing that system in Nyonoksa earlier this month. However, the evidence that has emerged so far has only continued to point more and more to this nuclear-powered cruise missile being at the center of the accident. You can read more about what is publicly known about Burevestnik and its development in these past War Zone stories . The radionuclides that Roshydromet found strongly point to whatever the system was having a true nuclear reactor as part of its propulsion system. Experts had previously considered whether the missile might have had a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), a sort of nuclear battery that converts the heat from radioactive decay into electric power. “These specified radionuclides rule out, to some extent, the possibility of an RTG,” Andrei Zolotkov, a Russian chemist with extensive experience with nuclear reactors from 35 years of working on the country’s nuclear icebreaker fleets, told The Guardian . “Usually, an RTG uses just one radionuclide, and during its decay, and it cannot produce these kinds of isotopes.” Strontium-91, barium-139, barium-140, and lanthanum-140 are relatively uncommon, but could come from the operation of a nuclear reactor using a traditional nuclear fuel source, such as uranium-235. However, these types of fission reactions typically produce cesium-137, which the Russian government says it has not yet seen in elevated levels. The Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (NOSAR) said it had detected elevated levels of radioactive iodine after the accident, but could not conclusively link that to the explosion. Zolotkov told The Guardian that the new disclosure from Roshydromet would mean that the missile contained some kind of novel reactor design or that the Kremlin is still not providing a full accounting of the situation. The former is certainly possible. For the final Burevestnik design to be reasonably small in size, it would need a highly compact nuclear reactor , which could be an experimental type itself. Some have posited that the initial reports of the missile’s propulsion system using a “liquid fuel” might be referring to a liquid fuel reactor of some kind. At the same time, there has already been evidence that the Russians are at least trying to heavily control the flow of information surrounding the accident, if they’re not looking to cover it up entirely. There had previously been indications that the Kremlin was deliberately shutting down environmental monitoring stations that could collect further data regarding radiation leakages. One of the doctors who treated individuals injured in the accident reportedly ended up with cesium-137 in his system, as well. Russian authorities posited that this individual had become contaminated after eating “ Fukushima crabs ,” a reference to seafood that might have become contaminated after the near-meltdown at the Fukushima Daini nuclear powerplant in Japan in 2011 following the catastrophic Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami . Before that, there had been unconfirmed reports of significant cesium-137 contamination at the Arkhangelsk Regional Clinical Hospital, after doctors and other staff treated patients from the accident site without receiving any warning about possible radiation exposure. A purported medical report has now leaked saying that at least one individual who came to the hospital from Nyonoksa was suffering from acute radiation sickness. There were subsequent reports that at least 10 employees from the hospital in Arkhangelsk, along with a number of injured individuals, had then moved to the Federal Medical Biophysical Center in Moscow. There has been no clear confirmation that radiation exposure was the cause of any of the seven deaths as a result of the accident. Individuals at the site of the explosion reportedly suffered severe burns and other trauma, as well. On Aug. 13, 2019, Russian officials had also curiously announced that they would briefly evacuate Nyonoksa the following day, before abruptly canceling that plan . It is still unclear whether that evacuation was related to the nuclear-powered missile accident or another scheduled test at Nyonoksa that subsequently got aborted. Much about the accident itself remains unclear. Satellite imagery shows that whatever missile the Russians meant to test was on a launcher on a barge right off the coast of Nyonoksa in the White Sea. Pictures have since emerged purportedly showing extensive damage to that platform, but offering no real details beyond that about the missile itself. A second barge also appeared to be involved in the test and suffered less obvious damage. A purported picture of the two barges involved in the nuclear-powered missile test, including the heavily damaged one at right., via East2West News Another picture showing the barges at what looks to be low tide., via East2West News In addition, NOSAR has also said that there appeared to be two distinct explosions and that seismic monitoring stations only detected one. It’s unclear if this might mean the second one occurred in midair, raising additional concerns about the spread of radioactive material. NOSAR also said that it is possible this second event was unrelated to the accident in Nyonoksa and might have been tied to mining activity in neighboring Finland. The Kremlin has historically been very tight-lipped about major military accidents , and ones that involve the risk of traditional leaks , in particular. For instance, very little remains known about a separate fire aboard the top-secret nuclear spy submarine Losharik , which occurred on July 1, 2019. The boat was attached to a larger nuclear-powered mothership submarine, the modified Project 667BDRM Delfin -class ballistic missile submarine BS-64 Podmoskovye , at the time. It remains unclear how much risk there might have been to the reactors on either submarine. At the same time, Russian authorities have found themselves increasingly compelled to release additional details about the Nyonoksa incident, the response to which has drawn repeated comparisons to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986 in what was then Soviet Ukraine. A critically-acclaimed HBO dramatic mini-series thrust the Chernobyl case back into the public consciousness earlier this year. It also drew criticism from Russia, which says it will now produce its own show with an “honest” accounting of those events, centered on a conspiracy theory that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was involved in its production. In the nearly four weeks since the accident, the Kremlin has steadily disclosed additional information about the incident and has now contradicted its previous assertion that there were no radiation leaks at all, though it now maintains that the radionuclides that did escape are not a cause for concern. It will be interesting to see if and how the official line continues to evolve if it becomes any harder to deny key details about what happened in Nyonoksa.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 27, 2019",Russia’s Sukhoi Shows Off Stealthier Vision For Its “Hunter” Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The existence of Sukhoi’s S-70 Hunter-B (Okhotnik-B) unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) is among the biggest military aerospace developments to come out of Russia this decade. The aircraft initially appeared in a flyable form back in January , with its first flight occurring in early August. One of the biggest questions surrounding the large flying-wing drone is just how stealthy will it actually become. As it sits now, it has major design issues that preclude it from offering all-aspect low-observability. You can read our full analysis on this topic here . But pictures The War Zon e has obtained from the Sukhoi pavilion at Russia’s biennial MAKS air show and weapons expo on the outskirts of Moscow show us what the company envisions the Hunter to finally look like once it fully matures. The photos of the model depict an evolved Hunter that is devoid of the multiple antennas, small air inlets and exhaust vents, air data probes, and other structures that currently pockmark its skin. This is not all that surprising as it is common to fit those systems in the most reliable and easiest way possible for a stealthy drone’s early development. America’s X-47B also had a similar configuration in this regard and its production version would have been significantly modified to maximize low-observability. Still, actually realizing the migration of these essential systems into low-observable apertures concealed below the aircraft’s smooth skin or mounted conformally within it requires a whole other level of material science and engineering know-how. Courtesy of Michael Jerdev/@MuxelAero The company’s Su-57 fighter, which you can read our full analysis on here , does show some expertise in this regard, but for an unmanned system that has to reliably communicate with other aircraft at the least, and beyond-line-of-sight via satellite data-link if it is to realize its full potential, is an extreme challenge. The United States has spent decades and untold sums of money to come up with solutions to these problems and master their execution materially. The same can be said with the biggest and most important change from the flying Hunter to what is seen on this display model—its exhaust. Currently, the drone has a miserable propulsion arrangement when it comes to low-observability. The rear of the flying prototype is far from refined in terms of stealthiness in regards to both the radio frequency and infrared spectrum. The rear aspect of Sukhoi’s Hunter UCAV. , Russian social media The aircraft appears to be fitted with an AL-31 turbofan engine that comes from the Su-27 family of fighters, with minimal refinement. Once again, you can read our full analysis of this configuration here . So, at the moment, Russia’s Hunter design is far from realizing the low-observability it seems to aspire towards, but now we know that Sukhoi is not only aware of this, the company hopes to fix it as the aircraft moves forward in development. Courtesy of Michael Jerdev/@MuxelAero This is a major admission. The firm’s Su-57 never really ended up getting its own propulsion arrangement refined to a point where low-observability was optimized to any major degree. This is not just about the conventional rear nozzle and engine nacelle configuration, but also the fact that its fan faces are exposed to radar from certain forward aspect angles. Baffles over the engine fan faces, such as those found on the Super Hornet, can attenuate some of the area’s radar reflectivity, but a true hidden engine face via serpentine duct designed with low-observable structures concealed beneath its smooth walls is ideal. Hunter, as it sits now, also may have this issue, but it looks like the inlet is also supposed to be revised significantly, according to the model. Courtesy of Michael Jerdev/@MuxelAero One of the hardest things to do design-wise on a low-observable aircraft of any type, and especially a flying wing, is to create an exhaust that is stealthy in terms of radar signature, while also working to minimize infrared signature. Starting with a platypus like configuration, where the exhaust isn’t directly exposed to most line-of-sight aspects, is key. This is especially true from lower hemisphere viewing angles. Extending a deck area out from the exhaust masks the core of its heat and radar signature from most viewing aspects aside from directly to the rear and can even play a role in cooling the exhaust emissions. The B-2 , Tacit Blue , X-47B , Bird of Prey , F-117 , X-45C , and YF-23 all use this design element. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B. , USN In this case, the S-70’s exhaust is most reminiscent of the one found on the X-45A demonstrators that largely paved the way for American UCAV development, that is before the vast majority of those initiatives strangely evaporated. You can read all about the X-45A and America’s mysteriously missing UCAVs in this past special feature of mine . X-45A on a test flight in the early 2000s. , Public Domain Of course, this is just a model. While it is indicative of what Sukhoi is thinking, the question of if they can actually realize such a vision remains to be answered. Once again, the material science and construction capabilities needed to pull this off are quite advanced. We have not seen anywhere near this level of low-observable sophistication on the Su-57, an aircraft that has been in development for nearly a decade. Courtesy of Michael Jerdev/@MuxelAero Something else should be noted here, as well. It is all but fact that the Russians were able to examine the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone that fell into Iran’s hands in 2011. Regardless of the RQ-170’s sophistication, there is some Skunk Works magic packed into that aircraft. At the very least, it represented a low-observable flying wing design with all the sensors, apertures, flight control concepts, communications systems, hardware, and exhaust configuration that go into it. Such an opportunity represented a near-instant leap forward when it came to understanding stealthy flying-wing unmanned aircraft design philosophy. Yet examining something or attempting to reverse engineer it, doesn’t mean the technology transfers in a timely manner. Knowing how something works is one thing. Being able to actually reproduce it with organic industrial capabilities is another thing entirely. There is also the coatings issue. Radar Absorbent Material (RAM) has a huge impact on a stealthy aircraft’s signature beyond its shape. Russia still has a lot prove in this regard. Courtesy of Michael Jerdev/@MuxelAero Regardless, we now know that Sukhoi is not looking for a uniquely Russian ‘balanced’ approach to low-observability with their Hunter drone. They aspire to field a very low-observable design, one that can make up for some of the stealthy shortcomings of its Su-57 counterpart—an aircraft it is supposed to work directly with in the ‘loyal wingman’ role. This synergistic strategy actually makes a lot of sense and it will tightly bind the Su-57 and S-70 together in the future as the technology matures. It could also become an attractive export option for countries looking for an updated fighter and a stealthy, deep penetrating capability. Neither Su-57 or S-70 can provide both, but as a team, they can offer a relatively flexible solution. That is if Sukhoi can actually turn the Hunter into the ghostly craft they now clearly envision it to be. Author’s note: A big thank you to Michael Jerdev for providing these great photos.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 1, 2018",Check Out This F-35 Helmet Display Video Of A Rolling Landing On The HMS Queen Elizabeth,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35’s Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) is one of the most interesting features on the entire jet. By seamlessly projecting imagery from cameras distributed around the exterior of the aircraft into the pilot’s visor, they can “see-through” the aircraft’s structure. The clip below shows a pilot landing aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth during trials. Not only is it interesting to see what a real Shipborne Rolling Vertical Landing, or SRVL, looks like from the pilot’s point of view, but it shows how the HMD projection from the Distributed Aperture Systems (DAS) allows the pilot to look right through the canopy rail. Here’s the video of the aircraft’s “virtual heads up display” in action during an SRVL approach: The Queen Elizabeth’s ample deck size allows for these 57 miles per hour rolling landings that provide a larger recovery weight margin for the F-35B, as well as other flexibility when it comes to ease of efficient operations for the ship, fuel savings, reduced wear and tear on the aircraft’s propulsion system and the carrier’s deck, and more. You can read all about this maneuver, its utility, and its implications in this past article of ours. The fascinating footage also shows what the pilot sees in their HMD when it comes to symbology. In the bottom left corner, the power output of the F-35’s lift-fan and maneuvering rear nozzle appears to be shown. You can also see how the pilot is supposed to put a secondary vector symbol on the bracket for the perfect precision landing. This bracket is also marked by the red centerline deck lights. Here is a video of the same operation and HUD symbology from the simulator: In another past piece of ours , we featured a clip from the F-35’s HMD showing a nighttime vertical landing aboard an American Amphibious Assault Ship. You can see the virtual HUD and how it snaps into place digitally when the pilot looks forward. There were remaining issues with the helmet-mounted display during these delicate operations that are apparently sorted out or that Lockheed says it will sort out soon. The HMD as a whole has been a constant source of frustration for the program, but similar technology is now proliferating to other platforms and vehicles, just as predicted . HMS Queen Elizabeth is going to head to sea with F-35Bs that belong to the United Kingdom, as well as a contingent of helicopters within weeks. The multi-month-long deployment will mainly take place off the coast of the United States, where USMC F-35Bs will also operate from her deck as part of a larger developmental mission. If we are lucky, we will get more clips from the pilot’s HMD perspective to garner a better understanding of its capabilities and how it interfaces with the pilot under different conditions and in different modes.

The decision comes amid growing international criticism of how the Bolsonaro Administration had been handling the crisis, which is also impacting neighboring countries. This has notably prompted Bolivia to lease the world’s only 747 Supertanker, the world’s largest firefighting aircraft , which arrived in that country today to help combat the blazes. Bolsonaro made the announcement on Aug. 23, 2019, a day after holding an emergency cabinet session, but offered little detail about what military forces might end up deployed to support the firefighting efforts at that time. Later in the day, he said the military would “ act strongly ” and deployments would begin on Aug. 24, 2019. Since Jan. 1, 2019, there have been more than 75,000 recorded wildfires across Brazil, a more than 80 percent increase over last year. This is also more than the total number of blazes in 2016, when drought fueled a particularly bad fire season. Many of the fires currently raging in Brazil are in that country’s portion of the Amazon , which accounts for 60 percent of that Amazon Rainforest’s total area. “The protection of the forest is our duty,” Bolsonaro said . “We are aware of that and will act to combat deforestation and criminal activities that put people at risk in the Amazon. We are a government of zero tolerance for crime, and in the environmental field it will not be different.” A map showing thermal hotspots indicating the presence of fires in the Amazon region in August 2019., Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS, USDA, USGS, AeroGRID, IGN, and the GIS User Community / NOAA, Esri / World Wildlife Fund (WWF) / Esri, Garmin, FAO, NOAA via AP Though Brazilian authorities have not said what military units might be headed to help battle the fires raging in the Amazon, the country does have a dedicated Military Firefighters Corps . This is a reserve component adjacent to the country’s Army, which has some 50,000 members spread across Brazil’s states. These units have specialized equipment and could receive orders to pool their resources to better respond to priority areas. Brazilian military firefighters on parade in 2009. , Jônatas B. Theodoro via Wikimedia The country’s active Army might also deploy military engineering units, which are often well suited to performing certain firefighting tasks, such as creating firebreaks and otherwise clearing debris. Ground forces have access to tactical trucks and other vehicles that would be valuable to move personnel, equipment, and supplies into more remote areas. The Brazilian Navy and Marines Corps also have amphibious vehicles and riverine and landing craft that could perform similar functions in inland waterways, such as along the Amazon River and its tributaries. Brazil’s Army, Navy, and Air Force, all have fleets of helicopters that could carry “ bambi buckets ” to conduct water bombing missions in remote or otherwise hard to reach areas, as well. Maybe its armed services’ most powerful firefighting weapon, the Brazilian Air Force has a limited number of Modular Aerial Firefighting Systems (MAFFS) that convert its C-130 Hercules airlifters into water bombers. You can read more about MAFFS in this past War Zone story . “Whatever is within our power we will do,” Bolsonaro said on Aug. 23, 2019. “The problem is resources.” A Brazilian C-130 demonstrates the MAFFS., Brazilian Air Force Unfortunately, as Bolsonaro noted, it remains to be seen whether Brazil can quickly put together the necessary resources to respond to the crisis, which is so extensive, some of the fires are readily visible from space. Brazil already lost 1,330 square miles of Amazon Rainforest – an area larger than the state of Rhode Island – to fires in the first six months of 2019, according to The New York Times . “It’s impossible to be everywhere at the same time,” Coronel Demargli Farias, the chief of firefighters in Brazil’s Rondônia state, also said on Aug. 23, 2019. “Even if we had 50,000 men.” Brazil could appeal to the international community to provide additional firefighters and support, but it might find that other countries are facing similar problems. The U.S. Air Force has its own C-130s equipped with the improved MAFFS II system, which you can read about more here , but would have to balance any requests for assistance against the potential demand domestically. The United States is in the middle of its own fire season. On Aug. 23, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump did say that “we stand ready to assist” in a Tweet that was otherwise supportive of Bolsonaro. This year has been especially bad for fires across Europe and into Asia, with Russia, in particular, finding its own resources stretched thin. This has also put high demand on commercial aerial firefighting companies, who may not have assets available to take Brazilian contracts. Case in point, a day before Bolsonaro announced his intention to deploy the military to help battle the fires, Bolivian President Evo Morales announced he had leased the 747 Supertanker Very Large Aerial Tanker ( VLAT ) aircraft from Global SuperTanker Services in the United States. Bolivia, which is significantly smaller than Brazil, is in the midst of its own fire-related crisis, having lost forests across an area roughly the size of the state of Delaware to blazes so far. “We believe that with this plane, we can put out the fire,” Bolivian Defense Minister Javier Zavaleta said on Aug. 22, 2019. Again, the aircraft, which landed in Bolivia today and can carry an impressive 18,600 gallons of fire retardant chemicals or water on each run, will certainly help, but it cannot fly missions everywhere at once. Also, these huge tanker aircraft are especially well suited for containing fires, not putting out large ones that are already burning. Aerial water bombing, as well as other direct firefighting activities, also require significant additional support capabilities to be truly effective. Expert command and control, intelligence gathering, and spotters in the air and on the ground are all necessary components that Brazil will have to either provide itself or try to source from elsewhere. At the same time, Bolsonaro, who has steadfastly described the fires as a purely internal matter , may also find asking for help to be politically fraught as he has received significant criticism, coupled with threats of economic action, over his response, or lack thereof. The hardline rightwing President has gone so far as to blame environmental groups for starting the fires deliberately to smear him, a claim he has provided no evidence to support. The Brazilian President is on record decrying environmental restrictions on developing the Amazon were impediments to economic growth in many of the country’s industries, including farming, logging, and mining. Humans do seem to be responsible for the bulk of Brazil’s current fires, through accidents and deliberate action. Environmental activists have cited Bolsonaro’s policies as emboldening ranchers , in particular, to extend their efforts to slash and burn the rainforest to clear more grazing land, which has been a source of many of the fires. Bolsonaro had previously dubbed himself “Captain Chainsaw ,” though he says that was in response to what he claimed were inaccurate deforestation figures. The Brazilian President also fired the director of the National Institute of Space Research after they released satellite imagery and accompanying data proving there had been a noted rise in slashing and burning earlier in the year. A satellite image showing areas of what appears to be systematic deforestation (lighter green) and fires (red/orange and blue smoke) in Brazil’s Rondônia state as of Aug. 11, 2019., Pierre Markuse via Flickr “Our house is burning. Literally,” French President Emmanual Macron wrote on Twitter on Aug. 22, 2019. “The Amazon rain forest – the lungs which produces 20% of the planet’s oxygen – is on fire.” The French government has been a particularly notable critic of Bolsonaro’s and has now withdrawn support from a European Union trade deal with the South American economic bloc Mercosur, of which Brazil is a part. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has since warned that his country could follow France if Brazilian authorities did not take greater action. Germany and Norway are also withholding financial support for the Amazon Fund, which supports preservation initiatives with regards to the rainforest. If Bolsonaro does finally ask for help, it may be impossible for the international community to ignore the crisis, though. As Macron noted, the Amazon as a whole helps process a significant amount of the carbon dioxide produced in the world, generating oxygen in return. Loss of significant parts of the rainforest could also have major enduring negative impacts on animal and plantlife biodiversity. “There are large negative consequences for climate change globally, as the fires contribute to carbon emissions,” Robin Chazdon, a University of Connecticut professor emerita who worked on tropical forest ecology, told NBC News . If Amazon is “not allowed to regenerate or be reforested, they will not be able to recover their high potential for carbon storage.” “These massive fires burning now reduce the resilience of the Amazon forest to future droughts and climate change at the same time that this forest is needed to mitigate against these threats,” Chazdon added. “Protection and restoration of the Amazon forest has never been more urgent.” “If we kill enough forest, we may be tipping the Amazon into a new, much drier state, and it may turn into a savanna,” Roel Brienen, who is presently a professor at the University of Leeds in England and has spent over 15 years studying the Amazon basin, also told NBC News . “This would be a great loss to our planet and almost means game over for our battle against climate change.” Sending in Brazilian military units could certainly give a much need boost to the firefighting efforts, but it remains to be seen how much of an impact they will have and how long it will take them to make their presence fully felt. Whether or not Bolsonaro likes it, the crisis already appears to have global ramifications and the international community should be ready to step up to help avoid an even greater catastrophe given how limited the Brazilian response has been so far. Editor’s note: It’s always a good time to help out! Donating a few dollars to the groups like Global Wildlife Conservation , Rainforest Action Network , and the Rainforest Trust can help preserve and protect the awesome wilderness and the animals that call it home in the Amazon and other locales around the globe.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 22, 2019","It’s Official! Trump Admin Sends Taiwan F-16 Deal To Congress, Here’s What’s In It (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Trump Administration has officially sent an $8B deal to supply Taiwan with advanced Block 70 F-16s to Congress. The potential sale is something we have tracked very closely over the last year as it is sure to infuriate China who has made it clear that such a deal would be crossing an unprecedented “red line.” Of course, all this comes during a brutal trade war between the U.S. and China that is beginning to spill more heavily into other geopolitical arenas—a possibility that has been a major concern of some analysts who fear it could eventually lead to a military standoff or even an armed conflict. You can read all about these tertiary issues related to the deal in our most recent piece on it linked here . Regardless, here is what Taiwan would be getting for $8B if the sale moves ahead. The deal would primarily include 66 new-build Block 70 F-16C/D Vipers. Here are some of the highlights from the detailed list provided by the State Department: Nine spare General Electric F110 engine—Interesting that Taiwan is choosing GE F110 engines over Pratt and Whitney F100s. Their current fleet of F-16A/B/V aircraft use P&W F100s like all F-16A/Bs. 75 AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam AESA radars 120 ALE-50 towed decoys 75 AN/ALQ-211 A(V)4 Airborne Integrated Defense Electronic Warfare Suites 27 JHMCS II or Scorpion Helmet Mounted displays with night vision compatibility—Odd just 27, but they are probably already getting units for their upgraded F-16Vs 70 Night Vision Devices [goggles] 20 ground debriefing stations Supposed F-16 Block 70 for Taiwan configuration. , ROCAF In addition to this gear, there are varied small lots of fuzes and components for JDAMs and laser JDAMs, and a small number of actual JDAM kits are included, too. These are likely to be used for testing purposes. The rest is pretty much everything you would need to operate new F-16s, from training, to spares, to support, to expendables, such as chaff, flares, and 20mm ammunition. One major thing missing is a targeting pod. This and a large order of precision-guided munitions and missiles will probably be included in a separate deal or they will be shared with the deal already in place for the F-16V upgrade that includes 144 F-16A/Bs already in Taiwan’s inventory. Here is the complete list from the State Department: The State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to TECRO for the 66 F-16C/D Block 70 aircraft and related equipment and support for an estimated cost of $8 billion. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale today. TECRO has requested to purchase sixty-six (66) F-16C/D Block 70 aircraft; seventy-five (75) F110 General Electric Engines (includes 9 spares); seventy-five (75) Link-16 Systems (includes 9 spares); seventy-five (75) Improved Programmable Display Generators (iPDG) (includes 9 spares); seventy-five (75) APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radars (includes 9 spares); seventy-five (75) Modular Mission Computers 7000AH (includes 9 spares); seventy-five (75) LN-260 Embedded GPS/INS (includes 9 spares); seventy-five (75) M61 Vulcan 20mm Guns (includes 9 spares); one-hundred thirty-eight (138) LAU-129 Multipurpose Launchers; six (6) FMU-139D/B Fuze for Guided Bombs; six (6) FMU-139D/B Inert Fuze for Guided Bombs; six (6) FMU 152 Fuze for Guided Bombs: six (6) MK-82 Filled Inert Bombs for Guided Bombs; and three (3) KMU-572 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Tail Kits, GBU-38/54. Also included are seventy-five (75) AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispensers (includes 9 spares); one-hundred twenty (120) ALE-50 towed decoy or equivalent; seventy-five (75) APX-126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (includes 9 spares); seventy­ five (75) AN/ALQ-211 A(V)4 Airborne Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite (AIDEWS) or equivalent (includes 9 spares); EW Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and Standard Electronic Module (SEM) spares; one hundred fifty (150) ARC-238 radios (includes 18 spares); Secure Communications and Cryptographic Appliques including seventy-three (73) KIV-78 cryptographic COMSEC devices, and ten (10) AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loaders (SKLs) for COMSEC; three (3) Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS); twenty-seven (27) Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS) II with Night Vision Device (NVD) compatibility or Scorpion Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker (HOblT) helmet mounted cueing system with NVD compatibility; seventy (70) NVDs; six (6) NVD spare image intensifier tubes; Cartridge Actuated Devices/Propellant Actuated Devices (CAD/PAD); cartridges; chaff; flares; three (3) each DSU-38A/B Precision Laser Guidance Sensor (PLGS) for GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) integration; PGU-28A/B 20mm ammunition; telemetry units for integration and test; bomb components; twenty (20) ground debriefing stations; Electronic Combat International Security Assistance Program (ECISAP) support including EW database and Mission Data File (MDF) development (classified/unclassified); communications equipment; classified/unclassified spares, repair, support equipment, test equipment, software delivery/support, personnel training, training equipment, flight/tactics manuals, publications and technical documentation; bomb racks; Organizational, Intermediate and Depot level tooling; Pilot Life Support Equipment (PLSE); Alternate Mission Equipment (AME); ground training devices (including flight and maintenance simulators); containers; development, integration, test and engineering, technical and logistical support of munitions; aircraft ferry; studies and surveys; construction services; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and logistical support services; and other related elements of logistics, program and sustainment support. The total estimated program cost is $8 billion. Taiwan is getting its entire fleet of 144 F-16A/Bs upgraded to F-16V configuration. This is similar in many respects to the Block 70s they are looking to buy, but not entirely as capable., ROCAF A quote from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the sale was pulled from a Fox News interview and distributed by the State Department. It reads: “The President approved the notice that went up to Capitol Hill on Thursday or Friday of last week so that we could move forward with these F-16 sales. These are deeply consistent with the arrangements, the historical relationship between the United States and China, the three communiques that layer on top of that. Our actions are consistent with past U.S. policy. We are simply following through on the commitments we’ve made to all of the parties.” The official release also included the following talking points: U.S. security cooperation with Taiwan has ensured and will promote peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. Today’s notification is consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, and our support for Taiwan’s ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability. There is no change to our longstanding U.S. “one China” policy based on the Three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act. Statements matter next to nothing in this instance—China is going to be absolutely livid about the deal moving forward and it will be a direct challenge to their own reported ‘red line’ regarding the issue. Certainly, some will see this as leverage, or at least punishment, towards China for not acquiescing to the trade demands of the Trump Administration. While that may or may not be true, now that the deal is officially moving forward, it will be hard to step away from it in the future. Taiwan is certainly staring down a superior foe when it comes to China and its increasing military might. Here a ROCAF F-16A escorts a PLAAF H-6 Bomber., ROCAF Just yesterday , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang warned the U.S. against supplying advanced F-16s to Taiwan: “China has made numerous solemn representations to the US on the sale of F-16V jets to Taiwan… The US has to bear all the consequences triggered by the sale… China will take necessary measures to defend its self-interest based on the development of the situation.” It will be very interesting to see how China responds to this. This deal represents a massive boost to Taiwan’s air combat capabilities, which are already being significantly enhanced by the F-16V upgrade program for their existing Vipers. It should also allow Taiwan to retire some older fighters in the future, such as its Mirage 2000s. Yet above all else, if this deal is realized, it will be a huge victory for Taipei, which has been trying to get approval to purchase new-build advanced F-16s for many, many years. UPDATE: China has issued its first response to news of the deal moving forward, stating that it will sanction companies involved with the agreement. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang stated the following: China will take all necessary measures to defend its own interests, including imposing sanctions on the U.S. companies involved in the arm sales… They constitute severe interference in China’s internal affairs and undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests.” This is likely just the start of China’s response.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",The First Flight Of A Mirage F-1 Belonging To A Private Aggressor Company Has Occurred,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), which is now owned by Textron, has put one of the 63 Mirage F-1s it bought from France into the air for the very first time. To our knowledge, this is the first time an F-1 owned by a private aggressor firm has flown in the United States. ATAC’s biggest competitor, Draken International, has also bought 22 Mirage F-1s , from Spain in their case, to serve as supersonic, radar-toting aggressors to fight against the Pentagon’s air forces. The historic flight took place on August 22nd, at Fort Worth Alliance Airport in Texas. ATAC has called Newport News in Virginia home for roughly two decades, but the firm has built a major operations center in Fort Worth dubbed the Adversary Center of Excellence (ACE). It will be the primary hub for its rapidly expanding private air force that will see tasking all over the country and beyond. Author’s note: Read all about ATAC and its roots in this past feature of mine that ran in Combat Aircraft Magazine nearly a decade ago. Caulun Belcher Images Caulun Belcher Images Caulun Belcher Images The aircraft that flew was a two-seat F-1B. Roughly 45 of the company’s surplus Mirage F-1s will be upgraded with new avionics, radars, and electronic warfare systems. These jets will join the company’s supersonic IAI F-21 Kfirs and Aero Vodochoty L-39 trainers, as well as its Mk58 Hawker Hunters, that round out its diverse fleet. The company’s Mirage F-1s are set to be heavily tasked as the Pentagon’s appetite for contractor aggressor services continues to increase. You can read a bit more about why the F-1 represents such an attractive aggressor to satisfy higher-end, supersonic-capable adversary training in this past piece of mine . In fact, going with upgraded third-generation fighters to replicate fourth-generation adversaries more efficiently has already led to one firm flying F-5s beating out another firm, ATAC, which had proposed using second-hand F-16s for the mission. You can read about the details surrounding this decision here. Although this was just one particular contract, and there are many more with varying requirements , the fiscal value proposition that upgraded third-generation fighters offer may prove to be widely more attractive than the very high-maneuverability and other enhanced performance and capability features that true fourth-generation fighters bring to the table. This could end up placing even more demand on the aggressor Mirage F-1 fleet. Caulun Belcher Images Caulun Belcher Images A huge congrats to ATAC. The company largely blazed the trail for this entire industry and continued believing and investing in the concept when it was far from being widely accepted across the services. That patience and conviction appear to be on the verge of paying off in spades. A huge thanks to Caulun Belcher for sharing his lovely images of the flight with us.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 4, 2020",Has Israel’s Air War On Iranian-Backed Militias Secretly Migrated To Iraq? (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the second time in four days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that his country will strike at Iran’s interests , anywhere , if necessary. This is likely to only fuel speculation that Israel is behind at least four mysterious explosions in Iraq at bases belonging to militia groups known as the Popular Mobilization Forces , or PMF, many of which are Iranian-supported, since July 2019. The PMF’s 12th Brigade has also now released footage of its members trying to shoot down an unknown small unmanned aircraft that its members say was snooping on them at a base in Baghdad, which would at least seem to suggest that someone is flying drones over militia bases. The first unexplained explosion occurred on July 19, 2019, at a PMF base 100 miles northeast of Baghdad, reportedly killing two Iranian personnel . On Aug. 11, 2019, another explosion blew up facilities at Camp Ashraf , some 50 miles northeast of the Iraqi capital, killing one person and injuring at least a dozen more. The next day, another blast occurred at Camp Saqr , also known as Camp Falcon, to the south of Baghdad, killing one civilian and injuring nearly 30 after the initial explosion sent munitions and other debris flying into nearby residential areas. Most recently, on Aug. 20, 2019, yet another possible attack resulted in an explosion at a PMF base adjacent to Balad Air Base , which is also home to the Iraqi Air Force’s F-16IQ Viper fighter jets, located north of Baghdad, causing only some injuries. A map showing the relative locations of the four incidents. Top to bottom: Amerli, Camp Ashraf, Balad Air Base, and Camp Saqr., Google Maps So far, there is still no hard evidence of any group’s involvement in these incidents, which militia leaders have, at times, also blamed on the United States and ISIS. Representatives of the PMF have claimed that drones have been involved on multiple occasions, which has now led Iraqi authorities to ban foreign military aircraft from conducting sorties anywhere in the country without prior approval. The PMF has said it will treat any foreign aircraft flying over its bases without prior notice as hostile , which is almost certainly why 12th Brigade’s members engaged the unidentified drone on Aug. 22, as seen in the video below. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Iran was looking to establish more physical presences in a number of countries in the Middle East, including Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq in an interview late on Aug. 21, 2019, with Israel’s Russian-language Channel 9 television network . The interviewer, Dmitry Dubov, interjected that this could mean Israeli forces were operating in Iraq. Netanyahu then responded generally to say that the country takes armed action against Iran and Iranian-linked groups, as necessary. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan , as well as i24NEWS , subsequently reported that Netanyahu had confirmed Israel had taken action in Iraq against Iranian-backed militias, though this was not what he actually said. Both of those outlets have since taken their stories offline. The Israeli Prime Minister’s comments to Channel 9 were very similar to those he reportedly gave during a visit to Ukraine on Aug. 19, 2019. “Iran has no immunity, anywhere,” Netanyahu said in response to the incidents in Iraq. “We will act – and currently are acting – against them, wherever it is necessary.” However, he never directly confirmed involvement in Iraq and Israel has taken direct action against Iranian interests elsewhere, particularly in Lebanon and Syria . Curiously, these particular comments also did not appear in an official transcript of Netanyahu’s remarks to the press in Ukraine. “What Netanyahu said is only speech, confirming nothing,” Iraqi Security Media Cell spokesperson Yehia Rasool had told Iraqi Kurdish outlet Rudaw on Aug. 20, 2019. “Iraq will take an Israeli statement seriously only if it is released through the Israeli Defense Ministry.” That being said, Israel may be disinclined to offer any sort of confirmation any time soon. Israel remained silent about strikes in Syria for some time though it has since begun admitting to striking at Iranian-linked targets there. Regardless, rumors and speculation about exactly what has caused the four explosions have been swirling since July 19. There have been numerous unsubstantiated claims that Israeli F-35I Adir stealth combat jets or drones have been involved . However, the F-35I lacks a standoff munitions capability and would not otherwise have the range necessary to conduct strikes on Iraq without refueling over a foreign country in between. That could be a complicated proposition . Israel does have other longer-range non-stealthy options , though. One report claimed , without evidence, that the United States had helped bring Israeli unmanned aircraft into Azerbaijan for strikes on Iraq. Azerbaijan is an Israeli regional partner and has bought unmanned aircraft and loitering munitions from Israel, but does not share a border with Iraq. London-based Saudi Arabian-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat reported that an unnamed “Western diplomatic source” had said that the United States and Russia had secretly given their approval to Israeli strikes in Iraq, similar to an arrangement the three parties reportedly have with regards to Syria. Two unnamed “senior American officials” also told The New York Times that Israel was responsible for at least some of the strikes. Other sources have accused U.S. drones of directly carrying out strikes on PMF bases over their ties to Iran given Washington’s own rising tensions with Tehran. The U.S. military has categorically denied any involvement, though this wouldn’t necessarily exclude the possibility that other U.S. government actors might have been involved. Separately, PMF commanders themselves have suggested that at least the Amerli attack might have been the work of ISIS terrorists , who have used small unmanned aircraft to drop munitions on Iraqi forces on countless occasions in the past . The terrorist group has exploited a number of geopolitical disputes in the region to try to regroup and recoup some of its lost strength after years of fighting the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria. There is also the possibility that the incidents may be unrelated to each other and that some of them may simply be accidents. Poor safety standards for the storage and handling of ammunition and other hazardous materials are hardly unheard of, even among larger militaries . In May 2018, the Syrian government notably walked back a claim that one of its ammunition depots had come under Israeli attack and said that the massive explosion was actually the result of an accident. This did not appear to be an attempt to conceal Israeli involvement, given that Syria’s regime blamed attacks before and after that on Israel and that there was clear evidence that Israeli forces were conducting a protracted campaign of airstrikes against Iranian-liked sites in the country. That campaign continues to this day . What has become clear in recent days is that Iraqi authorities, as well as the representatives of the PMF brigades, may not be speaking with one voice on these incidents. Also known as the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), the predominantly Shiite PMF came into being after ISIS blitz into the country in 2014. Two years later, it officially became a component of the country’s armed forces, but individual groups continue to exercise significant autonomy. On Aug. 21, 2019, Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis , the Deputy Chairman of Popular Mobilization Committee, which runs the PMF, described the incidents as attacks and blamed an unnamed “ foreign side ” for carrying them out. Al Muhandis is an Iraqi-Iranian who fled to Iran during Saddam Hussein’s regime and has close ties to the Iranian regime and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis, at right, speaks with Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Quds Force, the division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps tasked with conducting operations outside of Iran, including supporting proxy forces and carrying out clandestine attacks. This photo is from Soleimani’s Father’s funeral in 2017., Fars News Agency He returned to Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion toppled Hussein, only to flee back to Iran in 2007, for fear of arrest at the best of the United States. He returned again after the U.S. withdrawal to lead Kata’ib Hezbollah , one of the most prominent Iranian-backed Shiite militia groups in the country and a group that U.S. government has designated a terrorist organization, which subsequently became a core component of the PMF. On Aug. 22, 2019, however, Faleh Al Fayyadh, the Chairman of Popular Mobilization Committee, said Al Muhandis did not represent the view of either the PMF or the Iraqi government. Al Fayyadh also said that the Iraqi Security Forces had authorized Al Muhandis to make the statement, at all. Faleh Al Fayyadh, at right, with Al Muhandis at a PMF event to honor Iranian fighters who died fighting ISIS in Iraq in April 2019., Ameer Al Mohammedaw/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images It is, of course, plausible that Israel could actually be behind the incidents. As already noted, the Israel Defense Forces have already been very active in striking Iranian-linked groups in Lebanon and Syria. Israel also has a long history of conducting unilateral strikes in other foreign countries when it believes they are absolutely necessary. The Israeli government has made clear on numerous occasions that it sees Iran’s expanding influence in the Middle East as an existential threat. Tehran’s ability to establish a “ land bridge ” from Iran straight to Lebanon through Iraq and Syria, which could support various national allies and non-state proxy groups , is also a known Israeli security concern. At the same time, falsely blaming Israel, as well as the United States, is extremely convenient for both the PMF and Iran, who have competing interests in Iraq and beyond. It also downplays just how serious the continued threat of ISIS really is in both Iraq and Syria. The PMF and its supporters in Iraq’s government have already been able to leverage the situation to essentially close the country’s airspace to foreign military aircraft. This has had an immediate impact on U.S. military activity in the country, something that may also benefit Iran by reducing the ability of the United States to use Iraq as a buffer against Iranian interests. This, in turn, could only further fuel tensions between the United States and Iran, which have been steadily growing all year on a number of fronts , including accusations from Washington that Tehran has been trying to leverage the PMF to launch attacks on American military personnel and interests in Iraq. The US Navy’s Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer , along with other ships, sails through the highly sensitive Strait of Hormuz on Aug. 12, 2019.

LAV-25 light armored vehicles are visible parked on the deck of the ship facing to port and starboard to provide additional force protection against close-in threats, such as small boat swarms ., USN Opposition to the continued presence of American forces has already been building since Iraq’s parliamentary elections in 2018, where a political alliance with long-time anti-American firebrand Muqtada Al Sadr at its head made significant gains. In March 2019, members of that grouping publicly announced their desire to evict U.S. military personnel after President Donald Trump visited the country for the first time, but snubbed Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi. One of The New York Times ‘ sources warned that the incidents could reignite calls for a full U.S. military withdrawal from the country, which also raises questions about how much the U.S. government actually knows about what is going on. Whatever the truth is about these mysterious explosions, the competing claims and apparent divisions within the Iraqi government, as well as the PMF, over these incidents is worrying in its own right. The PMF is a particularly complex issue by itself, with some believing that Al Muhandis is the real power behind the umbrella organization and a direct link between it to Iran. Even before the emergence of the PMF, the Iraqi government had struggled to exert effective control over various Shiite militia groups in the country, which often inflamed sectarian tensions with Sunni Arabs and Kurdish groups. No matter what the reality is, without a definitive official account of what has happened and who is responsible, the incidents could evolve into a far more serious matter with wider-reaching geopolitical implications as all the parties involved throw increasingly serious accusations at each other. At this point, it seems clear that the actual culprit is the only actor with an interest in concealing the origin and reason for these attacks, leaving everyone else with a lot to lose. UPDATE 8/23/2019: On Aug. 23, 2019, the Associated Press , citing two unnamed American officials, reported that Israel was responsible for the July 19 incident in Amerli, which killed two Iranian personnel. However, those sources did not say whether or not Israel had been behind the other three incidents. There will be a “strong response” from Iraq if it turns out that Israel is carrying out strikes in the country, former Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who is now one of Iraq’s three largely ceremonial Vice Presidents, said in a statement on Aug. 23, 2019. Continued strikes “will transform [Iraq] into a battle arena that drags in multiple countries, including Iran,” the politician who is known for his strong Pro-Iran stance continued. “Israel’s intervention into the sphere of our national interests is a declaration of war against Iraq, its people, sovereignty,” Ahmed Al Asadi, an Iraqi Member of Parliament and former PMF spokesperson had also said on Aug. 22, 2019. “The silence on the aggression is not a rational position … We must take measures at the regional and international levels to resist the destruction of our airspace and military capabilities.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",China’s New Amphibious Assault Ship Is A Monster,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The development and fielding of China’s fixed-wing aircraft carriers grab all the headlines , but another class of ship that is currently under construction also deserves international attention. The Type 075 landing helicopter dock (LHD) will be the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) most powerful amphibious assault ship and will usher in a new era of capabilities for the PLAN. As you can see by the images in this article, this ship is remarkably large. Some think it will displace around 40,000 tons, nearly equaling the displacement of America’s own Wasp-class LHD, while others put it a bit lower, between 30,000 and 35,000 tons. Either way, this is an impressive warship that outsizes the vast majority of its international counterparts. These ships—three of which are on order—will become the centerpiece of China’s increasingly concerning amphibious force. These flattops are thought to be able to carry around 30 helicopters of different types, many hundreds of infantrymen and their vehicles, and a pair of Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) craft—the Type 726, which is basically a knockoff of the U.S. Navy’s LCAC —or other assorted landing craft to convey its troops to shore. Once again, we are talking about similar capabilities to the U.S. Navy Wasp class. Type 726 LCAC. , Public Domain Although there are certainly no shortage of rumors regarding the possibility, there is no evidence that any sort of short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fixed-wing jet aircraft is slated for these ships in the near term, although it wouldn’t be surprising if the Type 075 was designed with the potential to accommodate such an aircraft in the future. It is widely understood that China is at least researching how to build such an aircraft. China navy type 075 LHD latest photos pic.twitter.com/4Jzzmot3FM — 龙龑之 (@Loongnaval) August 20, 2019 An interesting graphical illustration of the PLAN's Type 075 showing its current progress (July 2019). via 'baoxiuyuan'/CJDBY-forum pic.twitter.com/kEdjW8NrXm — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) July 5, 2019 These vessels will operate alongside other new amphibious ships, namely the Type 071 amphibious transport dock (LPD) that serve in a similar role as the U.S. Navy’s San Antonio (LPD-17) class. China also has a variety of more traditional amphibious landing ships that remain in service. In addition, the PLAN has a very unique capability in the form of the massive Zubr class hovercraft that move large payloads of armor and personnel rapidly over relatively long distances without the need for any infrastructure to bring it all ashore. You can read all about how China obtained the Zubr class and how its unique capabilities can be put to work suddenly in this past piece of mine. kees torn/wikicommons So, what we are seeing here is China investing heavily to build itself an amphibious capability that is second only to the United States. That is a very big deal considering the country’s controversial strategic and territorial aims. Beijing’s ability to realize an invasion of Taiwan, for instance, would be enhanced significantly by these ships. But the multitude of other disputes over territory, like the one regarding the Senkaku Islands and those over large swathes of the South China Sea, also play into the utility of such a high-end amphibious force. Even China’s increasingly militarized manmade islands could be protected by these vessels and the shock troops and helicopters they hold. They could also be used to rapidly resupply these island outposts during a crisis or when their dock facilities have been destroyed. They also pose a real threat to the primary land holdings of regional competitors, like Japan, or countries that border the South China Sea, in a more traditional conflict. China has also been increasingly focused on drilling to rapidly seize islands, sometimes alongside their Russian allies . These vessels will dramatically enhance their ability to realize such a military action and are ideal for fielding allied forces that could help in doing so. The Wasp class USS Kearsarge . China’s LHDs will provide roughly similar capabilities., USN Yet beyond the region itself, these ships offer true ‘bluewater’ capability. They can deploy over vast distances and sustain operations far from home. Considering China’s increasing military footprint and influence abroad, including the opening of naval bases thousands of miles from Chinese territory, this isn’t all that surprising. Beijing needs a way to protect its holdings and interests far from home should the need arise. Few capabilities are better suited for such a mission than vessels like the Type 075 and Type 071. These ships will also sail with their own heavily armed escorts, as well, protecting them from aerial and subsurface attacks. So, we are talking about the ability to wield serious naval power projection. The first Type 075 looks remarkably complete in recent photos of it being constructed in Shanghai’s Hudong Zhonghua shipyards. I would imagine that it would be ready to be launched by early next year. When that happens, it will be yet another wakeup call for many that China is rapidly expanding the quantity and quality of its maritime capabilities. The fact that they are investing so heavily into amphibious capabilities, in particular, ones that have bluewater reach no less, is an indication not just of China’s territorial ambitions, but also of its global ones, as well.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 25, 2019",The B-2 Bomber Is Still Getting “Game-Changing” Upgrades As Focus Shifts To The B-21,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone recently had a chance to visit Northrop Grumman’s facilities at the Air Force’s Plant 42 complex as part of an event to mark the 30th anniversary of the first flight of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Northrop said it has and continues to leverage lessons from the B-2 program to support work on the new B-21 Raider , but also highlighted how it is still adding “game-changing” capabilities to the existing Spirits, including major upgrades as part of the Defensive Management System Modernization program, as well as improving the processes for sustaining and maintaining the bombers. America’s stealth bombers still have many years of life left in them and will find themselves flying alongside B-21s, at least for a period, as the Air Force begins to take delivery of the new aircraft in the next few years. The B-2’s actual first flight occurred at Plant 42 on July 17, 1989, though the ceremony was on Aug. 20, 2019, more than a month after the official anniversary, due to planning constraints. Plant 42, which also houses Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works and Boeing’s Phantom Works , among other sites, still supports a number of highly classified projects, including the B-21, and remains subject to very tight security. “These engineering frontiers that we’ve taken on with B-2 are setting the course for the B-21,” Janis Pamiljans, President of Northrop Grumman’s Aerospace Systems sector and the company’s Corporate Vice President, said at the event. “While I can’t talk much about the details of the B-21, I can share this with you.” “What we learn on B-2 are finding themselves baselined in the design for B-21 for supportability, sustainability, for mission-capable rate,” he continued. “So we are bringing you the next generation capability. At the end of the day, where the B-2 goes, so goes B-21.” U.S. Air Force Major General James Dawkins, head of Eighth Air Force, the service’s top strategic bomber unit, speaks at the ceremony at Plant 42 on Aug. 20, 2019., USAF Otherwise, Northrop Grumman and the Air Force both declined to add much in the way of additional detail about the B-21 program or the aircraft itself. Northrop representatives did highlight significant new construction at the company’s Site 4 within Plant 42, which is certainly linked to work on the bomber. There has been similar construction at Edwards Air Force Base, where B-21 flight testing is set to take place in the future. Journalists who attended the ceremony were also given a separate tour of a building at Site 4 where Northrop Grumman builds center fuselages for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . This facility uses a heavily automated Integrated Assembly Line (IAL) that increasingly employs high-precision robotics to increase production speed and improve overall quality control, especially when it comes to drilling holes in critical components, such as intake ducts. The U.S. military had publicly complained in recent years about having to reject F-35s for so-called “ quality escapes ,” which includes improperly drilled holes that could have impacted the jet’s stealthy characteristics. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mRe_bjy1FHs Northrop Grumman developed this assembly line infrastructure in cooperation with the U.S.-based aerospace division of robotics company KUKA . In 2016, German-headquartered KUKA sold that portion of the company to Advanced Integration Technology (AIT), after the U.S. government objected to its inclusion in the sale of the overall company to Chinese firm Midea. AIT continues to support the IAL and Northrop Grumman representatives said that they hoped to expand the same concept to other portion’s of the company’s aerospace work. When we asked, they added that the same general methods using enlarged tooling would be able to support production of larger aircraft, but they did not specifically mention the B-21. An additional production line in another building adjacent to the F-35 IAL at Site 4 already supports unspecified “other programs” and may be using similar production technology. In July 2019, U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Stephen Wilson revealed that the service is looking toward the B-21 making its first flight in December 2021. The first examples are expected to enter operational service sometime in the mid-2020s. It seems very probable, if not likely, that some form of risk reduction prototype or test articles have already flown as part of the Raider’s development. Northrop Grumman’s RQ-180 reconnaissance drone may have also served a dual purpose in supporting this development. U.S. Air Force Major General James Dawkins, head of Eighth Air Force, the service’s top strategic bomber unit, declined to comment on whether the first B-21s would eventually have a pilot-optional capability as outlined in the original requirements when we asked him after the ceremony. In the meantime, the B-2s will continue to be a vital component of the Air Force’s strategic bomber force and Northrop Grumman continues to modernize those aircraft, as well as improve the maintenance and sustainment processes to keep fleet going. The stealth bombers are high-demand, but low-density assets that have complex time- and resource-intensive maintenance and logistics requirements. All this contributes to the high operating costs for the B-2, which recent reports say is presently around $122,000 per flight hour. B-2, serial number 88-0329, also known as the Spirit of Missouri, at Plant 42 on Aug. 20, 2019., Joseph Trevithick Each B-2 has to go through a programmed depot maintenance cycle every nine years, which includes a general overhaul and a complete reapplication of the aircraft’s special radar-absorbing material skin and paint job. The bombers used to have to go to the depot in seven-year intervals, but improvements to the specialized coatings and other components have given them extended service life. Robotic tooling to help install parts and apply coatings, which helps improve consistency and quality control, has also contributed to this added flying time between depot visits. Northrop Grumman says the entire depot process takes a year, but that it has been able to speed up the basic work, again through the use of robotic systems. What this means is that the company now includes various upgrade work in each trip to the depot, which helps to reduce costs and improve availability rates. At present, the 19 combat-coded B-2s have a mission capable rate just over 60 percent. An additional bomber is at Edwards Air Force Base in a non-combat test capacity. Two of them, roughly 10 percent of the fleet, are at Plant 42 for depot work at any one time. Past B-2 modernization projects have included new communications equipment and improved avionics . The latest major upgrade effort, which is going on right now, is the Defensive Management System Modernization (DMS-M) program. “By leveraging ‘state-of-the-art’ electronic warfare antennae, processors, controller, and displays, B-2 aircrews will realize unprecedented situational battlespace awareness and dynamic, real-time threat avoidance in the most complex radio frequency emitter environments,” is how the Air Force has described the updates in budget documents in the past. “The inherent increased sensitivity of the modernized DMS over the legacy system, with increased processing power, will build a battlespace picture that could be shared with joint force platforms by onboard communication systems.” It is the “largest major modification to the aircraft ever,” Richard Sullivan, Northrop Grumman’s B-2 Program Manager said at a media round table after the ceremony on Aug. 20, 2019. “It’s a combination of changing the display subsystem … changing the Defensive Management System avionics, changing the antennas – the antenna technology today and the math and the computing horsepower has changed the ability to build things that perform … just a little bit better for penetrating aircraft – and then the software systems. … There’s new software that helps provide pilots better situational awareness.” We asked Sullivan if he could offer any additional about the new defensive suite, but he said he could only describe it as “game-changing.” The public statements on DMS-M focus heavily on improved electronic warfare capabilities, as well as added data sharing with sensors on offboard platforms , to spot, geo-locate, and categorize hostile defensive nodes, including air defense radars. The new defensive systems also have a secondary electronic intelligence capability . The DMS-M upgrades will allow crews to rely less on rigid mission planning and be more readily able to change their routes and tactics on the fly based on situational threat information. Electronic warfare systems will provide an additional set of tools to ensure the B-2s can get to their targets even as potential opponents, especially Russia and China, continue to improve their integrated air defense networks and develop potential countermeasures to detect and engage stealth aircraft. In addition, there has also been talk over the years about adding additional defenses, including hard-kill anti-missile systems, using either physical interceptors or directed energy weapons , on various U.S. military aircraft. Northrop Grumman itself has a patent for an anti-missile interceptor system for stealthy aircraft, which The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. Concept art showing a stealthy aircaft knocking down incoming threats with a laser., USAF There have been some concerns about the DMS-M schedule and the upgrade program might be looking at an eight-month delay due to complications with the software backbone that Sullivan mentioned. At present, Northrop Grumman is only on contract to modify three B-2s as part of the ongoing development of the DMS-M systems and the company could not provide a target date for when bombers with the upgrade would reach an initial operational capability. The first aircraft with the DMS-M upgrades, serial number 88-0329, also known as the Spirit of Missouri, was actually the one on display at the ceremony and is scheduled to head back to duty with the 509th Bomb Wing next month. These upgrades will ensure that the B-2 remains operationally relevant as the B-21 comes online. Northrop Grumman will almost certainly leverage work it is still doing on the Spirits to support the development of the Raiders, too. It is also very possible that the B-21 program, and technologies the company has been developing for it, has been a factor in the B-2 upgrade work, as well. The Air Force says that the Raiders will replace the Spirits eventually, but the transition won’t be immediate and it remains to be seen what that final schedule might look like. Virtually every independent force structure analysis the service has commissioned recently has called for more bombers overall , which might lead to a reassessment of the exact retirement date for the B-2. A commemorative coin from the 30th-anniversary event. At right, one can see the eyes and talons motif associated with the B-2 Combined Test Force . It also has Air Force Global Strike Command’s “Anytime, Anywhere” motto., Joseph Trevithick The B-2s have a service life of around 20,000 flight hours and none of them have flown more than 7,000 hours after more than two decades of active service, according to Northrop’s B-2 Program Manager Sullivan. At this same rate, the planes could fly for another 20 to 25 years before the need for a more extensive structural life extension. Any plans to add more bombers to the overall force could still cause issues for the U.S. government with regards to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, an issue The War Zone has explored in-depth previously . Whatever the case, with all eyes on the B-21 program, it seems clear that even after 30 years, the B-2 remains at the forefront of the Air Force’s combat capabilities. Depending on how force structure and other requirements evolve in the near future, the two bombers may find themselves flying side-by-side for an extended period of time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 18, 2020",Behold The Navy’s New Radar For Nimitz Class Carriers And Amphibious Assault Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A staple feature on Nimitz class supercarriers and America’s “Gator Navy” of amphibious assault ships may begin to disappear in the not so distant future and in its place will be a very different looking system. The AN/SPS-48 three-dimensional air-search radar has been fielded across the Navy for over five decades . Today, a modernized version—the AN/SPS-48G—of the big, square, billboard-like, spinning array can still be found on Nimitz class carriers, San Antonio class landing platform docks, and Wasp and America class amphibious assault ships. But that is slated to slowly change as Raytheon’s new SPY-6V2 radar hits the fleet. SPY-6V2 is a very close relative of the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) system, also known as SPY-6V1, being fielded aboard the new Arleigh Burke class Flight III destroyers . AMDR is made up of 37 individual Radar Modular Assemblies (RMAs) that are basically two foot by two foot active electronically scanned array radar ‘blocks’ that can be easily swapped in and out as needed. This modularity means that the system can also be scaled up or down for different applications with relative ease. AN/SPS-48 has been around a long, long time in various configurations. Now a new kid is in town that will finally replace it., USN Case in point is an outgrowth of this system known as the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) that is being developed for the third Ford Class supercarrier, USS Enterprise (CVN-80). You can read about why the Navy sought a new radar for the Ford class after just two ships had been procured here and here . Each EASR array is made up of nine RMAs. The radar is capable of providing a number of capabilities all at once, including anti-air and anti-surface warfare, air traffic control, and even possibly some electronic warfare capabilities for defensive purposes. The fact that the system is modular means that it will be more easily maintained and thus more reliable than its predecessors. So, it will actually save money over time. In fact, supposedly the EASR is so capable that it can also replace the two dimensional, long-range, L-band AN/SPS-49 radar on Navy flattops that receive EASR. And all this is in addition to offering a big leap in capabilities that AESA technology provides. EASR, which is also referred to as SPY-6, has evolved into multiple variants. SPY-6V3 uses three separate arrays that are flush-mounted into a ship’s superstructure, like the island on the Ford class supercarrier. Another variant, SPY-6V2, uses a single array that spins on a mount like a traditional 360-degree coverage radar system. This configuration still provides full scanning around the ship but doesn’t require three fixed arrays or the areas to mount them. There are some tradeoffs with going from three staring arrays to one rotating one, but for the ships they are destined for, this isn’t that important. It’s also work noting that one would assume the radar could just point in one direction for prolonged periods of time if need be. SPY-6V2 rotating on its base at Wallops Island., Raytheon The SPY-6V2 just successfully executed its first set of complex tests for the Navy. A Raytheon press release on the milestone reads in part: U.S. Navy completed the first system-level tests of SPY-6(V)2, the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar, at the Surface Combat System Center at Wallops Island, VA. In the first test the radar searched for, detected, identified and tracked numerous targets – including commercial aircraft. In a second exercise, the maturity of EASR integration enabled the radar to track multiple targets continuously for several hours during a test event involving another system. … “Moving quickly from radar installation at Wallops Island to ‘tracks on glass’ in less than three months is a major accomplishment,” said U.S. Navy Captain Jason Hall, Program Manager for Above Water Sensors, Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems. “The EASR program is progressing extremely well. We are now one step closer to production and delivering the radar’s unmatched capability to the surface fleet.” … Upon completion of system-level testing in Q4 2019, EASR will shift from the engineering and manufacturing development phase to the production phase. The 1st delivery of AN/SPY-6(V)2 will be to LHA-8, the America Class Amphibious Assault Ship. LHA-8, USS Bougainville, is really a class of her own within the America class. You can read all about the other changes this ship will feature in this past War Zone writeup on it. While amphibious assault ships from Bougainville on, as well as Ford class carriers from Enterprise on, and the Navy’s next amphibious landing docks known as LPD-17 Flight II (formally LX(R)), will all get the SPY-6 EASR, the system is also going to back fitted to existing ships with similar mission sets. Yet another version of SPY-6, the SPY-6V4, is sized somewhere in the middle between EASR and AMDR, with 24 RMAs in each of four arrays. This system is slated to be back fitted into Flight II Arleigh Burke class destroyers, basically slotting into where the current SPY-1 phased radar arrays are installed now. This will give these ships a big boost in capability and reliability without needing to totally rework their superstructures and internal infrastructure. What’s maybe most exciting is that SPY-6V3 is also the primary sensor destined for the Navy’s new frigate, the FFG(X ). The Navy is scheduled to down-select an FFG(X) design very soon, and that semi-off-the-shelf design will be altered specifically to accommodate the three array variant of the SPY-6 EASR. So, when it comes to the SPY-6 and its many derivatives, we are talking about massive commonality across the U.S. Navy’s future fleet of old and new ships. The big classic-looking rotating radars that sit atop America’s flattops are definitely familiar and nostalgic, but this most recent successful test of the SPY-6V2 is a sign of what’s to come. Considering how fast the program has moved along, and clearly, the Navy likes what it sees, legacy radar systems will start being displaced by new technology probably faster than what’s even being envisioned at this time. As such, the cluttered masts of the most powerful of America’s fighting ships will soon look a bit different than they have in the past.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2018",Israeli Forces Accidentally Opened Fire On A Light Plane Flying Over The Golan Heights (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain limited at this time, but the Israel Defense Forces have said that they fired on a light plane flying over the highly tense Golan Heights by mistake. The IDF took to twitter to make a short statement about the incident, stating (translated): An IDF force operating on the Golan Heights identified aircraft suspected of being a hostile aircraft that infiltrated Syria’s surface and posed a real threat, so opened fire on it. After realizing that it was an Israeli civilian aircraft, he stopped the shooting… As part of an aircraft penetration protection procedure, the force in the field is expected to identify and watch over suspicious vessels. This is a serious incident under investigation and its lessons will be learned. Reports are that the aircraft in question was an Italian-built “Texan Evo” type light-sport aircraft with the registration 4X-HYT. Supposedly, it was struck in the fuel tank, but appears to have landed safely. Here is a picture of this aircraft : Israeli government aerospace document Light-sport aircraft are quite small and often share powerplant types with medium-sized unmanned aircraft, so they would even sound like a drone of similar size. Considering IDF forces in the Golan Heights are on high alert for drone incursions from Syria, which have happened multiple times before, some of which have been shot down, one can imagine that it is possible that such a mistake could be made. Iranian and Hezbollah drones have grown increasingly more sophisticated and capable of carrying deadly payloads. So, detecting them and bringing them down as soon as possible is a high priority. Everything from F-16s with Python IV missiles to Apache helicopters using Hellfire Missiles to Patriot surface-to-air missiles have been used for doing so, and ground forces are keenly aware of the threat and the need to mitigate it, too. Israel is a true pioneer when it comes to deadly drones, especially those that are relatively inexpensive and are meant to be destroyed prosecuting their own attacks . These types of capabilities are proliferating rapidly to non-state actors as well as state actors, and launching overwhelming barrages of these types of drones is an emerging asymmetric tactic of choice for nefarious foes, which will make defending against them even harder in the years to come. US Gov map Hopefully nobody was hurt in the mix-up, and certainly, it will be a learning opportunity for the IDF and for pilots that fly in the area. If anything else, it is a stark reminder of how on-edge that region is due in part to the ever-expanding threat of unmanned aircraft. We will update this post when more information comes available. Update: 12:15pm PDT— Here’s an interesting track from just hours ago of the aircraft over the area: Update: 5:11pm PDT— Below is video of the incident.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 7, 2019",Let’s Talk About The Post-INF Treaty U.S. Test Of A Ground-Launched Tomahawk Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For those who think that the U.S. and Russia aren’t about to enter into an accelerated nuclear arms race, today may have been a sobering moment. Just 16 days after the U.S. officially withdrew from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and over three decades after it came into effect under President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. military has conducted a test of what it calls a ground-launched BGM-109 Tomahawk land attack missile. A variant of the Tomahawk known as the BGM-109G Gryphon , along with the Pershing II medium-range ballistic missile , were the backbone of America’s forward-deployed tactical nuclear missile forces prior to the INF becoming a reality. After the treaty was in place, these systems, along with their Russian counterparts, were destroyed. The treaty held firm for decades, before Russia began quietly violating it with development and the eventual fielding of their SSC-8 ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM). Concerns about the system date back over six years. You can read all about the SSC-8 and the depressing scenario the U.S. and Russia have waded into in these past War Zone articles linked here , here , and here . Before its withdrawal from INF, the U.S. had threated to develop its own medium and intermediate-range missiles if Russia did not return to compliance with the treaty. The INF stipulated that signing parties could not possess land-based conventional or nuclear-capable missiles of any kind that had a maximum range of between 310 and 3,420 miles, although there was some wiggle room for very limited testing purposes. Back in March, as the U.S. was threatening to exit the treaty, it was reported that some development and component production of ground-launched Tomahawk land attack missiles were spinning up, although these activities were said to be limited conventionally armed missiles only, not nuclear ones, and event that was likely for testing purposes anyway. Now that the U.S. is free from its treaty obligations, it appears to be very ready and willing to show Moscow that it is not going wait any longer to begin its own testing of what would have been INF-busting weaponry. Hence the August, 18th launch of the Tomahawk cruise missile. To be clear, this missile was launched from a Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cell, just like those found on the U.S. Navy’s most capable surface combatants. There is no clear indication that the missile was anything different than the Tomahawks the Navy currently employs, namely the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk . This is a very different weapon than the Gryphons of 30 years ago. They can be retargeted mid-flight, can loiter, have a far more advanced navigation and terminal targeting system, and can hit moving targets, such as ships . That’s not to say that all of these features would be necessary for a new nuclear GLCM, but it would certainly improve such a system’s flexibility and it could allow for lower-yield warheads to be used against certain targets. The U.S. Navy’s Tactical Tomahawk land attack missile. , Raytheon/Navair So, while this could seem like any Tomahawk test, the fact that it was highly publicized as using the Mark 41 launch system from land is clearly made to irk Russia. America’s Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense sites in Eastern Europe also use ground-based variants of the tried and true Mark 41 VLS. This has led to Russia accusing the U.S. of being able to hide the ability field INF busting missiles on its back doorstep. The Pentagon has repeatedly stated that the VLS canisters used at Aegis Ashore sites have been altered so they cannot accept Tomahawk cruise missiles and even invited Russia to inspect them for verification if they so please—an invitation that has never been accepted, at least as far as we know. MDA With this in mind, there is a clear message being sent here beyond just stating that testing for ground-launched cruise missiles has begun. It plays off Russia’s fears that the U.S. could deploy cruise missiles to its Aegis Ashore sites in the near term or even in other Mark 41 canisters scattered around Europe. This is a much lower developmental bar than designing a new transporter-erector-launch (TEL) and the command and control systems that would have to go with it, let alone a new Tomahawk cruise missile variant or a new missile altogether. The launch occurred from San Nicolas Island , one of two Navy-controlled islands in the Channel Island chain off California’s southern coast that are surrounded by a sprawling test range complex . Video and images from the launch show the weapon being boosted out of its Mark 41 cell. The Pentagon simply stated that it hit a target “more than 500 kilometers away,” which is beyond the INF limitations. INF Treaty being signed on the 8th of December, 1987, at 1:45 p.m., National Archives It’s worth noting that the U.S. could end up developing a new GLCM missile altogether, or adapt another weapon from the Pentagon’s inventory to satisfy the role. That weapon could end up augmenting a ground-launched Tomahawk variant that could be deployed as an interim solution. In particular, the AGM-158 JASSM comes to mind. This very stealthy and smart missile represents cutting-edge cruise missile technology and its low-observability (stealthiness) would certainly trouble Moscow. Still, it doesn’t have the range of the Tomahawk, which can reach out between 800 and 1,600 miles, depending on the variant. JASSM-ER has a range of about 600 miles, although that range could be boosted substantially for a ground-launched, nuclear model. In fact, Lockheed has already developed an extreme-range variant of JASSM known as JASSM-XR , which would suit this role very well. It would supposedly be ready by the first half of the 2020s. JASSM about to obliterate a test target. , Lockheed Martin Another option may be to adapt the Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) air-launched cruise missile that is being developed to equip America’s bomber force through the middle part of the century. This weapon won’t be ready even in its primary form for some time, with an estimated entry into service in 2030, but it could replace or augment the ground-launched Tomahawk when it is. The Pentagon stated that “data collected and lessons learned from this test will inform the Department of Defense’s development of future intermediate-range capabilities,” which clearly doesn’t address any planned role for Tomahawk in the post-INF era. The rapid development of hypersonic weapons by both the U.S. and Russia is also a wildcard in all this. At this time, fielding just a conventional hypersonic weapon is a challenge, but a nuclear-armed hypersonic missile capability is not out of the question in the years to come as the technology matures. Such a system could fill a similar role as the Pershing II medium-range ballistic missile of the Cold War era. So, the big question here is what level of arms race could become a reality in the coming years? The answer to that question is unclear. Some think the SSC-8, and Russia’s development of a menagerie of exotic doomsday weapons , is posturing by Russia so that it can have more leverage in some sort of new negotiated nuclear arms deal. On the other hand, the dissolution of the INF could spell doom to other key arms agreements that have helped maintain a strategic status-quo over the decades. New START, in particular, is incredibly important and is scheduled to expire in 2021. President Trump has made it clear than any future treaty that would replace the INF, and possibly others such as New START, should include other major players like China, in order for it to make sense. Other factors are at play, as well. The end of the INF presents an opportunity for the U.S. to deploy medium-range missiles to the Indo-Pacific region in an attempt to counter China’s rapid military expansion and extra-territorial aims. Newly minted Defense Secretary Mark Esper has stated as much on the record. In fact, he has said that he would like to U.S. ground-based, medium-range missiles deployed to the region in a matter of months , not years. Clearly, the Tomahawk and Mark 41 VLS canisters are the easiest, and possibly the only way to realize such a capability so soon. As a result, this adds some evidence to the possibility that the August 18th test launch of the Tomahawk missile may represent more of an operational vision than not. The SSC-8 is an outgrowth of decades of development dating back to the Soviet Union. It likely has some commonality with the Kalibr sea-launched cruise missile., Globalsecurity.org There is a whole geopolitical Pandora’s Box that goes with potentially deploying land-based medium-range missiles to partner countries in Asia, as well. What countries would even accept them is a huge question mark. But this emerging initiative represents just how much change can come so fast following the end of such a landmark agreement. This test also comes as Russia’s nuclear-powered cruise missile project has been in the headlines for some pretty miserable reasons . It has garnered President Trump’s attention , as well. Certainly, today’s video serves as a reminder that the U.S. is not sitting still when it comes to spinning up its own ground-launched cruise missile efforts and that fielding those weapons could come far faster than many may have predicted. One thing is certain, we have officially entered into a new and far less predictable age where the treaties that underpinned the strategic balance of the past are giving way to the rapid development and fielding of updated nuclear weaponry. We can only hope that all or even some of these developments will be rolled back via a new, wide-ranging weapons treaty as we approach the expiration of New START. But based on what we are seeing, such a proposition looks increasingly like a fantasy.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 18, 2020",There Are More Fighters On This Packed Ramp In Wisconsin Than In Some Entire Air Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An image posted by the USAF shows the apron at Volk Field in Wisconsin during exercise Northern Lightning. It represents a stunning depiction of American tactical jet capability and capacity. In fact, there are more fighters on that ramp than what some air forces have in their entire fleets. In total, there are 46 combat jets sitting on the flightline, ranging in capabilities and performance from AV-8B+ Harriers to F-22 Raptors. The complete list includes: 9 F/A-18E Super Hornets 3 F/A-18F Super Hornets 3 F-15E Strike Eagles 5 F-15C Eagles 8 AV-8B+ Harriers 5 F-35B Lightnings 6 F-16C/D Vipers 3 EA-18G Growlers 4 F-22A Raptors The image was taken during last year’s iteration of exercise Northern Lightning. Check out some other impressive photos from the exercise I dug up: The reverse shot of the top banner image. , Wisconsin ANG Wisconsin ANG Wisconsin ANG Wisconsin ANG On the secondary ramp where the old aircraft barns are, the aggressors lined up. Five USAF T-38As, likely from Langely AFB, and five Draken International L159 Honey Badgers are seen in the image. , Wisconsin ANG The exercise is one of the handful of high-end, large force employment (LFE) training events that the Air National Guard puts on every year. These are commonly revered for the intimate setting and high-quality interoperability training scenarios they offer that range all over the air combat spectrum. A big component of these LFEs is integrating 4th generation assets, like Super Hornets, Eagles, and Vipers, with 5th generation stealthy assets, like Lightnings and Raptors. Because of communications limitations, capability disparities, and performance differences, this can be challenging. So, getting crews familiar with the advantages that each asset brings to the fight, and how to maximize those advantages for the greater good, while also minimizing each asset’s unique disadvantages, is absolutely essential for working successfully as a team. This is not just some Pentagon corporate speak. Literally, the level of familiarity fighter aircrews have with working directly with more advanced or less advanced assets can mean life and death in a real combat scenario where the other side is actually trying to shoot them down. Northern Lightning also has a testing component usually baked into it, as well. Hence why you see F-15s and F-16s from the USAF’s operational test units in the photos. New weapons and systems, and the tactics that go along with them, can be put to the test in LFE scenarios alongside frontline pilots during the exercise to get a better idea of how they will perform outside of a strict developmental environment. The latest iteration of Northern Lightning, the second this year, kicked off just last week and will run through this week. According to a Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs press release , F-35s, F-22s, F-16s, EA-18s, and C-130s will be taking part in this evolution of the drills. It’s also common for outside assets, such as airborne early warning and control aircraft, bombers, and tankers, to fly into the exercise airspace from remote locales for this type of training event. The release states: “Col David May, the commander of Volk Field CRTC, said Northern Lightning offers an unmatched training experience as well as first-class facilities and training areas. “We look forward to another successful Northern Lightning exercise,” May said. “Our Airmen have been working hard in anticipation of this event so that we can continue the tradition of making this one of the best military exercises in the country. Our reputation as the premiere counterland training site, due to relevant training and our ability to blend the live and synthetic domain, has set us up to host an Air Force and Marine F-35 squadron along with dedicated adversary aircraft. They will integrate with the F-22, fourth generation aircraft and ground forces to prepare our military for the next generation of warfare. I am proud of every Solider, Airman, Marine, and Sailor who have made Northern Lightning what it is today.” Pilots and air crews participating in Northern Lightning can expect to operate in a contested environment with adversary aircraft, electronic jamming and simulated surface-to-air threats, and such training is critical to building readiness for the threats and missions the nation faces.” The first Northern Lightning exercise of 2019 took place in May. According to the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs, it saw “350 sorties flown, 400 bombs dropped and approximately 3,000 ground control tasks executed at Volk Field, Hardwood Range, and Fort McCoy.” So, we are talking a lot of flying action emanating from Volk Field, which is located in a somewhat rural area that usually doesn’t hear so much jet noise in such a compressed period of time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MmT5rimoav4 Volk Field is one of the Air National Guard’s Combat Readiness Centers. No aircraft are permanently based there, but many types frequent the installation throughout the year for various training evolutions, both big and small. The installation exists in part due to the ample training airspace nearby where a large spectrum of missions can take place, including live air-to-ground training, as well as air-to-air combat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 16, 2019",This Crazy Blue Flash From A Nuclear Reactor Firing Up Looks Right Out Of Science Fiction,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Twitterverse is a flea market of information. Most of it is junk, but there are some real gems to be found. One such post came through my feed this afternoon. It showed a nuclear research reactor giving off a bright blue pulse of light as it fired up. After the initial pulse, the reactor continued to glow an iridescent blue. The clip looked right out of a science-fiction blockbuster. I noted as much when I retweeted it. Thankfully, I don’t have to explain this phenomenon, the IAEA posted a little video about Cherenkov light and how it is helpful to multiple scientific fields of study: Here’s another video that’s worth watching to give you a little more context: Symmetrymagazine.org also gives a good basic explanation of the Cherenkov light, also known as Cherenkov radiation: “Cherenkov light appears when a charged particle travels through matter faster than light can. This effect is the optical equivalent of a sonic boom, which occurs, for example, when a jet travels faster than the speed of sound. But how can a particle go faster than light without violating the laws of physics? The speed of light in a vacuum is the ultimate speed limit: 300,000,000 meters per second. It’s thought that nothing can travel faster. However, light slows down when it goes through water, glass and other transparent materials—in some cases by more than 25 percent. Hence a particle can slip through material faster than light does, while at the same time staying below the speed of light in a vacuum. When this happens, a particle emits bluish Cherenkov light, which spreads out behind it in a hollow cone that is shaped like the cone of a sonic boom. This light gives the water surrounding a nuclear reactor core its distinctive blue glow. Scientists build telescopes to gather Cherenkov light emitted by cosmic-ray and gamma-ray showers in the Earth’s atmosphere. Neutrino physicists embed hundreds of light-sensitive detectors in large volumes of water and ice to record Cherenkov light from muons and electrons, which emerge when neutrinos crash into atoms. The Cherenkov light recorded with such devices helps scientists identify particles and determine their energies.” The world’s fascination and fear of nuclear applications have entered something of a renaissance recently due to what many would describe as the new Cold War between Russia and the United States, and both countries’ subsequent focus on updating and expanding their nuclear arsenals . Yet what has really elevated this scientific realm within the public’s collective consciousness is the Chernobyl mini-series that premiered last May. Although not every element of the incredibly well-produced show was perfectly accurate, it really seems to have brought concerns surrounding harnessing the atom to a whole new level. Some would call these concerns unfounded, while others say they are anything but. Regardless, this revived interest in all things nuclear manifests itself in many ways, and especially in regards to interest in reports on nuclear accidents, both new and old , as well as interest in more positive articles on what could potentially be an exciting future where nuclear energy production is far safer, cleaner and cheaper than it is today. For those of us who are not nuclear physicists, nuclear radiation and its somewhat surreal effects and byproducts can seem almost like magic. Yet sometimes reality has more in common with sci-fi than one would expect, which seems to be the case with very eerie yet beautiful Cherenkov light.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 9, 2019",Here Is The Lowdown On That F-16 Being Sold In Florida,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Jet Lease, an aircraft brokerage and leasing firm out of Palm Beach, Florida has some exotic aircraft listed for sale on their website, but among the AH-1s, C-130s, UH-60s, and a variety of private jets, the listing for the F-16 is bound to draw the most attention. We reached out to Jet Lease to get all the details on this intriguing offering. They were really enthusiastic about it and about their growing surplus military aircraft sales portfolio. As a result, we learned a lot, paramount of which is that the firm has three similar F-16s that could be sold together to create a private F-16 mini-squadron. These aircraft are F-16AM and BM Block 20 Mid-Life-Update (MLU) jets that are imported from Jordan. That country had bought dozens of second-hand F-16s from America’s NATO allies in Europe—Belgium and the Netherlands—between 2008 and 2017 under the Peace Falcon III to Peace Falcon VI initiatives. They have subsequently been in the process of liquidating some of their older F-16s in recent years, including selling Block 15 F-16s to Pakistan. RJAF F-16s in formation behind a USAF KC-135 during a multi-national exercise. , USAF It’s not totally unheard of for F-16s to be privately traded or used by commercial operators , but these are not the demilitarized warbirds that are usually the playthings of the mega-rich . They are functioning combat aircraft that are marketed to contractor air service providers that provide adversary support and test and development services to the Pentagon, allied governments, and other defense contractors. The buyers must comply with and successfully navigate the strict ITARS ( International Traffic in Arms Regulations ) rules surrounding acquiring and operating a weapon system like an F-16, which keeps these planes out of the hands of those who shouldn’t be able to pull them apart, let alone fly them. So no, this plane can’t really be purchased by some rich dude who is looking for a thrilling alternative to the latest supercar. The primary Viper being listed was built in 1980, but it has been enhanced along the MLU roadmap and has modern features found on many front-line Vipers today. This includes being setup for Link16 data-link and Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), a data-bus for modern guided weapons and other stores, a night-vision compatible cockpit, and so on. The Viper still has its AN/APG-66(V)2 pulse doppler radar, which is a very important feature that we will get to in a moment. It has also received Falcon STAR (Structural Augmentation Roadmap) that will allow it fly to at least 8,000 hours. The jet currently has 6,000 hours on its airframe, so there are many, many years of flying life left in it—I would estimate 10-15 years and that could be potentially be extended further. The jet has an asking price of $8.5M and the other two have a similar starting place for negotiations. In addition, any potential sale could also include spare parts, training, and simulators. So, if an operator wanted the entire F-16 end-to-end package, it seems like it could be worked into a deal at additional cost. The F-16 is really the top-end of aircraft being eyed for commercial adversary support duties as part of the Pentagon’s massive push to drastically expand these programs within the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps—a topic I have been writing about regularly for nearly a decade . The F-16 is incredibly capable and nimble, and while some aggressor outfits tout the capability , it has yet to really emerge operationally. Some key contracts have seen them passed over for less expensive to operate third-generation fighters that sport new subsystems. In particular, modern radar systems and data-links. This was the case in competition between the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) and Tactical Air Support Inc. (TacAir) for ‘fourth generation’ adversary support services at Naval Air Station Fallon . Fallon is the home of Topgun and where a variety of regular exercises occur, including air wing spin-ups prior to deployments, as well as tactics development, and more. You can read all about that contract and why upgraded F-5E/F Tiger IIs beat out F-16s to win it in this past feature of ours. Still, that is just one of many contracts up for grabs that have varying degrees of requirements. The F-16, with its high performance, radar, and data-link capability, satisfies the high-end of those requirements, but its not exactly the cheapest to operate or procure. This reality has led to something of a mad dash to acquire large fleets of surplus supersonic fighters capable of lugging a modern radar system aloft. Eventually, as these older, cheaper airframes, such as Dassault Mirage F1s , IAI F-21 Kfirs , F-5 Tiger IIs , and Atlas Cheetahs are gobbled up, more complex fourth-generation fighters will be in even greater demand. RJAF F-16AM taxiing. , USAF With this in mind, grabbing a trio of F-16AM/BMs that are essentially turnkey and ready to fly may be a highly logical proposition for the biggest adversary support players or even emerging players that are ready to dive in to what is going to be an incredibly active marketplace that will only continue to explode in size over the coming decade. The services simply cannot afford to fly the wings off their fighter fleets—some of which are already quite tired—performing many air-to-air training tasks, a good portion of which don’t require a highly complex airframe. This is especially pointed in regards to the fielding of the F-35 in large numbers—an expensive airframe that is very costly to fly. Using a pair of F-35s for duties like simple intercept training is an absurd waste of money. Even using two Eagles or Super Hornets for that type of mission is wasteful, as well. All told, contractors provide a tailored capability adversary support capability for less money and offer elastic capacity. It’s a win-win for all involved. Also, by mixing in a true fourth-generation fighter capability via a handful of F-16s among third-generation aggressors that emulate some fourth-generation features, more complex threat representations can be offered to customers that more accurately reflect what frontline pilots may actually encounter overseas. This would also take the burden off of the Pentagon’s tired fourth-generation fighter fleet that currently has to provide this level of training. With a data-link, the F-16 can feed its sensor data to assets that don’t even have a radar themselves, which makes for a cost-effective force multiplier for more complex training scenarios. So yeah, these upgraded F-16s, with their AN/APG-66(V)2 radars and other systems in place, really do have a lot to offer. Upgrades for Vipers, including active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar options, can be had from domestic and international suppliers with all of the development dollars already paid for. We are talking about truly off-the-shelf upgrades, including other sensors like infrared search and track (IRST) systems and advanced electronic warfare suites, that can make these F-16s whatever the customer demands them to be. And yes, they could also probably find work in a developmental and testing role, as well. RJAF F-16BM departing on a mission. One of the jets the firm has to sell is a two-seater like this., USAF Finally, supportability shouldn’t be a huge issue. As it sits now, roughly 4,600 F-16s have been built. So, sustaining these aircraft won’t be the nightmare that less prolific 4th generation fighter types may represent. It will be interesting to see who snaps these jets up. Will it be a well-established adversary contractor or one that is trying to break into the marketplace? Time will tell. But the idea of seeing some aggressor Vipers in private hands is truly exciting. Check out Jet Lease at their website linked here and follow them on Facebook here . They really seem to love what they do and they certainly aren’t shy about taking on some very unique projects!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 9, 2019",Taiwan Announces It’s Getting New Block 70 F-16s As U.S. Government Advances Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan’s Air Force has confirmed it expects to buy more than 60 new Lockheed Martin Block 70 F-16C/D Vipers and released an infographic about the fighter jets that says “See you soon!” This comes amid reports that President Donald Trump’s Administration has submitted the proposed deal to Congress for an informal review and approval. Doing this means the U.S. government doesn’t have to formally announce the potential sale, which is still guaranteed to infuriate China and has the potential to scuttle negotiations to end a trade war between the two countries and otherwise inflame tensions. The Taiwanese Air Force included in the infographic in a post on Facebook on August 16, 2019. That same social media post also declared that the United States had agreed to sell Taiwan the advanced F-16s in “Minguo 108,” or 2019. The government on the island uses the Minguo calendar , which starts in 1912 with the founding of the Republic of China, for official documents. Also on August 16, 2019, there were numerous reports , citing anonymous sources , that the Trump Administration had asked the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees to conduct an informal review of the possible sale. News first emerged that the U.S. government was considering selling the fighter jets to Taiwan, something China has said would be crossing a “red line,” in March 2019 . The U.S. State Department has refused to confirm that this process is in motion, saying it doesn’t comment on possible foreign arms sales until Congress has received a formal notification. Typically, this formal alert coincides with a public announcement from the Department of Defense’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which handles foreign military sales requests. After a formal notification, Congress is supposed to have 30 days to approve the deal. It is important to note that this does not guarantee the sale and Taiwan and Lockheed Martin would have to hash out the final terms of the contract. However, the Taiwanese Air Force and a number of members of Congress are certainly treating it as all but a done deal. The Taiwanese Air Force’s “See you soon!” infographic., Taiwanese Air Force The sale is “critical to improving Taiwan’s ability to defend its sovereign airspace, which is under increasing pressure from the People’s Republic of China,” Senator Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement according to Defense News . “Taiwan is a steadfast partner of the United States in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, and the United States remains firmly committed to supporting its defense.” “Hell, I’d like to sell them F-35’s, so the least we could do is sell them F-16s,” Senator Corey Gardner, a Colorado Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee for Asia, said . “It’s the law.” Gardner was referring to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act , which followed the U.S. government’s formal recognition of the government in Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China. Under the law, the United States reserves the right to sell weapons to authorities in Taiwan for the purposes of their defense, as well as maintain diplomatic liaisons with them, until such time as the status of the island is resolved. Chinese authorities see Taiwan as an integral part of the country and have threated military action on numerous occasions if it attempts to declare independence. China criticizes all U.S. government arms sales and other engagements with Taiwan, but has been particularly opposed to the sale of new fighter jets. The Taiwanese Air Force Facebook post notes that it has been trying to acquire new F-16s of any kind since “Minguo 92,” or 2003. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both rejected those requests. The Obama Administration did eventually approve a plan for Taiwan to upgrade its existing fleet of approximately 145 F-16A/B Vipers to the much more advanced F-16V configuration , which is similar in many respects to the Block 70. However, as The War Zone has previously reported, the new build Block 70 jets would give the Taiwanese Air Force a major boost in both capability and capacity. Just like its F-16A/Bs, Taiwan’s other core fighters, including the French-made Mirage 2000 and indigenously built F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo, are rapidly aging and will be in need of replacement. At the same time, China is aggressively modernizing its military as a whole, but has put particular emphasis on developing and new combat aircraft, including stealth fighters , multiple new stealth bombers , and fleets of unmanned aircraft . The upgraded F-16Vs and the new Block 70 Vipers offer Taiwan a qualitative leap over these older aircraft, as well. Most notably, both sets of jets will have Northrop Grumman’s AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), an active electronically scanned array type that will allow pilots to spot and track targets, including stealthy, low flying, and hard to detect ones, at longer ranges and do so more accurately, among other advantages. The Taiwanese Air Force’s infographic shows a Block 70 configuration with conformal fuel tanks , which would significantly extend the aircraft’s striking range and would be valuable for long-duration patrols around the island. They can also increase the F-16’s available weapons stations for many mission profiles. The Block 70 configuration has a number of other improvements that The War Zone has covered in detail in the past. The infographic also shows a Block 70 jet equipped with a new launcher that allows it to carry three AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) on a single pylon, which will help increase its air-to-air magazine depth. This would be a crucial enhancement for attempting to defend the island from an aerial onslaught originating from mainland China. Lockheed Martin first revealed this option in February 2019 as part of its rebranded F-21 proposal for India’s fighter jet competition. In addition, Lockheed Martin displayed a model of a Block 70 F-16 carrying what looked to be an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensor pod at the recent biennial Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition, leading some to believe that either the upgraded F-16Vs or new build Block 70 F-16s for Taiwan might come equipped with that system. The design appears distinct from Lockheed Martin’s Legion Pod , which contains the IRST21 system. IRST sensors offer a valuable alternative and complement to radars when it comes to spotting stealthy aircraft at extended ranges, which could be particularly useful for Taiwan given China’s stealth advances, such as the J-20, which is now in active service in increasing numbers. You can read more about the Legion Pod and IRSTs, in general, in these pervious stories linked here and here . Whatever the exact package includes and regardless of whether the proposed sale is formal or not, China is almost certain to be apoplectic about the deal. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have steadily been rising this year already and Chinese President Xi Jinping has threatened on multiple occasions to invade the island if it appears that the government there is moving toward declaring independence. The Chinese government has branded Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen, who has a very close relationship with the Trump Administration, as an “ independence extremist ” in the past. Recently, she voiced support for protesters in Hong Kong , another semi-autonomous region of China, and described Taiwan as “a democratic country & a responsible member of the international community” in the process. Relations between the United States and China have been frigid lately, as well, primarily due to a trade war, though Beijing and Washington has a number of other ongoing disputes, including over Taiwan and Chinese claims to the South China Sea. It seems very likely that the F-16 deal could scuttle talks aimed at finally ending the trade impasse for the foreseeable future. “We can’t allow that to dictate our foreign policy or dictate our policy toward Taiwan,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said in defense of the F-16 sale. This statement did come after Trump appeared to let trade talks influence the U.S. government’s response to what is happening in Hong Kong, with the President issuing a Tweet in support of Xi and calling on him to meet with the protesters there directly. Before that, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had described the situation in the semi-autonomous region as an “internal matter” for China to solve. China has also reiterated a threat to sanction American companies that sell arms to Taiwan, though this is something it has vowed to do multiple times in the past without following through. Given the state of U.S.-Chinese relations, it is possible that Beijing might actually pursue this course of action this time. At the same time, the United States has imposed an arms embargo against China since the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square and it is unclear how much this might actually impact the companies involved in any F-16 sale. Nearly a decade ago, Lockheed Martin actively pushed the U.S. government to allow it to sell new Vipers to Taiwan, including by arguing that it, unlike Boeing in the United States and aircraft manufacturers in Europe, had no business interests in China that could get upended by the sale. A slide from a 2010 briefing Lockheed Martin gave to Pacific Air Forces, the US Air Force’s top command in that region, regarding possible new F-16 sales to Taiwan. The pitch also warned that if the F-16 production line was allowed to close from a lack of sales, a real concern at the time, the US might have no alternative but to sell Taiwan the F-35 instead., USAF via FOIA There remains a real possibility that the Trump Administration may offer to scrap the F-16 deal as part of its ongoing trade negotiations with China. This would be a big smack in the face to Taiwan, though, and would show on a grand scale that the United States is willing to sell out major regional partners in order to realize favorable trade deals with far less friendly countries. Still, with Taiwan and members of Congress now publicly talking about the deal, changing course would create a massive outcry for both Taiwanese authorities and American legislators. All told, it looks increasingly hard to see how the U.S. government won’t approve the sale of Block 70 F-16s to Taiwan and cross Beijing’s long-held “red line,” no matter what China’s responses might be.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 10, 2019",Russia’s Fire-Damaged “Losharik” Spy Submarine Heads For Repairs As New Details Emerge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia will reportedly soon tow its top-secret nuclear-powered Project 10831 Losharik spy submarine to a shipyard in northwestern Russian for extensive repairs. The boat suffered serious damage in a fire on July 1, 2019, that ultimately killed 14 submariners. Reports offering additional details about the accident have also begun to emerge, though the Kremlin has offered little in the way of official information about the incident, just as it has continued to be coy about exactly what happened during a recent explosion during a missile test that involved a nuclear power source in the same region. On Aug. 14, 2019, state-run media outlet TASS , citing an unnamed Russian defense industry source, reported that Losharik , also known by the hull number AS-31, would be heading in the fall to the Zvezdochka Ship Repair Center in the city of Severodvinsk in Russia’s northwestern Arkhangelsk region. Zvezdochka is part of Russia’s state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation and has performed work on nuclear-powered submarines in the past. Representatives from Sevmash, the shipyard that built Losharik , as well as the Rubin design bureau, which crafted the submarine’s specialized deep-diving design, which you can read more about here and here , will also be involved in the repair work, though there is no timeline yet for when the sub might return to service. “This fall, Losharik will be towed for repairs to Zvezdochka,” TASS ‘s source said . They added that the first phase would involve pumping water out of the submarine, indicating that there had been flooding of one or more compartments, as well as a thorough inspection of the boat’s titanium inner hulls to ensure its integrity had not gotten compromised in the accident. Lorsharik reportedly has a unique internal arrangement consisting of a number of spherical titanium alloy sections linked together that sit inside an outer hull that has a more traditional submarine shape. This is key to the submarine’s deep-diving capabilities, which allow it to descend to depths of at least 3,300 feet, with some sources saying it can descend below 6,600 feet. A reported picture of Losharik running on the surface., via Top Gear Russia This is apparently also the source of the boat’s name, which is a reference to a Soviet-era animated children’s film about a circus animal shaped like a horse, but made from jugglers’ balls strung together. “ Losharik ” is a portmanteau of the Russian words for horse, “loshad,” and small ball, “sharik.” After personnel at Zvezdochka get all the water out and conduct that initial inspection, then they can get to work on actually fixing the submarine’s damaged internal components. TASS ‘s source said the damage from the fire was “significant,” but implied that the full extent of the situation remained largely unknown more than a month after the accident. “Preliminary estimates” had indicated that navigation equipment, life support systems, sonar components, and various other systems would need to be replaced entirely, they added. A second unnamed source had also told TASS that Sevmash would build new titanium hull parts, suggesting that the internal damage is far more significant than previously understood. This would align in many ways with a separate report from Russian newspaper Kommersant on July 23, 2019 . Again, citing only anonymous sources with knowledge of the accident and its aftermath, it still offered one of the most complete accounts to date of what might have happened. The Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, Russia’s main naval intelligence entity, also known by the Russian acronym GUGI , operates Losharik and its primary missions are investigating, manipulating, and recovering objects on the seabed, such hunting for items of intelligence value or tapping or cutting seabed cables. The small submarine is also designed to ride underneath a larger submarine mothership to get closer to the target area. GUGI has a number of motherships converted from ballistic missile and cruise missile submarines . Losharik was reportedly attached to the modified Project 667BDRM Delfin -class ballistic missile submarine BS-64 Podmoskovye following a training exercise in the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet’s training ground in Motovsky Bay in the Barents Sea when the fire broke out on July 1. The fire, which started in Losharik ‘s battery compartment, did not appear to be particularly serious initially, according to Kommersant ‘s sources . You can read about why fires onboard submarines can quickly and easily become very serious in this previous War Zone story . BS-64 Podmoskovye at the Russian Navy base in Severomorsk after the accident., TASS Still, 10 members of the spy submarine’s crew, reportedly remained on board to fight the fire, using PDU-3 portable breathing devices, which have enough oxygen to allow the user to breathe for up to 20 minutes. Russian Navy rules also stipulate that a submarine’s crew remain in place to deal with any fire, unless specifically ordered to evacuate, on penalty of criminal charges, Kommersant ‘s sources said . Kommersant ‘s sources could not say for sure what happened next, since all 10 of these individuals subsequently died and the investigation to determine the causes of the accident and what exactly transpired remains ongoing. These submariners reportedly fought the fire for more 40 minutes, exchanging their first PDU-3s for additional fresh ones from the stocks onboard and then using a fixed emergency breathing apparatus to continue their work. A newer PDU-4T “escape hood” emergency breathing device. This is similar in general concept to the PDU-3s that the crew of Losharik reportedly wore while fighting the fire., Zelinsky Group When some of the submarines on Losharik started to pass out from a lack of oxygen, the remaining individuals asked for permission to leave Losharik and escape into the BS-64 to which the midget submarine was still attached. Podmoskovye ‘s commander agreed to this and reportedly sent a team of four additional submariners to help get everyone out. Again, Kommersant ‘s sources say that it’s unclear what happened, since those four individuals also died, which accounts for the official death toll for the accident. An initial investigation after BS-64 and Losharik returned to the Russian Navy’s base in Severomorsk, which is situated relatively close to the reported site of the accident, turned up evidence that one of the batteries had exploded, sealing the fates of those on board and the rescue team. How and why the battery blew up remains unknown, according to Kommersant ‘s report . The newspaper pointed out that Losharik originally used silver-zinc batteries from a supplier in Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union when Sevmash began building the submarine. The Russian Navy has since reportedly swapped these out for Russian-made lithium-ion batteries given the virtual impossibility of obtaining replacements from Ukraine, which gained independence in 1991. In 2014, Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea region and began actively supporting separatists fighting the Ukrainian government, and the two countries have been engaged in a low-level conflict ever since. Lithium-ion batteries, especially if they’re cheaply made and the system they’re installed in short circuits , can definitely catch fire and explode. This has led to numerous restrictions on how people can transport and ship them in recent years. It’s hardly unheard of for submarines to use lithium-ion batteries, though, such as Japan’s Soryu class . Russian officials have also taken some of the batteries and deliberately blown them up with explosives to create a forensic baseline to check for the possibility, albeit reportedly remote, that terrorists, spies, or criminals might have deliberately tried to blow up Losharik , according to Kommersant . Whatever the case, depending on the severity of the explosion, this could help explain the damage to the inner hull and the flooding, as well. At the same time, it remains unclear what the risks might have been to the submarine’s other compartments, including its nuclear reactor, or to its hull integrity, in general. We don’t know whether the explosion posed a danger to the nuclear-powered BS-64, either. “They all shared one and the same fate – to save the lives of their comrades, to save their vessel and to prevent a catastrophe of global proportions at the cost of their own lives,” Sergei Pavlov, an aide to the Russian Navy’s top commander, reportedly said at a memorial service for the 14 submariners who died on July 6, 2019, according to Russian media outlet Fontanka . There remains speculation that this is an admission that if Losharik’s crew had not continued to fight the fire, there would have been a serious risk of a major nuclear accident. It seems unlikely that the Russian government itself will release much in the way of official confirmation about any such revelations, at least in the near future. The Kremlin is historically very tight-lipped about major military accidents, especially ones that might have a nuclear component. Just last week, a mysterious explosion occurred at a missile test site just to the west of Severodvinsk, leading to mounting evidence that the incident involved a controversial nuclear-powered cruise missile called Burevestnik and that the accident resulted in a radiation leak of some kind. You can read more about what we know about this incident so far here and here . Submarine accidents, of which Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, have had many, are particularly sensitive for the Russian government. In 1989, the one-of-kind nuclear-powered Project 685 submarine K-278 Komsomolets experienced a short circuit that triggered a fire, which sounds very similar to what happened to Losharik in July. However, Komsomolets , which was also carrying two nuclear-armed torpedos at the time, sunk in the Barents Sea and is now on the seabed leaking radiation . Two years later, right before the Soviet Union collapsed, the Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine TK-17 suffered a major accident and might have sunk after an R-39 Rif submarine launched-ballistic missile blew up in its launch tube. Thanks to the quick decision making of Captain Igor Grishkov, TK-17 survived the incident. The sinking of the Russian Navy’s nuclear-powered Project 949A Oscar -class submarine Kursk in 2000, which resulted from a pair of explosions and killed all 118 personnel on board was a major embarrassment for the country. It was also a very personal experience for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was in his first term at the time and received significant criticism for his handling of the incident. The Lorsharik fire was the deadliest submarine disaster for Russia since 2008, when the fire suppression system on nuclear-powered Project 971 Akula -class submarine Nerpa accidentally went off , killing 20 and injuring 41 more. Nerpa is now in service in the Indian Navy under a lease deal as the INS Chakra . Fires and other accidents continue to plague Russian shipyards and other military sites. Just days before the nuclear engine explosion, an ammunition depot in Siberia blew up , sending a massive shockwave and debris flying into neighboring communities and touching off a fire that took days to put out. Just in the past two years, there have been multiple fires at shipyards and naval bases . An electrical malfunction also that sunk the Russian Navy’s largest floating dry dock , which had the country’s only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , in it at the time, last year. Still, after Losharik gets to Zvezdochka later this year and there is a chance for more extensive investigations, more reports may begin to emerge with additional details about the accident and just how serious the damage was to the spy submarine.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Action cameras that capture 360 degrees of video and stitch it all together in a big spherical view that can be digitally panned in any direction are changing the way cockpit footage is captured. Jet demo teams were some of the first adopters of the technology and the USAF Thunderbirds have continued to make great use of it during their 2019 show season. Case in point, a video the team recently shot from the cockpit of Thunderbird 2’s Block 52 F-16C as it rocketed through the show’s pinnacle maneuver, the Bomb Burst Cross. The Bomb Burst starts with the four-ship diamond formation rocketing into the sky vertically, then four of the jets roll away from each other in opposing directions and break simultaneously. A fifth jet bursts through the center and continues skyward victoriously with its afterburner blazing as it does rapid aileron rolls. Meanwhile, the four jets that just broke in opposite directions continue on in large arching descents. The maneuver isn’t just powerful, it’s moving. So much so that a huge sculpted interpretation of it sits near the Pentagon as a memorial to all who served in the United States Air Force. FAA document The thing is that the initial Bomb Burst is really just half of the maneuver. The second half of this incredibly coordinated ballet in the sky is what’s most exciting. The four jets continue down on their opposing courses before leveling out at slightly different altitudes as they approach low and fast over show center with the idea being that they will all cross in nearly the same space and at the exact same time. This is called the Bomb Burst Cross. FAA document You can see an example of the Bomb Burst and the Bomb Burst Cross that follows at 21:20 if the video doesn’t advance automatically for you. This is not the main video that is the subject of this piece, keep reading for that one!: This second part of the Bomb Burst, the High Bomb Burst Cross, becomes the Low Bomb Burst Cross when cloud cover or other inclement weather keeps the team from doing their primary “high show,” with the “low show” being flown instead. During the low show, instead of breaking out in the vertical for the Bomb Burst, the jets do so in the horizontal. Again with four of the five jets returning to show center for the thrilling crossing maneuver.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Navy Ships Look To WWII Era Message-Filled Bean Bags To Communicate Without Radios,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month, sailors and Marines about the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer brought down an Iranian drone with an electronic warfare attack after it got too close to the ship in the Strait of Hormuz , an incident that highlights a number of emerging trends in modern warfare . Now, personnel on the ship have had the opportunity to demonstrate how they might use messages tucked inside small bean bags, a concept dating back to World War II, to communicate in the midst of an electronic warfare attack or when it might be essential preserve radio silence to remain undetected. On Aug. 4, 2019, an MH-60S Sea Hawk from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21 (HSC-21) hovered above Boxer ‘s deck and the helicopter’s crew tossed out a bright yellow pouch. A member of the ship’s deck crew retrieved it and quickly passed it up the chain of command until it arrived at its final destination, U.S. Captain Jason A. Burns, the Commander, Amphibious Squadron Five. “The purpose of the bean-bag drop was to show timely pilot-to-ship communication can be done without electronic transmission,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Michael Brown, the officer in charge of HSC-21’s detachment onboard Boxer , said afterward . “Together HSC-21 crew and Boxer demonstrated timely communication from the aircraft to the ship during EMCON [emissions control] procedures.” EMCON refers to the practice of limiting electromagnetic signatures, such as radio transmissions or radar waves, a ship emits, or “going radio silent.” A ship would do this to reduce the chances that an opponent would detect those emissions, which could give away their position. This would also prevent the enemy from intercept communications chatter or otherwise grabbing valuable electronic intelligence data . As noted, the bean bag messages could also be a useful tool if the ship’s communications systems were getting jammed or were otherwise inoperable. US Navy Aviation Boatswain’s Mate (Handling) 2nd Class Bradley Peterson retrieves the message-carrying bean bag that the MH-60S dropped on Boxer’s deck., USN The only problem with going radio silent, or getting jammed, of course, is that this limits the options available to transmit information, especially complex messages, rapidly even between ships sailing relatively close together. That’s where helicopters carrying orders and other missives in bean bags come in. The idea dates back to the early days of World War II. In the immediate leadup to the famous Doolittle Raid on Japan in 1942, an SBD Dauntless dive bomber flying from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise spotted a Japanese patrol boat ahead of the task force. Enterprise was part of the force escorting USS Hornet , which was carrying Doolittle’s Raiders and their B-25 bombers. Fearing that the Japanese might get alerted if he radioed back, the SBD’s pilot flew low over Enterprise ‘s deck and dropped a message attached to a bean bag onto the deck. As was the case on Boxer nearly 80 years later, sailors on the deck below rushed the message to the ship’s bridge so that the task force could take appropriate action to avoid patrol boat. The bean bag message drop during the Doolittle Raid is seen in the archival video below at around 2:48 in the runtime. “I started with the original measurements of the bean-bag used on the USS Enterprise in 1942 and built this one to withstand the impact of a drop but also weighed down for an accurate drop,” U.S. Navy Aircrew Survival Equipmentman 1st Class Carlos Freireizurieta, a member of Boxer ’s Paraloft shop, explained . “The World War II bean-bags were filled with stuffing, but the one I made is weighted down with a one-pound steel bar sown into the bottom of the naugahyde [artificial leather] and webbing package.” An actual World War II message-carrying bean bag., USN US Navy Aircrew Survival Equipmentman 1st Class Carlos Freireizurieta with his modern bean bag., USN U.S. Navy Lieutenant Taryn “SISS” Steiger, who was the pilot of the MH-60S during the bean bag test drop on Boxer , noted that the helicopter might also be able to briefly land or use its hoist to pick up additional messages in return, as well. The Navy did not say how far the Sea Hawk flew during the test drop or how long the entire experiment took. It’s not necessarily clear how practical the entire operation might be in a real-world situation. The information that the bean bag pouch could reasonably contain might be limited in both total volume and format. Written messages seem the most likely option, though the pouch could certainly carry flash drives or similar electronic storage devices to carry video or audio. But, at the same time, having an alternative such as the bean bag readily available would certainly be better than nothing in a situation where it would be impossible or ill-advised to use more modern communications options. This method is certainly low tech and low cost making it easy enough to have available, if necessary. Other older technology, such as morse code via signal lights, and signal flags, also remains available, but they might not be able to transmit as much information as quickly as the bean bag and could be difficult to use in poor weather or heavy smoke or at night. Whatever the case, the possibility of opponents spotting friendly forces from their electronic emissions, intercepting those transmissions, or just jamming them, are very real risks on the modern battlefield. On Aug. 7, 2019, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) issued an advisory for commercial vessels sailing in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, and Red Sea – the same general areas where Boxer is operating – that warned about Iranian forces or their proxies jamming GPS signals and communications transmissions, as well as issuing confusing or false messages. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNfqtJ4nNr0 “In at least two … incidents, vessels reported GPS interference,” the advisory noted. “Vessels have also reported spoofed bridge-to-bridge communications from unknown entities falsely claiming to be U.S. or coalition warships.” The risks, however, go far beyond Iran. Russia is widely believed to be the source of GPS jamming , in particular, in various locations in Europe and the Middle East , in recent years. America’s “great power” competitors are well aware of these issues, as well. For example, China recently announced it had brought back bugle calls as a battlefield communication tool. All of this only underscores the increasing and dangerous possibility that U.S. forces might find themselves disconnected from electronic tools they’ve come to take for granted. The U.S. military has been exploring a variety of high- and low-tech solutions to this problem, ranging from things like installing new jamming resistant antennas on aircraft to reemphasizing training troops how to use compasses . So, whether or not the Navy makes the bean bag message carrier a part of the standard communications suite on its larger warships, it is certainly an indication of how the service, along with the other branches of the U.S., are looking at all of their available options to ensure that personnel can communicate with each other quickly and effectively, no matter what.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 22, 2019",Russian Surveillance Plane Is Flying Missions Over U.S. Military Bases In Hawaii,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russians are conducting their latest surveillance missions over the United States under the Open Skies Treaty , this time over Hawaii. This agreement allows member countries to perform nearly unimpeded aerial surveillance over each other’s territory , using approved sensors and in the presence of monitors from the host country. In Hawaii, the Tu-154M-ON aircraft has been photographing Hickam Air Force Base , Marine Corps Base Hawaii , the Lualualei Naval Radio Transmitting Facility, and more. The Tu-154M-ON, which carries the registration RF-85655, left Russia on Aug. 11, 2019, and made a number of pitstops in Iceland, Canada, and the United States on its way to the Pacific. Its circuitous route took it over Chicago, where it caused something of a stir , though there is no indication it was not conducting a surveillance mission at the time. The plane was flying at around 36,000 feet and moving faster than 450 knots, far higher and faster than it typically flies when actually conducting missions. Actual flights almost always being and end a single locations, as well. The aircraft finally touched down at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu on Aug. 14, 2019. The plane conducted a low-level flight around the island of Oahu that same day at an altitude of around 6,000 feet, which included passing over back over Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, as well as flying past, Hickam Air Force Base , Kalaeloa Airport , and the Lualualei Naval Radio Transmitting Facility. Hickam Air Force Base, now part of the larger Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, is a major U.S. Air Force facility in the region. The base is home to the headquarters for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and hosts F-22 Raptor stealth fighters , KC-135 tankers, C-17 airlifters, and more, as well as supporting various aircraft flying through for operations and exercises, including B-2 Spirit stealth bombers . The route over Daniel K. Inouye International Airport and past Hickam Air Force Base., FlightRadar24 Kalaeloa was previously known as Naval Air Station Barbers Point . The U.S. Navy left as part of a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process in the late 1990s, but the U.S. Coast Guard continues to maintain a presence there with HC-130 Hercules rescue aircraft and HH-65 Dolphin rescue helicopters. The Tu-154M-ON’s flight path over Kalaeloa Airport., FlightRadar24 The Lualualei Naval Radio Transmitting Facility , assigned to the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific, is a major Navy strategic communications site that operates a very low-frequency transmitter array for communicating with submarines . The route over the Lualualei Naval Radio Transmitting Facility. To the East one can also see what used to be US Navy ammunition storage bunkers. The service sold these to a private developer in 2003 , who now leases them to private customers., FlightRadar24 On Aug. 15, 2019, the Tu-154M-ON conducted another fight, which started with a medium-altitude run at around 13,000 feet that took it over Lanai airport on the island of the same name and then over Maui Raceway Park , which occupies what used to be Puunene Army Airfield on Maui. It’s possible that this flight may have simply been for purposes of transiting to another area as neither of these sites, or any other locations along the route, have any apparent military value. The part of the Tu-154M-ON’s route over Lanai and then on to Maui., FlightRadar24 The plane eventually swung back around to fly over Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) – of which Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay is a part of – which is the service’s main base in the state. The Russian plane’s route over MCBH and Marine Corps Air Station Hawaii in Particular., FlightRadar24 Online flight tracking site FlightRadar24 does not specifically show the Tu-154M-ON flying over Pearl Harbor, but it does show the plane returning to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Aug. 15, 2019, along a path that could have taken it straight over it. If the plane did not take of it during that particular run, it will almost certainly do so before it leaves. This iconic facility remains the Navy’s premier base of operations in the Pacific and is home to a variety of specialized facilities, including naval shipyards . The same track could have taken the plane over Fort Shafter , which is home to U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC). None of the recorded flight data shows the plane passing over the U.S. Army’s Schofield Barracks , which is also on Oahu and is where the 25th Infantry Division has its headquarters. Pearl Harbor is seen at the upper left, while the “start” of the track for the Tu-154M-ON in this area is seen at the lower right. The plane then swung out in the Pacific before returning to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport as seen by the green-yellow track at the lower left., FlightRadar24 Over the years, the United States and Russia have exchanged various accusations that the other is failing to meet their obligations under the agreement or is otherwise exploiting its terms, something The War Zone has covered in-depth in the past . In 2018, it looks like the treaty was on the verge of collapsing entirely . A separate spat between Russia and Georgia had brought a halt to virtually all Open Skies flights that year. The United States also briefly refused to certify Russia’s two new Tu-214ON aircraft as being compliant with the agreement’s terms. Open Skies’ goal is to allow participating countries to routinely monitor each other’s military and military-related sites to promote transparency and reduce the likelihood of confusion about or misinterpretation of certain activities leading to an actual conflict. The U.S. government has, on a number of occasions, accused the Russians of trying to exploit the terms in order to gather more traditional intelligence. However, the Treaty seems to be back to running as intended, at least for the time being. The Russians eventually dropped their request to overfly Georgia and the U.S. government did approve the Tu-214ONs. So, in 2019, Open Skies missions have been occurring at their normal usual rate, both in the United States and elsewhere. Already this year, Russian Open Skies aircraft have flown over a number of particularly sensitive sites, including Area 51 and Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, among other locations.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 10, 2019",The Experimental Littoral Combat Ship Sea Slice Has Met A Sad Demise In Denmark,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of all the thousands of stories I have written, one of the most surprising to me in terms of its widespread interest was one about the selling-off of Lockheed’s innovative quad-hull littoral combat ship testbed vessel Sea Slice. That post prompted throngs of emails inquiring about the ship and a ton of social media action, as well as reposts from other outlets. People seemed to be fascinated with the bizarrely shaped ship and its unique capabilities and were genuinely interested in not seeing it split apart by the scrapper’s torch. I did a follow-up when it was successfully sold to a wind turbine support company in Europe and I remember corresponding with them about their plans for Sea Slice over the months that followed. Now it appears that those plans not only fell through, but the ship has met just as depressing an end to its life as what was originally feared when it was put up for sale in 2015. The largely aluminum Sea Slice cost $15M to build and was a major outgrowth of SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) design concept. Starting in the late 1990s, the ship worked to demonstrate a diverse variety of experimental capabilities, weapon systems, and tactics in the waters around Southern California. You can read all about Sea Slice’s legacy in this past article of mine . Note the Oerlikon Millenium deck gun, NLOS launcher on he stern, and the modular battle and communications center on its deck. Official caption: At sea with the experimental Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) ship “Sea Slice” Aug. 2, 2002 — An aerial view of the Sea Slice, an experimental ship built by Lockheed Martin, operating off the coast of Port Hueneme, Calif., during Fleet Battle Experiment Juliet (FBE-J). Fleet Battle Experiment Juliet is a joint warfighting experiment combining both live field forces and computer simulation at various locations throughout the United States during “Millennium Challenge 2002.”, USN When it was put up for sale for pennies on the dollar, it was hoped that a user would purchase it that could make use of its unique abilities, which included an expansive open-deck area that was made possible by its very wide beam, and high-speed and highly stable seakeeping. It turned out that this is exactly what happened. I wrote the following in January of 2016: The once military technology-demonstrator ship was shipped last October from San Diego to Rotterdam aboard the SAL Heavy Lift Vessel Frauke. Apparently, the voyage took 30 days. Shortly after arriving in Rotterdam, Sea Slice was towed via tug to Esbjerg, Denmark, where she was delivered to her new owners, Advanced Offshore Solutions. The firm provides logistical support and expertise to the burgeoning offshore wind energy industry in Europe. After receiving a refit she will begin work in the renewable-energy sector as an offshore windfarm tender and exploration craft. Her unique design allows for highly stable operations at speeds up to 30 knots, even while in high sea states (Sea State 5). Her large, wide deck area also makes the ship highly flexible for carrying various out-sized payloads. Apparently, Global Renewables Shipbrokers was the go-between that made the deal happen. GRS managing partner Matthias Mross states : “The Sea Slice is a special case in point to demonstrate how our customers can profit from our network and expertise. Bringing the right parties together from the outset and minimizing our time and cost expenditure is all part of our job and we are getting better and better at it.“ Fast forward to today and this promising future for Sea Slice appears to have failed to launch. The ship was subsequently transferred into the hands of Smedegaarden A/S, a Danish maritime logistics firm based out of Esbjerg, Denmark. This was Sea Slice’s last port of call before being scrapped by the company. Smedegaarden A/S wrote the following in a post on their website : The American navy vessel “Sea-SLICE” & Baywatch Celebrity, build 1996 by Lockhead Martin, has now ended its days in Esbjerg – Denmark for recycling. Smedegaarden A/S purchased the Vessel from a Danish Operator, who originally planned the vessel to be used as Service ship to the Wind Sector, and the once so proud and beutifull vessel is now empty for machinery, electronics and waste materials etc before the recycling of the hull can commence. The vessel has participated in Baywatch Hawaii Episode 10, which can be seen at youtube by clicking HERE The vessel contained, amongst other reuseable equipment, 2 x MTU main engines producing 3500 hp each. The vessel were build of corrosion resistant Aluminum material. Smedegaarden A/S You can see Sea Slice intact at their facility in the satellite image taken a year ago posted below. A can see where her pilothouse ended up here . Google Earth At least it’s nice to see the shipbreaker make note of the uniqueness of the vessel they are charged with dismantling and its historic significance. Regardless, it looks like Sea Slice and all of its potential is finally gone for good.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One Russia’s two Tu-214ON aircraft has conducted what appears to be its first-ever flight over the United States under the Open Skies Treaty . This agreement allows member states to conduct aerial surveillance missions, with certain limitations in hardware and in the presence of monitors from the surveilled country, over each other’s territory. Today’s sortie took the Russian plane over parts of West Texas, through New Mexico, and into Colorado, including overflights of Fort Bliss, White Sands Missile Range , Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, and finally hitting up the Pueblo Chemical Depot. The Tu-214ON, with the registration number RF-64525, took off from Rosecrans Air National Guard Base in Saint Joseph, Missouri, at around 1:50 PM local time on Apr. 25, 2019. The aircraft arrived at Rosecrans three days earlier and the Russian Ministry of Defense says it will continue flying from the base in Missouri until Apr. 27, 2019 . After leaving Rosecrans, the modified airliner flew a relatively straightforward route south at a constant speed of around 270 knots, or 310 miles per hour, and at altitudes between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. The flight path through Kansas, Oklahoma, and into Texas took the plane over a number of major U.S. military installations, including the U.S. Army’s Fort Riley and the U.S. Air Force’s McConnell Air Force Base , both in Kansas, Vance Air Force Base and Fort Sill in Oklahoma, and Sheppard Air Force Base and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas.

Afterward, the plane climbed to 30,000 feet, represented by the purple portion of the line, and returned to Rosecrans., Flightradar24 In El Paso, the plane flew over the U.S. Army’s Fort Bliss and its associated Biggs Army airfield, as well as other parts of the base’s extensive reservation. This facility is home to the 1st Armored Division and the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, among other units. The 11th controls the service’s Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense batteries.Â The plane’s flight path over Fort Bliss., Flightradar24 The plane then turned north, covering the Fort Bliss Training Complex and the McGregor Range Complex., Flightradar24 After turning north, the aircraft flew into New Mexico to the expansive White Sands Missile Range. Though Army-managed, White Sands supports a wide array of joint service and other government training and testing activities, including, but certainly not limited to testing new artillery systems and directed energy weapons , evaluating aircraft and aircraft self-defense countermeasures systems , and more. There’s even a mock U.S. Navy ship, known as USS Desert Ship or Land Locked Ship One (LSS-1), where that service can test various maritime systems, including missiles and radars.Â Russia’s Tu-214ON flew a route that showed a unique effort to pass over a NASA facility near White Sands, as well as the National Radar Cross Section Test Facility ( NRTF ). The NRTF is very similar in function and design to Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works’ Helendale Radar Signature Test Range, which you can read about in more detail here .

This city is home to the Air Force’s Kirtland Air Force Base and Sandia National Laboratories main site. Kirtland is home to two Special Operations Wings, the 58th and 150th, the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Directed Energy and Space Vehicle’s Directorates, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, and variety of other test and evaluation units. Kirtland also serves as a storage site for nuclear weapons. Sandia National Laboratories’ primary work is also in nuclear weapons, though it supports a variety of other research and development efforts, including hypersonic weapons .Â Interestingly, AFRL’s Directed Energy Directorate has also been involved in trying to reverse engineer a still unknown weapon blamed for a string of mysterious attacks on U.S. diplomatic staff in Cuba. The U.S. government reportedly has evidence tying the attacks to Russia . The plane’s route then continued north past Los Alamos National Laboratory , another prominent Department of Energy site that supports nuclear weapons research and other development activities.Â The plane’s flight path took it right over Sandia National Laboratories and past Kirtland Air Force Base to the West., Flightradar24 The route across Los Alamos National Laboratory., Flightradar24 After the tour of nuclear sites in New Mexico, the plane continued north in Colorado. Making its way past the city of Pueblo, the plane turned to cross over the Army’s Pueblo Chemical Depot, home of the Chemical Materials Activity , which is responsible for overseeing the elimination of the U.S. military’s remaining chemical weapons stockpile. The Pueblo Chemical Depot is one of only two remaining U.S. Army facilities that store chemical weapons awaiting disposal, the other being the Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky. This part of the route went right over the Pueblo Chemical Depot., Flightradar24 The Pueblo Chemical Depot was the last stop on the route before the plane climbed up to 30,000 feet to begin its return journey to Rosecrans in Missouri.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 23, 2019",U.K. Says Iran’s Supertanker Is Free To Go Even As The U.S. Tries To Keep It Impounded,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.K. authorities in Gibraltar have released the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 , after receiving assurances that the ship’s final destination was not actually an oil refinery in Syria that is under European Union sanctions. This decision comes despite the United States making a bid to take over the case and keep the ship detained and as Iran continues to hold the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero , which Tehran had seized in a tit-for-tat response nearly four weeks ago. Security forces in Gibraltar, along with Royal Marines, stormed the Grace 1 on July 4, 2019, over suspected sanctions violations. Iran has denied from the beginning that the tanker was bound for Syria, but has never publicly offered an alternative destination. Authorities in Tehran had been quick to denounce the British decision to seize the ship and vowed to detain a British-flagged vessel in response, a threat the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) made good on July 19, 2019, when its personnel boarded the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz. Both sides had publicly ruled out a ship swap in the past. “There are no longer any reasonable grounds for the continued legal detention of the Grace 1 ,” Gibraltar’s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said in a statement on Aug. 15, 2019. “The Grace 1 is therefore now released from detention under the Sanctions Act by operation of law as confirmed this afternoon by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.” Negotiations between the United Kingdom and Iran over the ship had been underway for weeks. In July, then-U.K. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt had publicly said that the ship could be free to go if the Iranians could provide clear and compelling evidence that it was not headed to Syria. On Aug. 14, 2019, it appeared that these discussions were coming close to reaching a conclusion. “The vessel was seized based on false allegations,” Jalil Eslami, the deputy head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization, had told state-run media outlet IRNA . “We hope the release will take place soon.” It remains unclear what evidence Iran provided to Gibraltar’s Supreme Court that led to the decision to release the ship. U.K. authorities have maintained from the start that it was the territory’s government that initiated the tanker’s seizure in the first place. However, when and if Grace 1 actually heads back to sea remains to be seen. Authorities in Gibraltar confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice had made a formal request to take custody of the tanker over a number of unspecified allegations. Chief Minister Picardo said the territory was still considering that request through a separate legal process, despite saying that the Iranian ship was, at least for now, free to go. Gibraltar’s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo in London in April 2019., Jonathan Brady/PA Wire via AP Images It’s unclear what the U.S. government’s arguments for taking over Grace 1 might be. The United States has put near-total unilateral sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, with secondary sanctions hitting any countries that continue to buy that oil, but it’s unclear what authority there is to then claim the vessel and its cargo in transit. Again, it’s important to note that Gibraltar initially detained the ship because it was allegedly heading to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria, which is the target of European Union sanctions. The U.K. insists that the seizure was not made based on a request from the United States or based on any U.S. sanctions. Still, the U.S. Department of Justice did successfully take custody of the North Korean-flagged M/V Wise Honest in April 2019 over sanctions violations. This was the first time the United States had ever done this with regards to North Korea and American officials may now be looking to use whatever legal arguments it made there to take control of the Grace 1 . The North Korean-flagged M/V Wise Honest , which is now in US government custody., AP How Grace 1 ‘s release and potential re-impoundment might impact the case of the Stena Impero is unclear. While the United Kingdom and Iran have repeatedly ruled out swapping the ships, letting the Iranian tanker might help de-escalate tensions. Agreeing to transfer to the ship to U.S. government custody, especially after the U.K. government recently agreed to join a new American-backed maritime security mission focused on Iran in and around the Strait of Hormuz, could inflame the situation all over again. If the United States succeeds in its attempt to take control of Grace 1 , it would almost certainly lead to a new surge in tensions between Washington and Tehran, as well. Since May 2019, the two countries have taken increasingly hardline stances toward each other, reaching a climax in June 2019 when the IRGC shot down a U.S. Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman, which, in turn, almost led to U.S. military strikes on Iran. The day before the IRGC seized the Stena Impero , it also harassed a convoy of U.S. Navy ships sailing through the Strait of Hormuz, which led Marines on board the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer to bring down an Iranian drone with an electronic warfare attack . For months now, the U.S. military has been steadily deploying additional forces to the region, or speeding up planning deployments, including fighter jets and bombers , Navy ships , and more . The United States has already been conducting its own unilateral maritime patrols aimed at deterring Iranian activities, including flights involving U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles armed with cluster munitions . US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles armed with cluster munitions and other ordnance conduct a patrol over the Persian Gulf in June 2019., USAF The Iranians have also seized two other tankers in the past few months, one before and one after the Stena Impero incident. It continues to hold the Panama-flagged Riah and an unnamed Iraqi-flagged tanker over suspected fuel smuggling. At the same time, the United States has had difficulty in getting its proposed multi-national maritime security mission off the ground, despite seeking to “internationalize” it and going so far as to ask global competitor China to participate. There are also reports that the U.S. government has been conducting back-channel negotiations with Iran through a number of different intermediaries to try and further de-escalate the situation, though the United States and Iran have denied this . Grace 1 may prove to be a valuable window into the state U.S.-Iranian relations, as well as those between the United States and its allies regarding policies toward Tehran . If the tanker does continue on its way, it will interesting to see were it ultimately offloads its cargo if it doesn’t actually head to Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Cluster Bomb Toting F-15Es Are Patrolling The Persian Gulf To Counter Small Boat Swarms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles have been flying patrols over the Persian Gulf armed with cluster munitions, as well as a variety of other weapons. These weapons could be useful for beating back swarms of small boats , such as those belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC. The sorties come amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as the IRGC’s harassment and seizure of a number of tankers in Strait of Hormuz in recent weeks. Images emerged of the cluster munition-armed F-15Es on July 31, 2019, as part of an official news item from the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing about the Surface Combat Air Patrols, or SuCAP. The 380th is the Air Force’s main unit at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. The Strike Eagles, assigned to the 336th Expeditionary Fighter Wing, had arrived there in June . “Their [the F-15Es’] role is to conduct combat air patrol missions over the Arabian Gulf and provide aerial escorts of naval vessels as they traverse the Strait of Hormuz,” the official news item explained. “The F-15E is a dual-role fighter designed to perform air-to-air and air-to-ground missions and is currently conducting Surface Combat Air Patrol (SuCAP) operations to ensure free and open maritime commerce in the region.” Accompanying pictures show the jets conducting SuCAPs on multiple occasions since June 2019. Pictures show at least some of the aircraft carrying Wind Corrected Munition Dispensers (WCMD), a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system guided canister that can carry a number of different cluster munitions. There are different designations for WCMDs loaded with different submunitions. An F-15E sits at Al Dahfra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates ahead of a Surface Combat Air Patrol in July 2019. Three WCMD cluster munitions are visible on the aircraft’s lefthand fuselage stations., USAF We can see the particular markings on these cluster munitionss, but for overwater missions, it is unlikely they are CBU-104/Bs, which contain dozens of Gator anti-personnel and anti-tank land mines. The other two main types of WCMD bombs in U.S. military inventory are the CBU-103/B, with a load of 202 BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomblets (CEB), or the CBU-105/B, also known as the Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW), with 10 BLU-108/B Sensor Fuzed Munitions (SFM). A member of the US Air Force prepares WCMDs for loading onto F-15Es ahead of a Surface Combat Air Patrol in July 2019., USAF The BLU-97/B is a traditional cluster sub-munition. It weighs just shy of three and a half pounds and has fragmentation, anti-armor, and incendiary effects, giving it the capability to take out a wide array of different targets. The SFM is a larger and much more complex, smart munition and each one has four separate anti-armor warheads with their own infrared and laser sensors to spot targets and destroy those targets with pinpoint accuracy. You can read more about the complete CBU-105/B in detail here . Either submunition could be useful against swarms of small boats, but the SFW would seem to be uniquely suited for the mission. Iran has used its relatively giant small boat fleet in recent months to harass and seize foreign commercial ships, which generally offer limited protection for their crew. Damage to engines, weapon systems, or crew, could easily achieve a mission kill even if the craft remains afloat. All this being said, cluster munitions have become increasingly controversial in recent years, despite their continuing military utility, and the U.S. government had sought to increasingly restrict their use and steadily eliminate them from U.S. military inventories. In 2017, President Donald Trump’s Administration reversed course, deciding to retain existing stockpiles of cluster munitions for the time being, though the development of alternative weapons has continued. You can read more about the international debate about these weapons and U.S. policy toward them in this past War Zone feature . Beyond the cluster munitions, the released pictures show that Strike Eagles from the 336th have been ready to take on individual moving targets with laser-guided bombs, as well. In one case, a pair of F-15Es each carried at least two 500-pound class GBU-12/B Paveway II bombs and one of them had a 2,000-pound class GBU-24/B Paveyway III on its centerline station. The latter weapon is capable of disabling or destroying any ship in the Iranian Navy. Two F-15Es from the 336th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron conduct a Surface Combat Air Patrol in June 2019. The jet on the left is carrying cluster munitions, while the other has a GBU-24/B on its centerline pylon., USAF In addition, the F-15Es each carried a pair of AIM-120C Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and two AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range infrared homing missiles. These weapons offer a self-defense capability, but could also allow them to engage other aircraft, including drones, that might be threatening other U.S. or other friendly forces, as well as commercial ships. In 2017, Strike Eagles flying over Syria shot down two Iranian unmanned aircraft, on separate occasions , which appeared to be targeting American troops and their local partners. We have also seen Air Force F-15C Eagles and F-35A Joint Strike Fighters armed with air-to-air missiles flying in the region in recent months. It’s also worth noting that the AIM-9X, with its imaging infrared seeker, can engage maneuvering surface targets, like fast boats. None of the F-15Es flying SuCAPs appear to have been carrying the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar pod, but we do know that the 336th brought a number of these advanced sensor systems with them when they deployed earlier in July. Dragon’s Eye is primarily a radar imaging system, but can reportedly also provide ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) data to target vehicles on land and ships at sea. F-15Es from the 336th at Al Dahfra Air Base in June 2019. Five of the six aircraft in the foreground are carrying Dragon’s Eye radar pods., USAF The 336th has also already been training to integrate with U.S. Navy aircraft and ships, which could also feed targeting information to the F-15Es. On July 24, 2019, a pair of the squadrons Strike Eagles took part in an exercise in the Persian Gulf that included the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Gonzalez and a P-3C Orion maritime patrol plane. “The P-3C provides maritime domain awareness, can also function as a maritime air controller with long loiter times, or employ its own weapons as required,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Adrian Willing, the Master Air Attack Plan Cell planner within the Air Force’s 609th Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, said in a statement . “The USS Gonzalez is operating in the Arabian Gulf to guarantee international freedom of navigation.” The Air Force has already begun to focus more on how it might respond to the threat of small boat swarms in recent years. In 2017, A-10 Warthogs conducted an exercise in the Gulf of Mexico involving just this sort of scenario. The appearance of the F-15Es in the Persian Gulf flying these sorts of patrols now is not particularly surprising. Since May 2019 , the U.S. military has been sending a steady stream of additional assets, including combat aircraft , ships, and other personnel, to the region in response to still largely undefined intelligence warning of increased threats to American interests from Iran and its proxies. The Strike Eagle, with its robust range and good loiter time, combined with its large payload capacity and multi-mission capabilities, is an ideal tool for conducting SuCAPs in the region. Having the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) is also really useful for dynamic operations. The mix of weapons on the aircraft in the pictures the Air Force has released only further underscores just how flexible a platform the F-15E is, in general. On on July 19, 2019, U.S. Central Command had also formally announced the start of a new maritime security mission dubbed Operation Sentinel . This was the same day that Iran seized the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero using a combination of forces aboard small boats and an Mi-17 helicopter. Iran had threatened to do just this following the United Kingdom’s seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar on July 4. Iran had already harassed another British-flagged tanker, the British Heritage , seized a Panama-flagged tanker Riah on still-murky charges of fuel smuggling, and is linked to a spate of outright attacks on commercial ships across two separate incidents in May and June 2019. The IRGC also shot down a U.S. Navy drone in June that almost prompted U.S. military strikes on Iran and, more recently, the U.S. Navy said that U.S. Marines on the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer had knocked down at least one Iranian unmanned aircraft over the Strait of Hormuz using an electronic warfare system . Despite all this, Operation Sentinel remains very much a work in progress. “We will escort our ships as they come along, but we won’t be there in great numbers,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Gilday, who is set to be the next Chief of Naval Operations, said during his confirmation hearing on July 31, 2019. “The coalition that we’re building in the Arabian Gulf and specifically in the Strait of Hormuz is going to be a 80- or 90-percent coalition effort,” Gilday continued. “A much smaller U.S. effort is primarily focused on providing intelligence support to the rest of the coalition.” A US Navy MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter flying from USS Boxer in the Strait of Hormuz, at right, escorts an Iranian Navy Bell 212 helicopter, at left, away from US ships during an incident on July 18, 2019., USN The United Kingdom had proposed a separate , European-led mission last week, but this effort appears to have been muted since the country’s new Prime Minister Boris Johnson took office on July 24, 2019. Johnson is seen as friendlier toward U.S. President Donald Trump than his predecessor Theresa May and he could be looking reassess the U.K. government’s cooperation with the United States on maritime security in the Middle East, as well as policy toward Iran more generally. The United States has had trouble otherwise finding willing partners to join its maritime coalition, with the German government recently saying it would not particpate. On July 31, 2019, it emerged that the United Arab Emirates, a major American partner in the region, had actually sent a delegation to Iran to discuss the security situation. “We are gonna keep it open,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had declared during a talk on July 29, 2019. “We are going to build up a maritime security plan. Countries from all across the world who have a vested interest in keeping those waterways open will participate.” So, at least for the foreseeable future, cluster munition-toting F-15Es, along with other U.S. military assets, look set to continue patrolling region’s waterways.

Sailors on board some of the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carriers are still training to employ an unreliable anti-torpedo defense system nearly a year after it stopped work on the program entirely.

Eisenhower training on the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense Systems (ATTDS) as part of a routine Board of Inspection and Survey, or INSURV, in July and August 2019. Congress has mandated that all Navy ships must pass an INSURV certifying their mission readiness at least once every 60 months. INSURVs are multi-phase processes that offer opportunities for ships’ crews to identify and correct deficiencies. Eisenhower’s crew would have had to demonstrate proficiency with all of the ship’s systems, including the ATTDS. “The Navy is planning to remove ATTDS from aircraft carriers incrementally through fiscal year 2023 as the ships cycle through shipyard periods,” William Couch, a spokesperson for Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), confirmed to The War Zone in an Email. “At present, the Navy is sustaining the ATTDS systems that are still installed on some vessels, where it is necessary for the Sailors to train with the system to maintain their qualifications in preparation for future deployments.” The pictures the Navy released show sailors aboard Eisenhower loading a training version of the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) into an ATTDS launcher and then firing it on July 31, 2019. For unexplained reasons, the service subsequently removed an image of the actual CAT launch, seen at the top of this story, from the official Defense Visual Information Distribution Services (DVIDS) website, though versions are still available elsewhere . Sailors onboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower load a training version of a Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) onto a launcher on July 31, 2019., USN The CAT is essentially a miniature torpedo that is six and three-quarters inches in diameter and approximately 85 inches long. It can either function in a hit-to-kill mode, destroying incoming torpedos by physically slamming into them, or with a glancing blow by using its small warhead. The Navy has also been exploring turning this interceptor into a small offensive weapon, called the Compact Very Lightweight Torpedo (CVLWT). You can read more about both CAT and the CVLWT in detail this past War Zone feature . The complete ATTDS also includes a Torpedo Warning System (TWS), which is towed sonar array that the carrier pulls behind it, and a centralized control system. As of the end of 2018, five Nimitz class carriers, including Eisenhower had the system installed. The other carriers equipped with the anti-torpedo torpedo defenses were USS George H.W. Bush , USS Harry S. Truman , USS Nimitz , and USS Theodore Roosevelt . It is unclear how many of these ships still have the system installed. Additional images from Eisenhower ‘s INSURV showed an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter from Eisenhower recovering a CAT training round using a specialized basket slung underneath after another launch on Aug. 11, 2019. The training round does not have a live warhead and deploys a bright red-orange airbag after traveling a certain distance that brings it to the surface for recovery. An MH-60S Sea Hawk scoops up a training version of the CAT after a launch on Aug. 11, 2019. You can see its red-orange airbag floating on the surface., USN The MH-60S flies the CAT training round back to Eisenhower ., USN It makes perfect sense, in principle, that the Navy would want crews on any of its ships to be fully qualified to use all of the equipment on board. The issue here, of course, is that the ATTDS, by the service’s own admission , is so unreliable it isn’t worth keeping on the carriers. By the time the Navy stopped work on the program in September 2018, the TWS had only shown “some capability” to spot incoming threats at all and was still suffering from high instances of “false positives,” that is to say, mistakenly thinking it had detected an enemy torpedo, according to a regular report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. That same review said that the “lethality of CAT is untested” and that these interceptors had “uncertain reliability.” In short, at best, the two key components of the ATTDS had demonstrated that they might work, in principle. You can read more about the known issues with the system in greater depth in this previous War Zone story . A diagram showing how the ATTDS is supposed to work in principle., USN It’s not clear how much of a capability the ATTDS in its present form would actually offer, even in an emergency, especially given that the Navy is no longer working to improve its functionality, at least publicly . Given known reports about its reliability, or lack thereof, a ship’s crew might be reticent to even try to employ it in an actual combat scenario. We also don’t know how much time and effort sailors spend on maintaining qualifications on the ATTDS. Still, that they are doing so at all comes at a time when the Navy has been seriously reviewing the time the crews of its ships spend on various tasks, as well as sleeping , amid concerns about overworking personnel and increasing the risks of accidents as a result. The service began looking into these issues after a pair of fatal collisions involving Arleigh Burke class destroyers in the Pacific in 2017. Subsequent investigations found that a lack of sleep , as well as lax training standards and other factors, contributed to those accidents. At the same time, some anti-torpedo torpedo capability may be better than none, especially in the face of the very real threat posed by increasingly advanced and ever quieter submarines armed with steadily improving torpedoes in service with the navies of potential opponents, such as Russia and China. These countries both have submarines armed with torpedoes that home in on a ship’s wake , making them largely immune to acoustic countermeasures, and that have other features that make them difficult to detect and evade . However, this doesn’t seem to have changed the Navy’s overall opinion of ATTDS, at least in its current guise. But until the service rips the last of these systems out of its Nimitz class carriers, because they technically remain an operational system on those ships, it looks like sailors will continue to spend at least some time training to use them, even if they don’t really work.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 10, 2018",Taiwan Reveals Land-Based Variant Of Naval Point Defense Missile System To Guard Key Sites,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan has expanded the development of its still-in-development Sea Oryx naval point defense system to include and land-based variant. This could help provide an important additional layer of defenses around various critical military installations against cruise missiles , anti-radiation missiles, and small drones , as well as potentially larger threats, such as helicopters and low-flying manned aircraft. Taiwan’s National Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, or NCSIST, showed a video presentation on Sea Oryx at biennial Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition that included a depiction of a truck-mounted version of the system for what appears to be the first time. The video also shows the point defense system fitted on a future guided-missile destroyer, which NCIST is also developing , as well as one of the country’s upcoming stealthy catamaran missile corvettes , a program The War Zone has been closely following . Sea Oryx, which NCSIST first announced publicly in 2015, is similar in general concept to the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). The missile is a derivative of the Tien Chien 1L (TC-1L), or Sky Sword 1L, surface-to-air missile, which is, itself, derived from the AIM-9 Sidewinder . The weapon leverages the imaging infrared seeker from the earlier TC-1L missile, along with its forward control surfaces, and combined them with a new rear section that includes a significantly larger and more powerful rocket motor. The complete system includes a launcher with either 12 or 24 missiles at the ready and a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor to help identify targets before launch. Sea Oryx will also be able to use targeting data from off-board sensors, such as ship-mounted or land-based radars, to cue the missiles. It was hardly surprising that Taiwan began development of Sea Oryx for naval applications, given the potential for conflict with China. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been working hard to expand its arsenal of air-, sea-, and ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles , in particular. At the same time, the destroyers and frigates that make up the most capable components of Taiwan’s existing surface fleet have limited close-in defenses, typically relying on Raytheon’s Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), if they have one fitted at all. The Tou Chiang , effectively a prototype for the future catamaran missile corvettes , also has a Phalanx CIWS. This point defense system combines a 20mm 6-barrel Vulcan cannon that fires at a rate of 4,500 rounds per minute together with a fire control radar. The video below accompanied NCSIST’s initial unveiling of the Sea Oryx program in 2015. Expanding the Sea Oryx program to include a ground-based version makes good sense for many of the same reasons. The threat from Chinese land-attack cruise missiles is growing, as well, and the PLA has the increasing ability to use aircraft, ships, and land-based launchers to engage targets anywhere on Taiwan from multiple vectors at once. The Taiwanese military spent considerable effort in the past building hardened bases and other facilities on the Pacific-facing side of the island, believing that it would offer added protection against Chinese forces. It has increasingly become clear that those sites are now near-equally as vulnerable to cruise missiles, as well as other emerging threats, such as swarms of small unmanned aircraft. In May 2018, the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) sent bombers and fighter jets on a route that effectively encircled Taiwan in a clear demonstration of its capabilities. In August 2018, it had already emerged that the Taiwanese military was looking to buy additional Phalanx CIWS point defense systems to install at a number of air bases. A ground-mounted Phalanx CIWS is supposedly already part of the defensive posture around Taiwan’s immensely valuable Leshan radar station, which houses an AN/FPS-115 PAVE PAWS phased array early warning radar. The U.S. military has also employed a ground-based Phalanx CIWS system, known as Centurion , for years, to protect forward operating bases against artillery rockets, mortar bombs, and similar threats. A view of the PAVE PAWS radar at Leshan., via fas.org The video NCSIST released clearly depicts a truck-mounted Sea Oryx system defending Leshan against a Chinese cruise-missile attack. A mobile system would also give the Taiwanese military the ability to rapidly reposition the system as necessary, both to respond to new threats on short-notice or to try to escape counter-attacks. When they enter service, the land-based Sea Oryx could supplant or simply supplement ground-mounted CIWS systems at various strategic locations. They may also be able to take over from increasingly dated Antelope systems, which use the TC-1L, in a more general air defense short-range air defense role. The Antelope short-range air defense system., 玄史生 via Wikimedia It is possible that Taiwan could seek to more directly combine Phalanx CIWS and Sea Oryx, as well. NCSIST could develop a system similar to Raytheon’s SeaRAM , which replaces the CIWS’ Vulcan cannon with a RIM-116 launcher, but retains the fire control suite, creating a more self-contained system. Direct U.S. assistance in the development of Sea Oryx, or future variants of or upgrades for that system, is certainly not out of the question, either. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Administration have been major supporters of Taiwan from the beginning and have actively worked to fast-track various arms sales to the island already. Whatever the case, Sea Oryx’s on land would be just one part of Taiwan’s larger, layered air and missile defense architecture. Those defenses are only set to become increasingly important as time goes on, especially given rising tensions between authorities in Taipei and Beijing in recent months. The United States, Taiwan’s principal international benefactor, has also seen a major trade war, among other things, strain its relations with China in the past few years. Most recently, Taiwan has raised the ire of Chinese authorities by voicing support for protestors calling for greater freedoms in Hong Kong, a separate issue The War Zone has covered in-depth . “As a democratic country & a responsible member of the international community, we are concerned about #HK,” read a post from the official Twitter account of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen on Aug. 14, 2019. The reference to Taiwan as a “country” is almost certain to inflame tensions with Beijing, which sees the island as part of its integral territory and has threatened military action repeatedly if it appears that officials in Taipei are moving to declare full independence. The Chinese government has branded Tsai herself as an “ independence extremist ” in the past. So, while it’s not clear when the system will enter service, it is increasingly apparent that there is a pressing need to bolster the island’s air and missile defenses sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 9, 2019",Navy May Need More Than $5 Billion To Fix Its China Lake Base After Powerful Quakes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy may need more than $5 billion to return Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake to a “mission capable” status following a series of earthquakes back in July. The sprawling base, which houses the service’s premier developmental test facilities for aircraft and weapons , sustained significant damage, including to the highly specialized facilities and the equipment within them. A pair of major earthquakes , with registered magnitudes of 6.4 and 7.1, along with thousands of aftershocks, rocked the base and surrounding areas between July 4 and 5, 2019. Getting the facilities back up and running is a major priority for the Navy, given that China supports so much critical research and development work, which you can read all about in greater depth in these past War Zone articles . An EA-18G Growler belonging to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Nine, or VX-9, taxies under a sunstand at China Lake after some flight operations at the base resumed on July 10, 2019., USN Navy Times first reported on the potential bill to get China Lake back up and running at full capacity on Aug. 12, 2019, after obtaining a report outlining the extent of the damages and the associated costs for repairing and replacing various buildings, which is around $2 billion. A separate Navy briefing, marked “pre-decisional” and dated August 2019, that is available online says that the total price tag to rehabilitate the facility could run more than $5 billion after taking into account the need to replace various specialized equipment and other assets, as well as other ancillary costs. USN “There was damage to a majority of the buildings and infrastructure,” U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Edelson, the head of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, or NAVFAC Southwest, told Navy Times . He added that many of the structures on the base dated back to before the 1980s, meaning they did not meet present-day “seismic standards.” Approximately 20 percent of China Lake’s buildings are now either entirely unsafe to occupy or have restrictions on their use, Edelson continued. A significant number of the base’s facilities sustained so much damage that it would cost more to repair them than to just replace them completely. This is part of the reason why the potential price of making repairs at China Lake are so high. A map showing the approximate locations of various earthquakes and aftershocks within China Lake’s boundaries on July 4 and 5, 2019., USN “This [$2 billion] cost is a rough estimate for recovery of the facilities infrastructure only, and does not include specialized equipment, furniture, machine tools, telecommunications assets, consumables, or non-facilities costs,” Edelson noted to Navy Times . China Lake is absolutely covered in these kinds of assets, many of which are unique to the base. For instance, Hangar 3 at China Lake’s Armitage field, which supports various aircraft and weapons programs, suffered so much damage to its hangar and attached weapon systems software activity spaces, that the base’s Air Test and Evaluation Squadrons – VX-9 and VX-31 – cannot use the facility and other functions need to be relocated in the interim. The earthquakes broke bolts off support beams, shook stairwells apart, and burst water pipes, causing significant flooding. This is one of the structures that will need to be replaced outright, which will cost approximately $350 million. Randy Smith, seen at left, along with other employees of China Lake in front of an AV8 Harrier jump jet and Hangar 3. Smith was previously kind enough to share his personal experiences of working at the base with The War Zone ., Courtesy Randy Smith Replacing Wing 8 of China Lake’s Michelson Laboratory, which handles various testing on advanced weapon systems, account for another $270 million in projected costs. Cracks throughout this facility’s foundation have put undue stress on various supporting beams, leaving it unsafe for use. In total, there are 23 specific facilities, or groupings of facilities, in need of replacement, construction projects that will each cost an estimated $2 million or more, according to a presentation NAVFAC Southwest gave to prospective contractors on Aug. 1, 2019. This is not including a variety of other facilities in need of replacement where the cost is under $2 million. USN USN Many of the facilities in need of replacement belong to the China Lake Propulsion Laboratory (CLPL), where cracks, bowed walls, and broken heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment has again made it largely impossible for personnel to conduct their work. “Loss of China Lake Propulsion Laboratories results in inability to support critical weapons” and the damage cripples “mission capability to Combustion Sciences, ordnance, propulsion, and explosives synthesis, mixing, and casting activities,” the report that Navy Times obtained said. A collection of 22 ammunition storage magazines are no longer rated as being able to contain the necessary blast pressures, making them dangerous to continue using. There are twelve more facilities, or groupings of facilities, that will need repairs and upgrades, each with estimated costs of $1.5 million or more. There are even more buildings that will need lesser repairs or structural upgrades, the latter of which will hopefully help prevent such extensive damage as a result of future earthquakes. For instance, “150 water valves, 180 electrical transformers, and 400 electrical poles,” need repairs, according to Navy Times . USN USN As it stands now, the Navy doesn’t expect to begin even awarding contracts to replace structures until 2020 Fiscal Year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2019. The service’s goal is to have all the repairs and reconstruction finished by the end of 2020. However, NAVFAC Southwest expects to find additional problems as the repair effort gets underway, which could lead to delays. In the meantime, China Lake will be running at a very diminished capacity, which could have second-order impacts on any of a number of research and development programs. USN The earthquake damage to China Lake, and the costs to get the base back to its “mission capable” status, is just the latest natural disaster to befall U.S. military bases in recent years. The Air Force expects to spend $3 billion over the next three years to get Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida running at full capacity again after Hurricane Michael decimated it in October 2018. The Marine Corps is looking at a $3.6 billion repair bill at Camp Lejeune in the aftermath of September 2018’s Hurricane Florence. Flooding at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska caused at least another $420 million in damage. The Pentagon believes that natural disasters will only pose an increasing risk to American military bases going forward, especially when it comes to extreme weather amplified by the effects of global climate change. In January 2019, members of Congress received a U.S. military report on these issues that, among other things, said that 53 of 79 bases that are particularly critical to national security will be increasingly in danger of recurrent flooding. For China Lake, future earthquakes remain a significant threat to its infrastructure and activities. The recent quakes may end up giving the Navy an opportunity to make important improvements so that the base can continue its vital work with minimal interruptions in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Russia Will “Briefly” Evacuate Village Near Site Of Nuclear-Powered Missile Accident (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Five days after a still very mysterious explosion at a missile test site in northwestern Russia, authorities have announced what they say will be a brief evacuation of a small village nearby, despite saying this was unnecessary in the immediate aftermath of the incident. The announcement comes as evidence mounts that the accident involved a nuclear-powered cruise missile known as Burevestnik . Reports of the evacuation of the Nyonoksa, which will reportedly last only around two hours, first emerged on Aug. 13, 2019. Igor Orlov, the governor of the northwestern Arkhangelsk region where the village is located, confirmed that residents were set to briefly leave their homes. Approximately 450 people live in Nyonoksa, which sits right up against the edge of the missile test facility where the explosion occured on Aug. 8, 2019. This is “a routine measure,” Orlov insisted. Russian officials continue to claim that there was no radiation leak from the accident, despite admissions from the country’s main nuclear corporation, Rosatom, that the system that exploded included a nuclear “isotope power source.” Local emergency management authorities had initially issued alerts about a spike in ambient radiation, but then took down those notices and referred all related questions to the Russian Ministry of Defense. On Aug. 8, 2019, Orlov had said there was no need for an evacuation. A map showing the general location of Nyonoska., Google Earth A satellite image showing the location of the village of Nyonoska relative to the missile test site to the north along the coast of the White Sea., Google Earth The evidence that has emerged so far, which The War Zone has been actively reporting on , has increasingly pointed to an accident during a test involving Burevestnik , also known to NATO as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, or a separate test article related to that development. On Aug. 12, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a Tweet that seemed to confirm reports that the U.S. Intelligence Community was increasingly of this view, as well. Though there is limited information available about Burevestnik, the prevailing theory is that it uses a small nuclear reactor rather than traditional fuel to power a ramjet and give it virtually unlimited range. The inherent hazards and risks in such a design, something The War Zone has written about in detail in the past, make this a particularly controversial program and have led multiple experts to question whether the Russians will ever be able to turn the concept into a practical weapon system. Of course, the evacuation, in of itself, does not necessarily suggest that the accident is related to Burevestnik. Nyonoksa residents have told local media outlets that they have had to leave in the past over other apparent mishaps at the nearby test facility. One individual reportedly told ArkhangelskOnline about a past incident where a burning piece of debris fell on their home and started a fire. “They said that there were no changes in the radiation background and there was nothing to worry about,” another unnamed individual explained to ArkhangelskOnline . “And that everything is fine both in our village and there, in the military town. The situation is checked by experts.” However, it does seem curious that Russia would only evacuate the village now, days after the accident, given the absence of any subsequent explosions and the Kremlin’s insistence that there is no danger of radiological contamination. For comparison, a massive explosion , seen in the video below, and a major fire at an ammunition depot in Siberia on Aug. 5, 2019, almost immediately prompted authorities to ask thousands of people to evacuate the area. Still, the purportedly brief nature of the evacuation might be to prevent anyone from seeing the Kremlin bring in specialized vehicles or other equipment to help with the recovery effort that would offer further evidence of Burevestnik presence at the test site or any indications about the actual severity of any radiation leak. Images and video of Russian emergency services personnel wearing protective gear and taking unusual precautions as they transported wounded individuals to hospital in the immediate aftermath of the explosion made it virtually impossible for the Kremlin to deny that there had been a radiological component to the incident. It could also allow Russia to remove items from the site with more limited public attention. That being said, two hours seems like a relatively short amount of time for any major movement of materiel, especially if it is heavily contaminated with radiation. If nothing else, the Kremlin does appear very keen to control any information coming out of the area. Residents will reportedly depart Nyonoksa tomorrow on board a special train. It is unclear where authorities will take the villagers from there and whether they will have to stay in place for the duration of the evacuation order. There is no indication that Russian officials plan to send the residents anywhere for medical evaluations of any kind, such as possible radiation exposure. However, the evacuation does come amid unconfirmed reports that 10 employees of the Arkhangelsk Regional Clinical Hospital, situated in the region’s capital of the same name, who had been involved in treating the victims of the explosion have since gone to the Federal Medical Biophysical Center in Moscow for unexplained reasons. That is where three individuals who had suffered injuries in the blast subsequently went for treatment. At least two of those individuals have reportedly since died , adding to the five immediate fatalities from the initial accident. “There can be no openness when developing new weapons,” Andrey Zolotkov, a nuclear safety expert with Bellona , a Russian environmental group, who is based in Murmansk further to the northwest of Nyonoksa, told The Barents Observer . But then “it is necessary to play it safe while conducting such tests, especially when it involves radiation and nuclear safety,” he continued. The Kremlin has historically been very secretive about any major military accidents, especially those involving nuclear weapons or other material, which has certainly helped fuel rumors and speculation in this case, as well. One Nyonoksa resident reportedly told TV29 , another local news outlet, that they would rather walk off into the woods than get on the official train out of town. This state of affairs is unfortunately not uncommon. There is similarly very little in the way of hard details about a fire onboard the Russian Navy’s top-secret nuclear-powered spy submarine Losharik on July 1, 2019, which killed 14 sailors. Another submarine fire sunk the one-of-a-kind Soviet nuclear-powered submarine K-278 Komsomolets in 1989 and that boat is now leaking radiation at the bottom of the Barents Sea. Regardless of exactly what the Kremlin was testing at Nyonoksa and how serious the accident might have been, all of this still underscores the dangers of testing nuclear-powered systems so close to populated areas. In 2018, the Russians appear to have decided to move Burevestnik testing from the remote Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the country’s Arctic region, an area that has served as a nuclear weapon testing ground in the past, to Nyonoksa, but it is unclear why they chose to do so. If this testing continues at that site, it only raises the potential for more radiological accidents in the future. It’s also worth remembering that even if Burevestnik works as advertised, test launching a nuclear-powered missile will always involve deliberately crashing a nuclear reactor into the ground or ocean. It is perhaps also worth noting that in his Tweet, Trump also alluded to “similar, though more advanced, technology,” though it is unclear what he might have been referring to. The United States did experiment with its own nuclear-powered missile concept during the Cold War, but abandoned those efforts. The U.S. military is now looking into small nuclear reactors, but to provide battlefield power . This didn’t stop Dmitri Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesperson, from pushing back on Trump’s claims, stating “our president has repeatedly said that the level of Russian projects is way higher than the level reached by other countries and is quite unique.” Whatever the case, back in Nyonoksa, it will be interesting to see if the evacuation ends up being as brief as Russian authorities say it will be. Update: 5:45 PM EST— Russian officials have now canceled the previously announced evacuation of Nyonoksa, saying that the Russian Ministry of Defense had called off a planned exercise in the area. Russian authorities also rescinded a navigational warning for all civilian and commercial ships to avoid a wide swath of the White Sea, which had suggested there might be another missile test coming, despite the accident last week.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 2, 2019",Chinese Paramilitary Police Have Appeared In Force Near Hong Kong As Tension Mounts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A massive convoy of armored vehicles, trucks, and other vehicles belonging to China’s paramilitary People’s Armed Police, or PAP, has assembled in the city of Shenzhen. This is less than 20 miles to the northwest of Hong Kong, where protests have been ongoing against authorities in that semi-autonomous region for months now. Chinese authorities say that the deployment is merely part of a scheduled exercise, but it comes after officials on the mainland said the demonstrations showed the “budding shoots of terrorism,” a heavy-handed statement that many have taken to be a threat of an imminent crackdown. Pictures and video clips of the PAP vehicles, which includes WZ-551 armored personnel carriers with bulldozer blades and construction equipment that could be useful in removing barricades, congregating in the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center appeared on social media on Aug. 12, 2019. The People’s Daily , the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and its tabloid offshoot Global Times , both published official videos of the convoy that same day, describing the event as preparations for a major drill. The South China Morning Post , an independent outlet based in Hong Kong, reportedly tried to interview some of the paramilitary personnel, but they “shook their heads and said nothing” when asked to confirm they were only there for an exercise. The PAP , which is primarily responsible for internal security duties, reports to both the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the country’s Central Military Commission, though it is not a component of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). “In the past few days, Hong Kong’s radical demonstrators have repeatedly attacked police officers with extremely dangerous tools, which already constitutes serious violent crimes and has begun to show signs of terrorism,” Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Chinese State Council’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, had said earlier on Aug. 12, 2019. “This is a gross violation of the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong … violent crimes must be resolutely cracked down in accordance with the law, without hesitation or mercy.” It has often been difficult to assess the character of the demonstrations in Hong Kong, even with an immense amount of photographic and video documentation. There has certainly been at least some level of violence from portions of the protest movement. At the same time, though, there have been claims that Hong Kong Police have infiltrated, or at least tried to infiltrate , protestor groups in order to commit acts of violence that authorities could pin on them. There has also been significant evidence of police brutality and possible collaboration between authorities and violent counter-protesters . The protests initially erupted in June 2019 over a proposed new law that would have made it easier for Chinese authorities to seek the extradition of individuals from Hong Kong, weakening the semi-autonomous region’s separate judicial system. In 1997, Hong Kong, which had been a British colony for more than 150 years, returned to Chinese control. As part of the repatriation agreement, Beijing promised to respect a “one country, two systems” arrangement for the next 50 years, affording Hong Kong substantial political and other freedoms compared to the rest of the country. Authorities in Hong Kong have shelved the proposed extradition bill indefinitely, but now demonstrators are calling on them to meet a total of five demands . These are the complete abandonment of that law, a retraction of the official description of a massive protest on June 12 as a “riot,” unconditional release of all arrested protesters, the creation of an independent commission to investigate the police’s handling of the protests, and universal suffrage. At present, an Election Committee of designated business, community, and political leaders in the semi-autonomous region nominate a Chief Executive, which China’s central State Council then either approves or rejects. In addition, limited electorates are responsible for choosing 30 of the 70 members of the region’s legislative assembly. Riot police conduct operations near the seat of Hong Kong’s legislature after protesters stormed the building on July 2, 2019. , Kyodo via AP Images It seems extremely unlikely that authorities in Hong Kong will give in to the protesters’ demands. At the same time, it remains to be seen whether or not the PAP contingent in Shenzhen will actually move into the region as part of a more serious crackdown to finally bring the demonstrations to an end. On Aug. 1, 2019, Major General Chen Daoxiang, the commander of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in Hong Kong, also had very strong words for the protestors. “The incidents have seriously violated the bottom line of ‘one country, two systems.’ This should not be tolerated and we express our strong condemnation,” he said. The same day, the garrison released a video of its own personnel conducting anti-riot exercises. Observers on the ground and elsewhere took this to be a veiled threat, but the PLA, or the PAP, has yet to intervene. It seems clear that the PAP deployment in Shenzhen is meant to be a signal, but it is hard to judge how close Chinese authorities may be to actually moving troops or paramilitary police into Hong Kong to put down the protests. There have been rumors for weeks now that Beijing might launch a crackdown, raising fears that there could be a repeat of the brutal suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing 30 years ago. The Hong Kong Police have already downplayed State Council spokesperson Yang’s terrorism comments, saying they will continue treating the situation as a violent protest. However, Yang’s statement marked a significant departure from another statement from his office just a week ago, which expressed confidence in the region’s authorities to handle the situation. On Aug. 12, 2019, protestors effectively shut down Hong Kong’s airport, in a significant escalation of the situation. The concern for Chinese authorities is not limited to the future of Hong Kong. How Beijing treats the demonstration could have direct impacts on protests throughout the country in the future, despite heavy censorship of what is going on in the semi-autonomous region. In addition, protestors have called for a “ Free Hong Kong ” in the past, which Chinese officials may see as a call for independence, something that would almost certainly be a red line for the regime in Beijing. Tolerating that sort of language in Hong Kong could bolster calls in other parts of the country, such as Taiwan and the far-western Xinjiang region, the latter of which is already in the midst of what appears to be a concerted ethnic cleansing effort against the Uighur population , the majority of whom are Muslims. Protesters have, at times, carried the old British colonial flag , as well as American flags , inciting the ire of Chinese officials. The United States, which is the middle of a trade war with China and has a number of simmering disputes with authorities in Beijing, including Chinese claims to the South China Sea and the status of Taiwan , has offered some moral support to the demonstrators. At the same time, it is important to note that Hong Kong is not Beijing and China, as a whole, is a very different country than it was 30 years ago during the Tiananmen Square massacre. Chinese authorities will have to balance their desire to present a certain image on the global stage against the potential fallout of allowing the protests to continue without any real end in sight. The protesters themselves have said that if the PLA or PAP were to come in, that they would likely disperse in order to avoid a violent confrontation. This, however, would not tackle many of the underlying issues, including increasingly problematic economic inequality, that could provoke demonstrations again in the future. It’s worth remembering that Hong Kong saw similar mass protests for more than two months in 2014 over proposed changes to the region’s electoral system, which came to an end relatively peacefully and resulted in no concessions from the region’s authorities. What happens in the next few days, or even hours, might determine whether the protests continue or if Beijing finally decides to intervene. With the PAP force already in Shenzhen, it should become apparent relatively soon whether they are actually there for an exercise or are in position for a more active mission in Hong Kong.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you are in the market for a very good condition, meticulously maintained, and low time 747-400 VIP jet, you may be in luck. Oh yeah, it also has a very prestigious past—it flew the Prime Minister and Emperor of Japan, and their entourages, around for nearly three decades in the role as Japan’s own Air Force One. The very special GE CF6 powered jumbo jet—serial 24730 that was registered by Japanese Air Self Defense Force as 20-1101, but now carries the registration N7474C—was built in 1991. It has remarkably low hours considering its age, with just 16,332 hours of flight time and 13,569 landings racked-up on this red and white 28-year-old beauty. Most of those hours had to have been short training flights as the crews of the JASDF’s Special Air Group that operated it had to keep current. Japan Airlines Co. has meticulously maintained the aircraft under contract over the years., JASDF The listing reads : VIP. One of the lowest time Boeing 747-400’s in the world. Aircraft has been maintained to the highest possible standard. Shows like new. Bed room, Shower, office and lounge area. Aircraft will be delivered fresh from C-check and paint. This looks like a factory new aircraft. Some of the images in the listing—the ornate conference room and bedroom—are not from this aircraft, they are from the ex-Qatari 747SP that has been up for sale for some time. It seems they serve as representative placeholders of modifications to come. Apparently, the aircraft had the stateroom and VIP living space ripped out before it was brought to the United States. A new stateroom and VIP suite are being installed to outfit the aircraft to a level even better than before. See the tweet below: The stateroom area was never photographed to my knowledge supposedly due to security reasons, but a video of the setup does exist: Beyond those modifications, the aircraft has a tasteful, but far more austere interior than what is commonly found on other VIP aircraft, and especially 747s . It is more of a mix of first and business class seating, work areas, a unique elevated area for in-flight press conferences, and an office area. Controller.com Controller.com Controller.com This is one of two 747-400s that served the highest echelons of Japan’s government and often flew together on high-profile international trips. Both are being retired and replaced with new Boeing 777-300ERs, the first of which was delivered last summer and just entered service in April of 2019. The second 777-300ER is scheduled for delivery this December. The other 747 is already in the United States , as well. The best description of the interior of the aircraft when it was in service comes from a feature done on it by Asahi.com . It reads in part: The rearmost section is a regular passenger area for reporters and accompanying government personnel. The seats are slightly larger than those of regular commercial planes, and the area has a configuration of two seats on each window side and four seats in the middle. Three large chairs facing rearward are placed on the podium in front of the seats. Microphones are also installed for news conferences. Moving farther to the front, there is a section for senior officials and other personnel accompanying the mission, which is equivalent to business class seating. Going even farther, there is a secretarial area with 11 seats spaced out and away from each other because secretaries need to work while traveling. There is a table in the meeting room set aside by a door, while fax machines and photocopiers are set up in the workroom. Special Airlift Group members who have no tasks during the flight take up seats on the upper level, which is characteristic of the layout of a jumbo jet. Going even farther to the front on the lower level, there is supposedly a VIP room. But the Defense Ministry doesn’t disclose the details, citing crisis management. However, the VIP room was opened to the media in November 1991 before the aircraft were placed into service. The Asahi Shimbun reported at the time: “In the VIP room in the front-most section on the lower level, there are the prime minister’s office, a sofa bed, a ladies’ room for his wife.” The interior layout will stay basically the same in the new aircraft, which will replace the old ones in April, the officials said. The feature also notes just how little these aircraft have been used on executive missions: The current planes flew 318 times in the past 27 years, making stops at 269 locations in 100 countries. They have been used not only to transport the emperor or prime ministers but also to dispatch members of the SDF and the Japan Disaster Relief Team. The two aircraft that had served as Japan’s Air Force One, 20-1101 and 20-1102., JASDF The aircraft up for sale served 14 Prime Ministers during its 28-year-long career with the JASDF.  With a listing price of $28,000,000, it comes in just shy of the price of a new Challenger 650 super-midsize private jet. Considering its relatively low usage and pristine condition, one would think there would be a buyer out there for this aircraft, although few individuals, or even governments, have a true need for a 747-400 nor the deep pockets required to operate and maintain one. Those that do seem to be upgrading to the 747-8i or 777 and a quick pace, including the United States when it comes to its Air Force One . Still, this aircraft costs less than 1/13th the price of a new 747-8i, and that is before the custom interior installation. As such, a charter operator or one of the casino groups may see the aircraft as a unique and highly attractive opportunity. If anything else, the very idea that you can buy the ex-Japanese Air Force One is certain to add a bit of extra hot sauce to the jumbo jet listing .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Evidence Grows That Russia’s Nuclear-Powered Doomsday Missile Was What Blew Up Last Week (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rumors and speculation continue to swirl around a radiological accident last week at a missile test site in northwestern Russia even as officials held a memorial service today for those who died in the incident. The Kremlin has now acknowledged that the incident killed at least seven scientists and other personnel from a major state nuclear research laboratory, who were working on a system that included a small nuclear reactor at the time. This same lab is linked to the development of a nuclear-powered cruise missile called Burevestnik and U.S. intelligence officials are reportedly increasingly of the view that one of these weapons, or a test article related to it, exploded in this mishap. Late on Aug. 11, 2019, Valentin Kostiukov, the director of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center-All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, also known by the acronym RFNC-VNIIEF, along with the institute’s scientific director Vyacheslav Solovyev and deputy scientific director Aleksandr Chernyshev, held a televised press briefing regarding the accident. RFNC-VNIIEF falls under Russia’s top nuclear Corporation, Rosatom, which first admitted its involvement in the incident at the Nyonoksa missile test site in the country’s Arkhangelsk region and that the explosion had occured during work on a system that included a nuclear “isotope power source,” on Aug. 9, 2019. “The death of our staff members is a bitter loss for the nuclear center and the Rosatom state corporation. The researchers are national heroes,” Kostyukov said , adding he had recommended that this individual pothumously receive state awards and honors. “They were the elite of the Russian federal nuclear center and sometimes they were carrying out tests in extremely difficult conditions.” Neither Kostyukov, nor the other two representatives from the RFNC-VNIIEF, offered any details about what specifically the scientists had been working on. “One of the lines [of research and development] is the creation of sources of thermal or electric energy using radioactive materials, including fissile materials and radioisotope materials,” Solovyev said, also noting work on small nuclear reactors. Solovyev continued on to point out that there are potential military and civilian applications of such developments both on earth and in space, specifically highlighting the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Kilopower program as an example of a non-military endeavor occurring elsewhere in the world. The U.S. military is also investigating a number of small nuclear reactor designs as possible battlefield power sources, projects The War Zone has explored previously in-depth . VNIIEF could certainly be working on small nuclear reactors for various applications. Given the Kilopower reference, there is the possibility that the “isotope power source” in question may have been a radioisotope thermoelectric generator or a small nuclear reactor for use on satellites or other spacecraft. The liquid fuel rocket motor, which reportedly was the component of the overall system that actually exploded, might point to some sort of launch vehicle that could have supported a test to see how a new generator or reactor design might respond to the stresses of getting blasted into orbit. However, there are various additional details that continue to point to the nebulous Burevestnik program. The U.S. Intelligence Community, which would have access to additional sources of information not available to the public, is reportedly increasingly of this view, as well, according to report on Aug. 12, 2019, from The New York Times . Russia’s President Vladimir Putin first revealed this weapon, also known to NATO as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, in a speech in March 2018. Subsequent reports, citing U.S. intelligence officials, suggested that Russians had been testing it for since at least 2017, unsuccessfully , in Novaya Zemlya , an archipelago in the country’s Arctic region that served as a nuclear weapon proving ground in the past. Details remain scarce about Burevestnik and how it works, but the most prominent working theory is that its main propulsion source is a nuclear ramjet . A weapon in this configuration would use rocket motors – potentially liquid-fueled, which would explain the source of the explosion in this accident – to boost it to the optimal speed for the ramjet to work. After that, air would pass over the nuclear reactor and get heated before passing through an exhaust nozzle at the rear to produce thrust. This, in principle, would give the weapon virtually unlimited range and a maximum flying time measured in days or weeks. Another possibility might be that it uses a nuclear thermal rocket , which uses a liquid fuel source instead of air, but this would have a more limited flight time compared to an air-breathing design given its use of a more finite fuel source. Reports of “liquid fuel” may also point to a liquid fuel reactor design. Whatever the case, the officials from the RFNC-VNIIEF said that preparations had been underway for the test at Nyonoksa, also sometimes written Nenoksa, for around a year. This would line up with observations, including from commercial satellite imagery, that researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California had made in the same timeframe. Satellite imagery indicated that Russia had at least begun dismantling the suspected location of the Burevestnik tests – located in the first place by analyzing a video, seen above, of a purported test launch of one of the missiles that the Kremlin released with Putin’s speech – in Novaya Zemlya between July and August 2018. A very similar looking facility subsequently appeared in imagery from Nyonoksa. This adds to other existing evidence that suggests a Burevestnik, or at least a test article related to that program, was the source of the accident. This includes the presence of the nuclear fuel carrier ship Serebryanka , which typically carries nuclear fuel rods or similar cargoes, near Nyonoksa at the time of the incident. This ship would be a good choice for transporting Burevestnik and was reportedly among the ships Russia had sent out on a mission in 2018 to recover one or more of the missiles that had crashed in the waters around Novaya Zemlya. Still, much remains unknown about the test and the actual severity of the accident, which reportedly led to at least a brief spike in radiation and involved a blast powerful enough to register at monitoring sites that exist to watch for signs of nuclear weapon testing . The Russian Ministry of Defense has since claimed that there was no radiation leak and has compelled local authorities to take down online notices about the recorded increased background radiation. So far, there have been no similar reports from other monitoring organizations in the region. Beyond that, it is unclear how much progress the Burevestnik program may have made toward anything approaching a viable weapon system, if that is even possible . The United States experimented with a similar concept during the Cold War, but abandoned it due to the complexities surrounding developing a reactor small enough to fit in a reasonably sized missile and the dangers inherent to the design. Most problematically, the lightened, miniaturized reactor would have been unshielded, meaning that the weapon’s exhaust would have spewed out dangerous amounts of radioactive material the entire way to its target. “It’s unclear if someone in the Russian defense industrial bureaucracy may have managed to convince a less technically informed leadership that this is a good idea, but the United States tried this, quickly discovered the limitations and risks, and abandoned it with good reason,” Ankit Panda, a nuclear expert with the Federation of American Scientists, told The Times . The Kremlin may also have simply initiated the Burevestnik project with the intent of using it, and the possibility of stopping the development, as a bargaining chip in future arms control negotiations with the United States. Whether or not this accident actually involved Burevestnik, it will certainly open up the Kremlin to increasing criticism over that project, as well as other projects involving nuclear power given the country’s already spotty safety record. Russia is also working on a nuclear-powered nuclear-armed torpedo and an ostensibly civilian-focused floating nuclear power plant , both of which have already been controversial developments . The floating nuclear power plant Akademik Lomonosov is reportedly on its way right now to the city of Pevek in Russia’s Far East. The Russian government has been providing a small, but a steady trickle of information about this recent accident at Nyonoksa, but the Kremlin has a history of being particularly secretive about any major military mishaps , especially those that could have a radiological component . Russia has been equally reluctant to share information about a fire that occured on the nuclear-power spy submarine Losharik on July 1, 2019. Reports had also emerged later that a sunken Soviet-era nuclear submarine was leaking much more radiation than previously understood, though Russian and Norweigan researchers insisted that the depth of the wreck and its general location mean this presents a more limited risk to surrounding areas. It may take decades to get a clearer picture of what happened, if that happens at all. Update: 6:30 PM EST— U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have confirmed that the U.S. Intelligence Community has at least strong suspicions that a Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, or a prototype thereof, was involved in the accident last week. Trump Tweeted about the incident late on Aug. 12, 2019, describing it using the NATO nickname for the weapon, “Skyfall.” Previous reports have identified this moniker, but no U.S. or other NATO officials have used it publicly before, suggesting that the social media post followed a formal briefing on the topic. Trump also said that the United States possessed “similar, though more advanced, technology,” though it is not clear whether or not he was referring to an active nuclear-powered missile program or the Cold War-era U.S. experiments with the concept.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 7, 2020",Something Big Seems To Be Going Down Near Area 51 This Weekend,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) seems to be hosting a significant test—or tests—of some sort this weekend, at least according to fragmented reports from various sources. Keep in mind, the nature of the topic makes attempting to draw any hard conclusions as to what exactly is afoot in the large swathes of cordoned off airspace that sit over southern Nevada a grossly speculative game that isn’t really the purpose of this post. With that in mind, here is what we hearing. A handful of interesting Notices To Airman (NOTAMs) had been published that identify distinct restricted areas within the NTTR that are being placed off-limits to any air traffic at any altitude. Keep in mind, these NOTAMs are for military aircrews, not wayward civilian planes or light aircraft trying to weave around the NTTR over the weekend when some of the Military Operating Areas (MOAs) may be “cold” (not in use). Twitter user Bryan Herbert , who keeps an eye on aerial happenings and breaking news events throughout the region, first posted about the NOTAM on August 8th. That notice was for R-4806E, an elongated north-to-south block of restricted airspace that measures roughly 50 by 15 miles and sits south of the small community of Alamo and east of R-4806W. R-4806W includes Dog Bone Dry Lake. A number of air-to-ground targets and a MOUT facility that is often used for JTAC training and other ground and air asset integration exercises are located there. At the center of R-4806E, the restricted airspace in question, is Desert Dry Lake, but nothing is really located there or on the stretch of ground that sits below this airspace as a whole. It’s also worth noting that Desert Lake sits roughly 30 miles southeast of Groom Lake/Area 51. VFR sectional via VFRMap.com Another NOTAM was posted on the 10th of August for the same airspace, with the effective time beginning at 8:00 PM local time. Like the first NOTAM that was posted a couple of days earlier, this one is also basically from the ground to unlimited altitude. Then another NOTAM was posted that spans a couple of days starting on the evening of August 10th that closes airspace from the surface of the earth to unlimited altitude. But this one is for another block of restricted airspace, a massive one that sits on the western flank of Area 51’s notorious no-go ‘box’ that hangs over the clandestine installation. This NOTAM is active from midnight on August 11th all the way through 5:59 AM on August 12th. VFR sectional via VFRMap.com In addition to these NOTAMs, keen-eyed airplane trackers noticed odd Janet flights out to Area 51 and surrounding installations such as Tonopah Test Range Airport scheduled for the weekend. This unusual activity is largely understood to be indicative of a major test event, or test events, occurring out of and over Area 51 and/or other parts of the surrounding NTTR. The NTTR is used for all types of training , test flights, and classified developmental exercises for emerging capabilities . As such, setting aside airspace for certain tasks is not uncommon. But this type of activity on the weekend and the unlimited altitude blocks declared in the NOTAMs are intriguing. In regards to the NOTAMs, some have mentioned the possibility of a test rocket launch of some kind due to the unlimited altitude restrictions, which would be odd for the NTTR as it doesn’t usually support that type of testing or operations, at least not in the traditional rocket manner . Laser and other more exotic directed energy weapon systems may require fully sanitized airspace up to space for safety concerns. In fact, such a system could even be used against space assets themselves. Still, maybe these are just precautions for testing very sensitive aircraft outside of the Groom Lake ‘box.’ And yes, especially if they are capable of extreme altitudes. Of course, there are many other potential explanations. They don’t call Area 51 “Dreamland” for nothing and its own relatively limited airspace would certainly get augmented by the surrounding ranges for expanded testing as required—especially on the weekends when normal military traffic is at a minimum. N-4807A also contains the Tolicha Peak Electronic Combat Range (ECR), a critical complex that is dotted with real and simulated enemy air defense and electronic warfare systems that is highly relevant to the development of future air combat systems and the fine-tuning of tactics and subsystems for ones that are already in operation. Just days ago, another test flight was up over Groom Lake under the callsign Romeo, with Northrop Grumman’s Gulfstream testbed aircraft— N99NG , which is equipped with a ventral gondola radome usually associated with ground-moving target indicator radars (like JSTARS )—flying along with it under the callsign Juliet 41. A full account of the communications from this test flight, which were also recorded, can be found over at Dreamlandresort under this thread . In recent years, people immediately surmise that literally anything secretive that goes on out of Groom Lake or over the surrounding range complex has to do with the B-21 Raider’s development . This phenomenon has reached an almost comical degree even in parts of the defense media ecosystem. Although it is possible if not probable that testing does occur related, even if tangentially, to the Raider program, it is worth keeping in mind that places like Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport , and the NTTR to even a larger degree, support many disparate classified programs at any given time. Some are more sensitive than America’s next stealth bomber and some are less so. And some are likely highly impressive and exotic, while others are far less glamorous. So, no, none of this is proof of the B-21 program flying some sort of a test article out there or even doing some type of surrogate testing in a case like this. That doesn’t mean it isn’t possible, there are just so many other possible explanations and few facts to leverage in which to make such a definitive determination. So there you have it. It looks like a busy weekend for America’s premier clandestine flight test center and its surroundings. Once again, this post is about starting a discussion.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2019",Russia Admits Mysterious Missile Engine Explosion Involved A Nuclear ‘Isotope Power Source’ (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s state-run nuclear corporation Rosatom says that a team of its employees had been working on an experimental “isotope power source” when it exploded, killing five people and injuring three more in a still very mysterious accident yesterday. The company offered no specifics about the project, but this new information, coupled with other details, suggests that this power source may be associated with a nuclear-powered cruise missile called Burevestnik that the Kremlin first announced publicly last year. The accident occurred near the village of Nyonoksa, also written Nenoksa, in the northwestern Russian region of Arkhangelsk on Aug. 8, 2019. This is a known test site for both cruise and ballistic missiles. There have been no previous reports that Russia has previously tested Burevestnik, also known to NATO as SSC-X-9 Skyfall, which Russian President Vladimir Putin first revealed the existence of in a speech in March 2018, at this particular location. Previous reports, citing anonymous U.S. officials, indicate that the Russians had been testing this missile, details about which are extremely limited, since at least 2017 , from Novaya Zemlya , a remote archipelago in Russia’s far north that has also served as a nuclear weapon testing ground. “The tragedy happened while working with the engineering and technical support of the isotope power source in a liquid propulsion system,” Rosatom’s statement reads . “Five employees … were killed while testing a liquid propulsion system. Three of our colleagues received injuries and burns of varying severity.” The statement does not specifically mention Burevestnik, but the general description Rosatom gave sounds similar in many ways to what is known about this weapon’s propulsion system. The cruise missile reportedly has a nuclear-powered ramjet engine that uses rocket boosters – as seen in the video of a purported previous test of the weapon below – to get it to an optimal speed. At that point, the fast-moving air would then blow over the hot reactor, before squirting out an exhaust nozzle to generate thrust. The presence of the nuclear fuel carrier ship Serebryanka in the area at the time of the accident also points to Burevestnik. This ship was reportedly part of a flotilla that Russia sent into the Arctic to reportedly recover one or more crashed Burevestniks last year. The vessel, which is configured to safely transport nuclear fuel rods and similar cargo, would be well suited to carrying nuclear-powered cruise missiles. This ship remains inside a portion of the Dvina Bay in the White Sea that the Russian government closed off to all public and commercial activity after the incident. It’s not clear how a liquid fuel rocket motor or jet engine, the component that reportedly exploded, might fit into the Burevestnik’s design. It is possible that the system uses liquid fuel rocket boosters to get it to the necessary speeds for the ramjet to work. The incident in question may have also involved an experimental configuration with a small nuclear reactor installed, but a conventional jet engine providing actual propulsion, in order to evaluate other features ahead of full tests of the missile in a more representative configuration. Another possibility could be that this was a reference to a liquid nuclear fuel-powered reactor . Unlike a missile using a conventional jet engine or rocket motor, the nuclear power plant could potentially keep the missile flying for weeks on end and give it virtually unlimited range , making it a nightmare for anyone trying to defend against it. Unfortunately, this also means that any test of the weapon, even one without a live warhead, still involves launching a radioactive payload. Whether or not the test fails – and crashes or explodes – or the missile succeeds in reaching its destination, it will always involve crashing a nuclear reactor into the ground or the ocean. Of course, there remains a possibility that this incident was unrelated to Burevestnik, but this weapon is the only one that Russia has announced publicly that it is working on that involves a nuclear power source. Whatever the case, it remains worrisome that the Kremlin would be testing any such propulsion system in such relatively close proximity to population centers. Reported testing of the Burevestnik in Novaya Zemlya had made good sense. Questions remain about how much radiation may have leaked out as a result of the accident. City officials in Severodvinsk, to the east of Nyonoksa, initially reported that there had been a brief spike in radiation based on readings of up to 20 millisieverts per hour from two sensors that are part of an automated civil defense system. Typical background radiation for the area is 0.11 millisieverts per hour. There are reports that sales of iodine, which can help prevent radiation absorption in the body, surged after the incident , though there does not to be any confirmation that officials had actually ordered residents to take it. A map showing the relative locations of Nyonoksa, at left, and Severodvinsk, at right., Google Maps However, Severodvinsk authorities did say that the radiation levels had returned to normal within hours of the accident. The Russian Ministry of Defense subsequently denied any radiation leak whatsoever. Late on Aug. 8, 2019, officials in Severodvinsk pulled down the alerts about radiation that they had posted online in Russian and in English, deferring to the Ministry of Defense. Regardless, it seems very clear that there was at least some release of radiation. The Norweigan Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, also known by the acronym DSA, which has a close working relationship with its counterparts in Russia, issued its own statement on Aug. 9, 2019, to say that it had received reports about a radiation leak, but noted that it had not detected any increased radiation from its own sensors. “Six persons are receiving treatment [in Russia] after receiving higher doses of radiation,” the statement noted, though it does not say if any of them had died from the exposure. “No increased levels of radioactivity has [sic] been found, but the DSA will continue to monitor.” Pictures and video of Russian personnel in protective gear screening helicopters bringing in the wounded and ambulance drivers taking similar precautions as they took the individuals to a local hospital would certainly seem to imply that they had sustained significant radiation exposure. This could also have been standard precautions given the radiological nature of the incident. If a Burevestnik missile, or a test article related to that weapon’s development, was involved in the accident, it is not clear how the incident might impact the program going forward. Previous reports, citing unnamed U.S. government officials, had said that the program had suffered numerous failures already. How serious Russia is or isn’t about the missile, and how viable a weapon it could ever be at all, remains up for debate. The Kremlin has stressed in the past that Burevestnik does not fall under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, with the United States, but it has also indicated that it might be willing to include it in a revised or all-new agreement. This raises the possibility that Russia may have begun development of this high-risk system, along with a similarly controversial nuclear-powered torpedo called Poseidon, at least in part, simply so it could offer to end the program in return for concessions from the U.S. government in future arms control negotiations. Whatever happens, it will certainly be interesting to see what, if any, additional information the Kremlin might release about this incident going forward now that an arm of the Russian government has gone on the record to admit to the accident at least tangentially involved radioactive material. Update: 8/10/2019— The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors compliance with this agreement prohibiting nuclear explosions for any purpose, has issued a statement saying that they detected the incident coinciding with the accident at Nyonoksa seismically and via infrasound. However, they did not say that they believed what they had detected was a nuclear weapon detonating.

U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Bill Galinis, Program Executive Officer for Ships at Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), revealed these new details in a panel discussion at the American Society of Naval Engineers’ annual Fleet Maintenance and Modernization Symposium, which began on Aug. 7, 2019, and in a subsequent interview with USNI News . At present, the Navy plans to buy 13 Flight III Arleigh Burkes through the 2025 Fiscal Year . The Service had expected to begin ordering LSCs in 2023, but by March 2019 this schedule had already gotten pushed back . “We’ve kind of notionally put a target date of sometime in 2026 or so, give or take, for the Large Surface Combatant, but I would tell you that’s not set in stone,” Galinis told USNI News . “The current force structure assessment that’s ongoing is going to also play into those conversations, and we won’t get that until this fall.” “We’re even considering right now, as we have these conceptual discussions on the Large Surface Combatant, do we need something beyond even a Flight III on the 51s?” the officer had asked rhetorically during the panel discussion. “And again, I tell people, the budget always gets a vote, so you’ve got to think about what the Navy is doing over the next five to 10 years in terms of ship construction.” A general overview of the improvements made to the Flight III Arleigh Burkes over previous variants., GAO In March 2019, the Navy had released latest long-term shipbuilding plan, which included an aggressive set of plans to get the service to its long-standing goal of 355 ships by 2034. This included the service’s planned acquisition of a new class of guided missile frigates , the Colombia class ballistic missile submarines, additional Ford class aircraft carriers , and much more . You can read The War Zone ‘s deep analysis of the shipbuilding plan here . The LSC is another part of this discussion and any delays in purchasing and deploying those ships could impact the Navy’s ability to reach its 355-ship target. The service first began talking publicly about these proposed new surface ships in any real detail in 2018 and released requests for information to shipbuilders and systems integrators in February 2019. At that time, the Navy made it clear that it wanted the LSCs to use the same AN/SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) as the Flight III Arleigh Burkes , as well as the latest iteration of the Aegis Combat System , which will also be found first on those destroyers. There also needs to be “Additional capacity for an embarked warfare commander and staff,” according to the contracting announcement. This latter capability is what sets the Ticonderogas apart from the existing Arleigh Burkes . The video below gives an overview of the AN/SPY-6(V)1 AMDR that will go on the Flight III Arleigh Burke -class ships. The Navy wants the ships to have an improved “Vertical Launch System to accommodate longer and larger diameter missiles for increased speed and range of weapons,” too. There is also a demand for a 360-degree defensive system suite using directed energy weapons, such as lasers or high power microwaves , to defeat a variety of threats, including incoming missiles and small unmanned aircraft . Perhaps most importantly, the Navy wants a ship with “increased flexibility/adaptability” to make it easier to maintain and replace existing systems, as well upgrade them in the future. The service similarly called for an initial design that had features to reduce the ship’s radar cross-section and other signatures and that could accommodate further signature reductions in the future. Beyond these requirements, the Navy has offered little additional detail about what it expects the ships to look like or what capabilities they might have. Months after posting the request for information, the service says it still working on laying out its basic requirements. “It’s a question of how much speed do you need, how much speed can you afford, how much do you want. How much signature are you willing to pay for? What payloads are you going to put in?” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Gene Black, the service’s Director of Surface Warfare, said at Surface Navy Association gathering in July 2019. “The things I know: I want a big sensor, I need big computing power, and I want some big magazines. Beyond that, we’re not entirely sure.” The Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers, a sage unto themselves that The War Zone has written about extensively , remain a good example of what the higher end of potential LSC concepts might look like., USN Unfortunately, it’s not clear if something like a Flight IV Arleigh Burke could help bridge the gap between the Flight III ships and the new LSC. The original design dates back to the 1980s. More than a year ago , Rear Admiral Galinis made it clear that the Navy was of the opinion that the Flight III design had hit “naval architectural limits of the … hullform.” The Flight IIIs are already substantially different from their earlier cousins, with a longer and stronger hull and a more robust deckhouse to accommodate the AN/SPY-6. In all, the new derivative involved changes to 50 percent of the technical drawings associated with the Aleigh Burke class. The Navy has already reached the same kind of developmental end state with the Ticonderoga class, which features a derivative of the now-retired Spruance -class destroyer ‘s hullform. Those cruisers are known to be overloaded and prone to persistent cracking in their aluminum superstructures that is costly and time consuming to repair. There may be some possibility of miniaturizing or otherwise reducing the size and weight of certain existing components to create more trade space within the Flight III design. However, it may be difficult to make any serious changes to the size and weight of various large systems, such as vertical launch system arrays , which need to be able to accommodate increasingly larger missiles , or the propulsion system. A program to develop an improved integrated electric propulsion system for existing Arleigh Burke destroyers, a potentially space-saving and maintenance reducing effort, was a resounding failure and the Navy abandoned the plan last year. Though the Navy had considered using a similar propulsion arrangement on the Flight III ships, in the end, these upcoming destroyers will have three uprated generators to provide necessary additional power, not an integrated electric system. It is worth noting that members of the House of Representatives have sought to include language in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the 2020 Fiscal Year, that would compel the Navy to resume work on an integrated propulsion system upgrade for the Arleigh Burkes . The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Truxtun , which served as the testbed for the integrated electric propulsion system upgrade., USN Whatever the Navy might manage to add onto a new subclass of the ships, one of the biggest issues will be how to power it all. The Arleigh Burke is effectively maxed out when it comes to power generation already. The main reason the planned propulsion system upgrade failed was that it simply could not keep all of the Arleigh Burke ‘s vital systems running at once. Advanced guided missile destroyers have notoriously voracious appetites for power and this will only increase times goes on. New radars and other sensors, as well as directed energy weapons, need significant amounts of juice, especially when they all have to be working at the same time in a combat situation. “We’re looking at the timing,” Galinis told USNI News , referring to the schedule for the LSC compared to other shipbuilding programs. “We know we have to recapitalize the surface fleet, but when does that kind of fit in, and if it moves out, do we need to do something more with the [ Arleigh Burkes ] to keep them combat relevant?” As the likely schedule to being purchases of LSCs slips, which, in turn, can only delay when those future ships might actually enter service, the Navy may still see few options beyond trying to squeeze even more out of the Alreigh Burke design, despite having declared it maxed out time and again in the recent past.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An image has emerged online of what looks to be several official or semi-official pins or similarly sized metallic items depicting a variety of products from China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, also known as the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation. One of these appears to be a previously unseen design, which could be manned or unmanned, but is almost certainly related to a still unidentified stealthy flying wing unmanned aircraft design that the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Chengdu’s parent company, first displayed publicly with virtually no fanfare at the biennial Zhuhai Airshow in 2018. Chinese military aviation expert Andreas Rupprecht was among the first to spot the pin after it appeared on Chinese social media. The original post indicated that the metallic items all represented the results of projects that Chengdu’s 611th Institute design bureau had been responsible for developing. The other four aircraft depicted are the Sky Wing unmanned aircraft , the J-10 fighter jet , the J-20 stealth fighter , and the FC-1 fighter jet . The FC-1 was a joint development between Chengdu and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, which is also known as the JF-17 Thunder. The pins are not of a common scale, with the J-20 and FC-1 examples being of a similar size, despite the two planes being of wildly different proportions in real life. The pin for the fifth, unknown aircraft depicts a flying wing-type design with something similar to a ‘cranked kite’ planform, the same general layout as Northrop Grumman’s X-47B drone. It looks to be a stealthy design, or at least one intended to have stealthy characteristics, and has two flush-mounted intakes on either side of a central hump in the fuselage. A notch in the rear fuselage suggests there is a single exhaust and, in turn, only a single-engine. It is not entirely clear from the photograph whether the pin shows a cockpit or not, though there do appear to be lines that could represent framing for windows. Still, even if there is an outline of what might look to be a cockpit, especially at this very small scale, that doesn’t necessarily mean this would be a manned design. Star Systems’ Star Shadow drone has a similar general layout and structural features that could give the impression of a cockpit in a similarly sized model, but there is no indication that this is a pilot optional design. In fact, the pin appears to be a dead ringer for an unnamed and apparently unmanned aircraft that the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) put on display at the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow. However, the aircraft on display at Zhuhai notably lacked the two intakes, instead having a single central intake more akin to other flying wing drones, such as the X-47B or the RQ-170 . A look at the front of unknown drone that AVIC put on display at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2018., Chinese Internet A look at the rear of the drone, giving a better view of its cranked kite planform and exhaust. Is this a subscale demonstrator for a new unmanned combat air vehicle or a manned next-generation combat aircraft?, Chinese Internet AVIC never officially said that the drone was a Chengdu product, though some observers had suggested that this could be the case at the time. Steve Trimble, a good friend of The War Zone and Aviation Week ‘s defense editor, had the following to say after seeing the design at Zhuhai: “On Nov. 5, Avic parked a small flying wing UAS in one of its static display corrals. The apparently subscale demonstrator is the only aircraft in the Avic static display area without an identifying placard. Asked to identify the aircraft’s name, an Avic worker in the display area declined, saying it was only available for pictures. “The mystery Avic aircraft is unlikely to be a true stealthy system. It has exposed rivets and a protruding access panel atop the fuselage. But its cranked-kite wing shape and semi-hexagonal inlet add new dimensions to Avic’s flight research.” The more robust and potentially manned aircraft that the pin depicts definitely supports the assessment that the relatively small and apparently unmanned aircraft at the airshow was a subscale demonstrator of some kind. Chengdu’s heavy focus on fighter jets might mean that this is a concept for manned sixth-generation stealth fighter or a possible large unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). The general configuration is similar in many respects to concepts for notional sixth-generation U.S. fighter jets that have also been emerging in recent years .  Chengdu’s J-20s are growing in operational service with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), so the firm may already be beginning to look into what comes next. Northrop Grumman concept art of a sixth-generation fighter jet that is equipped with a laser defense system to shoot down incoming threats., Northrop Grumman It remains unclear, though, how this design and its development, now tied to Chengdu, might otherwise fit in with other manned and unmanned stealthy flying projects underway in China. As noted, Star Systems is working on a very similar looking unmanned aircraft to the on that the pin reflects. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) also unveiled a cranked kite UCAV design, the CH-7, at Zhuhai in 2018 with very broad similarities to the X-47B. The CASC CH-7., Chinese Internet In addition, the Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation, another AVIC subsidiary, is reportedly working on the development of a manned heavy bomber known as the H-20 . There have been no official pictures or artwork clearly showing this aircraft, or even concept designs, but it is widely reported that it is a flying wing-type design in the same general vein as the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 Spirit . The War Zone has previously explored the available information on the H-20, which rumors have said China might unveil this year, in detail . There is a possibility that Chengdu demonstrator and the design depicted in the pin might reflect a regionally-focused stealthy bomber concept to compete with the JH-XX that the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, yet another AVIC subsidiary, is reportedly developing. It might also be an alternative developmental effort in case that program runs into trouble. Models and art depicting the Shenyang design show a more conventionally configured stealth design, which you can read about in depth in this past War Zone story . Artwork depicting the notional JH-XX on the cover of the May 2018 edition of Chinese magazine Aviation Knowledge., Chinese Internet AVIC is a state-owned enterprise, as well, and Chengdu’s stealthy flying wing development could be part of a cooperative program with another one of the subsidiaries, such as Xi’an or Shenyang. Beyond that, the pin would seem to indicate that Chengdu has plans for its design far beyond what ended up on display at Zhuhai last year. The pin would hardly be the first time we have seen indications of future aviation developments emerge in more discreet and anecdotal formats, as well. Last year, the PLAAF appeared to make passing reference to the H-20 in a prominently featured logo at an official gala touting the country’s plans for a “first-class strategic bomber division.” Months before that, Ma Hongzhong, a lead designer a CASIC, had dropped deals and a censored photo of what turned out to be the company’s latest edition to its Tian Ying drone line via the firm’s official WeChat social media account. Whatever the case, the pin seems to be yet another indicator of how China is aggressively pursuing multiple new stealth aircraft concepts, both manned and unmanned. This notably already includes various types that could serve as UCAVs or important developmental stepping stones toward such aircraft. All of this has come as the United States has shelved its own UCAV developments or moved them entirely into the classified realm. Chengdu’s stealthy flying wing design makes it clear that China’s aviation industry is not slowing down in this regard and continues to focus on making huge strides in the development of increasingly advanced combat aircraft, as well as other military technologies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Only One Of Iraq’s Chinese CH-4B Drones Is Mission Capable As Other Buyers Give Up On Them,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As of the end of June, only one of Iraq’s Chinese-made CH-4B drones was fully mission capable, contributing to a major shortfall in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capacity, according to recent U.S. government report. Unspecified maintenance issues are apparently to blame, but the news does follow reports that other operators of the type have been less than pleased with its performance. The new information about the state of the Iraqi CH-4Bs came in the latest Lead Inspector General report on Operation Inherent Resolve, the official name for U.S.-led coalition operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, which covered the period from April 1 to June 30, 2019. The Pentagon, Department of State, and Agency for International Development all contribute to these quarterly reviews. The same report said that Iraq’s fleet of “more than 10” smaller Boeing Insitu Scan Eagle drones had flown just two sorties in total since March 2019 due to a lapse in contractor maintenance support and unexplained signals interference issues. Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) have “struggled with the availability” of the aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, in general, according to the report. “Shortfalls have resulted in a 50 percent decrease in Iraq’s fixed-wing ISR sorties compared to the same period last year.” It is unclear how many CH-4Bs Iraq has in total or how many of them might be at least partially mission capable. As with the Scan Eagles, the Lead Inspector General report only says the country has “more than 10” of these Chinese drones. The Iraqis have been flying the CH-4B, which is in the same general size class as the U.S. MQ-1 Predator, since 2015 and are among its most prominent foreign users. The drones have a combat radius of around 155 miles and a maximum endurance of 14 hours. This allows them to cover significant portions of the country, even from bases south of the centrally-located capital Baghdad, and provide valuable surveillance capacity, including at night, with its sensor turret containing both electro-optical and infrared video cameras. Without the CH-4Bs, the Iraqi military has few alternatives to provide persistent surveillance coverage, especially after dark, when insurgent and terrorist activity is typically more pronounced. The Iraqi Air Force has limited numbers of sensor-turret equipped Cessna C-208 Grand Caravans and ISR-configured Beechcraft King Airs . Coalition advisors’ “recent focus is on training Iraq’s Squadron 3, which operates C-208 manned ISR aircraft, to increase its operations,” according to the Lead Inspector General report. A sensor turret-equipped Iraqi Air Force Cessna C-208., Iraqi Air Force The Iraqi Air Force has also been working to increase the use of the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods (ATP) on its F-16IQ Viper combat jets on what are known as non-traditional ISR sorties. Unfortunately, the “operational impact has been negligible as this capability is in its infancy and extremely costly to use,” the quarterly review explained. An Iraqi F-16IQ equipped with the Sniper ATP., Iraqi Air Force Aerial ISR could become extremely important for the Iraqis in the near future, given fears that ISIS may be attempting to exploit various regional geopolitical realities in order to regroup and mount a comeback. The Lead Inspector General report specifically noted that U.S. ISR aerial assets in the region had increasingly been retasked to respond to growing U.S. tensions with Iran . Additional assets had gotten redeployed out the theater entirely to meet demands elsewhere, such as in Europe and the Pacific region . The low availability of the CH-4Bs has impacts beyond surveillance, too, as the drones can carry various weapons. Iraq purchased stocks of AR-1 TV-guided missiles , similar in general size to the U.S. AGM-114 Hellfire , and FT-9 GPS-guided bombs from China to go with its fleets. The missiles give the drones the ability to engage moving targets, while the bombs offer an all-weather strike capability against fixed targets. Between October 2015 and February 2018, the unmanned aircraft reportedly carried out at least 260 strikes against ISIS terrorists, which included destroying vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices that were a major threat to Iraqi forces on the ground. The Lead Inspector General Report does not describe the exact maintenance issues that are now apparently plaguing Iraq’s CH-4B fleet. However, Iraq isn’t the only country to reportedly experience issues with the performance and overall quality of these drones. Reports surfaced in November 2018 that the Royal Jordanian Air Force had found its CH-4Bs lacking and was looking to retire them. In June 2019, they went up for sale . It is unclear when Jordan bought these, but satellite first showed one of them at a base near the country’s border with Syria in October 2016. Algeria reportedly decided against buying CH-4s of some type after losing two of them to accidents in testing between 2013 and 2014. Still, China has notable export success with this type, among other drones , with known sales to Egypt , Nigeria , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . A CH-4B on display at the biennial Zhuhai Airshow in China in 2018. This particular example has a sensor turret and what appears to be a radar pod under the fuselage. The missiles under the wing are an AR-1, on the outboard pylon, and a newer AR-2, on the inboard pylon., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Images At the same time, a not insignificant reason for this success was that U.S. export rules made it difficult , if not impossible, for many American partners to purchase highly capable U.S.-made drones, such as the Predator. The Trump Administration has since relaxed those restrictions significantly as part of a broader effort to promote U.S. arms sales abroad. It is possible that this could spur increasing sales of large, armed drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper , as time goes on. The rules changes could mean that allies and partners may also be able to buy some of the dozens of now-retired Predators that are in storage at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Of course, the Chinese haven’t stopped developing new fixed-wing and rotary-wing drones of various shapes and sizes, including new variants of the Reaper-sized Wing Loong series , many of which continue to see success on the export market . China continues to have far few restrictions on the export of weapons and military hardware, in general, than the United States. It will be interesting to see whether Iraq’s particular experiences and troubles with its CH-4Bs have an impact on any drones it might purchase in the future. In the meantime, Iraqi forces will have to find ways to increase the availability of the Chinese unmanned aircraft in order to ensure they can continue providing important ISR and strike capabilities over their country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2019",What We Know About A Reported Radiation Leak In Russia After A Missile Engine Exploded (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has rejected reports of a brief spike in ambient radiation after an explosion and subsequent fire killed at least two individuals at a military test site near the White Sea. This incident follows a massive blast at an ammunition depot in Siberia and ensuring fires injured six people and forced thousands of others nearby to evacuate the area just days ago. It also comes a month after a fire broke out onboard the top-secret Russian spy submarine Losharik , killing 14 sailors. This latest incident reportedly occurred at a site near the village of Nyonoksa in Russia’s northwestern Arkhangelsk region on Aug. 8, 2019, according to Russia’s Interfax . Russia’s Ministry of Defense said at least seven people had been injured in the accident, including a defense industry employee, and two of them had later died. Other reports say there may be as many as 15 people injured in total. Beyond this, many of the details about the accident remain unclear. State-run media outlet TASS , citing anonymous sources, had initially reported that the explosion and fire had occurred on an unspecified ship from the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet at its base in Severodvinsk, to the east of Nyonoksa. Other reports said that the incident might have involved a test ship or unpowered barge. The Russian Ministry of Defense’s statement does not specifically identify the location of the incident, describing it only as a “test site.” A map showing the relative locations of Severodvinsk, to the east, and Nyonoksa, to its west, on the White Sea., Google Maps TASS ‘ English translation of the Russian Ministry of Defense statement also said that a “liquid propellant jet engine” exploding was the cause of the accident, while its Russian version uses a phrase that could also translate to “liquid propellant rocket engine.” Other Russian media outlets, include state-run RIA Novosti , have also described the item that blew up as a liquid fuel rocket motor. The specific mention of a “liquid propellant” at all strongly points to a rocket motor given that jet engines almost universally use some form of liquid fuel and that this qualifier would be redundant in that case. There are, however, liquid and solid fuel rocket motors. Nyonoksa is reportedly used to test both cruise missiles, which use jet engines, and rocket-powered ballistic missiles. If a liquid fuel rocket motor was the source of the explosion, it is possible that it occurred during a test or other work on an R-29RM Shtil submarine-launched ballistic missile, which the Russian Navy continues to deploy on its Project 667BDRM Delfin class ballistic missiles submarines. No report, so far, has identified the motor, or associated missile, in question. Far more worrisome are reports from officials in Severodvinsk of an increase in ambient radiation after the accident. “A short-term rise in background radiation was recorded at 12 o’clock in Severodvinsk,” Ksenia Yudina, a spokesperson for the city, told reporters . The Civil Protection Department in Severodvinsk said that the readings , which exceed the normal background level for the area of 0.11 millisieverts per hour, had come from two sensors tied to an automated system in the region. Severodvinsk officials subsequently added that the radiation levels had already “normalized.” There were unconfirmed reports that residents in the area had received instructions to take precautions to prevent radiation exposure. The Russian Defense Ministry subsequently denied those claims . “No harmful substances were emitted into the atmosphere, the background radiation is normal,” according to a statement. What the exact source and veracity of the claims of increased radiation from Severodvinsk city officials might be, it is hard to hear about this incident and not think about a fire that occurred on board the Delfin -class submarine Ekaterinburg while it was in dry dock in 2011. Seven years later, then-Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin publicly disclosed that the boat had a full load of 16 R-29RMs, each one of which carries four nuclear warheads, while the work was going on, something that one could only describe as a gross safety hazard. Observers at the time of the incident had dismissed reports from anonymous sources that there were missiles on the submarine on the basis that it seemed extremely unlikely that Russians would have been so careless. Ekaterinburg at a ceremony marking her relaunch following repairs in 2014., АО “Центр судоремонта “Звёздочка” via Wikimedia The Ekaterinburg incident is also interesting to note given the initial report from TASS that this latest accident had actually happened during work on an unspecified Russian naval vessel in Severodvinsk. At the time of writing, the Russian state media outlet had not updated its English-language story to specifically say that this was in error or retract the statement, as seen in the screenshot below, which The War Zone has preserved here for the record. TASS A separate report from Russian newspaper Lenta suggested that the accident could have actually been the result of a failed ballistic missile launch from a submarine in the White Sea. This was based solely on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s unexplained demand that local authorities in the Dvina Bay area in the aftermath of the incident. Still, a failed launch from a submarine would hardly be unheard of. In September 1991, just months before the collapse of the Soviet Union, an R-39 Rif submarine-launched ballistic missile, thankfully with no live nuclear warheads inside, blew up inside its launch tube on the Typhoon class submarine TK-17 during a test. You can read more about that harrowing incident that almost led to the submarine sinking here . It is also possible that TASS’ report of a “liquid propellant jet engine” is actually more accurate and the incident involved one of Russia’s sea-launched land attack or anti-ship cruise missiles , some of which can carry nuclear warheads. Damage to a nuclear submarine, or the nuclear-powered Kirov class battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy , that may have carried out the failed launch could be the reason for a radiation leak. Russia is also reportedly working on a nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile called Burevestnik . This accident also comes more than a month after 14 sailors died while fighting a fire on Russia’s nuclear-powered Project 10831 spy submarine Losharik . A eulogy at a subsequent memorial service lauded the Russian Navy personnel for doing everything to “prevent a catastrophe of global proportions,” leading some to believe that there had been a more serious risk of radiation leaks from the boat’s nuclear reactor than the Russian government had admitted publicly. It is, of course, entirely possible that the reported surge in radiation near Severodvinsk was a false positive of sorts and that the incident was more mundane. Beyond the Ekaterinburg incident, fires are hardly uncommon at Russian naval bases and shipyards. Just in 2018, fires sunk the Russian Navy’s largest floating dry dock , which had the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov inside it at the time, damaged an icebreaker under construction in St. Petersburg, and caused damage to submarines in the country’s Far East. In addition, the Russian military, as well as its defense industry, has a history of major accidents tied largely to lax safety protocols, in general. On Aug. 5, 2019, an ammunition depot in the country’s Siberia region exploded , injuring at least six people, sending artillery shells and other debris flying into nearby communities, and forcing thousands to evacuate. Aerial firefighting aircraft and helicopters, along with unmanned firefighting vehicles on the ground, helped finally contain the blaze, which burned for hours. Back in April, a huge fire had also broken out at a large industrial park in Siberia. Some of the facilities at the Krasnoyarsk Machine-Building Plant are responsible for the production of components for intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Russian officials said the blaze was confined to a factory that builds consumer goods, including refrigerators. So, regardless of the exact circumstances of this particular incident along the White Sea, it is certainly another embarrassing accident for Russia’s military and defense industrial sectors just this year. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 3:30pm EST— Online tracking data shows that a nuclear fuel carrier ship was in the general area of the incident at the time. It is possible that the explosion in some way impacted that vessel, leading to a radiation leak. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 19, 2019",Take A Peek Inside The Armory On An Amphibious Assault Ship Carrying Hundreds Of Marines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s one of those nooks of a huge fighting ship that you rarely see, but know is pretty damn important. The armories aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp , one of the nine ‘Gator Navy’ flattops currently in service with the U.S. Navy, are essential to the ship’s core mission—conveying hard-hitting Marine grunts to the enemy’s doorstep and beyond and supporting them once they are there. Although we constantly see these vessels working as motherships for aviation and maritime combat assets and operations, their real might is disclosed within. Wasp can accommodate roughly 1,650 Marines during normal deployed operations and nearly 1,900 during surge operations. That is in addition to her crew complement of about 1,050. Most of those Marines need small arms to do their jobs. Lot’s and lots of guns, basically. These weapons just don’t float freely around the ship, they are securely stored in the ship’s armories. USS Wasp (LHD-1)., USN These spaces are packed with firearms of all types. From assault rifles, to sniper rifles, to grenade launchers, to sidearms, it’s here where the sprawling inventory of weapons U.S. Marines carry into combat are not only stored, but serviced and repaired by armorers. Marine grunts literally bet their lives on work done in these areas as the weapons they check out, which have seen disparate levels of usage, have to go bang. They also have to be inventoried meticulously to make sure nothing is left behind, misappropriated, or otherwise missing after an operation or exercise. Beyond lost weapons having the potential to harm others, the electronic components on these weapons can cost thousands of dollars and the guns themselves aren’t cheap either. So making sure everything is accounted for is absolutely essential. Take a peek into one of the armories aboard Wasp , the flagship of the Wasp Amphibious Ready Group, with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked, that just participated in Talisman Sabre 2019 off the coast of Australia.

Force protection is absolutely paramount in this day and age, not to mention sending well-armed VBSS teams to board suspicious vessels via small boat or helicopter. How these armories differ from those found on Gator Navy ships is that they don’t have to accommodate a pocket army of shock troops embarked aboard. So we are talking about quaint and secure spaces compared to the much larger and more densely packed arrangements that are absolutely bristling with weaponry on America’s amphibious assault vessel force.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 21, 2019",Full Analysis Of The First Flight Of Russia’s ‘Hunter’ Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B , or Hunter-B, flying wing unmanned combat air vehicle, or UCAV, flew for the first time recently and now the country’s Ministry of Defense has released video of the flight. Images of the drone had first emerged on Russian social media in January. The Russian Ministry of Defense officially announced the milestone last week, though it did not provide any imagery. The S-70 flew for more than 20 minutes, cruising at an altitude of around 1,970 feet on a route around an unspecified air base, according to the official statement at the time. This first flight was originally scheduled to occur sometime in the Spring, but was delayed for unknown reasons. It is not immediately clear where or when this test occurred. As of May 2019, satellite imagery and official Russian government statements confirmed that at least one Okhotnik-B was at 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center in Russia’s southwestern Astrakhan region. However, a separate report from AINonline in June says that the first flight had occurred on May 25 at Sukhoi’s Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association ‘s (NAPO) plant in the region of the same name. The video the Russian Ministry of Defense has now released, seen below, shows the drone taxiing, taking off, flying around the base, and landing. The UCAV, which is roughly in the same general size class as Northrop Grumman’s X-47B , is now carrying a bort number, Red 071, as well as the new paint scheme that was previously visible in the satellite imagery from Chkalov. It remains unclear if this means this is a refined design, or even an additional prototype, that is separate from the one seen in the pictures that appeared in January. The most immediate visual difference on the drone in the test flight video is the addition of two flight data probes temporarily installed on the leading edge of the wing, one on each side of the main air intake. This is not uncommon to see during flight tests. A U.S. Air Force RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone was spotted flying an apparent test sortie from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 2017 with a similar probe, something The War Zone was first to report . The configuration of the undercarriage, as well as the air intakes and antennas on top and underneath the fuselage, look largely unchanged from those that were visible in the January 2019 pictures, which were reportedly taken during a ground test at NAPO. A look at the front of the S-70 from the official flight test video, showing, among other things, the two air data probes., Russian Ministry of Defense capture A front aspect shot of the S-70 that emerged online in January 2019., Russian social media The drone’s engine exhaust also remains entirely exposed. We still do not know what type of engine the UCAV uses, but a variant of the Saturn AL-31F series found on Sukhoi’s Flanker fighter jet family remains a likely possibility. You can read The War Zone ‘s full analysis of the S-70 design based on what was visible in January, assessments that remain largely unchanged, here . A look at the rear of the S-70 from the flight test video., Russian Ministry of Defense capture A rear aspect shot of the S-70 that emerged in January 2019., Russian social media The Russian Ministry of Defense now says that the primary missions for the S-70 will be intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, using both electro-optical and infrared sensors and signals intelligence systems, as well as electronic warfare. However, its general size would allow it to accommodate weapons internally. The Russians also continue to claim that the unmanned aircraft uses composite structures and special stealth coatings to make it “ practically invisible ” to radar, but the design as it stands now remains far from very stealthy. The most obvious problem is the engine arrangement, which appears to have the inlet and exhaust relatively in line, as well as no shrouding for the exhaust at all, features that can only hurt the drone’s low observable characteristics. The various intakes and antennas dotting the fuselage only compound these issues, although some are likely installed for testing purposes alone. Steve Trimble, our friend and defense editor over at Aviation Week , also noted how Hunter-B’s wing design has a high similarity to that of the officially retired, but still flying F-117 Nighthawk . The sweep of its wing is somewhat similar to that of the F-117, but it’s worth noting that the same general wingtip configuration is used by the RQ-170 Sentinel, as well. It would be remiss if we weren’t to mention that the Skunk Works’ flying-wing Sentinel spy drone likely informed Russia’s Hunter-B design in more ways than wingtip design alone. The example that fell into Iranian hands was thought to have been at least examined by Russian engineers. Where technologically possible and logical, Moscow would have incorporated its secrets into their Hunter-B design and the operating concepts that are derived from it, much of which lies beneath its skin. As The War Zone has previously noted , the high sweep of the drone’s wing, combined with its engine configuration, could potentially give the Okhotnik-B higher performance, potentially allowing it to fly at transonic or even supersonic speeds, if only during short sprints. A less stealthy, but higher performance design that could keep up with manned fighter jets could turn the S-70 into a viable “loyal wingman,” especially for Russia’s Su-57 advanced combat jets . We’ve already seen evidence that there is some link between these manned and unmanned developments at Sukhoi. It seems likely that the Kremlin is still working on developing its exact concepts of operation for the S-70, and how those might fit together with other platforms, despite the comments on the drone’s official expected mission sets, too. With Russia’s history of deferring, canceling , and then reviving advanced combat aircraft programs, it is possible that the overall plans for Okhotnik-B are not necessarily rigid. Notably, the drones had previously offered a lower cost means to expand the Russian Air Force’s advanced air combat capabilities in lieu of the Su-57. However, the Kremlin recently reversed its decision to put serial production of those manned fighter jets on indefinite hold and now says it will buy as many as 76 of them in the coming years. Now that the S-70 has begun flight testing we may begin to learn more about its exact capabilities and just how the Kremlin plans to put them to use.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2020",Air Force Reveals Tests Of Supposed Record-Setting Scramjet Engine From Northrop Grumman,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force recently broke the record for the highest thrust producing air-breathing hypersonic engine the service has ever tested in its history, at least that we know about. Northrop Grumman built the scramjet engine for the Air Force Research Laboratory and its development comes amid a general renaissance in all things hypersonic across the U.S. military. The Air Force Research Laboratory announced the achievement on Aug. 5, 2019, but did not say specifically when it had occured. AFRL and Northrop Grumman had tested the 18-foot long fighter-engine sized scramjet powerplant across a nine-month period. The engine ran for a total of 30 minutes across an unspecified number of tests, generating up to 13,000 pounds of thrust under conditions the engine would experience at speeds of above Mach 4. The testing occured at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex’s (AEDC) Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit at Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee. “The series of tests … on this fighter-engine sized scramjet was truly remarkable,” Pat Nolan, Northrop Grumman’s Vice President for Missile Products said in a statement . “The scramjet successfully ran across a range of hypersonic Mach numbers for unprecedented run times, demonstrating that our technology is leading the way in delivering large scale hypersonic platforms to our warfighters.” It is worth noting that while the Air Force’s official release described the engine running at “conditions above Mach 4,” hypersonic speed is typically described as being Mach 5 and above. As such, the actual conditions during at least some of the testing may have been more extreme. The equipment used to test the Northrop Grumman scramjet engine at Arnold Air Force Base., USAF For an engine similar in overall size to those found in existing fighter jets, 13,000 pounds of thurst may not necessarily sound impressive. The General Electric F110-GE-129 turbofan on Block 50 F-16C/D Vipers is almost in the 30,000-pound thrust class. However, scramjets have to operate in a completely different and extremely demanding flight regime at higher altitudes. The 13,000 pounds of thrust from Northrop Grumman’s scramjet would offer far more sustained kinematic performance under those conditions than 30,000 pounds of thrust in thicker air at lower altitudes. Compared to previous scramjet developments, demonstrating 13,000 pounds of thurst is a major achievement. The SJY61 engine on Boeing’s X-51A Waverider hypersonic test vehicle, which AFRL tested between 2005 and 2013, produced between 400 and 1,000 pounds of thrust. AEDC’s facilities had to undergo a two-year upgrade just to be able to accommodate the tests of the Northrop Grumman scramjet. “The plan for a larger and faster hypersonic air-breathing engine was established 10 years ago during the X-51 test program, as the Air Force recognized the need to push the boundaries of hypersonic research,” Todd Barhorst, an AFRL aerospace engineer and the lead for the Medium Scale Critical Components (MSCC) program, said in a statement . “A new engine with 10-times the flow of the X-51 would allow for a new class of scramjet vehicles.” The main goals of the MSCC program, which has been going on since 2014, are to demonstrate improved engine performance, develop better ways to manage the heat and stress that air-breathing hypersonic engines experience in flight, and simply collect more data on the physics of hypersonic propulsion. So, it is possible that this test engine may never actually fly. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Falcon Combined Cycle Engine Test (FaCET), which Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works produced, is another hypersonic engine the Air Force has tested in the past at Arnold Air Force Base., USAF The data will invariably support the myriad other hypersonic developments going on within the Air Force and possibly elsewhere across the U.S. military. AFRL is already working together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program, which is seeking scramjet-powered missile designs. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are working together on a HAWC entrant, which you can read about more here , with the latter company supplying the scramjet engine. Lockheed Martin has submitted another design that you can find out more about here . DARPA has also separately contracted Northrop  Grumman to work on a hybrid engine that blends together the capabilities of a traditional jet turbine and a ramjet or scramjet as part of the Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program.  Ramjets and scramjets only function properly at high speeds and traditionally hypersonic vehicles have used rocket boosters to get them to the necessary velocities for the engines to run. The AFRE program is looking into a turbine-based combined-cycle (TBCC) design that would mean an aircraft, manned or unmanned, could take off from a conventional runway like any other jet, accelerate to hypersonic speeds, and then land again as normal. Lockheed Martin has reportedly been working to integrate a combined-cycle engine onto a demonstrator for its SR-72 hypersonic aircraft concept . AFRL has also eyed Reaction Engines Ltd’s Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE), which you can read about more here , as a way to provide similar capabilities. Since the MSCC experiments also deal in materials science and hypersonic physics in general, the tests at Arnold Air Force Base could also provide important data for other unpowered hypersonic programs, too. It is also important to remember that these record-setting scramjet tests reflect the latest developments that we know about. The U.S. military has been researching hypersonic technologies for decades and it is almost certain that additional developments have occured in the classified realm. We don’t know how this testing at Arnold Air Force Base may fit into the entire hypersonic research and development picture. What we do know is that the U.S. military as a whole has become extremely interested again publicly in hypersonic weapons and aircraft in recent years. For instance, the Air Force , as well as the U.S. Army and Navy , are all working on unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicles . Hypersonic developments in Russia and China have been a major driving force in the U.S. military’s own high-speed ambitions. Russia has fielded an air-launched hypersonic missile and has said a ground-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle will also enter service this year. China is actively pursuing its own hypersonic weapon developments . AFRL’s test of its new record-setting scramjet engine will now help open up a world of new research and development possibilities for the U.S. military.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Air Force’s New Base In Niger Is Getting A Major Addition Before It Even Opens,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery shows the U.S. military is building a new approximately 20,800-square foot hangar along with its own 100,000-square foot apron and associated taxiway at its new air base outside of the city of Agadez in central Niger. The American facilities in Agadez, which will form an important regional hub for U.S. military operations in Northwest Africa , have been actively under construction since 2016. The new runway, while complete, isn’t slated to open for actual operations until some time this fall. Images from Google Earth show that U.S. personnel began work on the hangar, apron, and taxiway, in January 2019. These items are distinctly separate from the construction of three other hangars nearby, which began in 2017 and was largely complete by March 2019. Those structures have their own apron and taxiway, as well. A general overview of the main facilities at the new US air base in Agadez as of July 2019. The three existing hangars and the new construction next to them are visible just below the runway., Google Earth A close up of the hangar area in December 2018., Google Earth Work being done to level the area next to the hangars as of April 2019., Google Earth The state of construction on the new addition as of July 2019., Google Earth The reason for constructing the fourth large hangar, or who might be destined to occupy it, isn’t immediately clear. When the American facilities in Agadez, which will be officially situated within the Nigerien Air Force’s new Air Base 201, finally open for business, the only flying unit we know of that will call the base home will be a squadron of MQ-9 Reaper drones. Since 2013, the 323rd Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron has flown Reapers in the region from an American base the Nigerien capital Niamey. Those facilities are attached to the Nigerien Air Force’s Air Base 101 and Diori Hamani International Airport. When the U.S. base in Agadez begins operations, all of the Reapers in Niamey will head there to continue operations. One of the 323rd Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron’s MQ-9s in a tent-style hangar in Niamey in 2017., USAF However, the 323rd was not among the units assigned to the 409th Air Expeditionary Group, which controls all regular Air Force activities across Northwest Africa, according to an official statement a spokesperson for U.S. Air Forces Europe and Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) provided to The War Zone in an Email in May 2019. Instead, the only flying unit the 409th officially controlled at the time was the 324th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron, which has been supporting U.S. operations in Africa from Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily since March 2011. Google Maps Be sure to check out The War Zone’s custom, interactive Google Map showing known U.S. military operating locations in Africa here . As of May, the 409th, which had moved to Agadez in June 2018, also oversaw the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron that handles day-to-day activities in Agadez and the 768th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron, which performs the same administrative mission in Niamey. The rest of the Group’s assigned units consisted of the 409th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron, the 31st Expeditionary Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers (RED HORSE), and elements of the 4th Expeditionary Space Control Flight. The latter unit helps monitor satellite communications and data sharing capabilities, which are particularly important for drone missions, which typically involve pilots and sensor operators actually flying missions from bases in the United States. That same month, the U.S. Air Force also announced it was temporarily repositioning a number of MQ-9s belonging to an unspecified unit to Greece while an undisclosed base that the drones normally operated out of in Africa underwent construction. This could potentially explain the absence of the 323rd at that time. Regardless, it is possible that Air Force has decided to consolidate the two MQ-9 units at Agadez, which might have created a requirement for more hangar and apron space there than the service originally expected. One of the main reasons the U.S. military is establishing the base in Agadez, to begin with, is so that Reapers will be able to operate from a more central location that will improve their ability to conduct missions across Northwest Africa. In late 2017, U.S. and Nigerien governments also came to an agreement about conducting armed drone operations from bases in the country, which could have created requirements for more expansive facilities to handle the storage and loading of munitions. To date, there has been no official confirmation of any armed MQ-9 sorties originating from Niamey. Three MQ-9s are visible in this satellite image of the US base in Niamey in 2017., Google Earth Regardless, the United States is actively engaged in supporting countries throughout the region combat a number of different terrorist groups, many of whom have at least loose ties to Al Qaeda and ISIS, something The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. In 2017, one of these myriad groups, the ISIS-affiliated Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), infamously ambushed a group of U.S. special operations forces and support personnel, along with a Nigerien partner force, outside Tongo Tongo in the western portion of the country near the border with Mali. Four Americans died in the ensuing firefight, which The War Zone has covered in depth in the past here and here . U.S. forces in Agadez had also brushed back what appeared to be a possible attack on the base in 2016. Terrorist activity in the region has increased in recent years , in general, which has also prompted demands for increased drone coverage, even just for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Persistent aerial surveillance has been one of the main methods the U.S. military has employed to keep tabs on militant and terrorist groups across Africa, who regularly exploit the limited ability of many countries on the continent to actively monitor remote, largely uninhabited areas within their borders. A briefing slide from 2018 showing the top 13 entries in US Africa Command’s Integrated Priority List for 2020-2024. Two of the top three deal with the demand for more persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. The number one issue is personnel recovery, a topic The War Zone has explored in depth previously., AFRICOM With this in mind, it is important to note that Agadez will also serve as a larger hub for U.S. military operations throughout Northwest Africa beyond simply serving as a staging point for MQ-9s. For the very beginning, the base’s runway needed to be able to support cargo aircraft as large of the C-17 Globemaster III airlifter . C-17s, as well as C-130s, have already been making regular use of the expanded runway at Agadez’s Mano Dayak International Airport to bring in vehicles, personnel, equipment, and supplies. The additional hangar could provide important maintenance space for these and other transient aircraft. It could also support contractors, who also provide important ISR and personnel recovery capabilities across Africa. It is not clear whether contract fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters presently flying from Niamey in support of U.S. military operations will move to Agadez, as well, when that base opens. The hangar could also help shield any aircraft at Agadez from the elements, if necessary. Sandstorm routinely sweep through the area and are one of the main reasons, together with extremely high temperatures, why the construction of the new facilities at Agadez has taken so long . The Air Force’s original goal was to have the base up and running by the end of 2017. “U.S. Air Force Airmen have completed several major construction projects at Nigerien Air Base 201 to include the runway and significant portions of infrastructure,” the USAFE-AFAFRICA spokesperson told The War Zone by Email in May 2019. “As with any new airfield, there are assessments that must happen and procedures that must be developed before flying operations can occur.” It remains to be seen whether or not the runway at Agadez will open as scheduled by the end of this year. What is clear is that the facility is still growing and is already in the process of getting significant new additions even before flying operations start.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 15, 2019",China Curiously Says It May Join U.S.  Persian Gulf Maritime Coalition Despite Trade War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has said that its navy could escort Chinese-flagged commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and the Strait of Hormuz, in response to growing security concerns in the wake of Iran’s seizure of multiple foreign oil tankers in recent the past month. In addition, Chinese officials are considering joining a new U.S.-backed maritime security framework in the region, despite serious tensions between the two countries at present, including a massive trade war. This news comes as the U.S. government has reportedly sought to take a more secondary role in that operation, offering the United Kingdom a leading role, in a push to “internationalize” the effort and attract foreign partners. Chinese Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Ni Jian informed Reuters of his country’s positions on regional maritime security in Abu Dhabi on Aug. 6, 2019. China’s embassy in the country subsequently provided additional details to the wire service via text message. “If there happens to be a very unsafe situation we will consider having our navy escort our commercial vessels,” Ni told Reuters . “We have the position that all disputes should be sorted by peaceful means and by political discussions, not … military actions.” “We are studying the U.S. proposal on Gulf escort arrangements,” the Chinese Embassy in the UAE added. The US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Sterett , at left, sails with the Chinese Type 903 Fuchi class replenishment ship Chao Hu , the background, and the Type 054A Jiangkai II class frigate Yun Chang during a counter-piracy exercise in the Gulf of Aden in 2014., USN On July 19, 2019, U.S. Central Command had announced the plan, dubbed Operation Sentinel , which would focus primarily on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as improved information sharing between allies and partners to increase overall situational awareness in the region. Earlier that same day, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had seized control of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz, a tit-for-tat response to the United Kingdom’s continued impoundment of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 . The British had detained Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean Sea on July 4, 2019, over sanctions violations. Iran is now holding a total of three foreign ships in total. On July 14, 2019, the IRGC also detained the Panama-flagged Riah . On Aug. 4, 2019, the IRGC said it had seized another ship purportedly sailing under the Iraqi flag, but did not give its name. The Iraqi government has denied it has any connection to the vessel, but has said it is working to get more information on the situation. Iran says that Riah and this unknown vessel were involved in fuel smuggling. This is a lucrative illicit business in Iran due to heavy government subsidies on commodities such as gasoline and diesel, despite regular shortages of those fuels within the country. Despite these incidents, the U.S.-backed effort failed for weeks to attract any real foreign interest. The United Kingdom and Germany had gone so far as to publicly announce their intention not to participate. Since at least June, U.S. military air and naval assets , including cluster munition-toting F-15E Strike Eagles , have been independently patrolling the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman and keeping watch for any potential threats to international shipping. A pair of US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles, at least one of which is carrying cluster munitions, conduct a Surface Combat Air Patrol in June., USAF The United Kingdom’s new government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, now says it will join the U.S.-backed mission, abandoning earlier plans for a separate European-led operation. At the same time, however, U.K. officials say that they remain committed to the international deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program and diplomacy with Tehran. The United States withdrew from the Iran Deal in 2018 and has since pursued a hardline “maximum pressure” policy toward the country. At the same time, tensions between the United States and Iran have been escalating, in general, for months, and there have been concerns that the situation might spiral into open conflict. These fears were especially pronounced after the IRGC shot down a U.S. Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman in June, which did almost lead to U.S. military strikes on Iran . “Nobody wants to be drawn into conflict with Iran,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters on Aug. 2, 2019. “That’s why we first proposed the idea of a coalition of like-minded allies and partners, if you will, getting together in the Gulf and in the Strait, figuring how again we can escort shipping, so that the Iranians will not take provocative actions.” Mark Esper, now Secretary of Defense, speaks to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation hearing in July 2019., Stefani Reynolds/Picture-alliance/DPA/AP Images So far, the United Kingdom has been the only party to formally announce plans to take part in the mission. The United States has also reportedly scrapped the Operation Sentinel name and agreed to give the U.K. armed forces a leading role in the effort, which may have helped sway Johnson’s government, according to a story from Politico on Aug. 5, 2019, citing anonymous sources. That same “internationalizing” of the mission may be why China is now considering signing up, as well. China and the United States are otherwise locked in an increasingly brutal trade war. Just on Aug. 5, 2019, the U.S. government branded China as a currency manipulator . That same day, China announced it had stopped buying U.S. farm goods entirely, a major blow to American agricultural enterprises. Chinese and U.S. authorities have increasingly come to at least rhetorical blows over a host of other issues in the past few years, as well, including China’s claims in the South China Sea and the status of Taiwan . Whatever the exact operational structure the Chinese might choose, conducting patrols in and around the Strait of Hormuz would certainly provide valuable experience for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which is striving to move from a regional force to one with robust global reach . The PLAN has been conducting counter-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean for years now and it also now has a base in the East African country of Djibouti that could also help support operations in the Middle East. Even a U.S.-backed mission could be attractive to the Chinese, especially if the U.S. military’s public role is diminished to some extent. China recently branded the United States as a destabilizing force globally in a new national defense policy white paper and involving itself in maritime security in the Middle East would offer an ideal opportunity to show that it can be a viable alternative to the U.S. government. The rapidly growing size of the PLAN means that China’s contribution to any mission in the region could be very visible even as part of a larger multinational force. “The coalition that we’re building in the Arabian Gulf and specifically in the Strait of Hormuz is going to be a 80- or 90-percent coalition effort,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Gilday, who is set to be the next Chief of Naval Operations, explained to members of Congress during his confirmation hearing on July 31, 2019. “A much smaller U.S. effort is primarily focused on providing intelligence support to the rest of the coalition.” Still, the U.S. government has, so far, left many questions about how unified the command structure for coalition it is building will be, as well as details about the U.S. military’s exact role within that framework, largely unanswered. China continues to trade and otherwise actively engage with Iran and Beijing could be very wary of putting itself into any position where it might find itself called upon to engage Iranian forces to defend another country’s ships. So, by the same token, China might look into the U.S.-backed mission and still ultimately decide to offer up its own competing framework entirely separate from any U.S. government influence. Whether or not the United States succeeds in getting additional allies and partners to agree to its plan first could be the deciding factor. “They [CENTCOM] had a sourcing conference last week. I want to say we had 30-plus countries attend,” Secretary of Defense Esper had told reporters on Aug. 2019. “And we have various degrees of commitment, so I think we’ll have some announcements coming out soon in the coming days, where you’ll see countries begin to sign up.” It will certainly be interesting to see how this U.S.-backed coalition evolves, what America’s role looks like in the end, and whether or not China is among the countries that ultimately agree to participate.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 24, 2020",You Can Buy Paul Allen’s MiG-29 Fulcrum Jet Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Microsoft co-founder, prolific entrepreneur, and a man with an absolute love for all things that fly, Paul Allen, died last October after a fight with cancer. He was just 65. Portions of his empire are beginning to be slowly sold off, including the world-record breaking “Roc” satellite-launcher aircraft and the company built around it known as Stratolaunch . Now, one of the most impressive pieces of his incredible collection of aircraft, many of which are part of the Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum at Paine Field in Everett, Washington has been put on the market. It’s widely understood to be the finest example of a MiG-29 Fulcrum in private hands anywhere in the world, and maybe even the finest regardless of ownership arrangement. The MiG-29 in question is a two-seat UB model that lacks the single-seat Fulcrum’s radar. The aircraft, which was used for training, among other roles, was built at the tail-end of the Cold War, in 1989. It saw service with the Ukrainian Air Force during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Eventually, Ukraine refurbished and demilitarized the jet and offered it for sale on the international market around 2005. Paul Allen in front of one of his P-51s at the Museum., Flying Heritage Museum It was imported into the United States—one of a very limited number of Fulcrums to have done so—by famed warbird aficionado John Sessions , who runs the Historic Flight Foundation , which is also located at Paine Field in Everett, Washington. Just getting the aircraft to the U.S. was a bizarre and harrowing ordeal, let alone reassembling it, restoring it, and test flying it. The fuselage was impounded in Hong Kong and sat to degrade in a salty-air warehouse for a long period of time before Sessions and his team could finally get it to the Pacific Northwest. You can and should read all about this crazy ordeal in this awesome article . Sessions meticulously restored the MiG-29UB to an extent never seen before. It was likely the ‘cleanest’ example of a MiG-29 anywhere in the world once it was done. In 2011, Paul Allen officially bought the jet for an unknown sum of money, but it was absolutely multiple millions of dollars. Sessions had stated the project cost at least $6 million. The Soviet-era fourth generation fighter would become a crown jewel in Allen’s Flying Heritage Museum, and fly it would, making regular zoom climbs and flybys over Paine Field in front of onlookers over the years. Allen also owns an F-5B Freedom Fighter and throngs of warbirds, private jets, floatplanes, and helicopters, the latter of which serviced his travels abroad and ferried him and his guests to his incredible superyachts Octopus and Tatoosh . The “Vulcan Air Force,” a reference to Paul Allen’s holding company Vulcan, Inc., now appears to be in the early stages of being at least partially liquidated. With this in mind, it’s not surprising that the MiG, which has very little real practical use and can burn through a full tank of a thousand gallons of jet fuel in a matter of minutes, while also representing a large initial investment, is being put up for sale now that Paul has passed away. Make sure to watch this sweet Facebook video with cockpit footage of the MiG-29 doing some low-level flying over the Rockies and more, as well as the videos below. The jet is being marketed by aircraft brokers and aviation consulting firm MENTE Group that is based in Dallas, Texas. Their listing states that the airframe only has 570 hours of total time, with each of its Klimov RD-33 afterburning turbofan engines having accrued just 60 hours since being totally overhauled. That number also represents the total flight time this aircraft has flown since it was brought back to life in the United States. Both of the aircraft’s K2 K36DM ejection seats are also hot. Avionics include an ADS-B transponder and a Garmin 530 GPS. All of the gauges and placards in English. We have reached out to MENTE Group to get more details and a list price on this incredibly unique aircraft, one that represents the absolute pinnacle of aerospace performance available to the private citizen—the MiG-29 is a Mach 2+, 9G+ design—but we haven’t heard back just yet. Often people think these aircraft would be hot items for private aggressor contractors that are currently expanding exponentially in size to meet U.S. military and its allies’ demand for adversary support services. This simply isn’t the case. The MiG-29s can be simulated by other high-performance aircraft in the fleet and these contractors aren’t there to get into groveling dogfights as much as to provide target saturation, intercept training, and electronic warfare support. The MiG-29 is also a horrific gas guzzler with a relatively minuscule combat radius. Supportability can also be an issue and a single airframe doesn’t equate to much in terms of a robust and marketable adversary capability. Allen’s MiG, bort number RED 64, sits in the museum between sporadic flights. The aircraft is spotless. , John Veit/Wikicommons In fact, other MiG-29s that are in flyable condition have languished on the U.S. market , and the UB model can’t even accommodate a fire control radar in its standard configuration, which is an increasingly in-demand feature for high-end adversary aircraft to bring to the adversary mission. The MiG-29UB does carry an infrared search and track (IRST) ball, but it was removed during the demilitarization process and Soviet IRST’s of the era, like the one Paul Allen’s MiG-29 would have had, aren’t even that useful . Still, this is the finest example of its kind out there, one that has had white-glove treatment thanks to a billionaire’s bank account. Maybe for American fighter pilot familiarization or for test pilot school support, a business case could be made for the jet. Maybe even a microsatellite space-launch company could use the jet as a first stage booster. And it’s not unheard of for pristine examples of Russian fourth generation fighters that have already been converted for U.S. operations to disappear into the U.S. government’s dark foreign materiel exploitation (FME) ecosystem. We know this happened to a pair of restored two-seat Ukrainian Su-27s that hit the market for a short time in the late 2000s. Those jets supposedly ended up at Groom Lake , better known as Area 51. That base hosts the “Red Hats” squadron , a unit that clandestinely flies foreign aircraft for intelligence gathering, tactics and systems development, and elite aggressor duties. This MiG-29UB, in particular, may offer a turn-key opportunity that is too good for the USAF to pass up. On the other hand, the U.S. government had its exchange pilots fly MiG-29s following the end of the Cold War and has had MiG-29s of the same vintage in its own stable for decades. In fact, it had a bunch of them— ex-Moldovan examples that were transferred to the U.S. in the 1990s. As such, it’s not like Paul Allen’s MiG holds any special intelligence value of any kind. Moldovan MiG-29s being prepped for shipping to the U.S. in 1997., DoD Then there is always someone with big bucks and a love of flight, just like Paul Allen, who could see value in adding such a high-performance beast of a flying machine to their collection. Whoever does step up with millions of bucks to own their own Fulcrum, they can be certain that they are getting pretty much the best one that has ever graced private hands.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Russian Ammo Depot Has Been Burning For Hours After Exploding In Giant Shockwave,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian ammunition depot in the country’s Siberian region caught fire earlier today, sending a powerful shockwave through local communities and touching off secondary explosions that have continued for hours, making it difficult to bring the blaze under control. It is unclear how many casualties the incident may have caused already, but it has forced the evacuation of approximately 11,000 people from nearby communities. The fire at the base belonging to Russian Military Unit 74008, which manages a territorial arsenal in the village of Kamenka in the central Russian region of Krasnoyarsk began shortly before 1:00 PM local time on Aug. 5, 2019, according to state-run media outlet TASS . The fire quickly spread to a warehouse containing artillery ammunition, including shells and artillery rockets, as well as propelling charges, triggering a massive explosion. The base also reportedly houses various other munitions, including tank shells, anti-tank guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles. TASS reported earlier in the day that the fires had been burning for more than five hours, though it is unclear if emergency personnel have been able to put them out since then. The Ministry of Defense had reportedly dispatched a pair of Uran-14 unmanned firefighting vehicles to the scene to help, given the dangers posed to first responders attempting to get close to enough to actually battle the flames. https://youtube.com/watch?v=N-4GpZ4wbjA “The shells are exploding one by one,” Semyon Semyonov, a local lawmaker in the region, told TASS . “Haze and smoke are drifting from there.” Authorities had ordered the evacuation of thousands of citizens from the nearby town of Achinsk and other communities surrounding the base. The explosions were violent enough to shatter windows on homes nearby. Russian aluminum producer Rusal said that it had shut down operations at its plant in Achinsk as a safety precaution , with only essential staff remaining on site. The video below shows a Uran-14 in operation, as well as a Uran-6 mine-clearing unmanned ground vehicle. The Russian Ministry of Defense has denied reports that there has been at least one fatality, but it may be hard for first responders to know for sure until they bring the fire under control. There were additional reports of at least eight wounded individuals, but how many are military personnel and how many are civilian bystanders is unclear. TASS said four members of the Russian military and four civilians were hurt, but RT reported that only two of the injured individuals were military personnel. It is also unclear where exactly those casualties occurred. Video has appeared on social media showing craters well away from the base that appear to have come from ordnance or other debris that explosion sent flying in all directions. The exact cause of the fire is unclear, but there are a number of forest fires raging across Siberia at present amid an unprecedented heatwave . This means that major firefighting resources are already spread thin in the region. Russia has suffered similar accidents in the past. The last such incident, in May 2018 , led to fires that burned for a week before aerial firefighting aircraft and helicopters could put out the blaze. This is not a problem necessarily limited to Russia , either. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2019",Congress Demanded The Army Put Its Plans To Gut Its Underappreciated Naval Fleet On Hold (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It took a Congressional intervention to recently halt the Army’s controversial plans to dramatically cut the size of its largely unknown and underappreciated fleets of amphibious landing ships, landing craft, and various other vessels and maritime assets, which are also known as “the Army’s Navy.” This came shortly after The War Zone first reported that the General Frank S. Besson class Logistics Support Vessel USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda had come up for sale, before it quickly disappeared from the General Services Administration’s online auction house. By all indications, the service had been moving forward with the divestment of Kuroda and dozens of other so-called watercraft systems, as well as inactivating their associated units, despite having agreed months earlier to conduct an additional review of those decisions, which is still ongoing. On July 15, 2019, Phil MacNaughton, a staffer for the House Armed Services Committee, reached out to the Army to say that legislators had concerns about the service’s watercraft restructure plans, according to Military.com . Four days earlier, Kuroda had appeared on the GSA Auctions website, along with the banner advertisement promising listings for the sale of 18 LCU-2000 landing craft, up to 36 LCM-8 landing craft, 20 tugs, and a pair of floating crane barges would be coming later in 2019 and in 2020. That ad also said that a second Logistics Support Vessel (LSV) might become available, as well. By July 12, 2019, the Army had already pulled down the listing for Kuroda following The War Zone ‘s report . You can read more about this ship, which is one the service’s largest and most capable, and the other LSVs, in this past War Zone profile . On July 26, 2019, the service’s senior leadership pulled the remaining auction listings and put watercraft divestments and associated unit inactivations on hold entirely. The USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda ., US Army “The Army is delaying implementation of its watercraft restructure plan, with respect to both vessels and units, until completion of an Office of the Secretary of Defense watercraft study which is expected to be concluded by the end of the fiscal year,” Matthew Leonard, a U.S. Army spokesperson had confirmed to The War Zone on July 30, 2019. But it remains unclear why the Army was implementing its plan at that time at all. The first reports that the service was looking to significantly cut the size of its watercraft fleets emerged in January 2019 , but a briefing The War Zone subsequently obtained shows that senior leaders had begun working to transform its watercraft force as early as June 2018. An official Army briefing slide from January 2019, showing that the service’s watercraft restructuring plan dates to at least June 2018., US Army This was a month after the Army, in coordination with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), had agreed, in principle, conduct the review of its watercraft restructure plan, Pentagon spokesperson Chris Sherwood told The War Zone in an Email. The Office of the Secretary of Defense had directed the service to perform this study after earlier discussions surrounding the Pentagon’s overall budget proposal for the 2020 Fiscal Year. This is also in line with the information in the public version of the Pentagon’s 2020 Fiscal Year budget proposal that came out in March 2019. At that time, the Army’s portion thereof did not indicate any plans to significantly change the composition of the service’s watercraft fleets. The watercraft review actually began in December 2018 or January 2019, according to Sherwood. The schedule for this study was and continues to be that the final report will be ready by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year, which wraps up on Sept. 30, 2019. This all makes good sense given that this was also around the time when the Pentagon was finalizing its latest National Military Strategy , which has a heavy emphasis on preparing for potential conflicts between the United States and “great power competitors,” such as Russia and China. INDOPACOM would already have had a significant interest in any decisions regarding amphibious and maritime logistics capabilities throughout the services given the “ tyranny of distance ” in the Pacific region. In particular, the Army’s Kuroda , along with her sister ship USAV Major General Robert Smalls , form a two-ship subclass of the General Frank S. Besson class that is further optimized for open-ocean operations. These two ships displace 1,800 tons more than the other six LSVs and have greatly increased range, along with other features to support their crews during long-distance missions. These vessels can also deposit their cargos right on a beach after arriving at their destination and do not have any need for established port facilities. USAV Major General Robert Smalls , at center, with the USAV Major General Charles P. Gross , one of the six smaller LSVs, at left. An LCU-2000 landing craft is sitting alongside Smalls ., General125 via Wikimedia The LSVs, in general, along with the Army’s other watercraft fleets, which include elements forward-deployed in the Pacific, could help ease the strain on already highly in demand Navy amphibious and military sealift ships during a crisis. Army vessels could help unload ships at forward locations or otherwise move vehicles, personnel, and other cargo in littoral environments, such as within island chains. Those same capabilities extend to non-combat contingencies, such as responding to natural disasters . A briefing slide showing the locations of US Army watercraft systems, including forward-deployed locations in Pacific, as of November 2018. The “zones” here refer to how the service divides up contractor maintenance support contracts for these units., US Army Whether or not the Navy has or will have adequate capacity to replace the Army vessels has reportedly come up in the course of the ongoing review. The Navy’s new Expeditionary Transfer Dock logistics ships and Spearhead class Expeditionary Fast Transports do provide many similar capabilities. That service is also developing a replacement for its hovercraft Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC), which The War Zone has previously explored in detail . However, Sherwood, the Pentagon spokesperson, made clear to The War Zone that the Army’s ongoing watercraft study only covers that service’s particular restructuring plan and whether it aligns with other planning elsewhere in the U.S. military. With all this in mind, it is not clear why the Army had continued to move ahead with divesting ships and inactivating units in the first place before the Pentagon-directed study was done. Members of Congress certainly seemed to share the view that this could prove to be a short-sighted course of action. MacNaughton, the HASC staffer, told the Army that members of the Committee were worried that the service was making “irreversible” decisions without knowing the recommendations of its own review, according to Military.com . The future of the Army’s watercraft fleets is still uncertain. Despite reports implying otherwise, the service has only put its restructuring plans on hold until the Pentagon-directed study is done. Beyond that, Mark Esper, who was Secretary of the Army when the service began moving forward with divesting vessels and inactivating units, is now Secretary of Defense. Mark Esper, then the nominee to become the next Secretary of Defense, sits before the Senate Armed Services Committee during a confirmation hearing on July 16, 2019., Stefani Reynolds/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images The House’s version of the annual defense policy bill for the 2020 Fiscal Year, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), does seek to prohibit the Army from getting rid of any watercraft systems or associated units until it conducts another study of the plans through a federally-funded “research and development corporation,” such as RAND . Unfortunately, the House and the Senate are at odds over their respective versions of the NDAA, which could delay Congress from passing a final bill and it becoming law. The end of the 2019 Fiscal Year, the due date for the current review of the watercraft restructure plans, is right around the corner. So we may not have to wait much longer to find out what the immediate future of the Army’s Navy looks like. Update: 5:45pm EST— After we published this story, U.S. Army spokesperson Matthew Leonard was able to confirm to The War Zone that the Pentagon-directed review of the Army’s watercraft restructuring plans began in December 2018, not June 2019, as Military.com had initially reported . He also provided the following statement: “A formal analysis that involves OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense], the Joint Staff, Army Headquarters, other Services and the combatant commands has been ongoing since December 2018. Initial analysis identified excess capability beyond existing requirements. Later, the Army decided to suspend watercraft transformation while we evaluate the overall watercraft requirements needed to support of the National Defense Strategy.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Armies Land Logistics Ships Sea U.S. Army U.S. Army Vessels"

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 18, 2018",Delivery Of Newest America Class Amphibious Assault Ship Delayed Over Technical Issues,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Huntington Ingalls Industries had revealed that it will deliver the next America class amphibious assault ship, the future USS Tripoli , to the U.S. Navy later than expected, with the commissioning date potentially getting pushed back into 2020. The shipbuilder cited unspecified technical difficulties as the reason for the delays. Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (HII) CEO, made the announcement in a quarterly earnings call with reporters on Aug. 1, 2019. The Navy had planned to commission the future Tripoli , which completed builders trials in July, some time this fall , but this will now not occur until the very end of the year, at the earliest. HII launched the ship in 2017 and had delivered the first-in-class USS America to the Navy three years earlier. “The systems are working today. It’s just a question of whether they will work for the life of the ship,” Petters explained, according to USNI News . “We’re working through a couple of technical design issues that we’re working and discussing with the Navy about.” Petters added that HII was in talks with the Navy about whether or not all of the deficiencies need to be resolved before commissioning. He declined to give any details about the issues specifically. “We think that’ll come to a resolution around the end of the year, and predicting whether it’s the end of this year or the beginning the next year, we don’t want to put up sort of any extra pressure on that,” Petters continued. “We want to resolve that the right way.” The Navy made no mention of any possibility of a delay in commissioning when it announced the future Tripoli had finished builders trials on July 19, 2019. “The Navy and industry team did a commendable job this week,” Tom Rivers, the Amphibious Warfare Program Manager within the service’s Program Executive Office Ships said at the time. That HII has specifically framed the reason for the delay as “technical design issues,” rather than, say, quality control problems , further raises the question about whether these deficiencies might be related to past difficulties with the first-in-class USS America and whether that ship might still suffer from similar problems years after formally entering service. In its review of developments relating to the America class in the 2018 Fiscal Year, the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) did highlight a number of remaining issues with USS America , which is also known by its hull number LHA 6. USS America ., USN “Operational testing demonstrated that LHA 6 is effective at supporting some Marine Corps missions, but testing was not adequate to demonstrate effectiveness at supporting the full Marine Corps range of operations,” the report, which DOT&E published in March 2019 , said. “The movement of marines, cargo, and vehicles executed during testing was insufficient to generate a realistic operational tempo required by the Operational Test Agencies for an adequate operational test.” One of the core questions that remains is about whether America and the future Tripoli will be able to support the operations of a full complement of 20 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters (JSF). “The Navy will not complete the operational evaluation of the ship’s ability to support a complement of 20 F-35B JSF aircraft until 2021,” DOT&E reported in March. The Navy has conducted evaluations with smaller numbers of F-35s. This is a major issue since these two America class ships lack the well deck found on past Navy classes of amphibious assault ship and is focused primarily on aviation operations, including those involving the F-35B. The third America class ship, the future USS Bougainville , features a significantly revised design that includes a well deck and will form a subclass unto itself. The War Zone has previously examined the differences in the America class subvariants and their associated concepts of operation in depth. In addition, previous tests identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a number of unspecified networked systems on America , which DOT&E has said “could adversely affect operational effectiveness in a cyber-contested environment” in the past. Beyond that, the Navy has not completed a required trial to assess how vulnerable the America class ships are to naval mines, an increasingly worrisome threat, particularly in the Middle East , as of September 2018. Despite the issues, in 2017, America had left for her first operational deployment, which included visits to the Western Pacific and the Middle East. In January 2019, the Navy also announced that it would forward deploy the first-in-class ship to Japan, where it could become the flagship of U.S. Seventh Fleet’s amphibious forces, taking the place of the older first-in-class USS Wasp , which would return the United States. USS Wasp in the South China Sea earlier in 2019 carrying an unusually large number of F-35Bs., USN The delay in commissioning the future Tripoli also comes amid a spate of issues with other high profile Navy shipbuilding programs in recent years. The most notable of these has been the ongoing troubles with the first-in-class aircraft USS Gerald R. Ford , which continue to plague the ship and effectively prevent it from conducting any real combat operations , if necessary, in its present form, two years after its commissioning. It remains to be seen how serious the technical issues with the future Tripoli actually are, as well as if they reflect larger deficiencies with the America class design. Hopefully, the delay in commissioning the ship will be relatively minor and HII will be able to resolve the outstanding issues quickly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 2, 2019",Army Black Hawks Are Finally Getting Laser Countermeasures To Throw Off Infrared Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is working toward fielding a new directional infrared countermeasures system on its UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters that will help protect them from shoulder-fired, heat-seeking, short-range surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems or MANPADS . Variants of this defensive suite may become standard equipment on AH-64 Apache gunships and CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters flying in combat zones in the future, replacing a number of other kits the service has already adopted on a more limited scale. Black Hawk crews from the 3rd Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, part of the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade at Fort Hood, Texas, traveled to Redstone Arsenal in Alabama earlier in 2019 to train on what the Army is calling the Common Infrared Countermeasures (CIRCM) system. Northrop Grumman developed the CIRCM system and supplied the first example for testing in 2016. The company announced that it had finished the operational test and evaluation phase and begun full-scale production of the defensive suite for the Army in September 2018. “Due to the evolving battlefield threats, the CIRCM comes at a pivotal time for Army aviation in order to improve the survivability of our crews that will be deploying in support of combat operations,” Chief Warrant Officer 4 Toby Blackmon, a member of the U.S. Army Operational Test Command’s Aviation Test Directorate, said in a statement . “We designed the test events [for 3-227th’s personel] to cover all the potential environments that aircrews may find themselves in.” The full CIRCM system itself uses a pair of turreted “pointer/trackers” to track incoming infrared-homing, short-range surface-to-air missiles and then cue one of two lasers to blind and confuse their seekers, sending the weapon off course. CIRCM leverages the existing AN/AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), which consists of electro-optical sensors installed in various locations around the helicopter, to initially spot the threat so that the pointer/trackers can target it. The CMWS also provides its own audio and visual warnings to the crew so that they can take appropriate evasive action. The components of the CIRCM system, as well as the CMWS., DOD The steady proliferation of MANPADS , as well as the improved countermeasure-defeating capabilities found on many newer designs, has led the U.S. military as a whole to begin increasingly installing directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) systems on various helicopters , as well as Osprey tilt-rotors and certain fixed-wing aircraft . Foreign countries, such as Russia , are doing the same based on their own experiences with the MANPADS threat . DIRCM systems add an additional layer of defense against heat-seeking threats beyond traditional decoy flares. The Army’s CIRCM program itself dates all the way back to 2009. At that point, the Army had already hired BAE Systems to provide an earlier DIRCM system called the AN/ALQ-212 Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM). The Army had planned to field ATIRCM across its AH-64, UH-60, and CH-47 fleets, but unfortunately, it proved to be too heavy to fit on the Apaches and Black Hawks. The service subsequently only bought fewer than 100 of these systems, which had the same general concept of operation as the newer CIRCM. The components of CIRCM versus those for ATIRCM., US Army However, the follow-on CIRCM program moved slowly, with the Army only awarding the final contract to Northrop Grumman in 2015. In the meantime, with demand growing within the service for a DIRCM capability on various helicopters, especially for the specialized MH-60 Black Hawks and MH-47 Chinooks within the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the service sought other interim options. The Army subsequently purchased a number of variants of the AN/AAQ-24 Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system, another Northrop Grumman DIRCM system, for use on Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks. Variations of LAIRCM were already in service on various helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as with foreign operators . Limited numbers of Army Apaches have since deployed to various combat zones, including Iraq and Syria, with a version of the LAIRCM installed. In 2018, DOT&E had reported that there were deficiencies with the AH-64 installations and that Army had also experienced still largely unexplained setbacks in trying to successfully integrate the systems onto its UH-60s and CH-47s. An Army Apache with the LAIRCM system installed. The turrets are visible on the tips of its stub wings., US Army This seemed curious at the time, especially that other U.S. and foreign operators were flying AH-64s, CH-47s, and Black Hawk variants with similar, and in some cases identical, DIRCM systems. With regards to the H-60 platform, specifically, Marine VH-60N VIP helicopters , charged with safely moving around the President of the United States and other senior officials, have been flying with LAIRCM for years now. A Marine VH-60N with the LAIRCM installed. The turrets are visible under the fuselage., AP Whatever the case, the Army has clearly seen more success with its CIRCM system. “In general, the CIRCM system performed as intended,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, reported in its annual report for the 2018 Fiscal Year. “The CIRCM system reliability requirement is 214 hours mean time between operational failures, which allows for a 95 percent chance of completing a typical 11-hour mission. The operational flight tests did not include enough hours to assess the 214-hour requirement,” DOT&E’s report notes. “However, flight test data to date indicates CIRCM is on track to meet the requirement at the conclusion of IOT&E [Initial Operational Test and Evaluation] with a current measured reliability of 115 hours.” The Army’s plan is still to eventually integrate the system with its AH-64s and CH-47s, as well. In these cases, the CIRCM will replace the ATIRCM and LAIRCM systems and creating commonality across the service, which will reduce maintenance and logistics strains. A US Army CH-47F with the ATIRCM system installed., US Army But the first order of business appears to be to get CIRCM to Black Hawk units that continue to lack any sort of DIRCM capability, which will only continue to become increasingly important as lightweight heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles continue to spread around the world. Correction: The original version of this story said that the UH-60M test aircraft that Army aviators from the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade trained on at Redstone only had one pointer/tracker installed, on top of the helicopter, but this was incorrect. The aircraft did, in fact, have both pointer/trackers installed, with the second being under the fuselage .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States now reportedly has permission to fly armed drones in support of its operations in the west African country of Niger, but it remains unclear if it has done so, or if it even has the capability to do so, yet. Satellite imagery and planned fuel purchases do indicate increased U.S. military activity in the country , and potentially in neighboring Algeria, even before a deadly ambush near the village of Tongo Tongo that resulted in the deaths of four American troops. On Nov. 30, 2017, The New York Times reported that U.S. and Nigerien authorities had reached an understanding regarding the use of armed unmanned aircraft inside the country, citing anonymous officials and an official memorandum. Unnamed sources subsequently gave similar details to other outlets. According to Reuters , the United States had not made use of the new agreement at that time, and it was unclear who would have to approve any such strike. At the time of writing, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) had not yet responded to The War Zone’s query about whether drones were now flying armed missions over Niger. The memo The Times obtained said that the American facilities adjacent to the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aérienne 101, attached to Diori Hamani International Airport in the country’s capital Niamey, would host the new armed flights. Since 2013, the U.S. Air Force’s 323rd Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron has flown MQ-9 Reapers from the base, but for surveillance missions without any weapons. One publicly available image, seen at the top of this story, shows a drone with a drop tank for extended range under one wing and an empty pylon under the other. American and Nigerien officials had reportedly been working on the new arrangement for months, but both parties moved to finish the deal after a deadly ambush by suspected terrorists from the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, or ISGS , close the Niger-Mali border led to the deaths of four U.S. Army soldiers between Oct. 4 and 6, 2017. Satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe, provided through Google Earth, shows significant unmanned aircraft activity in Niamey even before then. The most recent image, dated Sept. 9, 2017, caught no less than three Reapers outside of their clam shell hangars, including one on the taxiway leading to Diori Hamani’s main runway. Three MQ-9 Reapers on the ramp at Niamey on Sept. 9, 2017., Google Earth It’s not clear whether or not all three aircraft belong to the 323rd, though. France flies its own Reapers from facilities next to the American base. Before October 2017, the French had secured the right to fly armed missions from Niamey with their drones, as well as Mirage 2000D fighter jets. The Satellite imagery also shows French and German C-160 Transall transports and a French KC-135FR tanker at the base, all of which are supporting those countries counter-terrorism and security assistance efforts in the region . A Reaper flying from the base was reportedly overhead during the Tongo Tongo within minutes of American commanders receiving a request for additional support from the embattled troops, followed by French Mirages and helicopters . Earlier in December 2017, BuzzFeed News reported that the American personnel and their Nigerien partners had in fact crossed the border briefly into Mali to hunt for specific militants during the operation, citing various named and unnamed Nigerien officials. U.S. military personnel, and private contractors supporting their missions can “be temporarily present in the Republic of Niger in connection with visits, training, exercises, and humanitarian activities, and other activities as mutually agreed,” according to the 2013 Status of Forces Agreement. The combined force then found itself ambushed as it made its way back to a forward base in the city of Ouallam, which effectively lies halfway between Tongo Tongo and Niamey. The opening paragraph from the 2013 US-Niger Status of Forces Agreement., Department of State The new details only raised new questions about the nature of and planning for the supposedly “low risk” mission, the resources available to American forces in the region, and oversight of those activities. It remains unclear whether or not the unit was even suitably equipped for that task and if not, why not? The exact circumstances of the incident remain under investigation. There are other indications that the United is indeed stepping up its presence in and around Niger in the aftermath of the firefight near Tongo Tongo. “The war is morphing. You’re going to see more actions in Africa, not less,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, had told reporters after meeting with Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Oct. 20, 2017. An airmen keeps watch from a Humvee while guarding the US compound in Agadez, Niger., USAF On Dec. 1, 2017, the Defense Logistics Agency issued an amendment to a contract notice regarding prepositioned supplies at jet fuel at sites throughout Europe and Africa in support of U.S. military activities. The change specifically added a requirement for supplies of commercial Jet A fuel at three sites: Manu Dayak Airport in the central Nigerien city of Agadez, Houari Boumediene Airport in the Algerian capital Algiers, and Tamanrasset/Aguenar Airport. DLA Tamanrasset/Aguenar, which is also co-located with an Algerian Air Force Base, is situated in Algeria less than 200 miles from the Nigerien border and within 300 miles of Mali. Terrorists, other militants, and criminal organizations all operate with significant freedom in this sparely inhabited tri-border area. DLA says it wants fuel to be in place starting in March 2018 and running at least through September 2019. At the time of publishing, AFRICOM had not yet responded to questions about the exact nature of its activities, or those of contractors supporting the command, at Tamanrasset/Aguenar. Tamanrasset/Aguenar Airport to the right and the adjacent Algerian Air Force base to the left., Google Earth But we at The War Zone have already written in detail about how establishing an armed drone mission in Niger would require additional personnel, facilities, and other resources. Commercial jet fuel there could help enable the delivery of the additional equipment and supplies necessary for expanding operations at sites in Niger, as well as elsewhere throughout the region. U.S. conventional military and special operations forces both routinely use contract airlift to support their activities, including covert operations , especially across Africa . Most notably, the United States is planning to eventually move the entire Nigerien drone operation, armed or otherwise, to an all-new facility near the city of Agadez to the northeast of Niamey. Since at least 2015, the U.S. Air Force conducts operations there from a compound attached to the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aérienne 201, with both parties making use Manu Dayak Airport’s single runway. The foreboding conditions in the region have delayed construction of the new base and we don’t know the extent of American operations there at present. However, a picture from October 2017 does show a clam shell hangar, commonly associated with unmanned aircraft operations. US Air Force Lieutenant General Richard Clark, at center, the commander of the 17th Expeditionary Air Force, visits Agadez on Oct. 19, 2017. A clam shell hanger is visible to the far left., USAF The U.S. military has acknowledged that foreboding conditions in the region has delayed construction of the new base. The United States officially hopes to get things fully up and running some time in 2018. Given the present circumstances, this could now coincide with an expanding American military presence elsewhere in Niger, or in neighboring countries, such as Algeria. Update: U.S. Africa Command has gotten responded to our queries, confirming that the United States does now have permission to fly armed drone missions within Niger. In addition, the pre-positioned fuel in Niger and Algeria is not in response to a specific, official requirement for the command or any of its service components. “This amendment is a common practice to ensure worldwide fuel and service availability,” Robyn Mack, a spokesperson, told The War Zone in an Email. “This is a standard procedure to ensure support is available to aircraft flying worldwide and is not related to a new operation, ongoing operation, or training exercise.” That being said, the need to make sure fuel and service are available to flights at the three locations still points to an increasing U.S. military emphasis on North and West Africa. We will definitely continue to watch for any new developments in this part of the world. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Q-9 Unmanned"

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 30, 2019",What We Know About A Mysterious Collision Between A Chinese Warship And A Taiwanese Cargo Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Authorities in Taiwan have said a still unidentified Chinese naval ship collided with the Taiwanese-flagged container ship Yutai Number One in the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, but details about exactly what transpired remain murky. The incident comes amid a spike in tensions between Taiwanese authorities and their counterparts in Beijing. On Aug. 1, 2019, the Taiwanese Coast Guard announced that the Yutai Number One and the Chinese warship had hit each other at approximately 8:00 PM local time the night before in an established shipping lane, causing damage to both vessels, but no reported injuries. The incident reportedly occurred approximately 20 miles south of Kinmen County, a pair of islands that Taiwan controls, but which are situated less than 10 miles from the Chinese mainland. Kinmen is also on the Chinese side of a de facto boundary in the Taiwan Strait separating the two sides. The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ship “requested [ Yutai Number One ] to go to Xiamen for investigation,” Chen Jian Wen, a Taiwanese Coast Guard official told reporters in Kinmen. “So it asked us to send patrol ships to the rescue.” A map showing the approximate location of the incident, as well as the proximity of Kinmen to the mainland., Google Maps Taiwan’s Coast Guard dispatched two small 100-ton displacement patrol boats to the general area of the incident, which were able to locate the Yutai Number One and escort it safely to Liaoluo Port in Kinmen. One of them then made a search for the other ship involved, eventually locating the unidentified Chinese warship. “The military vessel said its hull was seriously damaged and its navigation was limited,” Chen said. “It refused to stop as it immediately needed to return to Xiamen port for safety.” The Taiwanese patrol boat was unable to read the PLAN ship’s hull number in the dark, according to Chen. However, it appeared that the Chinese vessel had been sailing northeast from Dongshan County in Fuijan Province. The ship could have been participating in People’s Liberation Army exercises in the Taiwan Strait , which began on July 29, 2019, and are scheduled to wrap up tomorrow. A Taiwanese Coast Guard patrol boat of the same class as the ones that responded to the incident involving Yutai Number One ., Marine Jet Power Taiwanese authorities have, so far, declined to say which ship might have been at fault or whether the PLAN vessel deliberately struck the freighter. We also don’t know what cargo Yutai Number One was carrying at the time. It is possible that the incident was simply an accident. In separate incidents in 2017, two U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers hit commercial ships, which led to the deaths of 17 American sailors in total. Subsequent investigations into these collisions, which also occurred in known shipping lanes, found that they were “preventable” and “avoidable,” but entirely accidental. Any number of unintentional factors could have similarly led the PLAN ship and Yutai Number One to come into contact. That the Chinese naval vessel offered to escort the Taiwanese container ship to a Chinese port may simply have reflected a standard operating procedure. Xiamen is not significantly further away from the approximate site of the incident than Liaoluo. At the same time, the PLAN , as well as China’s own Coast Guard and government-supported fleets of fishing boats, the latter of which have earned the nickname “ Little Blue Men ,” have been responsible for numerous deliberate collisions and near-collisions in recent years. These incidents have generally been expressions of China’s attempts to assert its authority over disputed maritime regions, particularly the South China Sea . Just in March 2019, Vietnam said a Chinese vessel rammed a Vietnamese fishing boat, causing it to sink. Two months later, a similar incident occurred involving Filipino fishermen . In September 2018, the Chinese Type 052C Luyang II -class destroyer Lanzhou aggressively maneuvered near the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Decatur , which could easily have led to a serious accident. A still from a video shot that US Navy aircraft or helicopter took of the near-collision between the USS Decatur, at left, and the Lanzhou , at right., USN The incident may have been a deliberate act meant to send a signal to the Taiwanese government. It does certainly comes a time when relations between Taipei and Beijing, as well as those between China and Taiwan’s principal ally, the United States, are particularly strained. In April 2019, after months of increasingly aggressive PLA aerial activity around the island, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen said she had ordered the Taiwanese Air Force to “ forcibly expel ” any Chinese military aircraft that violated the boundary line in the Taiwan Strait. The PLA’s ongoing exercises in the Taiwan Strait also follow an uptick in U.S. military ships sailing through the waterway as part of Freedom of Navigation Operations, or FONOPs, to challenge Chinese claims to the entire waterway and demonstrate support for authorities in Taipei. Though the United States recognizes the government in Beijing, it reserves the right to continue diplomatic relations with Taipei and help provide for its defense until the status of the island is settled. In July 2019, the U.S. government announced it had approved a number of potential arms sales to Taiwan, including M1 Abrams tanks, and there are reports that President Donald Trump’s Administration might okay a deal for new advanced Block 70 F-16 Viper fighter jets, as well. Beijing has made clear that a Taiwanese purchase of additional F-16s would be crossing a firm “red line.” Chinese authorities see Taiwan as an integral part of its own national territory and they have labeled President Tsai as an “ independence extremist” in the past. Beijing also routinely protests U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Taiwan wants to augment its fleet of older F-16s, some of which are seen here, with newer versions. , 總統府 via Wikimedia On top of everything else, Taiwan’s government has expressed its support for protestors in Hong Kong, who have been demonstrating for weeks, initially over a now-abandoned law that would have weakened the independence of the semi-autonomous region’s judiciary. Those protests have now evolved to include demands that Hong Kong executive Carrie Lam resign and for a “free Hong Kong,” which Beijing might be concerned is a call for full independence. On Aug. 1, 2019, the PLA’s garrison in Hong Kong, which has publicly described itself as a valuable political tool for Beijing in the region in the past, released a video showing “anti-riot” exercises. This appeared to be a clear, if veiled threat to protesters, some of whom Hong Kong authorities have now charged with rioting . “Recently, there have been a series of violent incidents happening in Hong Kong,” Major General Chen Daoxiang, the Hong Kong garrison commander said in remarks to a gathering of dignitaries, including Carrie Lam, that same day, which were ostensibly meant to mark the 92nd anniversary of the PLA. “The incidents have seriously violated the bottom line of ‘one country, two systems.’ This should not be tolerated and we express our strong condemnation.” There have been persistent rumors for some time now that the PLA could be considering declaring martial law in Hong Kong to put an end to the protests for good. This, in turn, has already drawn comparisons to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, which the Chinese government ultimately brutally crushed. The exact number of individuals who died in that crackdown is still unclear. Back in Taiwan, authorities say they are continuing to investigate the incident involving the Yutai Number One . It will hopefully become more clear in the near future whether it was a benign accident or a deliberate altercation driven by already rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 16, 2019",North Korea’s Kim Jong Un Has A New Luxury Missile Launch Viewing Van,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Kimster is slowly getting back into his old routine of testing different types of missiles and making high-profile inspections of new and advanced (relatively) strategic weaponry that is under construction. The launches have gone from sporadic to near-daily now, though he has kept them limited to short-range systems, maybe in an attempt to keep Trump off his back and to continue experiencing the far more tranquil environment he now enjoys, one that he gave up next to nothing to attain. One of the things that caught our eye with this week’s multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) test was the fact that Kim viewed it from inside a custom-built observation vehicle that we have never seen before. It’s just another sign that when it comes to those at the top of the regime itself, international sanctions have not stopped them from spending lavishly on official and lavishly customized state vehicles . The images show Kim and the typical brace of regime goons inside a small bus or large van that has been totally outfitted for observing test launches. In the past, Kim has always had his little field office setup for these spectacles, which included a number of key items: large desk, a few flat-screen monitors showing the telemetry from the launch and other footage, a phone system of some sort, a pair of huge binoculars, and an ashtray to support his incessant cigarette consumption. Sometimes paper maps, pointers, and paperweights are also present. A canopy of some kind often covers the whole setup. But this arrangement often left Kim out in the elements, from the heat of summer to cold winds of winter. Also, it offered no protection if the experimental projectiles veered far off course and impacted nearby. He was literally exposed out in the open. In addition, North Korea has been more heavily censoring photos of recent launches to try to conceal their locations, some of which are totally new . That objective conflicts with photographing Kim in an open-air field office. Even concealing Kim from high-flying prying eyes could now be a major priority. The setup did provide some ridiculous comic book villain-like imagery that has since been ingrained in pop culture. NK State Media NK State Media NK State Media Note Kim’s limo in the background., NK State Media NK State Media With this in mind, making a mobile observation post with all the same accouterments of the usual field offices used by the “Young General” is a somewhat logical evolution, but it would come at a cost. We reached out to our colleague, automotive journalist Jonathan Klein, as to what type of vehicle this might be. He was inclined to think it was a Mercedes Sprinter-like mini-bus conversion. This would make a ton of sense as we know the Kim family has a long love affair with Mercedes Benz automobiles and Kim Jong Un is already in his second iteration of armored Mercedes Guard limousines. We also know all too well that North Korea has an elaborate smuggling network that is designed to acquire these types of vehicles and import them clandestinely into the country, skirting international sanctions, for the regime’s use. As you can see in the images below, the cabin is fairly roomy and is replete with cherry wood accidents ( similar to his plane ), soft-touch liners, and a hardwood floor. There is a small refreshment and control area as well, with what looks like Keurig-like coffee maker or other beverage dispenser. It is likely the vehicle also has a private restroom for Kim as the composition of his fecal matter is a closely guarded secret . And, of course, it also has all the staples of the field offices seen during previous Kim Jong Un ‘commanded’ missile launches. It may even be reconfigurable for other uses by the regime when it is not being used to monitor weapons tests as there are no hard fixtures installed on its floors.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet has gone down near Naval Air Weapons Stations China Lake in California. The condition of the pilot is unknown and search and rescue operations are already underway. NAWS China Lake is the Navy’s premier weapons and aircraft test and development base in the western United States. It is surrounded by the sprawling R2508 Complex , which includes ‘Star Wars Canyon,’ that supports testing and training from numerous bases in the region, including Edwards AFB, Plant 42, Fort Irwin, and others. NAWS China Lake is also the epicenter of the recent powerful earthquakes that struck California in early July, 2019. In these past War Zone articles, you can read all about the base and what it is like to work there . We will update this post as more information comes available. UPDATE: 1 pm PDT— Multiple reports are coming in to us that the Super Hornet slammed into the canyon wall just below the parking area at the famous ‘Star Wars Canyon,’ also known as the ‘Jedi Transition’ and ‘Rainbow Canyon.’ The site is a Mecca for aviation photographers that capture military aircraft rushing through the steep canyon on low-level training sorties. We have done dozens of posts on this amazing place and the photos and videos are captured there . We have been told that there were some injuries in the parking lot, supposedly they were burn-related. As always, details are subject to change as this is a rapidly developing story. We will continue to update this story in real-time as more info comes to light. Update: 1:25pm PDT— A couple of perspectives from Google Earth of the parking area in relation to the canyon: Google Earth Google Earth The aircraft belonged to VFA-151 ‘Vigilantes’ based at NAS Lemoore in California. Still no word on the pilot. Some great video of jets making runs through the canyon and a great cockpit video of a Hornet blasting through the canyon. The Star Wars Canyon portion of the second video starts at about 2:30 in: UPDATE: 5:09pm PDT— The LA Times has a supposed image of the jet just before it crashed as well as another picture with a huge scorched scar on the side of the cliff where it hit. UPDATE: 7:26pm PDT— Some info from a witness nearby: The crash sent dark smoke billowing in the air, said Aaron Cassell, who was working at his family’s Panamint Springs Resort about 10 miles (16 kilometres) away and was the first to report the crash to park dispatch. “I just saw a black mushroom cloud go up,” Cassell told The Associated Press. “Typically you don’t see a mushroom cloud in the desert.” … Cassell said he heard jets roaring through the area and then saw the cloud of smoke. “It looked like a bomb,” Cassell said. “To me that speaks of a very violent impact.” A jet that was following the downed craft pulled up and began circling, Cassell said. He didn’t see any parachute. His father drove up to the area after the crash and saw a large black scorch mark and shattered parts of the jet scattered throughout the area between the parking lot and lookout, Cassell said. A nose cone from the jet was the size of a bowling ball and the rest of the debris was no larger than a ball cap. UPDATE: 1:40am PDT— This Fox26 report has some photos from the crash site and even some video of those that were hurt. It is very possible they were European aviation enthusiasts visiting the site based on the location and their accents. So glad they weren’t more badly injured in the terrible incident. The pilot is still unaccounted for. The Jedi Transition is off-limits to aircrews while search and rescue efforts are underway. It will be very interesting to see if it ever really opens up again to low-level traffic, and if so, what restrictions will be put in place. UPDATE: 1:21pm PDT— We are very sad to report that the Navy has concluded that the Naval Aviator died when the jet impacted the canyon wall.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 25, 2018",Check Out This Totally Stripped Thunderbird F-16C Taking Off From Hill AFB’s Taxiway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has released some cool shots of aircraft taking off from Hill AFB’s main taxiway while the base’s runway undergoes a deep rehabilitation. Most of the jets based at Hill have dispersed to other air bases in the region or are on deployment overseas while the runway work is being done—most notably, multiple squadrons of F-35s . But the base’s critical depot-level maintenance centers that make up the Ogden Air Logistics Complex and support much of the greater Air Force’s fleet have to continue their work. So, the taxiway is being used as an improvised runway for these purposes, including function check flights to test aircraft systems after deep overhauls. These processes often include stripping a plane’s old paint job and applying a new one . For the Thunderbirds ‘ Block 52 F-16s, with their highly unique and iconic red, white, and blue paint scheme, even after the jets are stripped, certain parts of the planes still give away the fact that they belong to the elite team. U.S. Air Force photo by Alex R. Lloyd C-130s, which receive deep maintenance at the base, are the largest aircraft allowed to use the temporary and narrow runway. F-16s, F-35s, F-22s, and A-10s are among the other types that also get serviced at Hill. Hill AFB., Google Earth A news release from Hill AFB discussed the unique arrangement with the taxiway, it stated the following : “In normal training you don’t train for landing on such a narrow taxiway,” said F-22 Raptor test pilot Maj. Philip Johnson. “We did a certification program in the squadron, which consisted of ground training and one flight where we landed on the taxiway before we could accomplish any functional check flights in any non-airworthy aircraft.” At more than two miles long, the taxiway is plenty long enough, it’s just quite narrow in most areas and isn’t as smooth a surface as a runway is designed to be. Using the taxiway also meant landing and taking off much closer to buildings that are located just to the west side of the taxiway, which caused crosswinds to affect the aircraft in a much different way. With operating hours ranging from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., summer brought fair weather allowing the pilots to operate in and out of the base without the use of instrument landing aides. “We were all surprised how easy is was to become comfortable to land and takeoff from the taxiway,” Johnson said. A C-130 touches down on the temporary runway which sits very close to the tower and also closer to the hangars and other facilities that line the west side of the base. , U.S. Air Force photo by Alex R.

So, Hill’s residents will slowly migrate back to the base to utilize the refurbished runway under normal operating parameters. But the use of the taxiway as a runway is quite topical seeing as the USAF is eyeing working from austere strips and rapidly building-up their capacity to support flight operations in far-flung locales. Maybe some of the flight operations from Hill’s taxiway will inform future contingency plans. In the meantime, the return to operation of the installation’s 13,550-foot runway is certain to be a welcome reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",The Army Abruptly Pulls Ship Auction Listings And Halts Plans To Slash Its Naval Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army, at least for the immediate future, has put plans on hold to gut its obscure and underappreciated fleets of amphibious ships, landing craft, tugs, and other maritime assets. The General Services Administration, or GSA, which had previously announced it would be auctioning off dozens of these vessels over the next year and a half, has pulled down all of the existing listings offline. The first to go was for USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda , one of the Army’s eight General Frank S. Besson class Logistics Support Vessels, or LSVs, which disappeared shortly after The War Zone first reported it was up for sale and highlighted the potential controversy surrounding selling it. On July 25, 2019, gCaptain , citing an anonymous source, was first to report that Acting Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy had ordered an end to the previous plans to divest as many as two of the LSVs, along with 18 LCU-2000 , up to 36 LCM-8 landing craft , 20 tugs, and a pair of floating crane barges. The memorandum reportedly also puts a stop to the inactivation of at least nine watercraft units and reassignment of those personnel to other positions with the Army. The LSVs, which you can read about them in more detail in this past profile at The War Zone , are the largest ships the Army has and Kuroda is one of the newset and most capable. The War Zone had previously reached out to the Army for additional information about the sale of the various vessels, which the service refers to collectively as watercraft systems and that have earned the nickname “the Army’s Navy,” as well as the inactivations. We had been in contact with Army public affairs officials already and followed up again after gCaptain ‘s report last week. At the time of writing, the service was still working with us to confirm the existence of McCarthy’s order or to provide responses to our other queries. However, the disappearance of the auction listings for Kuroda and various other Army vessels from the GSA website all but confirms that the divestments and inactivations have come to a halt, at least for the time being. It’s not entirely clear why this happened or when the Army reversed course in its decision. The USAV SSGT Robert T. Kuroda ., US Army What we do know is that The War Zone first reported that the Kuroda , among other Army watercraft systems, was up for auction on the GSA’s website on July 11, 2019. By the next day, that particular listing was gone, despite the auction listing having said it would be open for bidding through the end of the month. At that time, GSA said that the Army would have been responsible for delisting the ship and that they did not have any specific information about why the service had done so. Listings for three tugs and a crane barge remained online. The banner advertisement, seen below, remained at the top of the GSA Auctions website . A screenshot of the banner ad on the GSA Auctions website on July 11, 2019., GSA As of July 25, 2019, when gCaptain ‘s report emerged, GSA had modified the banner ad to remove any mention of the LSVs. It subsequently disappeared completely, along with the listings for the tugs and the crane barge. This would suggest that the Army only made the decision to halt its watercraft plans entirely on or about July 25, even though the service appeared to have already reversed its decision to get rid of multiple LSVs immediately after The War Zone ‘s report. It remains unclear why exactly the Army decided to change course, but Army leadership is in the midst of its own transition. On July 23, 2019, the Senate confirmed Mark Esper , previously the Secretary of the Army, as Secretary of Defense. On July 25, 2019, Senators also confirmed U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Still, even if the service only expects the halt in its plans to be temporary, postponing the divestments and inactivations could provide an opportunity to reassess the decision. Members of Congress who have begun to see reports about the watercraft decisions in the media may also make their weight felt in any such discussions. The War Zone has received responses from readers that range from appalled to puzzled. As The War Zone has noted on multiple occasions now , the Army’s naval fleet offers important, organic capabilities for the service, especially with regards to a potential conflict in the Pacific region. The “ tyranny of distance ” there could easily mean Army units would find themselves operating across fronts thousands of miles from the main logistics hubs. According to gCaptain , Advocates of significant cuts to the Army’s watercraft fleets reportedly have argued that they fill roles better served by the U.S. Navy’s new Expeditionary Transfer Dock logistics ships and the hovercraft landing craft that service is developing to replace its Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC), the latter of which The War Zone has covered in depth here . In 2011, the Navy had also taken exclusive ownership of were then called Joint High Speed Vessels (JSHV), which subsequently got renamed as Spearhead -class Expeditionary Fast Transports , or EPFs. The Army had expected to use these catamaran vessels to help rapidly move personnel and equipment, especially around in the Pacific. The remaining Army ships, especially the LSVs, could still help move cargo between intermediate staging points or within littoral areas without further straining the Navy’s already heavily in demand amphibious and logistics ships, or having to hire additional chartered vessels. Contracted ships might not be willing or able to operate in a combat zone, either. It had seemed particularly short-sighted to start the divestments with the 6,000-ton displacement Kuroda , which, together with her sister ship USAV Major General Robert Smalls , forms a subclass of the General Frank S. Besson class. These two ships, which are the youngest of the LSVs and cost $26 million to build, displace 1,800 tons more than the other six LSVs on account of a revised bow design and other features to improve their ocean-going capabilities, which would be particularly useful in a Pacific scenario. Kuroda and Smalls have a range of 6,500 miles and can discharge their cargos right on the beach without the need for specialized port facilities after arriving at their destination. Army LSVs and other watercraft have also shown their worth during non-combat disaster relief and humanitarian assistance missions , again offering additional capabilities without having to further burden Navy ships or hire additional contracted vessels. The Puerto Rico Army National Guard also has a few of the landing craft, meaning they are even better positioned to respond to domestic crises there. It remains to be seen how permanent the Army’s decision to keep its watercraft fleets, as well as units that operate them, intact might be. For the immediate future, though, the Army’s Navy has made an abrupt change of course and looks set to sail on for some time to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 24, 2019",The Navy’s Troubled New Carrier Still Only Has Two Working Weapons Elevators,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s long-troubled first-in-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford could leave an already extended stay in dry dock later this year with just two of its 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators, or AWEs, operational. The nine remaining elevators, which help move ordnance and other aircraft stores to and from the main flight deck to the ship’s magazines and are critical to carrier’s ability to fight, might not all be useable until 2020, at the earliest. In January 2019, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer had publicly said that President Donald Trump should fire him if this were to happen. These details emerged as Senator Jim Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma and the current Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, grilled U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Gilday over the Ford ‘s failings at a confirmation hearing on July 31, 2019. Presently the Director of the Joint Staff, Gilday is in line to become the next Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy’s top uniformed officer. “Even with this delay, only two of the 11 elevators are going to be ready in October,” Inhofe revealed in leading up to a question for Gilday. “Nine elevators will not be ready and likely will not be complete until 2020 or later.” “This is going to be dumped in your lap,” he added. It had already emerged earlier this year that the Navy had only been able to certify two of Ford ‘s AWEs for regular use. However, the Navy had stressed that it was working to rectify the issue and would use the carrier’s planned maintenance and rework period as an opportunity to make progress on fixing the problems. As noted, in January, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer had gone so far as to say that Trump should fire him if the ship left the shipyard in Newport News, Virginia without the elevators operational. “I asked him to stick his hand out; he stuck his hand out. I said, let’s do this like corporate America. I shook his hand and said, the elevators will be ready to go when she pulls out or you can fire me,” Spencer said at the time. “We’re going to get it done. I know I’m going to get it done. I haven’t been fired yet by anyone; being fired by the president really isn’t on the top of my list.” In response to Inhofe’s questioning, Gilday noted that as many as four elevators could potentially be working by the time Ford left drydock, which is now scheduled to occur in October 2019, but that the majority of them would remain unusable. This is a three month later than expected and the delay was the result of a separate, unexpected propulsion system problem. The USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN “It’s still unacceptable,” Gilday agreed. “We need all 11 elevators working in order to give us the kind of redundancy and combat readiness that the American taxpayer has invested in this ship.” This is something of an understatement. The AWEs are absolutely critical to the carrier’s flight operations and not being able to use more than half to them can only limit sortie generation as flight deck crews have to make more trips to and from the ship’s magazines to bring up the necessary missiles, bombs, and other stores. It could also limit access to certain magazines. The Navy itself has claimed that the new elevators, which use electromagnetic propulsion to move up and down, will increase sortie rates on Ford class carriers by between 25 and 30 percent over Nimitz class ships, because they can move faster and require less routine maintenance. The AWEs move at speeds up to 150 feet per minute, even with loads up to 24,000 pounds, more than twice the capacity and one and a half times faster than the traditional cable-driven designs on the Nimitzs. The service has long blamed the persistent problems with the elevators on finicky software-based control systems , but a separate story from Bloomberg on July 31, 2019, highlighted issues with the AWEs that have emerged as a product of a process known as “ concurrency ,” wherein Newport News Shipbuilding began construction of the ship without having a completely finalized design or fully mature components. Due to the “concurrent nature of elevator development and construction” the AWEs “have been test beds for discovering developmental issues that have delayed the turnover to the crew,” U.S. Navy Captain Danny Hernandez, a service spokesperson, told Bloomberg . As many as 70 elevator doors and 17 elevator hatches do not meet the required specifications because of how the ship’s physical structure has otherwise evolved over time. It remains unclear if the Navy will be able to meet the 2020 deadline for having all of the AWEs certified for regular use, either. In May 2019, the service announced it was building a land-based test facility for the elevators to support continued work on them. This structure won’t be operational until some time in 2020. Earlier in July, the service also said it had put together a team of experts to help with finally solving the problems with the elevators. “The secretary’s promise to the president eight months ago indicates either poor knowledge of the facts or poor judgment. This is the latest example of Navy leaders not being straightforward when it comes to their programs,” Inhofe told Gilday during the hearing. “That’s quite a charge, isn’t it?” Of course, the elevators are just one of a number of issues still plaguing the Ford , including unreliable electrically powered and controlled catapults and arresting gear , which cannot be able to safely launch and recover the Navy’s new F-35C Joint Strike Fighters and may not be able to do so until 2027. This is to say nothing of other persistent issues with the ship’s radar, propulsion system, and more. “We’ve had 23 new technologies introduced on that ship, as you know,” Gilday responded. “Of those, four were immature when we commissioned Ford in 2017.” “It’s the elevators, I think, that is the remaining hurdle to get over to get that ship at sea,” he added. This doesn’t change the fact that the Navy still has a significant ways to go before the Ford ‘s other critical systems are meeting the required performance targets. Ford is scheduled to leave on her first operational deployment in 2021, but the revelation about the AWEs only underscores the ship’s inability to provide any kind of real capability now, should the Navy need it in a crisis, two years after formally entering service. That the Navy still cannot provide a firm timeline on when all of the elevators will be working can only raise more questions about how capable the carrier might be when it does put to sea for its first real cruise two years from now, if that even occurs in the end.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 6, 2020",Congressman Has Written An Official Letter To The Navy Demanding Answers On UFOs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A member of the House of Representatives says the recent uptick in news regarding what many would call unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, something The War Zone has been a leading investigative source of , could reflect emerging threats to U.S. national airspace and homeland security, rather than simply military and intelligence concerns. Mark Walker, a Republican from North Carolina, has now written an open letter to Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer asking for more details about what that service is doing to record and assess sightings of what are increasingly referred to as unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP. Walker, who is a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and the ranking Republican on its Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, wrote the letter to Spencer on July 16, 2019. He subsequently made it public on his website on July 29, 2019, three days after he went on Fox News ‘ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to voice his concerns . “The reports mention the existence of these encounters both domestically and abroad during various [U.S. military] missions and trainings,” Walker wrote in his letter. “Additionally, there have been reports of significant investments in advanced aerospace technologies like the recorded UAP encounters by China.” “If the accounts are true, the unidentified crafts could pose a serious security risk to our military personnel and defense apparatus,” he continued. “As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, these reports are concerning from a national airspace and domestic security perspective.” You can read the full letter below. Office of Congressman Mark Walker “As the ranking member of terrorism and counterintelligence [Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism], we have questions,” Walker told Carlson. “It comes down to some of the new infrared radar systems that we’re putting on some of our new jets are detecting some things out there.” “Is this something that’s a defense mechanism from another country? We do know that China is looking at hypersonic missiles ,” Walker continued. “We don’t know if the nuclear warheads can be attached to those, is it something like that or is it something more? We don’t know but I feel like it’s something we must take a look at, and that’s why we’ve written Secretary Spencer of the Navy.” You can watch the full interview below. Walker’s reference to “infrared radar systems” appears to be a conflation of the fact the apparent increase in Navy UAP sightings has coincided with the service’s development and fielding of new radar systems, particularly the AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and plans to give those same aircraft, among others , podded infrared search and track (IRST) sensors in the coming years. The War Zone was the first to explore how these developments have impacted UAP reporting and will continue to do so in the future. The comments regarding China in Walker’s letter are less clear, but it appears that he is referring to advanced aerospace developments that the Chinese have been reportedly pursuing that might help explain at least some UAP sightings. In June 2019, The War Zone was first to report that Dr. James Sheehy, Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of the Naval Aviation Enterprise at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), had cited Chinese work in various related fields in a letter of support for a set of patent applications that Navy researcher Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais had first begun to file in 2016. Pais subsequently obtained those patents, which border on the science fiction, and The War Zone has analyzed them in detail and continues to investigate their origins and validity. Whatever the exact issues or concerns were that prompted Walker to reach out to Secretary Spencer, he says he wants to know how the Navy logs reported sightings and investigates them, as well as what resources the service is dedicating to these tasks. In addition, he wants to know if there is any “physical evidence or otherwise” that backs up any of the existing reports, which could include radar and other sensor data. There have also been claims that U.S. military offices charged with looking into these claims had actual physical remains of UFOs, but there has been nothing conclusive to substantiate them. However, these assertions have persisted, with Luis Elizondo, who has self-described himself as the former head of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat and Identification Program (AATIP) , repeating them again in a separate interview on Tucker Carlson’s show just in May 2019, as seen in the view below. Between 2008 and 2012, AATIP was charged with investigating UAP reports, among other things . Walker also wants to know if the Navy is aware of any “private companies or foreign nations” who might have made revolutionary aerospace developments that would explain the UAP reports. These requests, as well as the letter’s very existence, are notable. That the Congressman from North Carolina does not already have answers to his questions, including the full scope of the Navy’s publicly announced new UAP reporting procedures , strongly suggests that the U.S. government continues to treat these sightings almost exclusively as military and foreign intelligence issues, rather than ones that could impact homeland security. This would certainly fit with what we have learned so far about AATIP, and its predecessor, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications ( AAWSA ) program, which were housed at various times under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. AAWSA, in particular, was under the direction of the DIA’s Defense Warning Office , which exists specifically to monitor for potential advanced technological developments that could threaten U.S. national security. Even so, it would be particularly curious if none of the members of the House’s Homeland Security Committee had received a briefing from the Navy on the subject, given the obvious domestic security implications. If some members of the committee had received such a briefing, but Walker had not, it is hard to imagine he would not have complained about this fact in his letter. The Navy has publicly said that it has provided briefings to multiple legislators with regards to the UAP issue, though it has not provided a full list of lawmakers who have gotten one or offered details about the information therein. Some of these briefings may have included still-classified explanations for at least some of the UAP reports. The War Zone has already reported that the UAP issue had become so pronounced that Navy base commanders on the East Coast of the United States were issuing Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) warning about them simply as potential hazards to safe flight. This would support Walker’s assertion that these are national airspace and domestic security issues as much as they are military and foreign intelligence ones. With his letter to Secretary of the Navy Spencer now a matter of public record, it will be interesting to see if Walker shares any information he gets in response and whether his open prodding has an impact on how the service, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, together with the U.S. Intelligence Community, treats UAP sightings going forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 9, 2019",Jetpack Inventor Goes Zipping Between Royal Navy Boats In Open Water Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what looked like a scene straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, the Royal Navy recently teamed up with Gravity Industries’ founder Richard Browning to help his test his Daedalus jetpack over open water for the first time. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has been working with Browning and Gravity Industries for more than a year now amid something of a broader revival of interest among major military forces, including the U.S. special operations forces community, in jetpacks and similar personal flying systems, something The War Zone has explored in the past . Earlier in July 2019, the P2000 Archer class patrol boat HMS Dasher , along with two rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB), carried Browning and other members of his team into the Solent , a strait that separates the Isle of Wight in the English Channel from mainland England. The Gravity Industries founder is also a former Royal Marine Reservist and serves as his company’s main test pilot for the Daedalus, which has been in development since 2016. “Richard made taking off and landing on the P2000 look so easy, despite the ship traveling at 20 knots,” Lieutenant Lauren Webber, Dasher ‘s commanding officer, said in an official statement . “P2000s only have a small landing area so it provided a challenge for the test pilot and the Ship’s Company very much enjoyed seeing the ‘rocket man’ in action.” The Archer class boats are less than 70 feet long overall and have a beam less than 20 feet wide. Royal Navy and Gravity Industries personnel fitted a small pad to Dasher ‘s forward deck to serve as a landing and takeoff point. During the tests in the Solent, Browning made a number of short trips between patrol boat and the accompanying RHIBs, successfully demonstrating the jetpacks ability to operate over open water and of a trained individual to land and take off from a moving craft. The Daedalus is a complete suit-type system. The first iteration used six kerosene-powered microturbines for vertical takeoffs and landings, as well as level flight. Two of these turbines were situated together with the main fuel tanks, an assembly that the user wears like a backpack. The flier then has two more turbines in mounts on each forearm for lateral control. Improvements to the design have led to the replacement of the two backpack-mounted turbines with a single larger jet engine, which has helped increase the system’s maximum speed from 30 to 50 miles per hour. Richard Browning, wearing his Daedalus jetpack, onboard HMS Dasher in the Solent earlier in July 2019., Crown Copyright The system is heavily automated and feeds information about fuel and engine status to a helmet-mounted heads-up display. A wi-fi link allows a ground station to also keep an eye on things. The Royal Navy and other U.K. Ministry of Defense officials have suggested that Daedalus-equipped Royal Marines could help support at-sea boarding operations, such as the United Kingdom’s recent seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 , or amphibious assaults. Since 2018, Browning and other Gravity Industries personnel have worked with the Royal Marines, in particular, to demonstrate the system’s capabilities in a variety of different littoral environments. https://youtube.com/watch?v=btzJ3bThdQo In January 2019, Browning brought one of the jetpacks to the Royal Marines’ Commando Training Center and easily traversed its obstacle course . Four months later, other Gravity Industries pilots went to the Royal Marines’ Tamar base and showed off the Daedalus by making short flights from a Landing Craft Utility Mk. 10 in Devonport Dockyard to shore. Gravity Industries personnel depart a Landing Craft Utility Mk. 10 during a demonstration at Devonport Dockyard in May 2019., Crown Copyright “A ship you need to regain control of? You can have 10 people in different places all at once and the first thing they’ll know is when they hear a faint jet noise,” a representative of Gravity said after a demonstration for then-U.K. Secretary of State for Defense Gavin Williamson in April 2019. “Yes, you are really able to do a much more discrete insertion… it’s fantastic,” Williamson had added at the time . “Maybe if I can have a go in future there could be a bigger order.” There are various other potential uses for the jetpacks, as well. For instance, personnel might be able to quickly move medics or other critical personnel between Royal Navy ships, or to render aid to vessels at sea, if necessary. Royal Marines could similarly use them to reposition themselves quickly on land. Depending on how easy the system is to use, it might be possible to airdrop them to personnel below, such as downed pilots, so that they could fly themselves to safety, a general concept that is gaining traction within the U.S. military. Richard Browing flies past HMS Dasher in the Solent., Crown Copyright So far, the United Kingdom has not actually purchased any Daedalus suits and it is unclear how much the U.K. Ministry of Defense has spent so far to assist Browning with its development. But U.K. officials are hardly the only ones interested in jetpacks like the one that Gravity Industries is working on. In 2018, U.S. Special Operations Command conducted an evaluation of an Individual Aerial Mobility System (IAMS), a militarized derivative of Z-Air’s Flyboard Air , which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . Unlike Daedalus, the Flyboard Air is a jet-powered platform, rather than a suit. Z-Air’s French founder Franky Zapata also demonstrated his Flyboard Air as part of the annual Bastille Day military parade in Paris on July 14, 2019, suggesting the French military might also have an interest in a similar capability. Flyboard Air has a stated top speed of just over 90 miles per hour and a maximum ceiling of around 10,000 feet. Questions remain about whether or not Daedalus or Flyboard Air will be able to succeed where decades of similar developments have failed. In the 1960s, the U.S. Army, especially, working with major defense contractors, spent considerable time and resources , on a variety of jetpacks, rocket belts, and flying platforms. None of these systems entered operational use, primarily due to their limited range and low speed, not to mention reliability and safety. Daedalus and Flyboard Air are worlds more advanced than these systems and offer considerable improvements in performance, but remain hampered by overall flight time limitations. Videos below show just some of the systems the Army tested in the 1960s. Daedalus can reportedly only carry enough fuel to keep its engines running for around 10 minutes, depending on how fast it is going and how heavy the user and their other equipment is. Flyboard Air can similarly carry a combined weight of approximately 280 pounds for around 12 minutes while flying at a speed of around 80 miles per hour. It is questionable, at best, whether this would allow ship-to-shore operations in a traditional amphibious assault, especially as amphibious ships find themselves forced to stage further away from the landing area due to ever-improving shore-based defenses . Even in a boarding situation, it could be precarious, especially depending on how long it might take for an operator to find a safe place to land. Daedalus, in its present form, offers no additional protection for the user against incoming fire, either. Both Daedalus and Flybaoard Air can also reportedly operate at altitudes up to 10,000 feet, but it’s unlikely that it either have enough fuel to get to that height from sea level. That being said, this does mean that they would still work at higher altitudes, such as on mountains, where it could be a useful tool for rapidly ascending and descending. Beyond all this, despite Williamson’s assertions, Daedalus, at least in its present configuration, is simply not quiet enough to be discrete and would not be useful for covert insertions or similar operations, according to the Royal Marines’ own assessments. “Imagine what we could do with these suits on the battlefield – although Royal Marines pride themselves on being stealthy and one thing the jet pack isn’t is quiet,” Royal Marines Captain Oliver Mason said after the demonstration in January 2019. There’s also a cost factor. As of April 2019, each Daedalus suit costs some 340,000 pounds , a little more than $413,000 at the rate of exchange at the time of writing. The price of even equipping small units or providing a small number of suits on certain ships for boarding operations or other similar activities could quickly add up. So, it’s certainly true that Gravity Industries’ Daedalus, along with other developments, such as Z-Air’s Flyboard Air, are pushing the technology closer than ever to being a practical military tool. But it also remains to be seen whether personal flying devices have finally come of age or if they will continue to remain novelties better suited to airshows and action movies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2019",Putin Says Whoever Has the Best Artificial Intelligence Will Rule the World,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For some time now there has been a steadily growing debate over the potential benefits and hazards of artificial intelligence, or AI, drawing opinions from technology pioneers, futurists, scientists, philosophers, and most recently Russian President Vladimir Putin. Especially when it comes to the military, the core issues have become almost as much existential as technical, with some suggesting that a future with “killer robots” could be one without humans. Putin brought up the topic during an open lesson on science and technology with school children on Knowledge Day, Sept. 1, 2017. The Russian leader also discussed space, medicine, and the potential of the human brain, according to Russian media outlet RT . “Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,” He explained. “It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” Putin’s comments followed a spat over the broad issues surrounding AI between Elon Musk, best known as the founder of high performance electric car company Tesla and space launch firm SpaceX, and Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of social media powerhouse Facebook. Musk is a critic, perhaps even an alarmist, about the potential dangers of autonomous machines, while Zuckerberg, who is investing heavily in self-driving cars among other things views the technology with great optimism. Putin shares the stage with a number of teenagers while giving his “open lesson” on Knowledge Day on Sept. 1, 2017., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP Musk has been an increasingly vocal opponent of AI since at least 2014, when he was an investor in DeepMind, a startup working on the technology that Google eventually purchased. In July 2017, in a talk at the summer meeting of the National Governors Association, Musk raised his fears again , warning about an eventual machine takeover straight out of a Hollywood movie. “I have exposure to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it,” he said, likely referencing, at least in part, his interactions with DeepMind. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal.” Elon Musk., AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu Later in July, a Facebook user asked Zuckerberg about his opinions of Musk’s perspective during a live question and answer session on the social media platform from his home in Palo Alto, California. He was blunt in his dismissal of any concerns about AI. “I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic,” Zuckerberg said . “And I think people [like Musk] who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios – I just, I don’t understand it. It’s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.” Mark Zuckerberg., AP Photo/Steven Senne Musk then took to Twitter, saying he and Zuckerberg had spoken about AI in the past that “his understanding of the subject is limited.” The Tesla and SpaceX CEO added that there was a “movie on the subject coming soon…,” but declined to give a title or say whether he was involved in its production. Now, neither Musk or Zuckerberg – or Putin for that matter – were specifically talking about the military applications of AI. However, the two viewpoints very well encapsulate the multi-sided discussion about the future of the technology on the battlefield. On the one hand, there is a series of largely technical questions. How does one go about inserting a machine capable of autonomous decision making into the process? What tasks can it handle? How responsive and accurate is it? What vulnerabilities does it expose? From his public statements, this seems to be the realm Zuckerberg is most concerned with and he sees those problems as surmountable. If the issue is a concern about driverless cars making a bad decision and killing pedestrians or their occupants, then the answer is to find a way to fix that problem. “One of the top causes of death for people is car accidents still and if you can eliminate that with AI, that is going to be just a dramatic improvement,” Zuckerberg had said during his online Q&A. “Whenever I hear people saying AI is going to hurt people in the future, I think yeah, you know, technology can generally always be used for good and bad, and you need to be careful about how you build it and you need to be careful about what you build and how it is going to be used,” he added later on. This seems to be how many in the U.S. military view the topic, as John Launchbury, the director of the  Information Innovation Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency explains in depth in the video above. For the Pentagon and the individual services, AI is just another tool that helps reduce the workload for its personnel and may help speed up and simplify a host of processes, from administrative and logistics matters to surveillance and targeting during actual combat operations, making everything more efficient and reducing costs. Perhaps most importantly, fewer humans on the battlefield inherently means less casualties, which has long been an argument in favor of increasing the use of drones in the air, on land, and at sea. The U.S. military as a whole has been increasingly interested in autonomous weapons and high-end AI – which don’t necessarily have to go hand-in-hand – as part of the so-called Third Offset Strategy , which seeks advanced technological solutions to keep American forces ahead of their opponents, even as their overall numbers shrink. We’ve already seen early iterations of the technology help alert maintenance personnel of potential problems, automate the management of supply inventories, and analyze data . They can even run autonomous or semi-autonomous drones , weapons , and sensors , which can spot, track, and engage targets without continuous human interaction. In August 2017, the U.S. Air Force, as part of a joint project with U.S. Special Operations Command, asked for information on AI systems that could allow aircraft crews flying a notional light attack plane to find their targets faster by filtering out bad or conflicting information. The request for proposals said the service would be willing to consider equipment that then made autonomous decisions about whether or not to launch a bomb or missile or one that simply gave a recommendation to the human operator. Earlier in September 2017, the U.S. Army hired computer giant IBM to help manage various logistics inventories, including seeing what its intelligent cloud computing system Watson might have to offer. The year before, the service had installed sensors on 350 Stryker armored vehicles that all fed data into Watson , which in turn sifted through the information to try and predict maintenance issues before they even occurred. This allowed units to speed up the maintenance process by sending entire batches of vehicles off to receive the same preventive repairs at once instead of reacting to the problems as they came up or based on maintenance schedules specific to  individual vehicles. Putin seems to have a similar view of AI as it applies to the military realm, previously calling for increased development of autonomous weapons. There have been similar pushes in China , Israel , and South Korea , among others countries. There are “colossal opportunities and threats that are difficult to predict now,” Putin said on Knowledge Day, promising to share AI developments with other countries. However, he posited that future wars would be almost entirely the realm of unmanned aircraft, vehicles, and ships, adding that “when one party’s drones are destroyed by drones of another, it will have no other choice but to surrender.” The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway had come to a similar conclusion, specifically about unmanned aerial combat vehicles, in June 2016, writing : The fact is that if we don’t aggressively field this technology our potential enemies, who give far less consideration when it comes to the morality of robotic warfare, will. In fact, Russia and China both have ongoing UCAV programs, and although they remain in a fairly immature state and their sub-systems and low-observable designs are likely quite far behind American capabilities, they will steadily improve. Additionally, quantity is a quality all its own when it comes to UCAV swarms. Just because a foe can’t build the best UCAV imaginable doesn’t mean a large force of inferior types is not a potentially very deadly threat to say the least. Right now, by all indicators the US is leading in the unmanned aircraft department and especially in the low observable (stealth) one. Yet European consortiums have begun to let the UCAV genie out of the battle, with the highly promising BAE Taranis and the Dassault-led nEURon program rapidly evolving, the US has a grand but limited window of opportunity to pull away fully from the pack when it comes to this technology. And this won’t happen keeping the technology buried in the black world or not pursuing it really at all. Of course, increasing the networked nature of weapon systems and inserting technology into more aspects of day-to-day operations isn’t without potential dangers. The AI that troops come to rely on could fail itself or be the victim of an actual enemy strike, including a cyber attack . We at The War Zone have highlighted the increasing importance of cyber security in general and specifically with regards to the Automated Logistics Information System that goes along with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which you can read about in detail here . Needless to say, as AI become more advanced a prevalent, these issues will only grow in significance. A hostile force may no longer be primarily concerned with physically destroying weapons and equipment, but in breaking into them in order to sow confusion and misinformation or even turn them against their operators. It’s that latter point that seems to be of greatest concern to Musk and others, who warn that the idea of autonomous systems, including weapons, “evolving” so to speak to a point that they begin operating independent of any human controls is no longer limited to the realm of science fiction , the most popular comparison being to James Cameron’s iconic robotic apocalypse movie Terminator . In July 2017, there were a run of sensational reports suggesting that just such a thing had happened to Facebook’s AI researchers. The real story was that the company’s engineers had crafted two AI “chatbots” and pitted them against each other to test how well their code worked at negotiations. What they found was that in the absence of any rules regarding their language, the two pieces of software quickly began “ speaking ” to each other in a syntax that clearly appeared simpler for both to understand, which is not necessarily uncommon . The problem was that it was unintelligible to the researchers and therefore of no value, since they couldn’t analyze the data. They refined the code to make sure the two bots communicated in regular English. But the speed with which the computerized personalities devised their own communication mechanism is still no doubt worrisome to individuals like Musk. The basic argument put forward by these critics is that if something as simple as a piece of software churning out text can effectively cut out the operator, why couldn’t an autonomous armed drone do the same thing? “I think they’re [AIs] really improving at an accelerating rate, far faster than people realize,” Musk told Vanity Fair in April 2017. “Mostly because in everyday life you don’t see robots walking around. Maybe your Roomba or something. But Roombas aren’t going to take over the world.” So, it’s no surprise that the Tesla and SpaceX founder has joined a group of other technologists and academics to call for a global ban on “lethal autonomous weapons systems,” or LAWS, more commonly dubbed “killer robots.” In 2015, another collective , including physicist Stephen Hawking and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, made a similar appeal. For many of these activists, the matter is an existential question. For other international organizations and advocacy groups, it is more of an ethical concern. In these instances, the concern is more that weapon systems making their own judgment calls on the battlefield threaten the very notion of a state’s monopoly on the use of force by effectively delegating life-or-death decisions to an algorithm. It also raises complex questions about national sovereignty and the duty of national militaries to protect civilian life on the battlefield. Since 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Council has been exploring the issue, specifically with relation to concerns about the use of drones to conduct extrajudicial target killings. In April of that year, Christof Heyns, a lawyer who then held the title of the Council’s Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, issued a report calling for a worldwide moratorium on the development or fielding of killer robots until the international community could craft a workable legal framework for them to operate within. Christof Heyns., AP Photo/Keystone, Salvatore Di Nolfi “They raise far-reaching concerns about the protection of life during war and peace,” he wrote. “This includes the question of the extent to which they can be programmed to comply with the requirements of international humanitarian law and the standards protecting life under international human rights law. Beyond this, their deployment may be unacceptable because no adequate system of legal accountability can be devised, and because robots should not have the power of life and death over human beings.” At the same time, the signatories to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons have been exploring whether or not to add a new protocol to the treaty covering LAWS. The conventional already includes restrictions on the use of land mines and booby traps, incendiary weapons, blinding lasers, and other conventional arms in warfare. As far as the U.S. military is concerned, these are non-issues. In 2012, the Office of the Secretary of Defense issued an official policy directive about “autonomy in weapon systems.” Representatives of the signatories to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons hold a conference in 2013., Kyodo via AP Images “Autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems shall be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force,” it explains in no uncertain terms. On top of that, anyone employing one of the systems has to do so in accordance with international laws and the established rules of engagement, and every system should have failsafes to prevent the weapons from going rogue if they lose contact with their human overseers. As AI becomes more commonplace throughout society, it will no doubt prompt more debate and additional calls for international regulations or bans on killer robots, especially since it’s simply a truism that no system is ever 100 percent reliable. Protective measures are only as good as the engineers who build them and history is replete with examples of safety mechanisms on automated military hardware failing at the worst times . For Zuckerberg and other supporters of an AI-driven future, these are just problems needing solving. For Musk and his colleagues, this margin of error is fine for robot vacuum cleaners, but a nightmare that could end mankind when it comes to autonomous weapons. Putin seems to think that it could give someone the ability to dominate the future of technology, if not more. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Unmanned"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of copying U.S.-made aircraft and other weapons that the country received during the previous regime of American ally Mohammad Reza Shah, or transforming them into newish designs , before boasting about them as entirely domestic creations. Now the Iranians have added an early Cold War-era Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star jet trainer-turned-drone to the mix. On Jan. 30, 2019, Iranian Air Force unveiled the Khodkar , or “automatic,” at an exhibition in Tehran to mark the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979. Authorities in Iran have set up various physical displays and other imagery throughout the capital to tout the country’s military capabilities and technical achievements over the past four decades. It’s an obvious and often laughable exercise in propaganda meant to underscore the regime’s claims that it has and continues to successfully defy its critics, especially the United States and its allies, in the face of years of sanctions and embargoes. We’ve already seen one absurd example of these claims in a new mural that, in part, depicts Iranian engineers working on the American Space Shuttle , when the country’s own nascent space program has been racking up failed launches . Iran’s boasts about Khodkar are significantly less extreme, but the design is still hardly the technical marvel Iranian state-run media would like to depict it as. The Khodkar drone., PressTV A close of up Khodkar’s nose, including access to the “avoinics bay,” labeled in English., PressTV By their own admission, the “domestically-built wide-body drone” is a modified T-33 , which is certainly not a wide-body aircraft by any realistic description. The Shooting Star first flew in 1948 and was derived from the F-80 Shooting Star , which made its own first flight before the end of World War II. The last T-33s rolled off the production line in 1959. Under the Shah, between 1955 and 1964, Iran acquired around 32 T-33s, which were already on the second-hand market at point, according to data that the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has compiled . A T-33 belonging to the Shah’s Imperial Iranian Air Force circa 1955., Public Domain The most significant change between Khodkar and the original T-33 design is the reported substitution of the plane’s original Allison J33 turbojet with the General Electric J85 jet engine, according to state-run PressTV . First produced in the 1950s, J85s powered Northrop’s F-5 , which the Iranians also acquired in significant numbers, and it is likely that the drone’s engine came from one of those jets. We know at least some of those aircraft are still operational in Iran, since, in August 2018, the country also unveiled a “new” fighter jet, called the Kowsar , which was nothing more than a refurbished two-seat F-5F. Beyond its new engine, the Iranians say Khodkar has the ability to fly routes using data from either the American GPS or Russian GLONASS satellite navigation networks, PressTV also reported. It has two cameras, one optimized for use when crews launch and recover the drone, and other that provides a surrogate “cockpit” view in flight. It’s impossible to determine from the pictures alone whether the drone has a true fly-by-wire capability as a placard next to it at the exhibition claims, but that is highly unlikely. The Iranians claim that Khodkar could take on surveillance or strike missions in the future, but there is no evidence that the present example, which may be the only one in existence, even has provisions for added sensors or weapons. The bright orange paint job gives it an appearance more in line with an aerial target for training fighter pilots and air defense personnel. This would actually be in line with what the U.S. Navy did with many of its T-33s, turning them into QT-33 drone targets. The U.S. military also similarly converted a number of earlier F-80s into QF-80s. An AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile destroys a QT-33 drone during a test over a range at the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in 1975., USN All this being said, it is important to note that Iran’s defense industrial base has proven it can produce workable weapon systems, though often with limited capabilities, converted or derived from American and other foreign-made designs that can still pose a potential threat to its opponents. After a U.S. Air Force RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone came down in Iran in 2011, the Iranians produced a flyable drone with a similar shape that they have used operationally on at least one occasion . More recently, they revealed a modified AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile converted that they reportedly converted into an anti-tank weapon. Iranian copies of the American TOW anti-tank guided missile and surface-to-air missiles derived from U.S.-supplied RIM-66 Standards and MIM-23 HAWKs are also good examples. The experience Iran gains from working on these existing systems can only help it down the road, as well. But Khodkar, based on an aircraft design that is now more than seven decades old, doesn’t look like it will be Iran’s next great defense success story.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2019",Here’s Everything We Know About The Ongoing Search For Japan’s Crashed F-35 (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has been four days since the crash of a Japan Air Self Defense Force F-35A. Here’s what we have to report, but before you start reading the update, make sure you read our original post linked here to get caught up. Details regarding the crash remain scarce. Keep in mind that data surrounding tracking F-35s and the information its data-links send and receive are sensitive in nature, especially the data captured by its proprietary low-probability of intercept (LPI) Multi-functional Advanced Data Link (MADL) system which connects F-35s together within line-of-sight. The jet also has satellite and Link 16 connectivity, but they are not stealthy like MADL. In addition, it’s worth keeping in mind that these aircraft do not carry Aircraft Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods for training, so internal networked systems provide this function. All this info, as well as possible radar data, could potentially be used, as well as accounts from the three other pilots on the training flight, to recreate exactly what happened and where it happened of that unfortunate evening. All this data takes time to process and correlate, so it isn’t surprising we haven’t heard more just yet. What we do know is that the missing pilot, 41-year-old JASDF Major Akinori Hosomi, was highly experienced with over 3,200 hours of flight time, but he only had 60 hours in the F-35. During the doomed flight, the last thing anyone heard from Hosomi was a radio call to stop training. The aircraft was not operating at low altitude when it crashed at 7:29pm local time roughly 84 miles off of Northeastern Honshu Island, Japan. A JASDF F-35A taking off., JASDF Facebook Page The F-35A that crashed was the first aircraft Mitsubishi assembled locally. It had two known inflight emergencies during its short career—one early on during testing having to do with a cooling system issue and another due to some sort of faulty ‘position indicator.’ Both problems were remediated by swapping out parts and neither event seems particularly strange and inflight emergencies are far from rare when it comes to complex fighter aircraft. Even the status of the search operation is not exactly clear. The hunt for Major Hosomi certainly continues, but it isn’t known if the F-35’s location on the seafloor—roughly 5,000 down—has been pinpointed. Early on, an armada of ships blitzed into the area, including the American destroyer USS Stethem (DDG 63) and numerous Japanese government vessels, although that crowd has thinned substantially since then, according to vessel trackers. Japanese media outlet NHK reported the following about new naval assets being brought to bear in the hunt for the F-35: “Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters on Friday that aircraft and ships from the Self-Defense Forces, the Coast Guard and the US military are continuing their search. He also said a submarine rescue ship of the Maritime Self-Defense Force began an undersea search on Friday morning.” Air assets have also been highly present overhead the general area where the aircraft disappeared, with U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidons flying search grids along with JASDF aircraft. A U-2 Dragon Lady has also joined the search and is currently working the area. The aircraft’s powerful sensors have a robust secondary maritime surveillance capability.  So far, just some pieces of the aircraft have been found, which still represents a huge technological and intellectual property risk in itself. In fact, floating debris may be the biggest security risk at this time. As for the chances that a foreign power, such as Russia or China, could scour the area for floating wreckage or even send their own submersibles down to try to manipulate and remove parts of the F-35 wreckage, this clearly is a concern. But Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya noted that Japanese forces are closely monitoring the area around the clock and that there has not been any unusual activity detected, at least so far. Recovering the jet 5,000 feet down will be no easy task and that can’t occur until the F-35 carcass has been found. It is unclear exactly how the aircraft’s black box works—it is unlikely to ping by default. But it is possible that the F-35 has already been located and the Ministry Of Defense has not disclosed this information for security purposes. Reuters writes: “The military may have to hire marine salvage firms with submersible craft able to recover wreckage from deep water. The candidates include Japan’s two biggest marine salvage firms. Fukuda Salvage and Marine Works got its start a century ago recovering damaged warships during the Russo-Japanese war, while Nippon Salvage shares its corporate roots with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the company that assembled the lost F-35. “The time needed to complete salvage operations depends on a lot of factors and … it’s impossible to say how long it would take to recover the F-35,” a Fukuda Salvage official said, adding it would take more than a few days. The condition of the single-engine fighter, part of a 12 plane squadron that just became operational, will probably be the biggest factor in planning a salvage operation, an engineer at Nippon Salvage told Reuters. “Intact it could be pulled up by a crane, but if it’s broken up then submersibles would have to collect the fragments,” he said. “The question is whether you want to collect all the pieces.” Before that can start, however, Japan’s defense force has to find the wreckage of the highly-classified piece of U.S. military equipment.” It’s also worth noting that the depth of the ocean where the F-35 supposedly crashed precludes the possibility that a traditional combat submarine could reach and manipulate the wreckage, but it doesn’t mean that specialized ones outfitted with deeper-diving remotely operated vehicles couldn’t. Uniquely adapted nuclear submarines exist for these types of espionage missions in both the Russian and U.S. Navy fleets. In particular, the highly capable USS Jimmy Carter may be called upon to assist in the search and recovery efforts. Japan has grounded its small F-35 fleet until further notice, but the country has remained committed to its plan to buy 147 of the stealth jets, which includes a mix of standard takeoff A models and short-takeoff and vertical landing B models. This is the second flying loss of an F-35, with the first being an F-35B that crashed near MCAS Beaufort in September of 2018. It could end up being the first mishap with an F-35 that resulted in a fatality. We will continue to update you as more information comes available. UPDATE: 3:20pm PDT— Japan’s submarine rescue vessel Chiyoda (ASR-404) was just commissioned a year ago and it totes a brand new deep-sea rescue vehicle built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Chiyoda (ASR-404)., HUNINI/Wikicommons It remains unclear what the exact depth performance of the new rescue vehicle is, but other foreign types have maximum depth ratings up to roughly 5,000 feet—far beyond the crush depths of most combat submarines and about the same depth as where the F-35 is supposedly resting. Still, these ships usually can deploy various unmanned submersibles that dive far deeper and would be crucial for identifying, inspecting, and salvaging the lost F-35A.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We had been tracking the progress of Tom Reilly’s XP-82 Twin Mustang project as it finally approached and executed its first flight . Now, after over a decade of work, the Twin Mustang has finally roared through the skies over the Experimental Aircraft Association’s Airventure Air Show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Although the modern military participants are usually a big hit as they rocket through the air with afterburners alight , the one-of-a-kind and ridiculously ambitious Twin Mustang project is what EAA is really all about. Once again, our friends over at Airshowstuff.com knew exactly how to best cover the Twin Mustang’s participation at Oshkosh, just as they have done in the past with other aircraft of major historical significance—they put the viewer right in the cockpit. In this case, it is in the right-side cockpit of the XP-82, the one without the pilot in it. This also provides us with a clear view of the stick inputs throughout the aircraft’s flight and an awesome, but a little bit bizarre perspective on the XP-82’s other Packard Merlin V12 churning away. It almost looks like another P-51 is in extremely tight formation, but that’s just a very real reminder of the crazy design configuration of the Twin Mustang. In addition, the Airshowstuff.com team also shot the aircraft flying from the ground. The sound alone in both videos is worth the time you take watching them. Also, keep in mind that the cockpit XP-82 video itself is unlike any other in existence. It had been decades since a Twin Mustang flew, long before the GoPro revolution began. In other words, this is a truly groundbreaking warbird video. In total, it took 207,000 hours of labor to get the 70-year-old XP-82 into an airworthy condition. It is so exciting to see it actually flying. People like Tom Reilly who dedicate ridiculous amounts of time and money to keeping our flying heritage alive have our greatest respect and admiration. They make things that seem impossible, possible. Truly amazing. There’s only one thing better than a Mustang… A Twin Mustang! Well, then again, maybe a P-61 Black Widow!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 12, 2019",The U.S. Army May Cut Nearly Half Of Its Already Underappreciated Naval Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has confirmed that it is reassessing the size and composition of its often forgotten fleet of logistics ships , landing craft , and other watercraft as part of its over-arching modernization plans . At least one possible course of action the service is considering appears to involve doing away entirely with all of these craft in the Army Reserve and National Guard, which amount to almost half all of all these assets within the Army as a whole. This would eliminate a significant portion the Army maritime capability at a time when it is only becoming more important, especially with regards to potential combat operations in the Pacific region . gCaptain was first to report on the existence of the review of the Army Watercraft Systems program on Jan. 14, 2019, after obtaining a memo titled “Army Watercraft Transformation Through Divestment of Capability and Force Structure by Inactivation of Units.” While most people wouldn’t think of the Army having a Navy of its own, they do. The largest of these vessels are eight Logistics Support Vessels , also known as the General Frank S. Besson -class which we at The War Zone have profiled in depth the past. As of November 2018, the service also had 34 Landing Craft Utility 2000s (LCU-2000) and 36 Landing Craft Mechanized Mk 8s (LCM-8), along with a variety of tugs, small ferries, and unpowered barges. “The Army is assessing its watercraft program to improve readiness, modernize the force and reallocate resources. This is an ongoing formal analysis between OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense], the Joint Staff, Army Headquarters and the combatant commands,” Cheryle Rivas, an Army spokesperson, told The War Zone by Email. “This will be a long-term process as we review all aspects of Army watercraft employment. The Army watercraft force that emerges will be more ready and capable of meeting the National Defense Strategy and combatant commander requirements.” Though obscure, the Army’s organic fleets allow the service to avoid necessarily having to rely on the U.S. Navy or contracted ships to move personnel and materiel by sea. It also means the service doesn’t have to add to the existing burden on the Navy’s amphibious ships and landing craft, which are often stretched thin , to begin with. An overview of all of the Army Watercraft Systems as of November 2018. “AC” refers to the “Active Component,” or regular Army units, while “RC” refers to the “Reserve Component,” which includes Army Reserve and National Guard Units. APS are Army Prepositioned Stocks , caches of stored vehicles, other equipment, and supplies in strategic locations in case of contingencies., US Army The Army’s watercraft can help unload cargo from commercial ships in permissive and non-combat environments, as well, which could ease logistical requirements during distributed and expeditionary operations. These same capabilities have proven valuable during humanitarian relief operations after natural disasters at home and abroad. It is for these exact reasons that the Army has watercraft units spread across 10 locations on the East and West coasts of the contiguous United States, as well as in Hawaii. Army mariners also run operations from facilities in Kuwait and Japan and can deploy worldwide, as required. A map showing the locations of Army watercraft units and assets as of November 2018. The “zones” refer to how the service breaks up purchases of contract maintenance support for these elements at home and abroad., US Army But the memo that gCaptain obtained reportedly included plans to sell off or otherwise divest up to 18 LCU-2000s and shutter eight Reserve and National Guard watercraft units over an unspecified timeframe. The Army’s end goal was to “eliminate all United States Army Reserve and National Guard Bureau AWS [Army Watercraft Systems] capabilities and/or supporting structure,” according to the document. Rivas would not confirm or deny the specific details that gCaptain has previously reported or say whether they were just one of many proposed courses of action. We do not know what units specifically might be on the chopping block. A pair of Army LCU-2000s during an exercise in California in 2015., US Army Eliminating all watercraft capabilities in Reserve and National Guard units would automatically require moving three LSVs, seven LCU-2000s, nine LCM-8s, eight tugs, and two floating crane barges into so-called “Active Component” units or risking losing those capabilities altogether. This is around a third of the LSVs and roughly half of the landing craft the Army has in total outside of prepositioned stockpiles of equipment around the world. The loss of the three LSVs would be especially pronounced. These ships displace 4,200 tons and have loading ramps fore and aft for the rapid loading and unloading of tanks and other armored vehicles, as well as trucks carrying personnel and cargo. They can also accommodate oversized cargo. Works load a Boeing C-17A Globemaster III’s fuselage onto an Army General Frank S. Besson -class Logistics Support Vessel., DOD Capability-wise, these ships sit between large amphibious assault ships and smaller landing craft, an intermediate tier of vessels the Navy no longer has itself . LSVs have also proven they can perform in a multi-mission role, acting an intermediary platform to get materiel from amphibious ships to shore and in less traditional roles, including as submarine tenders during exercises. It would not be hard to configure them as small, impromptu sea bases, as well. You can read more about these ships here . An Army General Frank S. Besson -class Logistics Support Vessel acts as a tender for a foreign submarine during an exercise. , DOD Beyond potentially losing these kinds of capabilities with any cuts, the Army could find it difficult to retain the personnel assigned to the watercraft units. These individuals have training in the relatively specialized role of Army mariners and may require significant retraining before going elsewhere. On top of that, if the Army is considering selling off or otherwise divesting as many as 18 LCU-2000s, this calls into question whether or not the service plans to limit its watercraft cuts to Reserve and National Guards units. The Army only has 14 of these craft outside of prepositioned stocks and another 20 inside those stockpiles. This could mean shutting down all of those units or eliminating the extra ones it has on hand in case of a contingency. The Army is planning to acquire 36 new landing craft, known as Maneuver Support Vessels (Light) , or MSV(L)s, in the coming years, but these are supposed to replace the aging LCM-8s. An artist’s conception of a pair of future Army Maneuver Support Vessels (Light)., US Army It is possible that the memo gCaptain obtained mistakenly referred to the LCU-2000s, when it meant the LCM-8s. There are 18 of these Vietnam War-era landing craft across active Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard Units, along with another 18 in preposition stocks. However, if this is the case, the Army could still find itself in a capability gap depending on when it wants to divest any of these landing craft. The construction of the first four MSV(L)s isn’t supposed to start until 2021 . It’s not entirely clear what might be driving any decision to cut the Army’s watercraft fleets, either. We at The War Zone have noted in the past that the service’s maritime capabilities have only become more valuable in recent years, which one might have expected to cause growth rather than contraction in those units and their assets. The last major change in the service’s maritime capabilities came in 2011, when the Navy took full ownership of all of what were then known as Joint High Speed Vessels (JHSV). The Spearhead -class of what are now called Expeditionary Fast Transports , abbreviated EPF, continue to provide important, multi-purpose intra-theater maritime capability for the U.S. military around the world. You can read more about these catamaran vessels here . The Navy’s Expeditionary Fast Transport USNS Spearhead . This ship was originally destined for the US Army., USN As Army spokesperson Rivas noted in her statement, the service does have to balance its watercraft requirements against a host of modernization priorities, including new armored vehicles , artillery systems , air defenses , and much more . The U.S. military’s overall effort to re-focus on preparations for “great power competition” against countries such as Russia and China have prompted all of the services to work to revitalize various conventional military capabilities after decades of low-intensity conflicts. This shift in attitude has reportedly already led current Secretary of the Army Mark Esper to question the value of various elements of his service that no longer seem to be in line with these priorities. Most notably, he has advocated for doing away with the Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute ( PKSOI ) within the Army War College, ostensibly to free up funds for other programs. Advocates have pointed out the wide-ranging benefits PKSOI provides, including its interagency connections and knowledgebase , at extremely low cost. Secretary of the Army Mark Esper., US Army The services watercraft may have attracted similar budget-conscious scrutiny, which could become even more pronounced depending if President Donald Trump’s Administration asks for or receives a smaller defense budget in the next fiscal year than it has in the recent past. But, while they may not be ideally suited for “tip of the spear” operations in a high-end conflict , their capabilities could still be invaluable in more permissive areas during distributed operations. These craft could help free up more capable amphibious ships for more demanding missions. In the Pacific region, especially, where the “ tyranny of distance ” means that units may be spread across a wide area and positions thousands of miles from established logistics hubs, having additional intermediate maritime transport capacity could be vital to sustained operations. The Army’s fleets already give the Navy more flexibility in how it deploys its own amphibious capabilities. Eliminating the Army Reserve and National Guard capabilities would deprive them of unique assets to assist in non-combat missions, including disaster relief at home, as well. The Puerto Rico Army National Guard’s LCM-8s helped move personnel, equipment, and supplies in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 , the latter of which absolutely devastated the island and made overland travel difficult, if not impossible in many cases. A Puerto Rico Army National Guard LCM-8 during operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria., US Army “The Army is assessing the program,” is all the service’s spokesperson Rivas could tell us when we followed up for additional details. “This is an on-going formal analysis and a long-term process.” We will be keeping a close eye out for any future information about how the Army’s plans to cut or otherwise transform its understated, but important maritime capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 29, 2019",Israel Tests Arrow 3 Interceptor’s Long Range Performance In First-Ever Alaskan Launches,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has conducted the first-ever tests of its Arrow 3 ballistic missile defense system outside of the country as part of more than a week of launches in Alaska. In announcing this testing had occurred, Israeli officials have also said that there is foreign interest in potential export sales of the system, which has been in development now for more than a decade. The Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO), in cooperation with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), conducted the test campaign earlier in July 2019 at the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska (PSCA) in Kodiak, Alaska. During the 10-day-long testing period, Arrow 3 system fired three interceptors on three separate occasions against mock ballistic missiles, successfully destroying each one, according to IMDO and MDA . Israel had originally hoped to conduct these Alaskan tests in late 2018, but had pushed the schedule back to “improve the system’s readiness,” the Israeli Ministry of Defense said at the time. “Ten challenging years of development have culminated in this moment: the Arrow 3 weapon system completed a test campaign, during which an Arrow 3 interceptor completed full interception of the target,” IMDO Director Moshe Patel said in a statement on July 28, 2019. “This is an extraordinary operational and technological achievement for the State of Israel, made possible by thousands of employees, engineers, and officers from the Ministry of Defense, Israeli defense Industries, Israeli Air Force and our U.S. partners.” Arrow 3 gives Israel the “ability to act against ballistic missiles fired against us from Iran and from any other location,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared during a cabinet meeting , also on July 28, 2019. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Boeing have been developing Arrow 3, the latest member of the Arrow family , together since 2008 with heavy financial and other support from the U.S. government. The main reason why Israel decided to take Arrow 3 to Alaska now was to be able to conduct more representative tests of how the system might respond to threats coming from Iran or other locations at extended ranges. The PSCA and its associated test ranges in the Pacific Ocean are far larger than the spaces Israel has available either over land or in the Meditteranean Sea. Israel has already test earlier Arrow variants on U.S. ranges in the Pacific region for the same general space-related reasons. “Arrow 3 is too big for the state of Israel,” IMDO’s Patel told reporters at a gathering after the announcement of the conclusion of the tests. “It is supposed to be good against nuclear threats that are coming from Iran. We have limitations in our arena to conduct flight tests because of safety.” An Arrow 3 interceptor blasts off from the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska (PSCA) in Kodiak, Alaska during a series of tests in July 2019., MDA/IMDO That being said, IMDO has conducted a number of test launches and mock intercepts in and around the country. The most recent of these came in January 2019 when personnel at Palmachim Air Base in Central Israel had shot down another surrogate ballistic missile. Neither IDMO nor MDA said what type of targets they had used to simulate potential threats during the Arrow 3 tests in Alaska, but MDA’s press release did describe the intercepts themselves as “exo-atmospheric.” This makes sense given that Arrow 3 is the uppermost tier of Israel’s ballistic missile defense shield. Reportedly able to engage any kind of ballistic missile, including high-flying intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) moving at extremely high speeds, the interceptor carries a kinetic kill vehicle outside of the earth’s atmosphere to physically hit it target, destroying it in its mid-course flight phase . Israel has used members of Rafael’s family of Sparrow ballistic missile surrogates , not to be confused with the U.S. Sparrow air-to-air and surface-to-air missile, to simulate hostile ballistic missiles during past tests of Arrow variants. The largest of these, the Silver Sparrow, reportedly emulates the Iranian Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. The United States has also regularly used PSCA to test its own ballistic missile defense systems, including the Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) system. So, it is very possible that the U.S. military might have provided the same types of air-launched ballistic missile surrogates it had used for its own missile defense tests in the past, as well. The video below shows a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo aircraft releasing an air-launched ballistic missile surrogate over the Pacific Ocean during a ballistic missile defense test in 2015. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tZVxIOEpa4o In addition, MDA said it provided an X-band AN/TPY-2 radar to help with target detection and cueing, even though the Arrow 3 system uses Elta’s L-band Green Pine family of active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars for this purpose. This would have also offered a valuable chance to test the interoperability of AN/TYP-2 and the Arrow 3 system. The U.S. military has one of these radars forward-deployed at what is called Site 512 in Israel on top of Mount Har Keren in the Negev Desert. A map showing, among other things, the location of Site 512 in Israel., US Army The U.S. government’s most recent missile defense policy review underscored existing U.S.-Israeli cooperation and plans to expand those efforts. In addition, in March 2019, the United States military had deployed a THAAD battery to Israel for the first time as part of a demonstration of the U.S. military’s ability to rapidly bolster ballistic missile defenses for its own forces, as well as its allies, during crises. The announcement of the Arrow 3 tests also came just days after Iran fired a Shahab-3 at a mock target within its borders, but the timing appears to be entirely coincidental. That launch comes amid simmering tensions in the Middle East, particularly between the regime in Tehran and the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, over a host of issues. This includes Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) seizure of a British tanker , the IRGC’s shootdown of a U.S. Navy Global Hawk drone, and much more , all of which The War Zone has been following closely . Still, the Shahab-3 launch underscores a growing concern about ballistic missile threats, particularly from Iran and its proxies, throughout the region. American partners, notably Saudi Arabia, are in the process of dramatically expanding their ballistic missile defense shields. The Saudis have also reportedly started their own ballistic missile development program , possibly with Chinese assistance, another example of how this technology is only continuing to proliferate in the Middle East , as well as around the world . With this in mind, it’s not necessarily surprising that IMDO’s Patel says there is has been foreign interest in buying Arrow 3. “There is in interest regarding possible exports of the Arrow-3 system overseas,” he told reporters , though he declined to name any countries in particular. As already noted, Israel could see a number of potential customers for Arrow 3 just in its own neighborhood. U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have already seen considerable success in selling lower-tier THAAD and Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, respectively, to countries throughout the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Still, it might remain too politically precarious for Arab countries to purchase an Israeli-made system, even with significant American involvement in the program. However, ballistic missile threats are hardly limited to the Middle East. North Korea’s expanding missile programs , to say nothing of China’s ballistic missile arsenal , could spur interest in Arrow 3 in East Asia from countries such as South Korea or Japan . India, which is a major customer for Israeli-made weapons and other military equipment and is working on its own domestic ballistic missile defense architecture , might be interested in the system, too. It is possible that the two countries could enter into a partnership to develop a local Arrow variant, as well. Some European countries might have an eye toward establishing more robust ballistic missile defenses given Russian developments, too. All this being said, just with Iran’s continued ballistic missile developments, Israel, as well as the United States, have enough incentives to continue further refining and testing Arrow 3. But with the threat of ballistic missiles becoming more omnipresent internationally, there’s a good chance that sales of this ballistic missile defense system, not just testing, will not be limited to within Israel’s borders.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2019",Israel Hits Mock Missile With Arrow 3 Interceptor Days After Iran Fires A Rocket At It From Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel, in cooperation with the United States, has conducted a new test of its Arrow 3 ballistic missile defense system. Though both countries said this was a long-planned event, it is hard not to see it, at least in part, as a signal to Iran, which Israeli authorities blamed for a recent rocket launch at their territory from Syria. The Iranians also failed to put a satellite into orbit earlier in January 2019 , a launch the U.S. and Israeli governments condemned as a cover for the development of long-range ballistic missiles. The Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO), together with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), launched the Arrow 3 from Palmachim Air Base in Central Israel against a mock ballistic missile on Jan. 22, 2019 . The Israeli Air Force (IAF) and the missile defense system’s manufacturer Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) were also involved in the test. “The success of this test presents an important milestone in the operational capabilities of the State of Israel in defending itself against current and future existential threats,” Israel’s Defense said in a statement . “This successful test provides confidence in Israel’s capability to protect itself from existing threats in the region.” U.S. Air Force General Samuel Greaves, the present director of MDA, said in another press release . “We are committed to assisting the government of Israel in upgrading its national missile defense capability against emerging threats.” Arrow 3 represents the uppermost tier of Israel’s layered missile defenses and can reportedly engage any type of ballistic missile, including higher- and faster-flying intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). The interceptor carries a kinetic kill vehicle that is supposed to physically smash into an incoming threat above the earth’s atmosphere, thereby destroying it before it can pose a danger to anyone on the ground. The complete system uses the Green Pine family of active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to spot and track threats. The U.S. military also operates an AN/TPY-2 missile defense radar in Israel and information from that sensor almost certainly feeds into Israel’s own missile defense network. It’s rumored that the United States also feeds relevant information to Israel from other sensors, including the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) early warning satellites. The interceptor builds on the experience of the previous Arrow 2 , which is not capable of exoatmospheric intercepts. Israel has also received significant funding and other assistance from the United States to develop the Arrow series since the 1980s. American firm Boeing has been directly involved with the work on the Arrow 3. Arrow 3 entered operational service in January 2017 and the system shot down a Syrian surface-to-air missile some three months later . The Israelis have continued to refine and test the system since then. A graphic showing the sequence of an Arrow intercepting a target during an earlier test., MDA IMDO and MDA were supposed to fire another Arrow 3 from the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska (PCSA) on Kodiak Island in Alaska in 2018, but that test got postponed in order to “improve the system’s readiness,” according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense . Additional tests in 2016 and 2017 got called off due to technical issues , as well. Missile defense is complicated in general and exoatmospheric intercepts are especially challenging. You can read all about the challenging process in this past piece of ours . So, it’s not surprising that Israel is continuing to refine and improve on Arrow 3 even though it has already entered service. There is also a need to test how the interceptors perform against different types of targets under various parameters using certain combinations of targeting data. But intentional or not, this latest Arrow 3 test certainly takes on an added emphasis given a recent spike in tensions between Israel and Iran , especially over the latter’s forces and their proxies in Syria. Two days before the test launch, Iranian or Iranian-backed forces in Syria fired what Israeli authorities have simply described as a “rocket” into Israel . Whatever it was specifically, this threat didn’t require the use of the Arrow three’s capabilities, though. Israel’s Iron Dome defense system , the lowest tier in its missile defense shield, focused mainly on shooting down artillery rockets and shells, successfully intercepted that threat. Look at what Israeli families skiing in northern Israel saw above them yesterday… #StopIran pic.twitter.com/aRAEHCnKVX — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) January 21, 2019 However, in the past, Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad had threatened to fire his own ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for continued strikes against Iranian and Iranian-supported interests in his country. Israeli forces regularly target Syria’s air defenses while carrying out those operations and have targeted Syrian forces more directly in retaliation for other provocations. The Arrow 3 test also comes amid a spike in charged rhetoric between Israel, along with the United States, and Iran, over the latter’s ballistic missile development programs and possible work on a nuclear weapon. Earlier in January 2019 , Iran fired a Simorgh space launch vehicle in a failed attempt to place a satellite into orbit. U.S. and Israeli authorities, among others, contend these space launches are just a way to skirt U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at halting Iranian long-range missile programs. The U.S. military’s latest Missile Defense Review, which the Pentagon released on Jan. 17, 2019, also highlighted the growing threat from Iran’s missiles , noting that it “has the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East.” It also claimed that the Iranians continue to pursue ICBMs, including through work on their nascent space program, that could be capable of threatening the United States. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hSaLQOU9jT0 “The United States will sustain its strong missile defense partnership with Israel, underpinned by a new U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that includes a commitment of $500 million for Israeli missile defense each year beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 through FY 2028,” the report announced, as well. “Under this MOU, DoD will sustain extensive cooperation with Israel, and seek increased opportunities to take advantage of Israeli research and development efforts for similar U.S. defense missions.” This plan includes continued co-development and co-production of both the Arrow 3 and David’s Sling , the latter of which uses the Stunner interceptor and sits capability-wise between the Arrow family and Iron Dome. The U.S. and Israel will still co-produce the Iron Dome system, as well, which the U.S. Army is now looking to buy for its own use . The report did not mention it specifically as part of the new agreement, but Israel is also a major operator of the U.S.-made Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has a missile defense role, as well. All told, this latest Arrow 3 test is an indicator that ongoing cooperation, which is predominantly focused on countering Iranian capabilities, as well as those that it has and continues to proliferate to proxies in the region, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah . The increasing use of Iron Dome and other missile defense systems to protect against missiles and rockets originating from Syria only further underscores that reality of the threat. Those strikes will only further push Israel to keep working on the various layers of its ballistic missile defense shield. Combined with the overall tensions with Iran, and with an apparent backlog of test launches building up, we could easily see more demonstrations of the Arrow 3’s capability as the year goes on.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018",Here’s The F-22 Production Restart Study The USAF Has Kept Secret For Over A Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Axing F-22 production at just 187 examples has become one of the most hotly debated and controversial defense procurement-related decisions of our time. Today, it is widely viewed, even among the USAF’s brass , that this decision—made a decade ago— was near-sighted and we continue to find out new information as to how exactly it came to pass. Finally, in early 2016, the debate surrounding the need for more F-22s came to a head and study was mandated by Congress for the USAF to research what putting the super-fighter back into production would take. That study was finished in late 2016 with some of its findings openly discussed, but the document itself remained classified, until now. We have obtained a copy of the report, which cost approximately $37,000 itself for the Air Force to produce, through the Freedom of Information Act. It is almost entirely unredacted, but isn’t all that in-depth and largely depends on a 2011 RAND study as a basis for its conclusions. We have posted the full document here for you to review, but we have also distilled it down into some key points and takeaways. Working primarily with RAND’s conclusions from 2011, the Air Force crafted the following cost estimates and assumptions for what it would take to restart F-22 production and produce 194 additional Raptors: Total non-recurring start-up costs over a five year period totaling $9.869 billion in 2016 dollars, equal to more than $10 billion in 2018 dollars at the time of writing. This included approximately $228 million to refurbish production tooling, $1.218 billion to requalify sources of components and raw materials, $5.768 billion to redesign four subsystems, and $1.156 billion in other associated “restart costs,” along with $1.498 billion in “additional government costs.” Two of the four subsystems needing “redesign” would be the AN/APG-77 low probability intercept (LPI) radar and the F119 engine, neither of which are still in production. The other two were the aircraft’s software package and an unspecified fourth system, acting as a placeholder to hedge against the Air Force discovering that other systems needed replacement during the restart process. The aircraft’s electronic warfare, communication, navigation, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems were among those that might also need replacement or substitution with another system. While the 2011 RAND study estimated an average unit cost of $266 million, this was based on a total purchase of just 75 aircraft. The Air Force estimated that the initial unit cost for an order of 194 aircraft would be approximately $216 million. This would drop to around $206 million by the time the last one rolled off the production line. The unit price would begin to largely level out after the service had purchased the first 100 aircraft. The total procurement cost would be between $40 and $42 billion, with the entire program costing a little more than $50.3 billion. The Air Force also noted that while approximately 95 percent of the F-22-related production tooling is still available, the physical productions facilities either no longer exist or are supporting other Lockheed Martin programs, such as the F-35. After the 2011 study, the service elected to put the “primary production tooling” into a warehouse at Sierra Army Depot in California in case there was a need to make certain spare parts in the future. Pratt and Whitney, who supplied the F119 engine, had also shifted significant focus to building the F135 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The F135 is developed from the F119 to some degree, though. Tyler Rogoway/Author The Air Force repeatedly expressed a concern that the rebooted effort would compete for resources with its F-35 procurement and upgrade efforts. However, the report also says the service did not consider whether any of the Joint Strike Fighter’s components, supply chains, or infrastucture could help support a new F-22 program and potentially produce cost savings. The service also determined that it was still “technically feasible” to develop an export version of the F-22, potentially helping to share the cost burdens and reduce the unit costs even further. The report cites a separate 2010 Air Force study that estimated the costs of doing just that. In addition, the service reiterated the long-standing challenges in securing approval for exporting F-22s in any configuration. The report identifies a number of U.S. government stakeholders who would have to sign off on any foreign deliveries, but Air Force censors redacted all of them. The non-recurring costs of putting the Raptor back into production seem peculiarly high in this report, estimated at around $10 billion. Keep in mind that is roughly half of the entire development cost of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. In addition, this study states that unit cost would be fairly steady, especially after the first 100 examples, dropping to $206 million for the final example. This doesn’t make much sense considering all other major defense programs seem to tout steeper unit cost reductions over a production run, and especially over the first production lots. The F-35 program, for instance, has placed a huge part of its business case on this fact alone. Tyler Rogoway/Author When it comes to fly-away cost—what the actual aircraft costs to build itself, without research and development costs included— the last 60 F-22s that were produced during its production run cost an average of $137 million per copy , which was approaching the F-35A’s cost during the same time in its production run. In fact, then-Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael Mosely, who lost his job because he would not stand by and watch then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates make the decision to cut F-22 production without a fight, noted : “We didn’t, and still don’t need, a thousand of those things. But you need the right number… The last airplanes we took delivery of were $87 million… Had we been able to go to another multiyear [contract] there was an understanding that we would be able to get them for $85 million… Find me an airplane out there right now that costs $85 million and has that capability.” So, it seems likely that further reductions in production cost could be realized beyond what the restart study states, and especially considering the F-22 is a known commodity, not some new fighter just entering into production. The study uses some references to say otherwise, but This is also a reminder of how costs of weapon systems can be distorted using different calculations to make one look far more affordable than another. The reality is that the F-22 program cost $70 billion and roughly $30 billion of that was spent on non-recurring and research and development costs. So if you build less of them and amortize that over the small fleet, it looks fiscally atrocious. In reality, what’s atrocious is that the $30 billion spent on developing a system like F-22 would be wasted on such a tiny fleet. As we have stated before , the conclusions of this study were likely baked into it before it really even began and at this point investing huge sums of money into restarting F-22 production doesn’t make all that much sense. That money could be invested other programs like the USAF’s ‘ Penetrating Counter-Air’ initiative and especially in high-end unmanned combat air vehicles . But if another country, say Japan , were willing to pay for the non-recurring restart costs, the Pentagon would be crazy not to buy more Raptors for largely their unit cost alone as well as plenty of spare parts to support the fleet efficiently for decades to come. Tyler Rogoway/Author It’s impossible to believe that Tokyo could design and procure a 5th generation fighter with F-22 like performance for less than the cost of just restarting the Raptor line and producing upgraded F-22s. Plus they could have those jets in half a decade, not in decades . It would also go a long way when it comes alleviating risk for such a program. Israel, and even possibly Australia, could also be interested in buying a squadron or two of new production F-22s. But judging by the report itself, which underlines over and over again that any dollars put toward F-22s could be taken from the F-35 program—both in terms of foreign and domestic procurement—this is unlikely to occur.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2018",Here’s What Really Happened When U.S. Marines Brought F-35Bs to Red Flag,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With great fanfare , the U.S. Marine Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 (VMFA-121) arrived at Nellis Air Force Base with a contingent F-35B stealth fighters in July 2016. This was the first time F-35s of any type had participated in an iteration of the U.S. Air Force’s most important aerial war game, Red Flag. “If I had to go into combat, I wouldn’t want to go into combat in any other airplane,” Marine Corps Lt. Col. J.T. Bardo proudly declared to the press near the end of the exercise. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, The War Zone can now share how Bardo described the experience to his superiors behind closed doors. The executive summary of his final report paints a picture that is—like everything about the F-35—more complicated than the Pentagon’s public affairs push. A reading between the lines would seem to prove Marine F-35Bs were still far from ready for actual combat a year after the service declared the aircraft had achieved initial operational capability (IOC). It’s especially enlightening to read after the Air Force’s impressive claims about its own F-35As at Red Flag 17-1 in February 2017, where pilots reportedly racked up an impressive kill ratio of 15-to-1, a figure that was later revised to 20-to-1. Of course, It’s important to note The War Zone has only seen the executive summary and not the full and undoubtedly more detailed after-action review. At the time of writing, the Marine Corps had not yet responded to queries relating to the document. Though we have no reason to suspect the report is in any way disingenuous, we are still relying on Bardo’s own observations about his own unit’s performance. USMC “Overall, the F-35 was far more survivable then the participating legacy aircraft,” the Marine officer wrote in his concluding paragraph.“ This was the first Red Flag exercise with F-35 participation and the USMC lead from the front.” In addition to the Marine’s Joint Strike Fighters (JSF), Red Flag 16-3 included Air Force F-22 Raptor and F-16 Viper fighter jets, and Navy EA-18G Growler jammers, along with a host of other supporting aircraft and drones, such as E-3 radar planes, KC-135 tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawks. More F-16s from the Air Force’s 64th Aggressor Squadron and Draken International’s A-4 Skyhawks acted as the opponents. Everyone got a classified briefing about what the F-35 could do and some individuals sat in on a second briefing about the program in general. According to Bardo’s memorandum, during each week, his unit would spend two days flying air-to-air missions and three days practicing air-to-ground strikes, targeting opponents with the aircraft’s sensors and escorting combat search and rescue assets. In the vast majority of those cases, the squadron sent out a pair of F-35s. Four-ship “surge events” occurred two nights a week, as part of the “defensive counter air” and “strategic attack” sessions. The F-35’s actual flying time during the exercise appears to have been relatively limited. Over the course of two weeks, VMFA-121’s six F-35s spent a total of just over 94 hours in the air—three hours more than exercise planners had planned for the unit. The squadron expected to conduct 70 sorties in total during the exercise, but missed three in the end. Weather, specifically a thunderstorm and fears about dangerous ice buildup, forced the Marines to cancel two sorties since the potential danger of lightning strikes has long been a vexing problem for the F-35. In June 2016 , storms temporarily halted Air Force F-35As from flying during a separate exercise at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, according to other records the author obtained via FOIA. Earlier in March 2017 , Australia’s two F-35s had to wait an extra day to leave the Avalon Air Show near Melbourne because of similar concerns. An unspecified maintenance issue forced the Marines to abort the other flight. Without knowing more details, this could be anything from a flat tire to something far more serious. The F-35B has suffered dangerous incidents in the past. In November 2016, Military.com broke news of one of the Corps’ JSFs suffering a major fire in the jet’s internal weapons bay. Investigators ultimately traced the cause of the problem back to a loose bracket holding electrical wiring. VMFA-121 also left a seventh jet behind at its base in Arizona due to a malfunctioning integrated power package (IPP), which provides electrical power for the aircraft, Bardo noted. In all, fewer than two of the squadron’s fighters— 23 percent—were “full mission capable” at any one time, on average. Crews kept approximately 53 percent of the six planes “partial mission capable” throughout Red Flag 16-3. “Notably, these numbers only reflect the six aircraft deployed to Nellis AFB,” Bardo stressed. USMC The pilots trained with aircraft in their most stealthy state, without any external weapons or other stores. “Training in this configuration is critical, as it allows pilots learn to effectively employ the aircraft as well as trust the low observable signature,” Bardo said, suggesting that VMFA-121’s pilots were not yet fully aware of how well the F-35’s stealthy features might actually hide them from threats. This wouldn’t be unreasonable for aviators still learning the ins and outs of any new plane and it is possible that in day-to-day training the aircraft’s stealth coatings are allowed to degrade further than during combat or a major exercise like Red Flag. Also, F-35s wear radar-reflective lenses during some basic training evolutions. Bardo did not include his squadron’s win/loss ratio for Red Flag 16-3, but blamed all losses on pilot error or the exercise’s constraints. The limits of Nellis’ training range, artificial no-fly areas , and rules that confined the jets in a 1,000 foot “altitude block,” meant the F-35s could play to their strengths, he wrote. Based on the available information, we cannot independently assess those claims. Even with these limitations, VMFA-121’s aviators had “the ability to use the aircraft’s high fidelity sensors to share data over Link-16 [data link] with fourth-generation assets with less capable sensors/radars,” Bardo explained. “This type of non-kinetic support was a force multiplier and enabled fourth generation escort assets to be more lethal and survivable.” USMC Still, it is unclear how often the F-35Bs were actually available to provide this support. There is very little detail about the aerial combat sorties in the executive summary in general. During air-to-air missions, Bardo said the JSFs stay on station to pass information to other aircraft after they had “expended” their mock weapons. The F-22 has done the same thing, acting as a “quarterback” of sorts for less capable assets even after their weapons bays were virtually empty. However, Bardo noted his jets couldn’t refuel in midair since none of the tankers at the exercise had the necessary probe-and-drogue equipment. On top of that, since the F-35Bs were in their stealthiest configuration during the sorties, unloading their total missile load would have meant “firing” at most four AIM-120 air-to-air missiles. It is entirely possible the majority of VMFA-121’s flying time during offensive and defense-counter air missions was spent without any available weapons regardless of its pilots specific roles. Similar issues were apparent during the ground attack flights. During the exercise, despite having the long-range sensors, software limits meant the Marines could only engage practice targets at relatively close ranges with laser-guided GBU-12 Paveway bombs and GPS-guided GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. “Lack of stand-off weapon in this current software configuration continue a to be one of our biggest limiting factors,” Bardo himself conceded. F-35.com Unfortunately, the F-35B’s massive lift fan, essential for its vertical take off and landing capability, is the major limiting factor when it comes to the jet’s internal weapons carriage capabilities. With the added weight and size of the fan, the Marine’s version can only manage to carry 1,000 pound-class weapons internally, while Air Force and Navy models can carry bombs and missiles in the 2,000 pound category. In addition, the F-35B Block 2F software package doesn’t yet work with the smaller Small Diameter Bomb glide bomb that can allow the jet to hit targets precisely from over 50 miles away. Regardless, Bardo specifically pointed out the exercise designers had not crafted a single scenario where they believed a fifth-generation stealth jet was critical to successfully completing the mission. All in all, unsurprisingly, the Marine’s assessment represents a mix bag or sorts that depicts a new plane showing promise but still in its teething phase, and services still trying to understand its new capabilities and adapt training exercises to suit them. We are eager to see if there will be similar detailed information available about Red Flag 17-1,—which featured a larger contingent of USAF F-35As flying with more advanced software—as well as a more robust set of threats for them to deal with.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works is building a new, more capable test reactor as it continues to move ahead with its ambitious Compact Fusion Reactor program , or CFR. Despite slower than expected progress, the company remains confident the project can produce practical results , which would completely transform how power gets generated for both military and civilian purposes. Aviation Week was first to report the updates on the CFR program, including that Lockheed Martin is in the process of constructing its newest experimental reactor, known as the T5, on July 19, 2019. The company’s legendary California-based Skunk Works advanced projects office is in charge of the effort and had already built four different test reactor designs, as well as a number of subvariants, since the program first became public knowledge in 2014. The War Zone has been following news of this potentially revolutionary program very closely in recent years. “The work we have done today verifies our models and shows that the physics we are talking about – the basis of what we are trying to do – is sound,” Jeff Babione, Skunk Works Vice President and General Manager, told Aviation Week . “This year we are constructing another reactor – T5 – which will be a significantly larger and more powerful reactor than our T4.” The T5’s main job will be to further test whether Skunk Work’s basic reactor design can handle the heat and pressure from the highly energized plasma inside, which is central to how the system works. In a nuclear fusion reaction, a gaseous fuel gets heated up to a point where the pressure is so intense that its very atomic structure gets disrupted and certain particles fuse together into a heavier nucleus. This process also involves the release of a massive amount of energy, which, in principle, could be used to run a traditional thermal power generator . A Skunk Works briefing slide from 2017 on the CFR program outlining the goals for the T5, as well as three other planned future experimental reactors leading up to the first viable “TX” prototype., Lockheed Martin via Stephen Trimble “We are currently scheduled to have that [the T5] go online towards the end of this year,” Babione said. “So that will be another significant leap in capability and towards demonstrating that the physics underlining our concept works.” The CFR program is built around new patented reactor design, which The War Zone has explored in detail in the past, that uses superconducting coils to more effectively generate a magnetic field to contain the heat and pressure of the reaction. Lockheed Martin’s hope is that this will overcome challenges that have relegated nuclear fusion power generation to the realm of experimentation since the first concepts emerged in the 1920s. A diagram showing the basic reactor configuration Lockheed Martin is using in its CFR program., Lockheed Martin Since then, teams in various countries have built functional fusion reactors, but they remain large, inefficient, and expensive. Last year, China touted progress on its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), but without highlighting that this reactor is situated inside a two-story building within the Dongpu Science Island, a large research campus on a lakeshore peninsula in China’s Anhui Province. An international consortium also hopes to have construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) completed in France in 2025, but this reactor will weigh approximately 23,000 tons . Containing the reaction, the same one that occurs in our sun and other stars, and doing so for a protracted period of time, remains the biggest hurdle. Nuclear fusion creates temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees Fahrenheit, which, in turn, also generate extremely high pressures inside the reactor vessel. The energy from fusion reactions can be so powerful that countries have already weaponized it in the form of hydrogen bombs . Using a powerful magnetic field remains the most viable means of keeping everything contained. Tokamaks such as EAST and ITER, a concept the Soviet Union first invented in the 1950s, which has become relatively common in fusion research, use a ring-shaped design, but remain inefficient. China says that its EAST now holds the world record for longest sustained fusion reaction at just 100 seconds. France’s Tore Supra , another tokamak, holds the record for longest plasma discharge at just over six minutes . In 2014, Aviation Week , with the help of Dr. Thomas McGuire, head of the CFR program, explained Skunk Work’s plan for getting past this issue: “The problem with tokamaks is that “they can only hold so much plasma, and we call that the beta limit,” McGuire says. Measured as the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure, the beta limit of the average tokamak is low, or about “5% or so of the confining pressure,” he says. Comparing the torus to a bicycle tire, McGuire adds, ‘if they put too much in, eventually their confining tire will fail and burst—so to operate safely, they don’t go too close to that.’ … The CFR will avoid these issues by tackling plasma confinement in a radically different way. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. ‘So for us, instead of a bike tire expanding into air, we have something more like a tube that expands into an ever-stronger wall,’ McGuire says. The system is therefore regulated by a self-tuning feedback mechanism, whereby the farther out the plasma goes, the stronger the magnetic field pushes back to contain it. The CFR is expected to have a beta limit ratio of one. ‘We should be able to go to 100% or beyond,’ he adds.” Lockheed Martin says that the CFR design could eventually be small enough to fit inside a shipping container, but still be able to power a Nimitz class aircraft carrier or up to 80,000 homes. The patent documents suggest it might eventually be compact enough to even power a large aircraft. It would also only require a fraction of the nuclear fuel found in existing fission nuclear power reactors, which, in turn, would generate significantly less waste over time. The fuel also doesn’t need to be anywhere near as refined, making it less dangerous to handle and far less suitable as a starting place to build nuclear weapons . Needless to say, this could completely disrupt the power generation industry and would have far-ranging applications in both the military and civilian domains, something The War Zone has previously explored in-depth . The U.S. military, in particular, is becoming so concerned about meeting future battlefield power generation needs that it is once again considering building small, mobile fission reactors to provide that energy. A practical CFR would offer a much safer and efficient alternative. Unfortunately, despite the progress that Skunk Works has made, many questions remain about whether its new reactor concept will be able to succeed whether other designs have failed. Lockheed Martin has initially suggested it might have a viable prototype ready this year or the next. By 2017, that schedule had gotten pushed back to sometime in the mid-2020s. In his interview with Aviation Week , Babione did not offer any more of a specific timeline for when a practical reactor, which the company refers to as TX, might be ready. Members of the CFR program team at Skunk Works work on an experimental fusion reactor., Lockheed Martin One of the biggest hurdles for Skunk Works may be ensuring that the design remains truly “compact” by the end of its development. Babione acknowledged that Lockheed Martin still had much work to do in scaling up the capabilities of the reactor design to a practical level, which might also require increasing its physical size . “How do you scale it up to generate power for a city or an entire town? That’s all ahead of us,” he said. “It’s certainly not easy but we think it is in the realm of the possible.” What we do know is that Lockheed Martin is still building new test reactors and clearly remains committed to this very exciting program, which could fundamentally change the future of power generation.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The commanding officer of the sprawling 57th Wing that calls Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada home is up to it again. This time around he isn’t running a social media contest to select a new aggressor paint scheme for one of the resident 64th Aggressor Squadron’s F-16C/D Vipers, he’s taking a poll as to what to name a new black and red motif that is already slated to adorn one of the adversary jets. You can read all about how these paint schemes are picked, why they are needed, how Brigadier General Robert Novotny came up with the idea to engage the Facebook community in regards to picking them, and so much more, in this past interview of ours with the General himself. With the highly anticipated and crowdsourced “ghost” scheme already flying , this new black and red design is definitely worth turning people’s attention to. In fact, two years ago, I thought this scheme had already come to be. A jet painted just like this, albeit without all of its titles, appeared at Red Flag Alaska that summer. I dubbed it the ‘SR-71’ scheme because it looked a lot like the iconic paint job on the Blackbird. An 18th AGRS F-16C wearing its flat black basecoat and red titles landing at its home base, Eielson AFB. The odd paint job caused some confusion when it appeared. , AIRMAN 1ST CLASS ISAAC JOHNSON It turns out that the aircraft in question—there were actually two—had its matte black basecoat applied during depot servicing. After returning to the 18th Aggressor Squadron at Eielson AFB in Alaska, there wasn’t enough time before Red Flag kicked off for the paint barn at the base to finish the paint job. So it flew missions in its black and red motif. What emerged after the paint job was finally applied, was one of the coolest ‘splinter’ style schemes around . The ‘SR-71’ Viper became the ‘BDU’ Viper after it got its full paint job., USAF At the time, I thought the black and red arrangement looked absolutely awesome, and it is somewhat similar to some of the paint jobs China has experimented with on their new stealth fighters—the J-31/FC-31 and the J-20 . Now it seems that the aggressors at Nellis agree and are going full-in on seeing that the concept becomes a reality. You can vote on what to name this newish design on the 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page . The options are currently ‘Wraith’ and ‘Fury,’ with Wraith leading by a sizable margin after 820 votes have been cast.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 8, 2018",The Crazy V-Bat Vertical Takeoff And Landing Drone Could Be A Game Changer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy sent its expeditionary fast transport ship USNS Spearhead to sea to experiment with a number of cutting-edge technologies last week, including MartinUAV’s novel V-Bat drone. V-Bat is capable of infrastructure-independent vertical takeoff and landings while also retaining the high efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft for long-endurance missions. Seeing as it can be launched and recovered in a nine square meter area and even in dense urban terrain, as well as on the tight decks of ships, the drone could have a lot of applications in the military, law enforcement/first responder, industrial, and environmental monitoring sectors. With a speed of up to 90 knots, it can dash to different areas quickly and it can cruise around for eight hours at 45 knots at an altitude of up to 15,000 feet . It can carry a payload of around eight pounds, which can include various multi-spectral sensor, electronic intelligence, radar, electronic warfare, and communications connectivity packages. It really is a lot of flexibility packed into a relatively small drone—V-Bat weighs just 82 pounds. It runs on a 183cc two-stroke engine that provides about 13 horsepower to its ducted-fan propulsion and control system. USN The aircraft is controlled via modular line-of-sight data-link that has a connectivity range of up to 50 miles. This can be extended indefinitely across the aircraft’s entire linear range by ‘handing-off’ V-Bat to other ground control stations as it nears the edge of its line-of-sight horizon. It features a semi-autonomous laptop user interface that fits into an easily portable hard-case. The entire V-Bat system., MartinUAV So we are talking about Scan Eagle/ RQ-21 Blackjack capabilities here in many respects, albeit with a bit less endurance, but without any of the launch catapults or recovery nets needed for that system. V-Bat is capable of autonomous launch and recovery operations and considering its tiny footprint, you really don’t need a flight deck or landing area to send it on its way or to land it. In fact, MartinUAV has demonstrated V-Bat landing in the bed of a truck while it was driving down the road. This opens up a whole host of sea-going platforms and ground units types that could leverage its persistant information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) potential. USN The U.S. Army has V-Bat on its very short list of contenders to replace its RQ-7 Shadow drones. The service has a number of capabilities they want for their new small drone system, with the ability to operate independently in very austere conditions and without a runway of any kind, as well as a lower acoustic signature than the Shadow being prime requirements. Advanced evaluations at the platoon level will be ongoing into 2020, after which the Army will make its choice. The reality that future battles will likely take place in sprawling and dense urban areas the Pentagon has dubbed ‘megacities,’ V-Bat’s ability to deploy and recover in really tightly confined areas may help make its case. In addition, it’s not like the Army and the Navy are the only services interested in V-Bat. The Marines and the Coast Guard are also eyeing the drone, too. It has demonstrated its capabilities during large allied exercises and for customers overseas, as well. USN V-Bat has been serving in a limited counter-narcotics role for the U.S. Navy since at least 2016, but a far wider deployment of the capability is yet to be seen. Still, the fact that the Navy has continued to experiment with the system for years now is a good sign that they like what they see. It isn’t hard to imagine how the Navy could use the drones to do a wide variety of tasks, from providing overwatch and/or communications relay capabilities to Naval Special Warfare units, to equipping its logistics ships, or even chartered vessels with no flight deck at all, with a powerful and persistent airborne ISR capability. USN If the Army adopts V-Bat as its RQ-7 successor, it will likely usher in a craze for these drones. Not only will it be a huge stamp of approval for V-Bat, but the economies of scale that a large U.S. Army acquisition would offer are unparalleled. This is especially true if the service goes beyond purchasing it for its RQ-7 units and migrates the capability to other parts of its organization, as well. As a result, the cost of V-Bat could become even more attractive to users that don’t have anywhere near Defense Department-sized budgets. It will be really interesting to see how V-Bat’s story evolves in the coming years. By the looks of it, it could very well become one of the most important and widely-used drones in the Pentagon’s portfolio.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 17, 2019",DARPA Starts Work On “Glide Breaker” Hypersonic Weapons Defense Project,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the threat of hypersonic weapons continues to grow , one of the Pentagon’s top research and development arm is moving ahead with a new project to explore ways to guard against them. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Glide Breaker project will look into various “component technologies” needed for one or more defense systems, but will focus heavily on a hard-kill interceptor to knock the fast-flying weapons out of the sky. DARPA showed off concept art of the interceptor portion of Glide Breaker for the first time at its D60 Symposium, which honors the organization’s 60th anniversary, in September 2018. The agency’s Tactical Technology Office had previously hosted a gathering to explain the project and its requirements to interested parties in July 2018. “The objective of the Glide Breaker program is to further the capability of the United States to defend against supersonic and the entire class of hypersonic threats,” DARPA said in an announcement for the July 2018 “Proposers Day.” “Of particular interest are component technologies that radically reduce risk for development and integration of an operational, hard-kill system.” So far, there are few other publicly available details about the program. In its budget request for the 2019 Fiscal Year , DARPA did not ask for any money for Glide Breaker specifically or for research and development of hypersonic defense systems broadly. It’s also not clear how Glide Breaker may be related to the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) own hypersonic defense project, which you can read about in more detail here and also includes plans for some sort of anti-hypersonic missile weapon system. As of February 2018, MDA expected to spend more than $700 million in total on that research and development project through at least 2023. DARPA’s concept art also shows hard-kill, kinetic interceptors about to destroy unpowered, hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , which would fit with the program’s name. However, the project’s stated goal of researching and developing technologies to defeat both high-supersonic and hypersonic threats suggests that such a system would only be one element of the research into a set of layered defenses that would work against both boost glide-type and air-breathing weapons . In addition, “breaker” is a clear call back to at least two earlier DARPA efforts, Assault Breaker and Tank Breaker , both of which were Cold War-era projects focused on defeating Soviet tanks and other armored vehicles. The former program also featured a multi-faceted approach that led to the development of a host of air and ground-based sensors, weapon systems, and other technologies. Assault Breaker included work on what would become the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control aircraft and the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, as well as the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX) program, which employed Northrop’s Tacit Blue stealth demonstrator as a low-observable sensor platform. It also helped drive the development of Northrop Grumman’s Brilliant Anti-armor Tank (BAT) submunition and the U.S. Army’s Army Tactical Missile System ( ATACMS ) quasi-ballistic missile. BAT has since evolved into the GBU-44/B Viper Strike glide bomb. Research under DARPA’s Assault Breaker program into long-range, stand-off sensors to spot Soviet armored formations and battle management capabilities to help friendly forces to engage them helped lead to the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft, one of which is seen here., USAF It seems likely that DARPA will pursue a similar ‘ecosystem approach’ with Glide Breaker. The U.S. military’s existing combination of terrestrial and space-based early warning sensors are simply not capable of reliably tracking strategic hypersonic weapons and none of its fielded or in-development missile defense weapons have the capability to engage these threats. American forces on the ground and at sea also have limited means of spotting a hypersonic weapon strike and no way of stopping it. On the strategic side, senior U.S. military officials, including Michael Griffin, the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, have both been particularly strong advocates for expanding and improving space-based sensor networks and deploying space-based anti-missile systems. Hyten has been particularly vocal about ensuring that space-based sensors can track hypersonic weapons , which isn’t surprising given the significant investments that Russia and China are making in nuclear-capable hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. The video below offers the best available look at Russia’s ballistic missile-launched, nuclear-capable Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, as well as computer-generated imagery showing how it would operate in flight. There has been less discussion of how to counter the growing threat of hypersonic weapons to conventional ground and naval forces, but those concerns are very real, too. The Russians have begun fielding the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal , an air-launched version of their Iskander quasi-ballistic missile , which can reach hypersonic speeds. China is in the process of developing an air-breathing hypersonic weapon that it could potentially use in a surface-to-surface or air-to-surface role. In both strategic and tactical settings, hypersonic weapons look set to offer a game-changing ability to launch virtually no-notice strikes against time-sensitive and other high priority targets. Their speed and ability to maneuver give them the ability to break through or simply dodge existing missile defenses. The video below shows a test of China’s Starry Sky 2 air-breathing hypersonic vehicle in August 2018. Glide Breaker’s core objective seems to be to find a way to challenge these inherent capabilities and make it clear to any potential opponent that a hypersonic weapon strike is in no way guaranteed to succeed against American forces. “A key figure of merit is deterrence: the ability to create large uncertainty for the adversary’s projected probability of mission success and effective raid size,” DARPA said in its Proposers Day notice . Unfortunately, doing so will be easier said than done. Using hard-kill interceptors to knock down incoming ballistic missiles, which reach hypersonic speeds in the latter stages of their flight trajectory, is hard enough , even though they travel along relatively well-defined courses to get to their targets. This has been described as trying to hit one bullet with another bullet . Engaging a hypersonic weapon would be akin to trying to hit a bullet that can erratically change course, is flying on a more level path through the atmosphere instead of space, and that is cruising at a consistent speed of five times the speed of sound or more throughout the majority of its flight. That speed would also simply reduce the time available for any sensors , no matter how well placed or powerful, to identify the threat and then help cue the interceptors. This would only be more pronounced in a battlefield setting, where hostile forces might launch their weapons much closer to the actual target, further reducing the time available for U.S. forces to respond. Of course, existing ballistic missiles already travel at hypersonic speeds in their terminal phase of flight, so existing defense systems geared toward intercepting those weapons at the end of their trajectory might be adaptable to knocking down hypersonic weapons, as well. Adding a space-based missile defense weapon layer could be another option to help shoot down boost-glide vehicles, which typically briefly fly near or above the earth’s atmosphere. Undersecretary of Defense Griffin has already proposed deploying 1,000 anti-missile interceptors in space and has discussed concepts for destroying incoming ballistic missiles during their initial boost phase , when they most vulnerable, using satellites carrying directed energy weapons . He has said the interceptor constellation concept would cost $20 billion, but has not yet offered any concrete details about the interceptors, how they would operate in space, or where the U.S. would position them to provide a useful defense shield. In 1993, the U.S. government canceled a proposed plan to place 4,600 interceptors in space, which had a price tag of $55 billion – more than $95 billion in 2018 dollars. The key in any one of these scenarios will be a robust sensor network to alert U.S. forces to incoming threats, monitor them as they head toward their targets, and help aim anti-missile weapons at them somewhere along the way. But despite these various potential difficulties, the growing danger of hypersonic weapons is already too great to ignore. “In brief, we do not have systems today that give us globally, comprehensive, persistent, timely, multi-mode awareness of what is going on on earth, everywhere, all the time. We don’t have that,” Undersecretary of Defense Griffin said at a conference earlier in September 2018. “The Chinese hypersonic threat is one that in today’s world, we cannot see coming until it’s too late.” It will be very interesting to see what sorts of sensors, weapons, and other technologies come out of DARPA’s Glide Breaker program that might be able to counter hostile hypersonic weapons, or at least make an enemy think twice before employing them. We’ve reached out to DARPA for more information about the project and will let you know if and when we get any additional details.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 23, 2020",The U.S. Air Force’s Unique Climate Testing Lab Has Blown Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The situation is still developing, but a massive explosion at the U.S. Air Force’s McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida prompted officials to issue a shelter in place order and set up a safety cordon around the facility. The service says it is still assessing situation. The incident occurred at approximately 10:00 AM, Eastern Standard Time and created a massive smoke cloud visible for miles around the base. The plume potentially contained the noxious chemical methyl chloride , according to authorities. “If in that area on base turn off your HVAC system,” one Tweet from Eglin’s official account read. “It has not [been] determined smoke contain[ed] methyl chloride,” another social media post added at around 12:52 PM. “Incident did occur in close proximity of chemical.” A common ingredient in consumer products in the past, use of the compound has largely declined in no small part because of its toxicity and flammability. Also known as chloromethane, it is colorless and has a mildly sweet odor. Inhaling it in its gaseous form can cause intoxicant-like effects, such as confusion and difficulty breathing, talking, and walking. Prolonged exposure can put you in a coma. First-responders put a 1,000-foot cordon around the main laboratory building and advised everyone to avoid the smoke. By 1:11 PM, it had reportedly dissipated. There were “no significant injuries,” according to the Eglin Twitter account. Ilka Cole, an Eglin spokeswoman, further told Military.com that it was not clear whether the methyl chloride was the cause or exacerbated the accident or how many people, if any, were working in or around the facility when it blew up. “We will provide updates as we receive them,” she said. “The cause is currently under investigation.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=NcGvW5dAa0A We don’t know how much of the substance was present or why it was at the site at the time, either. It is possible that the chemical, also known as Refrigerant-40, was in use at the McKinley Lab for that purpose. The facility is where the U.S. military torture tests aircraft, weapons, and other equipment to see how they fare under brutally cold conditions, as well as other extreme climates. A C-5 Galaxy cargo plane sits inside the McKinley Climatic Lab’s hangar., USAF While at Foxtrot Alpha in 2016, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway wrote a detailed profile of the facility, explaining: Within its first 50 years, the McKinley Climate Lab – which is the largest insulated hangar in the world –had tested 300 different aircraft from the B-29 to the F-22, as well as 2,000 other pieces of equipment, munitions and vehicles. Next year the facility will celebrate its 70th year, and it is in as high demand as ever. Foreign military customers have also tested their aircraft designs at the McKinley Climatic Lab, and so have some commercial and private aircraft companies. In the last decade, the 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 have been put through climatic torture tests there. The 55,000-square foot insulated main chamber has an array of cooling and heating components available including mechanical cooling towers, large heading arrays and a steam plant. All types of conditions can be tested, from deep freezing to blowing rain to high humidity conditions to dust storms. Also, different aircraft operations can be performed there, like running the aircraft under extreme thermal loads to test environmental control systems and cooling capacities. In all, the facility can provide testing environments with temperatures ranging from -70 to +180 degrees Fahrenheit. You can read the full profile, and see a variety of additional images and video of the facility and its operations, here . With officials still assessing the full extent of the damage, after which they can move on to determine the actual cause of the accident and the full chain of events, it could be some time before the facility reopens. This could potentially set back any number of projects that might be waiting for tests and results before they can move on to their next phase of development. We will definitely be keeping an eye out for new developments and update this story over the next 12 hours as more details become available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 4, 2019",Look Inside The Secret Service’s Command SUVs That Are Being Converted For Special Ops Use,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Special Operations Command North, or SOCNORTH, is in the process of converting six Chevy Suburban sport utility vehicles to better meet the needs of its Crisis Response Team. The White House Communications Agency had previously used these already heavily modified “ Roadrunners ” to provide critical command and control and communications support for presidential motorcades, something you can read about in great detail in this past War Zone feature . We now have pictures of the outside and inside of these SUVs that offer a unique look at their previous lives and future roles. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), which is managing the vehicle modification contract for SOCNORTH, posted the set of photos on the U.S. government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps on July 24, 2019 . The headquarters for AFSPC, SOCNORTH, and U.S. Northern Command are all at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. The six Roadrunners are presently there and the Air Force says it would prefer whichever contractor it hires to do the work on the base, though it is willing to consider offers from companies wishing to use facilities up to 80 miles away. It is not entirely clear when SOCNORTH acquired the Roadrunners for its Crisis Response Team (CRT) or how long they have been in service with the White House Communications Agency (WHCA) before that. Last year, photos emerged of a Ford F350 Super Duty-based Roadrunner replacement, indicating that the WHCA might begin to retire the old Chevy Suburban-based types, which is likely how these examples became available to the CRT in the first place. It’s also not clear if the CRT has been employing these vehicles operationally or in training already. The pictures show the SUVs still have their characteristic roof-mounted base for the original configuration’s antenna array, but with an X-shaped UHF satellite communications antenna in the center rather than the cakepan-shaped one seen on more recent WHCA vehicles. Roadrunners have also been seen in the past with a more dome-shaped GV2432 UHF satellite communications antenna. Markings on the roof do seem to show where a circular antenna of some sort had been installed before. A WHCA Roadrunner with the cakepan-style satellite communications antenna on top., Paul Carter A closeup of the X-shaped satellite communications antenna on one of SOCNORTH’s Roadrunner, with the apparent mounting point for a circular antenna also visible., USAF A view of the rear portion of the roof mount with additional antennas still in place., USAF From what else we can see of the Roadrunners in their present configuration, it is clear that WHCA vehicles are extremely jam-packed in the back. Pictures show a large equipment rack in the center and two additional ones all the way to the rear. SOCNORTH’s CRT wants the center rack and the rear left rack gone entirely, along with various cabling and connections that go along with them.

The contracting documents also call for retaining a number of antenna bases, cabling, and power connections within the vehicle in order to provide capacity for adding new and additional systems down the line. This could include higher capacity on-the-move satellite communications and data-sharing capabilities using improved hardened and secure networks and terminals, such as the systems the Army has developed part of successive iterations of its Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T). A close-up, at left, along with a wider shot of the external power panel on one of the CRT vehicles., USAF There is otherwise no mention of any modifications to the vehicles on the automotive side, which isn’t necessarily surprising. The Roadrunners were already specially configured to meet the power generation needs and other performance requirements that the WHCA had previously laid out. It’s not clear exactly how SOCNORTH’s CRT expects to use the vehicles now. A primer on SOCNORTH , as a whole, that Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Collins, the Plans Division Chief for the command’s Strategy, Plans, and Policy directorate, or J5, wrote for Small Wars Journal last year described the CRT’s mission as such: “The SOCNORTH SOCFWD-Crisis Response is a command element built from the SOCNORTH staff that is capable of deploying within four hours to provide Command and Control (C2) of DoD assets and situational awareness to CDR NORTHCOM in times of crisis. Primarily in support of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the SOCNORTH crisis response team postures itself to rapidly assess the situation, coordinate with lead federal agencies when needed and send valuable updates through the DoD chain of command to assume a proactive response for supporting the interagency. In addition to the domestic portion, SOCNORTH is developing the ability to perform the same function in the foreign areas of the AOR. This will include increased coordination with the Department of State (DoS) and diplomatic facilities to ensure the proper reception, staging and onward integration (RSOI) of DoD support and resources in the event of a crisis.” In addition, acquiring the six Roadrunners helped the CRT provide “enhanced interoperability and effectiveness in communications to defend the homeland,” according to the public LinkedIn page for Wesley Drake . That page says he was the Communications Senior Enlisted Advisor within SOCNORTH’s Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber Directorate, or J6. This would strongly imply that the SUVs will continue to provide important command and control functions for CRT members, including being able to link together with other U.S. government agencies during domestic or foreign missions. This kind of interoperability would be invaluable when responding to a large domestic terrorist attack or other major crises , especially ones that trigger so-called “ continuity of government ” planning and involve locating and then moving large numbers of senior U.S. officials to safe, hardened locations . During these kinds of scenarios, the CRT could easily find itself deeply embedded within a broader interagency task force with elements from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Department of Justice. A member of an FBI SWAT Team assigned to the Tampa Field Office, at right, and another special operator during a multi-national special operations forces demonstration on the sidelines of the annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference in Tampa, Florida in 2018. , USAF Still, SOCNORTH’s planned configuration for the vehicles does sound less robust than the one found on the WCHA’s Roadunners At the same time, the CRT’s command and control requirements are also unlikely to be as demanding as those for personnel charged with following around the President of the United States and ensuring that America’s chief executive remains in direct contact with the rest of the U.S. government, including the National Command Authority in case of the need to order a nuclear strike , at all times. Using the modified Suburbans also generally makes sense for the CRT, which expects to find itself often operating with civilian agencies, such as the FBI , DHS, or the Department of State , which also typically use similar civilian-style SUVs. SOCNORTH’s personnel are less likely to stand out with these vehicles and they would be far less likely to add onerous and unique additional logistical requirements for mission planning. If nothing else, SOCNORTH has made what appears to be a very sensible decision to take Roadrunners the WHCA was likely working to get rid of anyways and use them to bolster the CRT’s vehicle fleets without having to go through the often lengthy and costly process of acquiring all-new vehicles and having them modified to meet various U.S. military and other government standards. When fully modified, the SUVs look set to provide an important set of capabilities as the CRT continues to expand and evolve to take on greater responsibilities both within the United States and elsewhere in North America.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 12, 2019",The French Have Plans For A Constellation Of Laser-Armed Miniature Satellites,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. France is eying a constellation of miniature space-based guardians armed with lasers that could strike at other satellites if the country’s orbital assets come under attack , along with increased surveillance capabilities in orbit to spot potential threats. There are many questions about the potential plan that remain unanswered, but that the French are considering it at all highlights growing concerns about potential conflicts in space and the reality that no one necessarily knows what that might actually entail. France’s Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly described to reporters on July 25, 2019 , the country’s new “ Mastering Space ” plan to boost surveillance capabilities in space to spot potential threats and to develop an active defense posture to respond to any attacks. Parly also announced that the country would expand space-related defense spending by $780 million through 2025, on top of an existing budget of around $4 billion over the next six years. This came just weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the country would create a Space Command within the French Air Force by Sept. 1, 2019. That service will subsequently get renamed the Air and Space Force, as well. “Today our allies and our military adversaries are militarizing space,” Parly said. “We must act. We must be ready.” Parly offered limited specifics about how France planned to pursue the surveillance and active defense components of the Mastering Space effort. By far, the biggest reveal was that the French could potentially deploy a constellation of dedicated laser-armed mini-satellites to guard other assets, which the country could begin buying in numbers as early as 2023. French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly speaks to the press about the country’s new space policies on July 25, 2019., Ministère des Armées “If our satellites are threatened, we intend to blind those of our adversaries,” Parly declared said. “We reserve the right and the means to be able to respond: that could imply the use of powerful lasers deployed from our satellites or from patrolling nano-satellites.” It’s not clear whether these laser attacks would be directed at attacking satellites or simply any other satellites belonging to the hostile party that initiated the skirmish. In addition, Parly only mentions “blinding” satellites, but this would only work against the optics on a target satellite. She also did not say whether such an attack would be aimed a permanently disabling a target’s cameras or merely at “dazzling” them temporarily She did say that France was developing high-powered laser directed energy weapons – “an area in which France has fallen behind” – to support this project. This might potentially point to a broader ability to damage or destroy other space-based assets in the future. The U.S. military, almost certainly the main “ally” Parly was referring to as militarizing space, is already pursuing space-based lasers, microwave beams , and particle beams , ostensibly for missile defense, but that could similarly have a role in targeting hostile satellites. Parly’s comments also come amid growing concerns about Russia’s increasing number of small, very maneuverable “ killer satellites ” in orbit that might be able to use small manipulator arms to physically attack other objects in space or simply smash into them in order to destroy them. They are also small enough to possibly position themselves close to otherwise satellites and remain undetected until the time comes to strike or hide in fields of otherwise innocuous “ space junk ” floating in orbit, making them difficult to monitor. It’s worth noting that these same tiny satellites might carry electronic intelligence equipment, electronic warfare jammers, or directed energy weapons that might be able to blind optics or otherwise interfere with a satellite’s operation, too. Even just having some sort of sprayer to paint over cameras or solar panels could be enough to achieve a mission kill on a particular target. A diagram from the US Defense Intelligence Agency showing the various means by which one satellite might attack another., DIA In 2018, Parly publicly accused Russia of using one of its Luch-Olymp relay satellites to try and maneuver close to Athena-Fidus military communications satellite, which France and Italy operate jointly, to try and intercept transmissions. It got “so close that one really could believe that it was trying to capture our communications,” she said at the time. Beyond space-based threats, there are also a growing number of terrestrial anti-satellite threats , including ground-based interceptors , too. In March 2019, India conducted its first-ever anti-satellite weapon test . The United States, Russia, and China are the only other countries to have demonstrated surface-launched anti-satellite weapons. In order to help better monitor for these sorts of potential threats in the first place, Parly said that France would also be adding surveillance cameras to its Syracuse military communications satellites . However, it was unclear how France would be able to make these modifications to the elements of that constellation that are already in orbit or if this would only apply to future Syracuse 4 satellites. Two of these, Syracuse 4A and 4B, are already under construction, with the first one slated to be in orbit and operating in 2021. In November 2018, French authorities announced that they had decided to procure a third Syracuse 4 satellite, as well. The Syracuse 4 design reportedly has additional protective features to harden it against cyber attacks, electronic warfare jamming, and electromagnetic pulses. The Syracuse 3A military communications satellite, which France launched in 2005., Thales Alenia Space France is also looking to develop a successor to Graves radar surveillance satellite , which already provides enhanced situational awareness about activity in space. “The successor of Graves must be able to detect satellites 1,500 kilometers [932 miles] away that are no bigger than a shoe-box,” Parly said. But however the French decide to increase monitoring of its existing satellites, especially to watch out for potentially hostile mini-sats maneuvering close to them, and what steps they take to develop capabilities to attack those threats, serious questions remain about just what exactly a conflict in space might look like at all. Parly’s comments, and their lack of specifics, in many ways reflect similar statements from former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein earlier in 2019, which The War Zone analyzed in detail at the time. Wilson and Goldfien both spoke about the potential development of active defensive measures to protect American space-based assets, but offered little explanation about how it might implement any such response. Then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, to her immediate right, at the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium in April 2019., USAF Attributing attacks in space, especially against satellites a country may not even acknowledge exist , can be difficult, to begin with. Deciding what a proportional response would be, particularly given that a skirmish in space is unlikely to produce immediate human casualties, might be even more problematic and could easily lead to an escalating conflict that extends down to terrestrial battlefields. “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists,” Douglas Loverro, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, said during a talk in 2016 . “Is jamming an attack? Is a laser an attack? Does it have to be a kinetic hit on a satellite to be an attack?” “None of us actually know how a war – if and when it extends to space – will actually evolve, where and what phase will it happen, when will it happen in the conflict, how will it be engineered, we don’t know any of that,” he continued. “Probably people are going to die on the ground where nobody’s going to die in space.” Despite the very real concern of a potential clash in space, or at attacks on space-based assets as part of a broader conflict above and below the earth’s atmosphere, three years after Loverro outlined these issues, not much has changed in the way of policy and international norms. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty bans signatories from placing weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weapons, in space, and prohibits them from militarizing the moon and other “celestial bodies,” but does not restrict the deployment of conventional space-based weapons or other military capabilities. How the US Army envisioned war on the moon in the 1960s, before the Outer Space Treaty effectively prohibited this. What conflict in space in the future might look like remains unclear., US Army As space becomes more crowded – approximately 2,000 active satellites are in orbit right now and this doesn’t include inactive “ space junk ” that poses its own hazards – these questions will only become more pressing. In June 2019, India notably announced plans to conduct a table-top “ space war ” exercise the following month that would explore many of the same issues. “We are not afraid of everyone,” Parly said in response to a question at the press conference on July 25 about whether France’s new space policy was directed at any potential adversaries in particular. “We consider because we’ve seen it that space is becoming a potential place of conflict.” This is certainly true, but it remains less clear what character a conflict in space might take on and how exactly a future full of space-based weapons, such as France’s proposed laser-toting miniature satellites, might shape it before, during, and after it occurs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",U.S. Training For Arctic Nuclear Satellite Disaster Amid Russian Weapons Developments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military, along with other federal and state authorities, has been training to respond to potentially dangerous releases of radioactive material in and around the Arctic . Though there is no clear indication of a direct link between Russia’s reported tests of nuclear-powered missiles or expanding use of nuclear power in the region, it is hard not to see these exercises in connection with those developments. Earlier in March 2018 , members of the U.S. National Guards from 10 different states arrived at the Donnelly Training Area, situated near the U.S. Army’s Fort Greely in Alaska. Alaska state authorities and members of Canada’s reserve 39 Canadian Brigade Group joined the exercise, nicknamed Arctic Eagle 2018, as well. The drills included a number of different mock crises, including an overturned fuel truck creating a hazardous material spill, the potential for attacks on the Trans Alaskan Pipeline System, and even cyber attacks . But especially notable was a scenario involving the need to locate a crashed satellite and contain the radiological material it had deposited across a wide area as it plummeted to earth. “Training in an extreme weather environment tests not only your equipment, but your own physical strength,” 1st Lieutenant Shawnta DiFalco, commander of the Decontamination Element within the Washington Army National Guard’s 792nd Chemical Company, said during the exercise . “The Soldiers had to work through freezing wind, snow and ground ice to set up equipment. Without fail, there are challenges when using decontamination equipment; the cold weather training we received was unmatched in its ability to challenge our capability to do our jobs in an austere environment.” A member of the 220th Military Police Company, Colorado Army National Guard, mans a checkpoint in the Donnelly Training Area during Arctic Eagle 2018., US Army The 792nd Chemical Company is part of a larger Homeland Response Force for Alaska and neighboring regions of the United States, which also includes specialized Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams , military police, and other elements from various states. Air and Army National Guard elements also helped deploy these forces, including via C-17 airlifters. The active duty 95th Chemical Company also contributed a pair of M1135 Stryker Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicles, which carries various equipment to detect and categorize radiological, chemical, and biological hazards, for the exercise. “The winter is a really challenging time of year to land in Valdez, [Alaska],” Major Laura Grossman, one of the two pilots from the Alaska Air National Guard’s 176th Wing that flew C-17s between from Anchorage to the landing area near the Alaskan city of Fairchild during the drills, said . “The runway isn’t plowed, and even if we were able to land, the runway is too slick and wouldn’t allow us to take off.” An infogrpahic showing the various capabilities of the M1135 Stryker., US Army It’s definitely no secret that the U.S. military has become increasing interested in preparing for potential conflicts and other contingencies above and near the Arctic Circle in recent years. As global climate change has shrunk the polar ice cap and otherwise reduced the amount of ice buildup that occurs during certain parts of the year, the region has become increasingly important economically and various countries, especially Russia, have moved to enforce their territorial claims. “The growing concerns regarding the increased number of nations competing for Arctic resources are well justified,” U.S. Air Force General Lori Robinson, head of U.S. Northern Command, which oversees operations in the region, and the designated “Advocate for Arctic Capabilities” within the Pentagon, reiterated to members of Congress during a hearing in February 2018 . “Diminishing sea ice provides opportunities for significantly expanded access to a region that had previously been inaccessible to all but a handful of northern nations.” A C-17 from the  Alaska Air National Guard’s 176th Wing sits on the tarmac in Spokane, Washington waiting to pick up elements of the Homeland Response Force during Arctic Eagle 2018., US Army Also earlier in March 2018, U.S. Marines and Army Special Forces soldiers teamed up to conduct another exercise in Alaska, called Arctic Edge , focused on improving different services’ abilities to work together in the Arctic region. The U.S. Navy, along with foreign allies, has also been in the process of a routine Ice Exercise, or ICEX, demonstrating important submarine capabilities above the Arctic Circle. And to be fair, the idea of a crashing satellite creating a radiological disaster isn’t an entirely fictional scenario. In 1978, the Soviet Union’s Kosmos 954 reconnaissance satellite , which had a nuclear reactor as its power source, crashed into Canadian territory, touching off an international incident and prompting an expensive response and clean-up operation. It’s also not the first time the U.S. military has employed the idea of hunting for a radioactive satellite as the basis for training exercises in Alaska. The 2017 iteration of Arctic Eagle also involved this same basic scenario. That same year, soldiers from 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment went on the look for a mock radioactive space object in another drill above the Arctic Circle, known as Spartan Pegasus . But U.S. military and other agencies practicing specifically to handle a radiological incident in the region seems even more noteworthy in light of a number of recent events. Most importantly are Russian claims that it has been testing a cruise missile with theoretically unlimited range that uses a nuclear reactor-powered propulsion system in the Arctic. Anonymous U.S. government officials have since told various media outlets that this is true, but that the weapons have been crashing , potentially spreading radioactive material and components. As we at The War Zone noted previously , even if the Kremlin deemed these tests successful from a research and development perspective, the missiles would still have to be slamming back onto solid ground or into the ocean at the end of their flight by design. The Arctic Edge 2018 scenario specifically included faux radiological releases on land and at sea. The Russians have also been dramatically expanding their use and plans to employ small and mobile nuclear reactors to support activities in the Arctic. In January 2018, Andrey Petrov, director of Russia’s state-run civil nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom, announced that the Akademik Lomonosov , a floating nuclear power station, would arrive in country’s Arctic town of Pevek in June 2019. The Akademik Lomonosov will be the first of its kind to begin regular operations and Russia is planning to build more of the same design, ostensibly to support resource extraction and other civil efforts in the Arctic. There have been serious concerns about the reliability and safety of these unpowered, reactor-carrying barges in such extreme conditions. But the Kremlin has consistently dismissed those concerns, pointing to its long-standing operation of nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Arctic, which isn’t the best example because they too have experienced radiological leaks. It seems very likely that these power stations, or a similar design, could help power Russia’s plans for a dramatic expansion in its Arctic military facilities, which the country announced in 2014. In April 2017, Russian officials revealed a new, massive base in the region called the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , which translates variously as Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock. The Akademik Lomonosov under construction., Rosatom This facility is situated on Alexandra Land , an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, north of the Arctic Circle. It has its own power plant to support operations when during the winter months when it is effectively cut off from the mainland, but it is unclear whether it is conventional or nuclear-powered. In addition, there are reports that Russia has begun to develop and potentially deploy small underwater nuclear reactors in order to power sensors or other equipment for protracted periods of time. The Arctic is a likely site for these units, as Russian forces are looking to expand their undersea capabilities in the region, reportedly including sonar networks to monitor foreign submarine activity . If any of these nuclear power systems were to fail, it could potentially cause a serious radiological incident that would impact both the United States and Canada. The same procedures American military and other government personnel have been training to employ in response to a crashed satellite would undoubtedly be applicable in those situations, too. So, while the idea of radioactive space debris might serve as a ready exercise scenario, there are a growing number of very real radiological dangers in the Arctic. Unless the Russians change course, the need to be prepared for a nuclear incident only looks set to become more pronounced in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",China Says It Has Brought Bugle Calls Back To The Battlefield,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has released a new defense policy white paper, the first since 2015, which lambasts the United States, in particular, as the principal threat to global stability. Not surprisingly, it casts itself as a stable alternative, despite its very visible actions to the contrary in recent years , and calls for continued modernization and expansion of the People’s Liberation Army and its ability to meet various foreign and domestic security challenges. The document specifically notes a number of materiel developments that the Chinese clearly see as important reflections of these already growing capabilities, including the J-20 stealth fighter , the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, and the Type 052D destroyer . But there’s one that’s a bit more curious, the return of bugles as a battlefield communication tool. The Chinese government’s latest policy document says that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has “restored and improved the traditional mechanism of using bugles to communicate and command.” However, it does not provide any specifics on how widespread the practice is at present or across which of the PLA’s services. It’s main branches, at present, at the PLA Army (PLAA), PLA Navy (PLAN), PLA Air Force (PLAAF), and PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), the last of which is responsible for the country’s ballistic missile units. In 2015, China also activated the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), primarily to handle space and cyberwarfare operations . Last year, the Chinese also announced plans to create the PLA Joint Logistic Support Force (PLAJLSF) to create a central command for major logistics activities, as well as construction tasks, including oil pipeline work. Bugles as an instrument of military communication date back at least to the 18th Century, but they were also the evolution of millennia of militaries using musical instruments and other auditory signals to direct forces on the battlefield. Bugles and similar instruments have typically been associated with ground and naval forces. The Chinese white paper did not say whether or not PLA forces would be using actual bugles or some other instrument. Elements of the PLA had already continued to use bugles operationally into the 1980s , well after they had become a more ceremonial, non-combat tool in most other militaries around the world. Other traditional battlefield signalling tools, such as whistles and signal flags, also remain in Chinese military use. The first reports that China was looking to reboot the PLA’s bugle capabilities emerged in 2018. The new system significantly reduces the total number of bugle calls from 109 to just 21. The new calls will include a number to routine activities, such as reveille in the morning and taps at night, along with ceremonial purposes. However, the PLA has made clear that there will also be calls in a third category for actually signaling actions on the battlefield. “The purpose of restoring and improving the bugle calls system of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is to further strengthen the troops’ consciousness in listening to orders, inherit the good traditions of the army, and boost the soldiers’ morale,” one 2018 article on China Military , an official PLA outlet, explained. “The bugle calls system was established in the early age of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and played an important role in guaranteeing the victory of the war.” A Chinese Communist bugler plays his instrument during World War II., Public Domain It remains to be seen how serious the PLA actually is about the bugles. It is certainly true that, unlike modern radios and satellite communications systems, the instruments can’t get jammed or spoofed or intercepted or hacked via electronic means. At the same time, bugle calls have an extremely limited range by any standard and can only convey broad messages – attack, retreat, and so forth – to those in earshot. The immense amount of noise on a modern battlefield full of automatic gunfire, unarmored and armored vehicles, helicopters, combat jets, and more, could easily drown out their signals, too. The U.S. Marine Corps is notably looking to issue a significant number of regular combat troops with sound suppressors for their rifles in part to help make it easier for small units to communicate verbally during periods of intense action. The video below includes various U.S. Army bugle calls as generic examples of the use of the instrument for communicating day-to-day announcements and combat commands. Of course, if your electronic communications are unavailable for some reason, bugles do represent a no-frills backup option that can at least communicate to some degree. With multiple buglers spread between units, they could relay calls across a larger area with relative rapidity and at a volume above how loud a person might be able to yell without quickly going hoarse. Auditory signals would work in the dark or in situations where friendly forces may be hidden away behind physical cover, smoke, or other obscurants, and unable to otherwise see hand signals or flags. However, using bugles in these situations would expose the position of any concealed unit, too. In the end, it may turn out to be that the PLA’s restoration of bugle calls for combat purposes is itself somewhat symbolic and could find itself confined to training exercises, demonstrations for senior officials and foreign dignitaries, and reenactments to mark major historical anniversaries. There have been also been similar developments in Russia, including the recent creation of a ceremonial Russian Army unit equipped with World War II-era T-35/85 tanks. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made appeals to nationalism a key part of his governing style. “The National Revolutionary Army that participated in the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, already had buglers and a bugler detachment,” according to another China Military article, underscoring the PLA’s deep and existential connection to the bugle. “In November 1931, the Music Scores of Military Bugle Calls of the Chinese Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army was formulated and issued, and the Chinese military had its own bugle calls scores and regulations for the first time.” The symbolism of the bugle certainly appeals to a reinvigorated sense of nationalism that President Xi Jinping has steadily promoted since first taking up his post in 2013, too. After China intervened in the Korean War, “military bugle calls were widely used by the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, playing an important role in creating psychological shock on the so-called ‘United Nations Army’ and dwarfing their morale,” China Military declared in a 2018 piece dripping with patriotic fervor . A bugle that U.S. Army troops in Korea captured from Chinese forces., National Museum of the U.S. Army The aggressive shift in Chinese policy, away from even outward calls for regional and global cooperation with potential opponents such as the United States to more outright competition, is otherwise visible throughout the 2019 defense white paper. Calling out the U.S. government is hardly surprising given the current state of U.S.-China relations, which are at a recent low. The two countries in the midst of a major trade war and they have also seen escalating tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea , among a host of other issues. “The U.S. has adjusted its national security and defense strategies, and adopted unilateral policies,” the Chinese defense policy white paper says. “It has provoked and intensified competition among major countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure, pushed for additional capacity in nuclear, outer space, cyber and missile defense, and undermined global strategic stability.” With all that in mind, the document’s general themes also align with increasingly assertive PLA activity , especially in the South China Sea . China is also pushing ahead with efforts to expand its ability to project power further from its borders in pursuit of becoming a true global power . “Guided by Xi Jinping’s thinking on strengthening the military, China’s national defense in the new era will stride forward along its own path to build a stronger military and endeavor to achieve the great goal of developing world-class forces in an all-round way,” the white paper declares in its closing statements. “China’s armed forces have the determination, confidence and capability to prevail over all threats and challenges. They stand ready to provide strong strategic support for the realization of the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, and to make new and greater contributions to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.” At least for the immediate future, beyond China’s various ongoing high-technology weapons developments, which range from stealth aircraft to railguns to hypersonic missiles , and more , this pursuit of “national rejuvenation” will also include training troops on how to issue and respond to bugle calls on the battlefield.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 11, 2019",South Korea Kicks Off Development Of A New Amphibious Ship Designed To Carry F-35Bs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea is in the early stages of developing a new, larger amphibious assault ship that could support short-takeoff and vertical-landing combat aircraft and plan to launch the ship toward the latter end of the next decade. For more than a year, the South Koreans have been considering a purchase of up to 20 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , which would likely form the core of the air wing onboard this future vessel. South Korea’s decision to acquire the ship, presently known only as Landing Platform Helicopter-II, or LPH-II, reportedly came during a meeting that South Korean Army General Park Han Ki, the Chairman of the country’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, held on July 12, 2019. LPH-II is a reference to the ship being a successor South Korean Navy’s two Dokdo class LPHs . “The plan of building the LPH-II ship has been included in a long-term force buildup plan,” an unnamed spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff told Defense News . “Once a preliminary research is completed within a couple of years, the shipbuilding plan is expected to be included in the midterm acquisition list.” At present, the LPH-II requirements call for a ship that displaces around 30,000 tons, which is twice the displacement of the Dokdos , but still smaller than the U.S. Navy’s Wasp or America class amphibious assault ships. The LPH-II will also be around 820 feet long . If these specifications remain true, the LPH-II will be closer size-wise to Japan’s Izumo class “helicopter destroyers,” Australia’s Canberra class amphibious ships, or various European light carrier and amphibious assault ship designs. Japan’s two Izumo class helicopter destroyers, which each displace around 27,000 tons with a full load., Kyodo via AP South Korea’s planned LPH-II will still be an amphibious assault ship and will have space for up to 3,000 troops and 20 armored vehicles, according to Defense News . It seems very probable that it will have a well deck for launching amphibious vehicles and landing craft, as is the case with the Dokdos . But it will also feature a significantly larger flight deck compared to the Dokdos and a ski jump to increase the takeoff performance and provide an additional margin of safety for short-takeoff aircraft, such as the F-35B. The LPH-II could be able to carry as many as 16 of those jets in its final configuration. A British F-35B takes off from HMS Queen Elizabeth via her ski jump. Queen Elizabeth is a supercarrier that is much larger than South Korea’s planned LPH-II., Crown Copyright The emergence of the LPH-II plan is not particularly surprising. Starting in late 2017, there were reports that South Korea was eying a relatively small purchase of F-35Bs, around 20 aircraft in total, with the expectation that these would operate from the Dokdos. However, those ships are relatively small for this role and it wasn’t immediately apparent how, or if, they could truly conduct sustained F-35B operations, even with a major refit. As it stands now, the Dokdos are configured to carry a complement of around 10 medium to medium-lift helicopters, such as the South Korean Navy’s UH-60P Black Hawks or Westland Lynxes . The first-in-class Dokdo also reportedly has deck space to accommodate one V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, though South Korea has not agreed to buy these aircraft yet. The second Dokdo class ship, Marado , which is undergoing builders trials now ahead of an expected commissioning date in 2020, has a slightly larger flight deck that can handle two V-22s simultaneously. It is worth noting that Marado also has a new Elbit fixed-panel 3D surveillance radar in place of the rotating Thales SMART 3D radar found on Dokdo . The future ROKS Marado ., South Korean Defense Acquisition Program Administration Even with the larger flight deck, Marado ‘s ability to support short takeoff and vertical landing capable fixed-wing combat jets appears to remain limited. There is no word on whether the deck, as well as other infrastructure on the ship, has received the kind of hardening to prevent the F-35B’s powerful and extremely hot exhaust from damaging it, especially during vertical landings. Japan is also in the process of modifying its Izumo class ships to carry the B model Joint Strike Fighter, but also recently acknowledged that these it had designed these ships from the outset to support fixed-wing combat jets. This will help simplify the conversion process in that case. https://youtube.com/watch?v=n-vHoIHhpoE Beyond the need for an expanded and reinforced flight deck, either one of the Dokdo class ships would also likely need additional modifications to ensure it meets other operational and logistics demands, including aviation fuel capacity and space to perform significant maintenance on the aircraft while underway. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are contending with similar issues as they develop “ Lightning Carrier ” concepts of operation for Wasp and America class ships, something The War Zone has examined in detail , even though these ships are substantially larger than the Dokdos . So, if South Korea does intend to purchase the fleet of F-35Bs, it would almost demand the construction of a bigger ship, such as the LPH-II, to support them. An unnamed source told Defense News that South Korean officials are still exploring their options with regard the short takeoff and vertical landing variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. The South Korean Air Force has already taken the delivery of two conventional F-35As out of a planned total fleet of 60 aircraft. The first F-35A for South Korea during a rollout ceremony on 2018., Lockheed Martin “A pilot study on the purchase of F-35Bs is being conducted by a state-funded research institute,” Defense News ‘ source said . “The study results are to be released as early as September.” The two options reportedly under consideration are the substitution of some portion of the existing F-35A order with F-35Bs or just buying 20 B models on top of the 60 A variants. South Korea would have few, if any alternatives avenues to acquire short takeoff and vertical landing capable combat jets if it were to decide against buying F-35Bs. The only other readily available option would be to investigate buying a portion of the U.S. Marine Corps’ AV-8B Harrier fleet that will be slowly phased out over the coming decade. Regardless of how exactly plans for the LPH-II and the F-35B purchase evolve, South Korea has a clear demand for a more robust carrier-like capability. Most pressingly, in any potential conflict with North Korea, South Korean airbases and commercial airports would be prime targets for North Korean ballistic missiles , as well as special operations forces . Runway independent combat jets such as the F-35B, able to operate from the deck of ships such as the LPH-II, as well as dispersed and austere sites on land, including highways and reinforced concrete strips, could be an essential part of any subsequent combat operations. Underscoring this reality, yesterday, news broke that North Korea launched two unspecified short-range ballistic missiles. Based on the information available, it appeared that these might have been a design North Korea first tested in May 2019 , which is similar externally to the Russian Iskander and that the U.S. government now refers to as the KN-23. South Korea’s National Security Council subsequently said that its initial assessment was that two weapons to have been “a new kind of short-range ballistic missile,” but that it was a final assessment would not come until a more in-depth analysis of the information in cooperation with the United States. One of the missiles flew almost 430 miles, which would put much of South Korea within striking distance, and any new designs would only add to the existing and increasingly expansive North Korean ballistic missile arsenal . Beyond North Korea, the geopolitical environment in Northeast Asia, and the Pacific region as a whole, along with South Korea’s place in it, is also evolving. Seoul has increased regional security concerns beyond the Peninsula, including with regards to various territorial disputes involving both China and Japan. The LPH-II could help the South Koreans project more power regionally, including as part of larger coalitions with allies such as the United States, both with its embarked aircraft and amphibious assault forces. This could be particularly important as the Chinese, as well as the Russians, have been stepping up both air and naval activity in the region themselves. China, in particular, is in the process of dramatically expanding its naval capabilities, too, including the construction of multiple aircraft carriers and its own new class of 40,000-ton displacement amphibious assault ships, known as the Type 075 . Just days ago, an unprecedented aerial incident involving South Korea and Russia occurred that underlined the evolving geopolitical character of the region. South Korean fighter jets reportedly fired hundreds of 20mm cannon shells toward a Russian A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft, along with flares, as warning shots after that aircraft flew into the airspace above a contested group of islets in the Sea of Japan. The Japanese government also claims ownership of these islets. Russia, which was conducting its first-ever joint long-distance bomber patrol with China at the time, initially disputed South Korea’s version of events and denied that the A-50 flew into South Korean national airspace above the islets. The Russian Ministry of Defense also said that South Korean jets did not fire any warning shots at the Mainstay or at its Tu-95MS Bear bombers that were also in the same general area. However, South Korean authorities subsequently said that the Kremlin apologized for the incident, saying any intrusion was likely the product of a technical problem with the plane’s navigation equipment. So, while South Korea’s plans for the LPH-II are still years away from coming to fruition, between North Korea and the country’s other emerging regional security demands, it makes perfect sense that the country is getting the process started now so that it will have this important capability available as soon as possible.
