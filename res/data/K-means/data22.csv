By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman has built and tested a new Very Lightweight Torpedo, derived from an earlier U.S. Navy-funded design. The company says it will submit this weapon as an option for that service’s Compact Rapid Attack Weapon program , which is looking to develop a miniature torpedo that can also act as anti-torpedo interceptor and field them first on some Virginia class submarines within the next three to four years. The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor first revealed the weapon , also referred to by the abbreviation VLWT, on May 21, 2020. The firm says this is the first industry-built torpedo of its kind and that it privately funded the development. However, it is based on design documentation for a Common Very Lightweight Torpedo (CVLWT) that Pennsylvania State University’s Applied Research Laboratory (PSU-ARL) had developed for the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and which the service had distributed to defense contractors in 2016. The War Zone had previously written a deep dive into the PSU-ARL design and its potential applications, which you can find here . “The successful testing of the torpedo nose on the first try is a testament to Northrop Grumman’s design-for-affordability approach, which will significantly reduce cost without sacrificing operational performance,” David Portner, the Lead Torpedo Program Manager at Northrop Grumman’s Undersea Systems division, said in a press release. Visually, Northrop Grumman’s VLWT is very similar visually to ARL’s CVLWT design and also uses a Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System (SCEPS) to propel the weapon. The SCEPS in the earlier CVLWT consists of a solid block of lithium that then gets bathed in sulfur hexafluoride gas, which triggers a very energetic chemical reaction. The resulting steam drives a turbine that powers the torpedo’s single screw. SCEPS, which already in use in more traditionally-sized torpedos, is known for being able to rapidly accelerate the weapon compared to other propulsion methods. A Navy briefing slide showing the internal components and describing the various features of the PSU-ARL Common Very Lightweight Torpedo (CVLWT) design., USN “Applying its engineering and manufacturing expertise, Northrop Grumman improved upon the VLWT baseline design to replace high-cost components and drive overall affordability, reproducibility and reliability,” according to the press release. “Those altered sections were built and tested using PSU-ARL’s own test equipment for confidence.” Northrop Grumman has its own extensive experience with torpedos as the primary supplier for the Navy’s Mk 48 heavyweight and Mk 54 lightweight types. The most recent variants of the Mk 48, which are presently the primary anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare torpedo for the service’s submarines, are 21 inches in diameter, 228 inches long, and weigh nearly 3,700 pounds. The CVLWT on which the new VLWT is based is only six and three-quarters inches in diameter, around 85 inches long, and at just around 220 pounds is some 16 times lighter than the Mk 48. Navy personnel maneuver a Mk 48 torpedo., USN The Navy had actually already attempted to field a version of the CVLWT, known as the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT), as part of a “hard-kill” Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System (ATTDS) for high-value surface warships, especially aircraft carriers. The idea of using a physical anti-torpedo interceptor has gained popularity as advanced torpedoes that are increasingly less vulnerable to more traditional countermeasures have entered service around the world. You can read more about these torpedo developments in this recent War Zone explainer . The ATTDS program has unfortunately suffered numerous technical difficulties. The service announced in February 2019 that it would remove the initial systems from five Nimitz class carriers entirely without any immediate replacement. You can read more about that saga in this past War Zone piece . The focus now is on what the Navy refers to as the Compact Rapid Attack Weapon (CRAW). In its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, the service asked for more than $49.5 million across multiple line items to support the development of the CRAW and associated systems, an effort that it described as “new start” as a formal program of record, rather than an experimental project. “CRAW is a very lightweight torpedo that can double as a submarine hard kill countermeasure,” according to the descriptions of the program in the Navy’s budget documents. “This capability will then fulfill the Navy’s requirement for a hard kill countermeasure as outlined in the Submarine Torpedo Defense System Capability Design Document dated in 2008.” USN USN USN USN The Navy’s plans for the 2021 Fiscal Year with regards to CRAW include beginning development of the software and the hardware for the weapon itself, as well as updates for the AN/BYG-1 Submarine Payload Control System and standardized External Countermeasures Launcher (ECL). The AN/BYG-1 is the software-driven combat system that virtually all of the service’s existing submarines, as well as some foreign types, employ to fire torpedos, launch weapons via vertical launch systems, and deploy countermeasures. The ECL is the actual launcher that many American submarines use to deploy existing anti-torpedo countermeasures, which you can read all about in this recent War Zone piece . A table listing existing and planned subvariants of the AN/BYG-1 combat system for various types of American and allied submarines as of 2018., USN The Navy’s plan, as it stands now, is to begin integrating the CRAW onto its Block III and IV Virginia class attack submarines via temporary alterations to their design beginning in the 2024 Fiscal Year, which starts on Oct. 1, 2023. After that, a more permanent set of modifications would be developed and integrated into all Virginia class boats, including the extended-length future Block V types, which will have a new Virginia Payload Module (VPM) with four large-diameter vertical launch tubes. General Dynamic Electric Boat, which designed the Virginia class and is one of two shipbuilders presently making them, will support this effort. A briefing slide showing the basic visual differences between the initial blocks of Virginia class submarines and the Block V with the Virginia Payload Module. The Ohio Replacement SSBN at the bottom has since become dubbed the Columbia class., General Dynamics Electric Boat However, there’s no reason why the Navy would have to limit the fielding of CRAW to those submarines, especially after doing the work to integrate the weapons into the common AN/BYG-1 and ECL architecture. Submarines could carry many more of the mini-torpedoes than existing heavyweight types, such as the Mk 48, by using the ECLs and other potential launch options, including using some form of insert to stabilize the smaller weapons inside normal torpedo tubes or vertical launch system cells. A mixed load of CRAWs and Mk 48s would give the boats greater magazine depth and additional flexibility, especially when it comes to attacking smaller, and potentially unmanned, underwater and surface targets. As a defensive anti-torpedo countermeasure, the system could be especially valuable for protecting the service’s Ohio class ballistic missile submarines , which are at the core of America’s second strike nuclear deterrent capabilities , or the highly specialized and sought after Ohio ‘s that have been converted into guided missile submarines, which support a wide array of conventional strike, special operations support, and intelligence gathering missions. You can read more about these latter boats in this past War Zone feature . CRAW could similarly find its way onto the Navy’s future Columbia class ballistic missile submarines , as well as new attack and large payload submarine classes that it is just starting to explore on a conceptual level. It might be an option for the service’s fleets of large unmanned undersea vehicles , too. The compact torpedo could have more novel uses, as well, including as part of a future naval mine design or as a weapon for smaller surface ships or aircraft, including unmanned types in both instances. Northrop Grumman actually demonstrated how an unmanned helicopter, such as the Navy’s forthcoming MQ-8C Fire Scout , another one of the company’s products, might employ a CRAW during a larger set of experiments in 2016. It’s also interesting to note the parallels between CRAW and the development of compact air-to-air missiles to increase the magazine capacity of fighter jets and that also might be able to shoot down incoming threats. A Bell Model 407 helicopter, standing as a surrogate for an unmanned helicopter, drops an experimental CRAW design during a demonstration in 2016., Northrop Grumman Submarine and anti-submarine warfare have seen a renaissance of sorts within the Navy in recent years, driven in no small part by developments among potential near-peer adversaries. Russia has been working to increase its submarine activity, particularly in the Atlantic , and China continues to expand its submarine fleets . Both countries are building newer and more advanced types , as well. Other, smaller possible American opponents, such as North Korea and Iran , have also been expanding the capabilities of their submarine fleets in recent years. Advanced diesel-electric submarines , including those with very quiet air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems , which make them very hard to detect, have been steadily proliferating around the world , in general, too. The Navy has responded with various efforts to improve its own submarine and anti-submarine warfare capabilities , including CRAW , as well as to develop new and improved tactics, techniques, and procedures to counter existing and future threats . “The nation needs advanced undersea warfare capabilities now more than ever. We are ready to support fielding the VLWT which will increase subsea lethality and enable innovative concepts of operations for multiple warfighting platforms,” Alan Lytle, Northrop Grumman’s Vice President for Undersea Systems, said in the company’s May 21 press release. Northrop Grumman VLWT and the Navy’s overall CRAW program offer the potential for game-changing capabilities for America’s submarines, among other platforms, and look set to become a reality within the next few years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 21, 2020",U.S. Navy Looking To Arm Its Subs With Tiny Torpedoes That Intercept Incoming Torpedoes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tucked away in its most recent budget proposal, the U.S. Navy says that it is interested in giving its submarines the ability to launch small torpedoes. These weapons could offer added offensive firepower, as well as an all-new anti-torpedo defense interceptor capability . The mini-torpedos use a common body and future variants might also arm unmanned ships or submarines , as well as flying drones , act as naval mines, and more. The Navy’s budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year , which came out in February 2019, asks for more than $60 million to support the continued development of the AN/BYG-1 Submarine Payload Control System. Virtually all of the service’s existing submarines use variants of this software-driven combat control architecture to launch weapons and other payloads, via combinations of torpedo tubes, vertical launch systems, or countermeasures launchers, depending on the particular design. The Navy’s future Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines and Block IV and V Virginia -class attack boats, as well as Australia’s future Attack -class , will also use versions of this system. The funding for the 2020 Fiscal Year will go toward continuing work on the Advanced Processing Build 19 (APB19) software upgrade and updates to add other capabilities, known as Technology Insert 20 (TI-20). The Navy also says that the development of APB19 will support the early integration of new payloads, such as the improved anti-ship variant of the Tomahawk land attack cruise missile and improved decoys to confuse and distract incoming torpedoes. Known existing and future variants of the AN/BYG-1 as of August 2018, from a US Navy contracting document. “688i” refers to improved Los Angeles -class attack submarines. The Royal Australian Navy announced that its future attack submarines would be known as the Attack -class in December 2018 ., USN But the budget line also specifically mentions an “Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Compact Rapid Attack Weapons program (ATT CRAW)” as a possible new payload to integrate into the AN/BYG-1’s control systems. When asked, the Navy would not officially confirm that there are fixed plans to add either an Anti-Torpedo Torpedo or a Compact Rapid Attack Weapons capability to its submarines. “At this point in time this effort is pre-decisional,” William Couch, a spokesperson for Naval Sea Systems Command, told The War Zone by Email. “We are investigating options to transition efforts that were executed under the ATTDS [Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System] Program and other RDT&E [Research, Development, Test and Evaluation] efforts in support of the Compact Rapid Attack Weapons.” For more than a decade now, the Navy has been working on what it has referred to in the past as the Common Very Lightweight Torpedo (CVLWT). The core of the CVLWT is a “chassis” that can accommodate warheads, guidance packages, and other systems optimized for certain roles. An overview of the Common Very Lightweight Torpedo chassis and various typical internal components., USN The mini-torpedo has a Stored Chemical Energy Power Systems (SCEPS) power system for its propulsor in the rear. SCEPS works by bathing a solid block of lithium in sulfur hexafluoride gas, creating an extremely energetic chemical reaction that, in turn, produces steam to drive a turbine engine. In use in torpedoes for years already, this helps make the smaller CVLWT accelerate very fast, reaching fifty percent of its unspecified top speed in less than 12 seconds on average. At six and three-quarters inches in diameter and approximately 85 inches long, the CVLWT is significantly smaller than the latest variants of the Navy’s Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo , which is the standard weapon of this type for its submarines now. The Mk 48s are around 21 inches in diameter and 228 inches long. The mini torpedo’s typical weight, around 220 pounds, is also more than 16 times lighter than its heavyweight counterpart. So we are truly talking about a tiny torpedo here. US Navy personnel move a Mk 48 torpedo., USN The Navy has already developed multiple variants of the CVLWT, the best known of which is the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT), also called the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT). This is a defensive “hard-kill” interceptor that is supposed to destroy incoming torpedoes by either slamming into them or destroying them with its explosive warhead. The interceptor also features a sonar seeker capable of operating in active and passive modes, together with a guidance package that also includes an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU). The IMU provides data that allows the torpedo to make more precise movements, making it more maneuverable and improving its accuracy. A diagram showing the general arrangement of the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) variant of the CVLWT., USN The Compact Rapid Attack Weapon (CRAW) has much of the same hardware, the bulk of which consists of Commercial Off-The-Shelf components to help keep production costs and maintenance requirements low, according to public Navy briefings and other documentation , but is optimized as an offensive weapon against other submarines. Both variants could offer important capabilities for various American submarines. At present, American submarines use a combination of electronic warfare jammers and acoustic decoys to defeat incoming torpedoes. This works well against threats that use active and passive sonar to home in on their targets. More advanced torpedoes, however, which feature sensors to detect differences in water density to zero in on the wake a ship or submarine churns up as it moves, are immune to acoustic decoys and are jamming resistant. These wake-homing torpedoes have been a major impetus for the Navy to develop a hard-kill anti-torpedo interceptor in general, especially for high-value ships, such as aircraft carriers. In recent years, concerns about existing and future torpedo threats have similarly led to a push to add a torpedo interceptor capability to submarines, according to The War Zone’s trusted sources. But the anti-torpedo torpedo concept remains very much in development. In September 2018, the Navy formally halted work on the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System (ATTDS) for surface ships. The service had already installed examples of this system on five Nimitz -class aircraft carriers and is now removing all of them. A Nimitz-class aircraft carrier fires a CAT interceptor during a test., USN So far, the biggest problem for the ATTDS has been creating a kill-chain short enough for the interceptor to be effective. The system needs to spot and classify the threat and then cue the anti-torpedo torpedo in a very short amount of time. The small size of the interceptor means that even if it employs its explosive warhead, rather than functioning in a hit-to-kill mode, it still has to get relatively close to the target to be effective. In addition, at least some existing wake-homing torpedoes already employ tactics that could throw off interceptors. The latest variants of the Russian Type 53 series zig-zag toward their target in their terminal phase, making them harder to track or target. A Soviet-era Type 53-65K torpedo, one of the first variants of this design to feature a wake-homing capability., BrokenSphere via Wikimedia This doesn’t mean that the Navy couldn’t still add an anti-torpedo interceptor capability to its submarines in the future. As noted, the service says it is still considering doing just that and there is clearly a requirement for this kind of defensive system. But this is also where the CRAW comes in. As an offensive weapon, the mini-torpedo could give submarines added magazine depth and additional flexibility, especially to engage smaller targets, such as unmanned surface or underwater vehicles. A briefing slide showing a Compact Rapid Attack Weapon using the same “chassis” as the anti-torpedo torpedo (ATT)., USN Based on the physical dimensions of the CVLWT chassis, submarines could potentially carry at least four of these weapons in the same space allocated to a single Mk 48. The boat’s crew also wouldn’t have to expend one of those heavyweight weapons in order to attack a smaller target. The smaller CRAW would still likely need something to stabilize it inside a U.S. submarine’s standard 21- or 26-inch torpedo tubes. It might be possible to develop a system that personnel could readily install and remove, as necessary, or to permanently modify a portion of the tubes specifically for the mini-torpedoes. Another possibility might be a discarding frame that keeps the torpedo aligned in the tube and breaks off after launch, similar to high-velocity armor-piercing tank shells that use a sabot to stabilize a sub-caliber kinetic penetrator in the barrel. But this added bulk might limit the overall space-saving qualities of the mini-torpedo. A view of the torpedo room on the Los Angeles -class attack submarine USS Olympia , showing how cramped it is even with the Mk 48 torpedoes stowed in place., USN The Navy could pack larger vertical launch tubes full of the mini-torpedoes, too. The up-coming Block V Virginia -class attack submarines will have each have a Virginia Payload Module (VPM) with four launch tubes that are 87-inches in diameter and deep enough to accommodate a 246-inch long Tomahawk cruise missile with a booster rocket motor. The standard loadout the Navy envisions is six Tomahawks in each of the VPM’s four tubes. Substituting even one of these for a cluster of CRAWs could significantly increase the boat’s magazine depth for anti-submarine or anti-surface operations. This could be particularly valuable for engaging swarms of enemy unmanned surface vessels or underwater drones in the future. A single submarine could also launch a flurry of the mini-torpedoes at a single surface or sub-surface target, which would help overwhelm its defenses. The attacker could layer the attack with smaller weapons and a standard heavyweight torpedo, as well. A schematic of the Virginia Payload Module for the future Block V Virginia -class submarines., USN In addition, the Navy has noted that the CVLWT chassis may be compact enough to fit inside the launchers that submarines use presently to fire countermeasure decoys. Depending on the commonality between the anti-torpedo interceptor and offensive variants, this could enable subs to carry additional multi-purpose mini-torpedoes without having to trade out more standard torpedoes or missiles. The size of the CVLWT opens up the possibility of more novel employment, as well. From the very beginning, the Navy has been interested in arming unmanned helicopters and underwater drones with these mini-torpedoes. During the service’s Annual Naval Technology Exercise (ANTX) in 2016, Northrop Grumman demonstrated how an unmanned helicopter might employ a CRAW autonomously against a hostile submarine using targeting data from multiple offboard sources. A helicopter acting as a surrogate for an unmanned aircraft drops a CRAW during ANTX 2016., Northrop Grumman More recently, in February 2019, the Navy hired Boeing to build four extra-large Orca drone submarines, a stepping stone that could lead to improved designs capable of carrying out anti-submarine or anti-surface warfare missions using weapons such as the CRAW. You can read more about those efforts in detail here . A briefing slide showing Navy plans for various size categories of unmanned underwater vehicles. The long-term plans for the large and extra-large categories both include anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities., USN There’s the possibility that the Navy could use the CRAW as the basis for an underwater mine, too. The service already employs Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM), which contains a Mk 48 torpedo and anchors itself to the seabed after getting shot out of a torpedo tube. It then uses a passive sonar system to detect passing ships or submarines and then fires its homing torpedo at them. A rendering of a notional naval mine similar to the Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mine, but employing mini-torpedoes instead of a full-size Mk 48. The gray system to the right is a separate concept for a torpedo-tube-launched “hunter” that would deploy unattended acoustic or other sensors on the seabed., USN A smaller mine using the CRAW could be harder to detect and make it easier to rapidly lay larger minefields. A variant of the existing SLMM could potentially carry multiple mini-torpedoes and engage multiple targets, as well. Since the CVLWT chassis offers significant scalability for a wide array of launch platforms, the Navy would have the option of combining some of these systems together in the future, as well. The service is already looking at developing new Large Payload Submarines that could serve as motherships for large underwater drones. Such a submarine could potentially deploy its own swarm of unmanned underwater vehicles armed with these mini-torpedoes. With that common frame, the Navy might find it easier to integrate additional variants of the mini-torpedo down the road. Though the service appears to be focusing more on the CRAW version now, it could leverage that work to add an anti-torpedo interceptor capability in tandem to it as the technology necessary for that defensive system matures. Sailors load a Mk 48 torpedo onto the Los Angeles -class attack submarine USS Topeka ., USN Integrating payloads based on the CVLWT with the AN/BYG-1 could also help attract interest from American allies, which could help defray the costs of continued research and development of various mini-torpedos and related systems. As noted, the Australians are already set to use this control system on their Attack -class submarines, which could also just improve their ability to work together and potentially share data with American submarines and other U.S. assets during combined operations in the future. In addition, the added magazine depth that the mini-torpedoes afford could be especially pronounced for smaller submarines that many American partners operate. The Navy says it has yet to make a final, formal decision on adding mini-torpedoes to its submarines, or any other potential launch platforms, but it is still certainly working that direction. This is also only what the Navy will say publicly and the service could be further along on this project, or in the development of related capabilities, in the classified realm . We know the upgrade work on the AN/BYG-1 control system that is going on right now and that it wants to continue with that work into next year. The inherently multi-purpose nature of the mini-torpedoes could transform the Navy’s undersea warfare operating concepts and being able to rapidly intercept a torpedo with another torpedo would be a game changer for American submarines. This revolutionary capability could very well be on its way to becoming a reality in the next few years. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a year after a pair of 30mm Bushmaster II cannons were installed on the U.S. Navy’s first-in-class USS Zumwalt , the ship has fired the weapons for the first time in a test. These guns, fitted instead of two larger 57mm guns, are one of a number of controversial changes to the stealth destroyer’s design over the years. Zumwalt conducted what the Navy described as a “ structural test fire ” of the two Mk 46 Mod 2 Gun Weapon Systems (GWS), which are mounted on top of the ship’s helicopter hangar toward the stern, at the Naval Air Weapons Center Weapons Division Sea Test Range off Point Mugu, California on May 16, 2020. Pictures first appeared of the Mk 46s installed on the destroyer in February 2019, which The War Zone was first to report . “The privilege of being a ‘first-in-class’ ship includes having the opportunity to systematically conduct testing across the breadth of systems installed onboard the ship,” Navy Captain Andrew Carlson, the Zumwalt ’s commanding officer, said in a statement. “The real plus is conducting those tests, such as today’s live fire with the Mark 46 GWS, which provide tangible evidence of combat capability maturation.” Zumwalt fires one of her Mk 46s during the May 16 test., USN Zumwalt spotted in San Diego with her Mk 46s installed in February 2019., MrWasabi Each Mk 46 Mod 2 is a remotely-operated turret containing a single 30mm Mk 44 Bushmaster II automatic cannon. The operators use control consoles within the ship to aim the weapon by way of visual, low-light-level, and infrared video cameras, as well as a built-in laser rangefinder, inside the turret. These gun systems, versions of which are found on San Antonio class landing platform docks and Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) equipped with the Surface Warfare Mission Package , are intended primarily for close-in defense against smaller surface threats, such as small boat swarms . “Today’s event is the first in a chapter of live fire test events over the next year that will prove the lethal capability that these ships will bring to the fight,” Navy Lieutenant Commander Tim Kubisak, the Zumwalt Test Officer for the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems, who was present for the live-fire test, said in a statement. However, this is a chapter that has been a long time coming at best and at worst it is a reflection of the watered-down combat capabilities of what is arguably the service’s most advanced surface combatant, something you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . This particular test event wasn’t even intended to gauge the effectiveness of the cannons against simulated threats, but merely to make sure that firing them didn’t damage the mounts, sensors, or other electronic systems or any other adjacent parts of the ship. The USS Zumwalt pulls into Pearl Harbor in Hawaii., USN The 30mm cannons themselves have been a source of controversy. In 2012, the Navy decided to install them in lieu of a pair of larger 57mm Mk 110 guns, arguing that the Mk 46 GWS was actually a more effective weapon for the intended role. This was despite the fact that the Mk 110 gun has a higher rate of fire and greater range than Mk 44 cannon in the Mk 46 GWS. The 57mm weapons also have a wide set of ammunition options, including programmable rounds with an airburst mode and “smart” shells, which enables to them to engage a broader array of potential targets, including some aerial threats. A Mk 110 gun in the turret on the bow of the first-in-class Littoral Combat Ship USS Freedom ., USN Regardless of whether or not the Navy made an accurate assessment of the Mk 46 GWS’s capabilities, the smaller guns definitely come in a package that is decidedly less stealthy than the fully encapsulated mounts that were to have held the Mk 110s. These mounts would have been similar in broad respects to how the Mk 110 is installed on the bow of Sweden’s Visby class corvettes . The arrangement would have allowed the barrels to be stowed completely inside the turret when the guns were not in use, helping to keep the Zumwalt as stealthy as possible. Other features added over the years have also degraded the ship’s stealthy qualities. The turret for the 57mm Mk 110 gun on a Swedish Visby class corvette. The proposed Mk 110 mounts of the Zumwalt class destroyers would have been similar., Poxnar/Wikicommons At present, the 30mm cannons are also the Zumwalt ‘s only usable large-caliber guns. In 2016, the Navy canceled plans to buy any of the special Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP) that were to go along with the ship’s pair of 155mm main guns, which are installed inside stealthy fully encapsulated turrets. This decision came after the cost of each LRLAP round ballooned to an exorbitant $800,000 . The service is exploring other possible ammunition types to actually make these guns operational, but, for the foreseeable future, they’re effectively dead weight. The Zumwalt also has 80 Mk 57 vertical launch system cells, which can accommodate various weapons, including quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) and Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles . The Zumwalt ‘s combat capability has long been a point of contention, in general. The Navy commissioned the ship in 2016 and had agreed to take delivery of it from shipbuilder Bath Iron Works that year with many of its systems, such as the Mk 46s, only partially installed, if they were at all. Congress interceded by passing a law making it illegal for the service to accept delivery of the ship until its combat systems were officially activated. In the end, the Navy only formally received the ship in April , despite having been operating in a limited fashion for four years now. By every indication, in its final form, the Zumwalt, as well as its two sister ships, the USS Michael Monsoor and the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , will still be extremely advanced and capable ships . However, years of cost-cutting measures and other controversial decisions, including truncating the class to just three ships, down from the originally planned fleet of 32, are likely to keep the ships acting primarily as testbeds for new systems and tactics, techniques, and procedures over the course of their service lives. Zumwalt and Michael Monsoor are already assigned to a developmental unit, Surface Development Squadron 1 , that the Navy stood up last year. The Lyndon B. Johnson is set to join them after its commissioning, which was originally supposed to occur in 2017. The ships are likely to find themselves attached to other forces for actual deployments, but the extent of those operational activities remains to be seen. It will difficult for the trio to make persistent contributions. It is certainly good to see progress being made on getting Zumwalt ‘s weapon systems to an operational state, but it comes years after the stealth destroyer was supposed to fully enter service and shows that the ship still needs significant work to get anywhere near to reaching its full potential.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 21, 2020",F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Jets Just Flew A Mission Off The Southern California Coast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 Nighthawk was officially retired 12 years ago. A quiet period immediately followed, but within a few years, it became apparent that a handful of the stealth jets were still being flown. Since then, the increasingly active pocket force F-117 and has apparently taken on the low-observable (stealthy) aggressor role, at least to a limited degree, for training purposes, while also executing its secretive test and development support duties . These tasks have seen the still flyable F-117s stray increasingly from their home at the shadowy Tonopah Test Range Airport in desolate Southern Nevada. In recent years, they have been flying over the Mojave Desert, which has resulted in unique fanfare among the aviation enthusiast community. Now it is clear that they are flying missions out to sea, over America’s vast range complexes off the Southern California coast. Matthew P., a plane tracker and radio communications aficionado, picked up on the unique mission before getting the surprise that F-117s were indeed involved. Matthew tells The War Zone : “At about 10:30am on May 18th, 2020, my scanners were running and I just happened to be looking at ADS-B when I noticed an Edwards-based NKC-135 heading south over the Angeles National Forest. It was not showing any callsign. Moments later, I heard some chatter on an air refueling frequency between three aircraft. The tanker being GHOST27 and the receivers were KNIGHT01 and KNIGHT02. The communications were just some basic chatter about intentions while they were in formation heading right over populated areas north of Los Angeles County. Initially, I had a feeling I was listening to the “retired” F-117s based off of previous sightings from other folks because they too used the callsign KNIGHT or LEHI. I had mixed thoughts because why would they fly F-117s right over one of the most populated cities and risk being seen? That is until I stepped outside and realized it was completely overcast. Sure enough, Satellite imagery showed much of Southern California was socked in at the time. As they reached their work area over the ocean, it seemed they checked in with an E-2 Hawkeye callsign EAGLE31 while their tanker GHOST27 started a racetrack pattern for refueling. At this point, I still wasn’t sure for sure what I was hearing until GHOST and KNIGHT left the offshore W-291 range heading northbound back to the R-2508 complex, and then it became dead obvious who KNIGHT was. Their tanker GHOST27 handed them weather for Tonopah Test Range and it sounded like the winds were debatable out there and they might have to attempt to land and divert to Edwards AFB if they couldn’t make it down. Overall this was pretty interesting to say the very least and it’s something I don’t think I’ll ever forget.” The route of the Edwards AFB-based test NKC-135R tanker and the pair of F-117s. , Screenshot from ADS-B Exchange via Matthew P.

It isn’t clear exactly what the F-117s were doing out there, but the E-2D Hawkeye is the most advanced airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) platform in the world. It has amazing capabilities, which include the ability to detect and track aircraft with small radar cross-sections and to fuse radar data from various ships and aircraft and rebroadcast that information. As such, testing and validating the E-2D’s systems against the F-117s would be highly beneficial, as would training against it. Navy Super Hornets directed by the Hawkeye, as well as naval ships toting extremely powerful radar systems, could also put their sensors, data-links, and training to work cooperatively against such an elusive target. Interestingly, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is out there right now executing a COMPUTEX (Composite Training Unit Exercise) . It’s the most challenging integrated training evolution a carrier strike group undertakes before a deployment. All this together adds more to the evidence that these aircraft are flying at least partially in the adversary support role now. E-2D touching down on the carrier. , USN On the test and tactics development end, most notably, Navy Super Hornets will soon receive infra-red search and track (IRST) sensors that are uniquely suited for spotting stealthy aircraft. That system is currently in testing. We have long speculated that the F-117s are being used to test very similar IRST systems currently being developed by the Air Force . So, it makes sense that they would do the same for the Navy. The Navy has cutting-edge sensors on San Clemente Island that are used for range control and development. Testing them against the F-117 could also be valuable. Individual Navys ships work in the area around the island, as well. They could also benefit from the F-117’s unique radar signature. With all this in mind, there are plenty of reasons for the F-117s to go play with the Navy off the SoCal coast with a test tanker nearby. A look at the airspace off Southern California, including the W-291E range that surrounds the Navy’s testing facilities on San Clemente Island. , FAA Even as the vast majority of the roughly 50 “Black Jets” that still exist sit partially disassembled in the same hangars that they occupied during their top secret operational years the better part of four decades ago, it’s amazing to think that a few of their stablemates are out there playing the bad guy against America’s front-line weapon systems so long after their introduction to service and their subsequent retirement. Eventually, the F-35 will enter into the adversary support role , but still it won’t have the reduced infrared signature that its predecessor had, nor the same unique stealth characteristics. As it sits now, the F-117s are still mandated by law to be destroyed over the current decade, with less than a quarter of the remaining jets slated to go to museums . So, while the end seems to be finally on the horizon for the elusive Nighthawk, clearly, they are literally not going out without a fight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2020",Pentagon’s Top R&D Chief Throws Cold Water On Laser Missile Defense Aspirations,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s top official in charge of overseeing advanced research and development activities has said he does not believe it is feasible, at least at present, for an aircraft to carry a laser that would be sufficiently powerful to shoot down “an adversary missile.” Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin appeared to be speaking about ongoing work on drones equipped with laser directed energy weapons for ballistic missile defense, raising questions about whether those efforts have hit significant hurdles. Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone Steve Trimble posted the comments from Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin on Twitter on May 20, 2020. Griffin had disclosed these details at the Washington Space Business Roundtable, which is being held this year via a remote video conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “As a weapon system to equip an airplane with the lasers we think necessary in terms of their power level …and get them to altitudes where atmospheric turbulence can be mitigated appropriately, that combination of things can’t go on one platform,” Griffin said. “I’m extremely skeptical that we can put a large laser on an aircraft and use it to shoot down an adversary missile even from very close.” What Griffin is talking about here is how laser beams inherently become more diffuse as they extend further from their source, as the light particles pass through the elements of the atmosphere and otherwise getting beaten about by other environmental factors, such as turbulence in the air, all of which reduces their power and accuracy. Increasing the power and otherwise focusing the beam, such as adaptive optics , as well as simply employing the system at higher altitudes where the air is thinner, can help mitigate these issues. Unfortunately, in turn, this generally increases the size and power requirements of the overall system. There have been significant developments in miniaturizing solid-state lasers for years now, resulting in experimental weapon systems that are compact enough for aircraft and helicopters or for small ground vehicles to carry. These have shown themselves to be capable of shooting down small drones , rockets, and missiles . Shooting down a ballistic missile, especially larger intermediate or intercontinental range types, is a much different affair. In the 1990s and the 2000s, the Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) notably tested a laser-armed Boeing 747 airliner known as the YAL-1 , which cost billions to develop and was canceled in 2011 after the Pentagon determined it could only knock down ballistic missiles at extremely close ranges during the initial boost phase of flight. During that stage of flight, the missile is moving slowest and its rocket motors are burning brightly, making it easier to detect and track and more vulnerable to attack. However, at that point, it is also likely flying over an enemy’s own heavily defended territory, making it difficult to get close to it. However, the YAL-1 Airborne Laser system employed a massive chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL). MDA has been working on an unmanned successor to the YAL-1 for boost-phase missile defense using a more advanced and far more compact solid-state laser weapon since 2015. Two years later, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and General Atomics got their first contracts to develop Low Power Laser Demonstrators (LPLD) to explore the feasibility of the concept. MDA gave Lockheed Martin $30 million and Boeing and General Atomics each $29 million in additional funds to perform critical design reviews of the beam control systems in their respective designs in March 2019 . Griffin is now saying that, at least so far, and possibly based on data from those and other design reviews, a more advanced airborne solid-state laser weapon that is viable for missile defense still remains elusive. These comments are especially notable coming from Griffin who has been an outspoken advocate for directed energy weapons development, even including notoriously complex particle beam systems , for decades. This traces back to his work on the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) missile defense effort, better known by the nickname “Star Wars.” “We should not lose our way as we come out of the slough of despondence in directed energy into an environment that is more welcoming of our contributions,” the Undersecretary had said in remarks at the 2018 Directed Energy Summit in Washington, D.C. “We should not lose our way with some of the other technologies that were pioneered in the ’80s and early-’90s and now stand available for renewed effort.” An artist’s conception of a space-based particle beam missile defense system from the Star Wars era., Los Alamos National Laboratory via Aerospace Projects Review It’s also interesting to note that Griffin had announced that the Pentagon was putting its plans for a space-based particle beam weapon on hold in September 2019. He specifically said that this decision would allow for the refocusing of funding for that project to support other work on lasers. The idea of using laser directed energy weapons for ballistic missile defense is unlikely to go away completely, either. A space-based system, something that MDA has also been exploring , would have few, if any of the issues that ground-based or airborne designs face when operating within the Earth’s atmosphere. France also has plans for satellites carrying laser weapons to defend other assets in space against potential threats, further indicating that there is a broader view that these kinds of systems in orbit would be technically capable of providing useful capabilities, at least in principle. “Directed energy weapons (high energy lasers or particle beam) or space-based interceptors provide the best overall hope of a hard kill” against future hypersonic weapon threats , as well, according to a March 2020 report from the NATO Science & Technology Organization. “These systems will need to be refined and be made operational, within the appropriate policy and legal constraints, if effective defensive countermeasures are to be deployed over the next ten years.” It’s possible that the lasers that MDA has been development so far might still have some value when combined with a penetrating unmanned aerial vehicle that can more readily get close to a launch site and in certain specific situations, including against launches of only a small number of missiles by a rogue state, such as Iran or North Korea. This would still be a capability with only limited applications. Griffin may just be speaking about the present state of the applicable technologies, or he may even be being deliberately misleading to confuse America’s opponents, as well. There is always the potential that advances in the future could make the idea of an airborne laser ballistic missile defense system more practical broadly, just as improvements in solid-state designs have made them viable short-range defense systems against various small aerial threats, as well as artillery rockets and smaller missiles. Whatever the case, Griffin has raised some clear concerns about the value of MDA’s current work on airborne laser missile defense, at least in the near time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2020",Foreign Special Operations Gunships Train On The Navy’s Huge Sea Base In The Persian Gulf,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s expeditionary sea base USS Lewis B. Puller recently hosted UH-60M Black Hawk and CH-47F Chinook helicopters from the United Arab Emirates’ Special Operations Command for training in the Persian Gulf. The event highlighted how the already extremely versatile ship could support coalition operations in the region with U.S. allies and partners, as well as with other branches of the U.S. military . At least two UH-60Ms and one CH-47F from the UAE’s Air Force’s Group 18 took part in the deck landing qualification (DLQ) training , which took place at the southern end of the Persian Gulf between May 11 and 12, 2020. The helicopters practiced landing and taking off from Puller during the day and at night, as well as refueling onboard the ship. Group 18 is a dedicated special operations aviation unit primarily equipped with helicopters that akin in some broad respects to the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment . The UAE unit also operates fixed wing light attack and utility aircraft. It’s helicopter fleets, which also include AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, have been particularly heavily committed in recent years to operations in Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, as part of the Saudi Arabian-led coalition, and Al Qaeda’s franchise in that country, an effort it conducts in cooperation with the United States. Though the CH-47F appeared to be unarmed in this case, the UH-60Ms that participated in this recent exercise were notably configured as heavily armed gunships with 70mm rocket pods, launch rails for Hellfire missiles , and .50 caliber GAU-19/B rotary-barrel machine guns hanging from their stub wings, as well as 7.62mm Miniguns mounted in their crew chief windows. This is similar to the configuration the 160th uses for its MH-60 Direct Action Penetrators (DAP). One of the UAE UH-60Ms prepares to land on the USS Lewis B. Puller. , USN USN A UAE CH-47F approaches the Puller ., USN USN The UAE UH-60Ms also have a sensor turret under the nose, which contains visual and infrared full-motion video cameras and a laser designator, as well as boxy filters in front of their engine intakes to keep out sand and other particulate matter during extended operations in the region’s deserts. “DLQs expand interoperability between [the] U.S. Navy and UAE military, making both forces more proficient and able to respond to regional challenges,” Navy Captain Michael Mosbruger, Puller ‘s commanding officer, said in a statement. “This series of training evolutions continues to enhance the readiness of UAE pilots and familiarizes the crew of the Puller with UAE rotary-wing platform[s], by increasing partnership capability and interoperability in the maritime domain,” a Navy news release added. Puller , which is permanently forward-deployed to the Middle East, has the primary mission of supporting minesweeping operations – a very real potential need given the use of mines by Iran and its regional proxies – by serving as a base for the Navy’s massive MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters . However, it’s large open flight deck and readily reconfigurable spaces below make it a decidedly multi-purpose platform that can support a wide variety of Navy helicopters, as well as those from the Army and Marines , along with the latter service’s Osprey tilt-rotors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pkTAtKUvJzw Just earlier this year, Army AH-64s trained on Puller , in cooperation with other Navy and Coast Guard vessels, in the Persian Gulf. At one point during that exercise, which ran between March and April, 11 small Iranian boats harassed the flotilla , coming dangerously close to multiple American ships in the process. Small boat swarms are a potential threat that the Apaches, flying from the sea base’s deck, would be ideally suited to help defeat. This is also a threat that the UAE’s armed helicopters, flying from Puller , could respond to as part of a larger coalition effort with the United States during a crisis in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere in the Middle East. Group 18’s helicopters could also join American special operations forces, as well as conventional units, in conducting raids or other expeditionary operations in any of the region’s littoral areas, such as islands in the Persian Gulf or the coasts of Yemen . Search and rescue and casualty evacuation would also be among the potential mission sets. Of course, this is hardly the first time that Group 18’s helicopters have trained with American ships in the Middle East. The UAE special operations aviation unit conducted similar exercises with Puller ‘s immediate predecessor, the interim sea base USS Ponce , which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . “UAE pilots have extensive flight experience and have previously performed landings and routine flight operations on the Puller and other U.S. naval assets deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations,” the Navy also noted in its news release regarding the latest exercise. The USS Lewis B. Puller has already been a unique force multiplier for U.S. forces in the Middle East for years now. This recent exercise underscores how America’s friends could leverage its capabilities during a crisis or contingency in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2020",USAF Plans For Its “Skyborg” AI Computer Brain To Be Flying Drones In The Next Two Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is working on an artificial intelligence “computer brain,” dubbed Skyborg, that it hopes will be able to autonomously operate a prototype “ loyal wingman ” drone, such as the Kratos XQ-58A , by 2021 and be able to fly an actual “fighter-like aircraft” two years after that. The larger goal is to integrate this system into various unmanned planes in the future and eventually turn it into a digital co-pilot to help human aviators in manned platforms. On Mar. 20, 2019, Aviation Week was first to report the projected timeline for developing Skyborg and the first prototype aircraft equipped with the system. The Air Force Research Laboratory had issued a formal request for information to determine what technologies might be available already, or close to available, to support Skyborg, on Mar. 15, 2019 . Two days before that, Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, had publicly disclosed the program for the first time at a conference consulting firm McAleese and Associates and bank Credit Suisse had sponsored in Washington, D.C. “Skyborg will directly support the initiatives outlined in the 2018 USAF Artificial Intelligence Strategy and the 2019 Executive Order of Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI) while filling an immediate operational need,” the Air Force Research Laboratory’s contracting notice explained . “The primary goal of the Skyborg program is to deploy a modular, fighter-like aircraft that can be used to quickly update and field iteratively more complex autonomy to support the warfighter.” First and foremost, Skyborg is about developing an AI system that can fly an unmanned aircraft with minimal, if any human interaction. The Air Force is also adamant that they want it to use a software that is “modular” and “open architecture” so that it can rapidly add new “complex autonomous behaviors” into this advanced computer brain in the future. “I expect the first things that we’ll do will not appear as sexy as what you might imagine in a movie, but will be completely game-changing,” Roper explained at the conference on Mar. 13, 2019. He did not elaborate, but one of the immediate benefits of an AI or AI-enabled system is the increased speed of decision-making. At first, a drone with Skyborg might not necessarily do anything a manned aircraft can’t do already, but it will be able to perform those tasks, such as aerial combat maneuvers or weapons employment, faster based on its set parameters. Where a human might be distracted or confused by the chaos of an aerial engagement, an autonomous unmanned aircraft would simply act. The drone would be able to make its decision quickly, but also based on an immense amount of situational data that would take an actual pilot much longer to process. This alone is a major leap in capability and would serve as a jumping off point for the development of more advanced capabilities going forward, which you can read about in more depth here . The Air Force also has a “critical” requirement for at the least initial prototype drone design to be “attritable.” The service is keen to make clear that this term doesn’t mean “expendable,” but does describe a design that is low cost enough for commanders to more readily consider sacrificing it on the battlefield if necessary. The Air Force’s publicly announced critical requirements for the Skyborg program as of March 2019., USAF If the drone could already have a terrain avoidance and all-weather flight capability, be able to take off and land on autonomously, and feature modular payload bays for sensors and other systems, the Air Force Research Laboratory says this is “highly-desired,” though not essential, at least at the beginning. Lastly, the Air Force says it is “desired” that the Skyborg systems and associated aircraft be still be easy to use even for personnel who have limited or no engineering or pilot background if at all possible. These latter requirements seem very focused on the Air Force’s desire to rapidly transition Skyborg from an experiment into an operational capability. This is something that Assistant Secretary Roper stressed in his earlier remarks. Non-critical requirements for Skyborg., USAF “I don’t want this to just be a laboratory project that lives and dies there in a petri dish. I want this to become a program,” he explained . “I want to see real, operational demonstrations within a couple years. And I will push them to be faster than that.” This also strongly suggests the Air Force will be inclined to use a platform already in development, or even operational, to host the first iterations of Skyborg. Roper did not say whether the service had a specific platform it was focusing on, but did mention the possibility of putting the AI into target drones such as the QF-16 or BQM-167 . In 2016,  drone maker Kratos demonstrated its Unmanned Tactical Aerial Platform-22 ( UTAP-22 ), also known as the Mako, an evolution of the BQM-167,  in the loyal wingman role together with a manned U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet. The Air Force has also previously employed modified, unmanned F-16s in tests of the loyal wingman concept , known as Have Raider and Have Raider II, in 2015 and 2017 respectively. All of these experiments could help further inform the Skyborg program’s requirements. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lcP66syzQls He also mentioned the possibility of pairing Skyborg with Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie , which just flew for the first time earlier this month, as seen in the video at the beginning of this piece. The design already meets the critical attritable requirement and AFRL is already working on it as part of its Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program, which would make it attractive starting place. The Air Force is interested in the XQ-58A and LCAAT as stepping stone to an operational and cost-effective surveillance, strike, and electronic warfare platform. These drones could operate singularly, as part of a networked, autonomous swarm, or in groups of loyal wingmen in cooperation with manned aircraft, revolutionizing how the Air Force operates. An overview of the Air Force’s LCAAT program., USAF An AI system such as Skyborg that has the ability to grow and evolve over time is almost a requirement for the XQ-58A, and any future “fighter-like” unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) designs, to carry out any of these mission sets most effectively as the new threats and challenges emerge. There may also be a benefit to integrating the system into manned aircraft, offering a sort of virtual co-pilot to reduce the burdens on human aviators. “I might eventually decide, ‘I want that AI in my own cockpit,’” Assistant Secretary Roper said at the Washington, D.C. conference. “So, if something happened immediately, [Skyborg] could take hold, make choices in a way that [a pilot would] know because [a pilot has] trained with it.” Again, the benefit that Skyborg would bring the table first would be its ability to make those decisions faster and incorporate amounts of information that would overwhelm a real pilot to help make the best choice possible. It could also simply spit back a menu of possible options for an aviator to rapidly choose between. In March 2018, the Air Force Research Laboratory announced the Air Force 2030 initiative and released a video presentation highlighting various technologies the service might implement in the future. It included this sequence where a pilot in an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter appears to engage with a virtual co-pilot with working together with loyal wingmen drones., USAF capture It could potentially provide revolutionary improvements in survivability and safety. Skyborg could help manned aircraft avoid or evade enemy defenses and taking over for a pilot suffering from hypoxia or wounds from enemy fire. Tapped into an aircraft’s own computerized diagnostics systems, it could immediately identify faults and either look to correct them or alert the pilot to the issue. The importance of speed of response in in-flight emergencies has already led to the development of the science of what is known as “ crew resource management ,” which involves methods of streamlining communication and troubleshooting at critical moments. There’s a major value in just being able to shunt a host of relatively minor, routine tasks in flight to a robust AI-driven system, too. This would help reduce fatigue, which, in turn, could lessen the chance of tired aviators making simple, but serious mistakes. The U.S. Army, in cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is already pursuing a similar effort, known as the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System ( ALIAS ), to develop autonomous flight systems for its helicopters. In February 2019, the Pentagon kicked off a U.S. military-wide push to further integrate AI and machine learning into a host of operational and other activities. The Army and DARPA are already experimenting with this modified Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, which features a semi-autonomous “co-pilot.” , Sikorsky The Air Force will spend much of Skyborg’s initial phases figuring out exactly what the first generation of the AI can and can’t do and then building out from there. “Before operational AI innovation can occur, the USAF must field an autonomous system that meets an immediate operational need and can serve as an iterative platform to jumpstart complex AI development, prototyping, experimentation, and fielding,” AFRL’s contracting announcement notes . The hope is that the rapid prototyping and development of actual flying drones with the system on board in the next few years will speed up the process. “I think once we have it out in the operators’ hands, it opens up new opportunities,” Assistant Secretary Roper said . But this also raises some curious questions about the actual state of the technology the Air Force might be looking at for this program. The service’s prior work on UCAVs, at least publicly, evaporated almost a decade ago, despite the service and its industry partners having made major progress on promising technologies that seem very much in line with Skyborg’s general goals. By 2003, Boeing’s X-45A UCAV demonstrator was already capable of autonomous operation thanks to its Decision Mission-Control Software, or DICE. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced project division has also been active in developing autonomous unmanned aircraft and swarming capabilities. The War Zone covered all this and much more in a previous in-depth feature . While Skyborg is certainly an important development , Roper and AFRL have framed it as new. At the same time, one has to wonder how a comparable system doesn’t already exist in a classified realm after all these years. The alternative is that the Air Force truly abandoned its previous work entirely and is starting again more or less from scratch. It’s a strange situation that The War Zone will be looking to address at great length in the near future. With the Air Force’s aggressive schedule for Skyborg, we will hopefully be getting more details on what the service has in mind for this game-changing technology in the near future, as well.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced the first test of its on-orbit power-beaming system on the U.S. Air Force’s X-37B mini-space shuttle , just a day after the successful launch of that vehicle on its latest mission to space. These experiments could have game-changing implications for power generation on Earth, especially for facilities in remote areas and for unmanned aircraft, but they also underscore the potential applications of high-powered microwaves and other directed energy beams as weapons in space to jam, blind, or even destroy critical sensors and other components on opponents’ satellites. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory’s (NRL) Photovoltaic Radio-frequency Antenna Module (PRAM) is one of a number of publicly disclosed payloads onboard the X-37B, which blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 17, 2020. This is the reusable space plane’s sixth trip into orbit since 2010 and it had just completed its fifth mission, which lasted a record-setting 780 days, in October 2019. Much about the craft and its missions remain highly classified . PRAM is a self-contained module that is a foot long, a foot wide, and around two inches tall. The system uses a solar panel on top to collect sunlight and then converts that into a microwave beam. In principle, a receiver on Earth could then take the beam and convert it back into energy that could be used to power traditional electric devices. You can read more about the history of this concept and the science behind it in this past War Zone piece . The Naval Research Laboratory’s Photovoltaic Radio-frequency Antenna Module that is now on that X-37B in orbit., USN “PRAM converts sunlight for microwave power transmission. We could’ve also converted for optical power transmission,” Chris Depuma, the PRAM program manager at NRL, said in a statement. “Converting to optical might make more sense for lunar applications because there’s no atmosphere on the Moon. The disadvantage of optical is you could lose a lot of energy through clouds and atmosphere.” The Navy team plans to test how efficiently PRAM converts energy and its associated thermal performance in space, rather than in a terrestrial laboratory setting. NRL hopes these experiments will inform the development of future prototypes and could lead to a full system installed on a dedicated spacecraft. In principle, a constellation of solar-energy-collecting power-beaming satellites could provide near-limitless, clean power anywhere on Earth. This could completely transform how power is supplied for both military and civilian activities in the most remote areas. It could potentially power propulsion systems on long-endurance drones, allowing them to stay aloft indefinitely, something The War Zone has previously explored in detail . “To our knowledge, this experiment is the first test in orbit of hardware designed specifically for solar power satellites,” Paul Jaffe, PRAM principal investigator at NRL, said in his own statement. This “could play a revolutionary role in our energy future.” However, if a power-beaming system can take solar energy, convert it into a microwave beam, and direct that beam at a specific location, one has to wonder if that concept could not also be adapted into a space-based weapon. The idea of using high-powered microwaves to disrupt, or even destroy , electronic systems in space, as well as on Earth, is hardly new . The U.S. military alone has already explored various types of high-powered microwave weapons that can scramble or damage electronic systems and is evaluating new designs, right now. These include systems that can disrupt enemy computer networks , knock down small drones , and fry the electronics in incoming missiles to throw them off course, among others . A sufficiently powerful burst of microwave energy could cause enough damage to cause a mission kill on satellites. A 2019 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) specifically highlighted ground and space-based high-powered microwaves, as well as other directed energy weapons, including lasers, as potential future threats to American assets in orbit. It also listed a slew of other possible dangers, including jamming and “ killer satellites ” capable of launching various types of kinetic and non-kinetic attacks . A graphic from a 2019 Defense Intelligence Agency report on present and future challenges in space showing the means by which one satellite might attack another., DIA The Russians and the Chinese both already have various anti-satellite capabilities, including air-launched and ground-based kinetic interceptors , and are continuing to develop new capabilities given the traditional advantage that the United States has in space-based capabilities, including intelligence gathering , early warning , communications and data sharing, navigation , and more. The U.S. military itself has a number of other highly-classified counter-space capabilities and other countries, such as India , are also developing their own means to challenge opponents assets’ in orbit. There is also renewed discussion about space-based weapons, mostly as a means to counter anti-satellite threats or for missile defense , in recent years. “Directed energy weapons (high energy lasers or particle beam) or space-based interceptors provide the best overall hope of a hard kill” to destroy future hypersonic weapons , according to a report the NATO Science & Technology Organization released in March. In 2019, France also notably announced plans to eventually deploy small laser-armed satellites to protect other space-based assets. A portion of the section on hypersonic defense from the March 2020 NATO Science & Technology Organization report., NATO As NRL’s researchers noted with regards to PRAM, the vacuum of space removes many of the obstacles that deflect and diffuse directed energy beams on Earth. This means it could require less starting power to generate a beam with sufficient energy to disrupt or damage another target in space, even if it were shielded from common solar radiation. Many military-grade weapons and other systems are also hardened against electromagnetic radiation, but are still vulnerable to a suitably powerful microwave attack. Highly maneuverable satellites or other spacecraft – the X-37B would be an ideal platform itself – could also maneuver the system very close to its target. This could, in turn, reduce the power and range requirements for high-powered microwave or other directed energy weapons. A high-powered microwave also has the benefit of not needing to physically break up the target to destroy it, meaning that an attack would not cause a cloud of dangerous space debris that could threaten friendly assets in space. Of course, there is no indication that NRL has plans to transform PRAM, specifically, into a weapon. At the same time, the technology, or at least related technology, seems to have clear applications as a weapon. In addition, the U.S. military has been researching new space-based weapons in recent years, including plans for a particle beam system , which it announced it had shelved in September 2019. This is in addition to the anti-satellite capabilities that the Air Force is already known to have, which the U.S. Space Force has now begun to inherit , the full scope of which remains largely unknown . All told, the PRAM experiments onboard the X-37B are exciting steps forward toward potentially revolutionary systems for providing power down here on Earth. Work along similar lines could have important implications for possible future American space-based weapons as competition in orbit and beyond continues to heat up.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking for a new carrier jet trainer that could replace its aging T-45 Goshawks . Most interestingly, the service says it is looking to buy an existing land-based design that would be limited to doing touch-and-gos on aircraft carriers and would be unable to perform catapult launches from or arrested landings on those ships. This would be a radical change that would have major implications for much of the Naval Aviator training pipeline. FlightGlobal was first to notice that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) had posted a request for information regarding what it is formally calling the Undergraduate Jet Training System (UJTS) on May 14, 2020. There is no firm publicly available schedule, so far, for when the Navy might begin buying any of these aircraft, which it also refers to as the T-XX, but the service says that it does want to begin replacing the T-45s around 2028. Right now, NAVAIR is interested in getting information “on the suitability of an existing land-based jet trainer aircraft design (i.e. nondevelopmental, as defined under FAR [Federal Acquisition Regulation] 2.101) to satisfy certain requirements under consideration for the next generation US Navy undergraduate jet trainer aircraft,” according to the notice on the official U.S. government contracting website beta.SAM.gov. “Of particular interest, and the subject of this RFI [Request for Information], is the capability of a nondevelopmental aircraft to perform Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) events and Carrier touch-and-go events, and the corresponding effects of these high sink rate landings.” “The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess the current state of technology and inform whether the candidate system(s) can satisfy the capability requirements to perform missions in support of Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) T-45 Combined Multi-Service Pilot Training System (i.e., CNATRAINST 1542.167B) and the Advanced Strike Fighter Undergraduate Military Flight Officer Training System syllabi (i.e., CNATRAINST 1542.164A),” the notice adds. A T-45 Goshawk on the deck of the Nimitz class carrier USS George H.W. Bush ., USN The Navy says it expects to fly each UJTS aircraft for 400 flight hours each year. The jets would conduct around 1,200 Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) landings using simulated facilities ashore, as well as up to 45 touch-and-gos on actual carriers, annually. The proposed purchase of a land-based jet trainer design that cannot actually land or takeoff from an aircraft carrier would be a major shift om how the Navy trains its fighter pilots. The T-45, which first entered service in 1991, is a carrier-capable variant of the well-established BAE Hawk series and replaced the existing carrier-capable T-2C Buckeye and TA-4J Skyhawk in the intermediate and advanced jet trainer roles, respectively. A T-2C Buckeye “catches the wire” on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman ., USN Launching from and recovering on an aircraft carrier is a highly complex and challenging affair under the best conditions and requires significant and routine training to develop and maintain the requisite skill sets. Being able to train pilots to perform these landings and takeoff through FCLP training using simulated facilities on land and with touch-and-gos on actual carriers would certainly provide valuable experience, but would not be a full substitute for the actual carrier qualifications that aviators can currently get while flying in the T-45 Goshawk. It’s not clear from the contracting notice if the land-based design would actually be the only replacement for the T-45, as NAVAIR itself has made clear that it will only be able to meet “certain requirements” for the UJTS program. The War Zone has already reached out for additional information and clarification. It’s certainly true that the T-45s, of which the Navy and the Marine Corps have around 194 in service in total, the oldest of which are now more than three decades old, are increasingly in need of a replacement. The Navy had originally planned to phase them all out in 2018, but, five years before, made to decision to instead extend their service life through 2042. The Goshawks fleet’s readiness rates have slipped in recent years, raising concerns about the service’s ability to train an adequate number of pilots each year. In 2019, the Government Accountability Office also warned about potential shortfalls in available aircraft as jets went through the planned Service Life Extension Program. The T-45 fleet also suffered a worrying and deadly spate of hypoxia incidents between 2016 and 2017. Various fixes to the aircraft themselves , as well as the Navy’s operating procedures, have reduced the number of subsequent physiological events in the past three years, but identifying the underlying root causes has proven difficult . Buying an existing land-based design made to Navy specifications, but without having to modify it to withstand the stresses of catapult launches and arrested landings, could offer a low-cost, low-risk path for the Navy to acquire new jet trainers. One obvious option would be to acquire a version of the U.S. Air Force’s new T-7A Red Hawk , the production of which started in January . The War Zone has already detailed the many possible future roles for the T-7A, or derivatives thereof, in the past. There are also a number of other proven and in-production land-based jet trainer designs available, including the losing entrants for the Air Force’s T-X competition, which the T-7A won. The Air Force itself recently exploring buying a small number of South Korean-made KAI T-50 Golden Eagles to support its own transformational fighter jet pilot training plans . That service canceled its proposed sole-source purchase of the T-50s in March and now says it will hold an open competition . A T-50 jet trainer., Lockheed Martin At the same time, whatever cost-savings the Navy might find by pursuing this course of action might be offset, at least in part, by changes that would then be necessary to its fighter pilot training pipeline. Those aviators will still need to conduct carrier qualifications and will need suitable aircraft in which to perform them. Even simply using existing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to meet these requirements would increase the number of flight hours those jets have to dedicate to training missions, potentially pulling them away from other activities. These full-up fighters are also costly to operate. It is worth noting that the Navy is making substantial investments in developing and fielding various technologies to help automate carrier landings. It is possible that this could eventually reduce the amount of required carrier qualification training the service feels is required, but it wouldn’t eliminate it entirely. At the same time, carrier qualifications have been getting steadily pushed farther and farther down the pipeline. The Navy has already done something broadly similar with regards to its C-2 Greyhound and E-2 Hawkeye aircraft. Prospective pilots destined to fly those aircraft conduct much of their training in the T-44, a variant of the Beechcraft King Air, which is also not carrier-capable. It’s not clear how that training pipeline may also now change as the C-2s get replaced by the CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor. Still, as long as manned fighter jets operate from its carriers, there will be a need to have those pilots practice the uniquely complicated process of landing on, as well as taking off from, those flattops. Regardless, the Navy’s plans to buy non-carrier-capable jet trainers to replace its T-45s, even in part, points to major changes coming in how the service prepares prospective fighter pilots for the challenges involved in joining its carrier air wings.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds are touring around the western United States as part of their “America Strong” flyover mission that is meant to support medical workers , first responders, and essential personal during the COVID-19 outbreak. The team, which prides itself on precision flying , especially when in the iconic six-ship delta formation, had a bit of a scare today as they soared over Los Angeles County. Although it may have been an unwelcome moment, the good news is that training worked and nobody got hurt as a result of the momentary lapse in cohesion. The video below, which was shot from a helicopter, shows the formation heading south, towards Newport Beach. Then, at about 0:26, you can see Thunderbird #1 level out fairly quickly from what looks like a small correction turn, with #3 sliding-out towards #6 on the right end of the formation as a result. #6 catches the potential issue and takes a hard break to the right out of the formation so as to avoid a potential collision. The rest of the delta formation also loses its form a bit for a moment, but they suck back together as they go into a steeper left-hand turn. It isn’t exactly clear what caused the issue. According to the map the team released prior to the flyover, the formation should have been out over the water during this leg of their journey. Regardless, it is a stark reminder of just how fast things can go from fine to potentially devastating up there. An unsightly breakaway is nothing compared to the alternative. So, although it wasn’t the team’s prettiest moment, it underscored just how well their contingency practices, honed over nearly 70 years, work. Thunderbirds It is also a reminder of how tough these flyovers are. The team has to navigate unfamiliar and complex routes at low altitude while in tight formation and traveling at around 400 miles per hour. Weather, turbulence, other air traffic, birds, and even the position of the sun can complicate everything. Oh, and they have to do it over a long period, with some flights lasting up to a couple of hours. It is really an unprecedented and highly intricate feat.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew a route close to China’s Hainan Island in the South China Sea , which is home to a massive People’s Liberation Army Navy base, earlier today. This particular aircraft is one of a small subset of the service’s Poseidon fleet that is configured to carry a shadowy radar system known as the AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor . On May 15, 2020, online plane spotter and Twitter user Golf9 spotted the P-8A, which carries the Navy Bureau Number 169010, flying a route through the South China Sea that took it around Hainan and into the Gulf of Tonkin. The Poseidon then turned around and exited the area along a similar path. The plane came within approximately 30 miles of the southern coast of the island, including passes by the sprawling Yulin Naval Base. Golf9 also pointed out that 169010 is one of at least seven P-8As that have been observed carrying the AN/APS-154 in the past. The Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS) is a large podded system that requires the installation of a special mount on the underside of the fuselage. Raytheon developed the AN/APS-154 almost under a large degree of secrecy and its exact capabilities remain highly classified. The radar inside the pod is known to be an active electronically scanned array (AESA) type that can capture highly detailed imagery, even at night or in bad weather, while operating in a synthetic aperture mode and has a moving target indicator (MTI) functionality. The AAS is also specifically designed to work in complex littoral regions and scan sea and land areas at the same time with extreme fidelity. Traditional surface search radars are generally configured to spot and track objects of interest in one of these environments or the other, or have dedicated modes for both, and have trouble functioning in both simultaneously. The Navy acquired the AN/APS-154 as a direct follow-on to the AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS), an earlier and equally secretive Raytheon-developed podded radar that some of the service’s P-3C Orions carry. You can read more about the AN/APS-149 and the AN/APS-154 here . Another AAS-equipped P-8A, this one with Bureau Number 169007, with a red arrow pointing to the radar pod., @cvvhrn Hainan is exactly the kind of target area that the AN/APS-154 was designed to scan. The P-8As also have signals intelligence capabilities, which allow them to detect, geolocate, and classify emissions, including from radars and other air defense nodes, which can help in building a so-called “ electronic order of battle ” of a potential opponent’s defensive networks. The island has long been an intelligence target for the U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community. Notably, in April 2001, a Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane made an emergency landing at Lingshui Airfield on the Island after suffering serious damage after a mid-air collision with a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-8II fighter jet . The Chinese jet was destroyed, killing the pilot, Lieutenant Commander Wang Wei, in what became a major international incident . A satellie image of Yulin Naval Base on March 3, 2020., Google Earth The AAS-equipped P-8A on this latest flight past the island would certainly have been able to peer into Yulin with its underslung radar while flying a slanted flight path, as well as other potential areas of interest along the coast. One particular objective might have to gather information about the state of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s growing Type 094 Jin class ballistic missile submarine fleet . A Type 094 ballistic missile submarine., CRS via USN A pair of Type 094 ballistic missile submarines, as well as another submarine at the top, docked at Yulin on March 3., Google Earth There were reports in April that the PLAN had taken delivery of two more Type 094s, which, if true, would bring the total number of these submarines in service to six. In February, the Office of Naval Intelligence told members of Congress that China only commissioned four of these submarines so far, though it expected six ballistic missile submarines to be in Chinese service by 2025 and eight by 2030. This total could eventually include some number of new Type 096 ballistic missile submarines, a follow-on class to the Type 094 that is reportedly in development. A table showing PLAN submarine force totals, according to the US Navy, as of February 2020. This came from a draft document that the Federation of American Scientists obtained via the Freedom of Information Act that did not include comparative totals and protections for the US Navy., USN via FAS The Type 094s represent an important and expanding second-strike nuclear capability for China and, together with reported work on the H-20 stealth strategic bomber , is evidence that the country is moving closer to deploying a true deterrent triad of land, sea, and aerial delivery platforms. In addition, Chinese authorities just recently highlighted continued work on the JL-3 solid-fuel submarine-launched ballistic missile, development of which first began as a companion to the Type 096. Yulin is a major base for the PLAN’s steadily larger and more modern submarine force , as well as its surface fleets, as well, and famously features a large network of underground facilities , including pens that submarines can sail in and out of directly. A close up of the entrance to the subterranean submarine cavern at Yulin., Google Earth PLAN surface warships at Yulin., Google Earth The Chinese have also expanded military facilities above ground in the same general area, including around nearby Sanya Harbor, in recent years, notably adding a pier capable of accomodating the country’s growing fleet of aircraft carriers . A satellite image of Sanya Harbor on March 3, 2020, with the large, rectangular carrier-capable pier seen toward the south end., Google Earth The flight of 169010 past Hainan also follows the apparent end of a dispute in the southern end of the South China Sea over the activities of the West Capella , a Panama-flagged drillship operating under contract to the Malaysian government to explore potential oil and natural gas resources in the area. Beijing has expansive claims over virtually the entire body of water , which every other country in the region, as well as the vast majority of the international community, rejects. Chinese vessels reportedly harassed the West Cappella and supporting ships , starting in December, and China also sent its own survey vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8 , from Hainan to conduct operations in the area with escorts from the Chinese Coast Guard and the country’s paramilitary Maritime Militia. Naval vessels from Vietnam, which also has territorial claims in the area, as well as the United States and Australia, conducted various patrols in the region, as well. “The United States is concerned by reports of China’s repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement in April . “In this instance, [China] should cease its bullying behavior and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity.” “There is no better signal of our support for a free and open Indo-Pacific than positive and persistent U.S. Naval engagement in this region,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Fred Kacher, Commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 7, headquartered in Japan, said after the Independence class littoral combat ship USS Gabrielle Giffords conducted a patrol near the West Capella on May 12. That same day, the drillship concluded its scheduled activities and left the area. The Independence class littoral combat ship USS Gabrielle Giffords , in the foreground, sails past the drillship West Capella in the South China Sea on May 12., USN This is just the latest instance of friction between China and other countries in the South China Sea region, as well as the United States . This has lead to direct confrontations between American and Chinese forces, including a near-collision between warships from the two countries in 2018. On May 8, Air Force B-1 Bones also flew a mission to the South China Sea as part of a new dynamic concept of operations that involves irregular bomber sorties in both the Pacific region and Europe . These flights, some of which have involved round trips to and from bases in the United States, have become a regular occurrence following the recent and abrupt end of the Air Force’s Continuous Bomber Presence deployments on Guam after 16 years, which The War Zone was first to report . In addition to these activities in the South China Sea, there has been an uptick in tensions between Beijing and authorities on the island of Taiwan ahead of the inauguration of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen for her second term next week. The Chinese government, which treats Taiwan and a semi-autonomous region, has decried Tsai in the past as a pro-independence “extremist” and threatened military action repeatedly if the island seeks to formally break away from the mainland. Tsai, who first took office around the same time as President Donald Trump, has cultivated close ties with the current U.S. President and his administration. The U.S. government does not officially recognize the government of Taiwan, but has established a framework to work with it and support its defense needs until such time as there is a formal resolution of its status. The Trump Administration has concluded a number of arms deals with Taiwanese authorities in recent years, notably agreeing to deliver new advanced versions of the F-16 Viper fighter jet, which China has long said was a red line that would provoke a major response. There were unconfirmed reports recently that China might be preparing to invade Taiwan. Officials on the island have not said whether or not those news stories were accurate, but have said that they continue to closely monitor Chinese military activities . The People’s Liberation Army has recently kicked off major exercises , which certainly appears to be a signal aimed at Taiwan and follows a number of other similarly provocative maneuvers in recent months. At the same time, U.S. naval vessels and military aircraft have conducted a number of so-called Freedom of Navigation patrols in the Strait of Taiwan in recent months, which are clearly meant to demonstrate America’s resolve to defend Taiwan against any Chinese aggression. Just this week, the Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS McCampbell sailed through the Strait on one of these patrols. In addition to their recent flights in the South China Sea, Air Force B-1 bombers have flown a number of recent missions into the East China Sea to the north of Taiwan, in which China also has territorial disputes with Japan and South Korea . With all this going on, while we don’t know exactly what 169010 and its AN/APS-154 radar were looking at specifically, it’s hardly surprising that the Navy sent it to go check on what might be happening at one of China’s most strategic naval bases. The AAS offers the Navy a powerful new intelligence-gathering tool and it seems likely that we will now be seeing more of the P-8As equipped with these secretive sensors, especially in the Pacific region.

Aaron Amick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2020",The Shadowy World Of Submarine And Ship-Launched Torpedo Countermeasures,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Historically speaking, torpedo countermeasures have been a tool used to buy time for a ship or submarine trying to escape an attack, but 21st-century naval technology is changing the way they are used. Today, countermeasures can be used as a defensive device or as a distraction that opens up an opportunity to attack. So, let’s take a dive into this shadowy world, starting with the four basic types of torpedo countermeasures: maskers, jammers, decoys, and anti-torpedo devices, as well as their differences and how they are tactically employed. Broadband passive sonar systems found on modern submarines identify a target by contrasting the broadband energy signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with quieter background noise. This contrast is displayed as different shades or colors on the sonar screen forming traces that waterfall down from the top. Broadband acoustic masking devices that interfere with a sonar’s ability to differentiate background noise from a contact, like the Naval Acoustic Electromechanical ( NAE ) Beacon Mk 3, are the simplest of torpedo countermeasures. This saltwater activated masker is ejected from the submarine and a float is released that tethers the device to a specific depth. A thermal battery powers its motor and electronics, which create the broadband noise. This produces a loud acoustic signature that spans the spectrum of a broadband sonar system, effectively raising background noise above a target’s SNR, “wiping” the sonar operator’s display in one solid color with no contrast. As such, they cannot delineate targets from the noise. Maskers have a short operational time and grow quieter as they lose power. It is common to deploy multiple maskers with different start time delays. This gives the evading submarine more time before the masking field expires. They are not effective against most modern torpedoes, such as the Russian UGST or the Black Shark . This is because maskers will cover a submarine’s evasion maneuver from the opponent’s broadband sonar system, but will not reliably hide a submarine from the torpedo’s active or narrowband sonar search modes. With this in mind, Russia’s Vist-E torpedo decoy is a five-inch, 30-pound acoustic countermeasure that combines broadband noise masking with active sonar jamming and torpedo active reproduction. In other words, it can simulate a submarine’s own narrowband acoustic signature, but has a relatively short battery life of less than 10 minutes. Overall, the Vist-E is less capable than modern NATO decoys, but when used in groups, it can create a field of confusion that will hamper most torpedoes. Vist-E., Rosoboronexport Submarine Scutter ( SUBSCUT ) and Launched Expendable Scutter (LESCUT) are reactive decoys built by Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems and Rafael of Israel. SUBSCUT is pre-loaded into internal signal launchers or external launchers—launch tubes that house the countermeasure devices, and can be automatically deployed upon torpedo detection. The decoy will hover between a depth of 10 and 300 meters listening for the incoming torpedo. A torpedo’s active sonar is analyzed by the decoy and classified. SUBSCUT customizes its own acoustic decoy transmission to the specific type of incoming torpedo, including the Doppler effect . Doppler effect is important to deceiving torpedo logic because it is one of the many checks the torpedo circuits can make during target verification. When the internal battery runs out, the decoy erases its software and sinks. LESCUT is the surface ship counterpart to SUBSCUT and is launched with a rocket motor from a chaff tube topside into the water. Scutter., Rafael The Submarine Countermeasure Acoustic Device ( SCAD 102 ) is used by the Royal Navy’s ballistic missile submarines and the Astute class of nuclear fast attack submarines (SSNs). This four-inch diameter, self-contained, internally-mounted torpedo countermeasure has the multirole capability. It is mission programmed before launch and is capable of jamming and decoying next-generation torpedoes, such as the Mk 48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP). Sonar Jammers, such as the United States Navy’s Acoustic Device Countermeasure (ADC) Mk 4 Mod 1, an expendable 6.25-inch diameter, 120-pound (54.4kg) countermeasure, produce wide range tones designed to confuse a torpedo detection logic with a large number of false targets. This triggers a target verification algorithm within the torpedo’s homing logic and restarts it continuously with multiple new targets every second. This result is the torpedo circling the jammer verifying targets that do not exist while the actual submarine exits the search area. LESCUT, SUBSCUT, SCAD, (ADC) Mk4 Mod1, Ultra Electronics Most modern torpedoes, such as the Royal Navy’s Spearfish , have modes to defeat this kind of jammer and older less capable torpedoes can use guidance commands sent over the long trailing wires connected to the launching submarine to reset the torpedo’s search mode. However, this latter method requires direct input from the submarine’s fire control system operators. In February 2019, the United States awarded a contract to develop a 3-inch version of the ADC Mk 4, called the ADC Mk 5. This will decrease the operational cost of the ADC program due to each device being stored within the submarine pressure hull instead of externally. An external ADC has a 12-year replacement lifespan, but only a two-year operational life after it is installed into the external mount. Phase three of this contract explores the feasibility of automated underwater vehicles deploying torpedo countermeasures. This gives the attacking submarine more tactical flexibility because he can prepare the battlespace before an attack with numerous automated mobile decoys that move away from the submarine’s position. Testing of the system is taking place on naval ranges off the coast of Washington, California, Virginia, and at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas. To respond to the “countermeasure homing” abilities of modern torpedoes, such as target verification and frequency discrimination, Leonardo has created the C303/S for submarines and C310 for surface ships. C303/S is a 12-barrel, external, pneumatic countermeasure launcher that shoots a 3.7-foot-long, 33-pound, three-inch diameter stationary jammer, and a five-inch Mobile Target Emulator (decoy). C303/S. , Leonardo The jammer is supported by a floating buoy that deploys a cable submerging the jammer to its most effective depth for the environment. The Mobile Target Emulator (MTE) will move away from the jammer responding to the incoming torpedo’s active pings as if it is a valid return. The doppler of the moving decoy and high SNR response is sufficient to lure the weapon away for a short time. When the weapon realizes it is following a decoy it is likely to return to the jammer and not the target. The C303/S launcher can be manually or automatically fired upon torpedo detection. The system will give a recommended evasion course that moves away from the mobile decoy. Ultra Electronics is developing the Next Generation Countermeasure ( NGCM ). This 3-inch device can be internally launched and will swim away from the launching platform and provide tactical information via an acoustic communication link and updates between ships and submarines in the battlespace. The NGCM will act as an autonomous full-duplex mode acoustic communication link and torpedo jammer or decoy if, necessary. The 3-inch Swimmer Mk 2 device is in development, it provides more tactical capabilities and can be launched externally. This gives submarine commanders more tactical options. Devices such as the NGCM expand sonar detection range, act as guards against counter-attack, and can provide broadband masking while the submarine repositions itself. Towed decoys are common on most warships. Even the battleship USS Iowa deployed the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie system. Towed decoys employ both a broadband masker that generate more noise energy than the target ship and an active pulse transmitter that returns a torpedo’s active sonar ping at two to three times more amplitude than received. This attracts the torpedo to the towed decoy where it will circle until it runs out of energy. This is a better option than expendable countermeasures because if power is applied to the towed decoy, it will run continuously and can be reused. Towed Nixie decoy system aboard the USS Iowa . , USN Expendable countermeasures have seawater batteries that last between six and 45 minutes. Modern towed decoys can also act as torpedo early-warning sensors and alert the towing vessel of incoming weapons before their hull-mounted sensors detect them. Ultra Electronics has created the Type 2070 surface ship torpedo defense (SSTD) system. This next-generation torpedo countermeasure employs both active and passive methods that reliably decoy and destroy incoming torpedoes. Details as to how the Type 2070 does its job remain highly classified. SSTD., Ultra Electronics Russia’s Paket-E/NK anti-torpedo system is designed to engage torpedoes or submarines inside 800 meters. This fast-reacting countermeasure consists of an externally mounted rotary launcher of eight intercept devices, a Paket-E control system, and a Paket-AE sonar set. The system can automatically alert on an incoming torpedo, calculate its path and launch a torpedo disabling anti-torpedo. It provides ships with unique anti-submarine and anti-torpedo capability. This point defense approach is employed if traditional evasion is unsuccessful. Rosoboronexport Rafael’s Torbuster is a mobile decoy that is launched from an external launcher. It mimics the incoming weapon’s active sonar creating a false target. The system will calculate the torpedoes range and when it reaches the closest point of approach, it self-detonates a charge capable of damaging or destroying any nearby weapon. The evolution of weapons and defenses have counteracted each other since the beginning of warfare. From sword and shield to radar and jammer, military science has parried each new technology with an appropriate response. Since the 1980s the torpedoes have been the dominant ship killer in naval warfare, leaving the target with little choice but to run the weapon out of energy. Today’s anti-torpedo technology, such as Russia’s Paket-E/NK close-in anti-torpedo torpedo, Israel’s Torbuster , and the United States Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Compact Rapid Attack Weapons program ( ATT CRAW ), are making conventional torpedoes obsolete. Torbuster., Rafael For the first time, naval weapons platforms have an active option against submerged attacks. They can counter-fire on incoming torpedoes rather than rely on deception and evasion as the only method of survival. This provides navies with new offensive opportunities to press an attack when they would normally be forced to maneuver away. 21st Century naval combat will look much different than that of the previous century. New weapons systems like the U.S. Navy’s Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP) and laser turrets will favor the aggressive captains. A shift towards offensive operations has occurred and commanders who recognize these new capabilities will be rewarded. Aaron Amick is a retired U.S. Navy submarine sonarman.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but an Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter jet has crashed at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and the pilot is now at a local hospital in stable condition. The aircraft was flying a routine training sortie at the time and was not involved in a flyover earlier in the day that was part of a larger nation-wide salute healthcare workers and first responders on the frontlines of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic as some outlets initially reported. The first reports of the crash began to emerge at around 11:30 AM local time. The Air Force says that the pilot successfully ejected from the aircraft before it hit the ground. An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident is already underway. The actual crash appears to have occurred sometime before 11:00 AM. Fighter jets performing the separate flyover had reportedly just completed a route that took them over the cities of Panama City Beach, Panama City, and Lynn Haven. Those jets were also supposed to head over Mexico Beach and Gulf County, but at 11:48, officials at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida announced the cancellation of those portions of the route. Any mishap involving an F-22 is particularly significant given the relatively small size of the fleet overall. Prior to this incident, the Air Force had only 186 Raptors in total, of which just around 125 of them are assigned to combat-coded units. F-22 operations in Florida were also notably hard hit by Hurricane Michael in October 2018, which forced a number of the jets, along with supporting units , to leave Tyndall and move to Eglin. The 43rd Fighter Squadron, the designated F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU), remains at Eglin, though the Air Force is now looking to move those training activities to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. The 95th Fighter Squadron, an operational squadron previously based at Tyndall, has already dispersed its F-22s to Langley and other bases around the United States. Update: 12:35 PM EST— Eglin Air Force Base has now issued a statement confirming that the F-22 in question was assigned to the 43rd Fighter Squadron and that it was conducting a routine training flight at the time. The pilot is presently at the 96th Medical Group’s hospital on base. The 96th Medical Group is part of the 96th Test Wing, the main unit at Eglin.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2020",Behold These Awesome Shots Of A Navy P-8A Poseidon Carrying Its Big Secretive Radar Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Navy’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes recently visited Moffett Field in California. The aircraft in question was carrying an elongated pontoon-like pod underneath, known as the AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor , or AAS, a powerful and secretive radar system. A planespotter, photographer, and War Zone reader named Fred, who also goes by the Twitter handle cvvhrn , took the pictures of this particular P-8A, which is also known by the Bureau Number 169007, at Moffett on May 3, 2020. He was kind enough to share them with us so we could share them with you. @cvvhrn @cvvhrn The pictures offer an excellent view of the underside of the AN/APS-154, as well as the P-8A carrying it. The pod is attached to the bottom of the aircraft using a special, extendable cradle known as the Special Mission Pod Deployment Mechanism (SMPDM), which Aviation Week was first to report on in July 2019. By extending the pod well below the fuselage while in flight, the radar’s fields of view are no longer obstructed by the plane’s two engines. @cvvhrn @cvvhrn @cvvhrn You can also see a pair of vertical strakes, one on either side of the bottom of the P-8A’s rear fuselage. These are unique to aircraft that have been configured to carry the AN/APS-154. The two strakes are visible in this picture under the rear of the fuselage., @cvvhrn @cvvhrn Specific details about the pod itself and the capabilities of the radar inside, all of which Raytheon developed almost entirely in secret, are limited. The radar is known to be an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) type with moving target indicator (MTI) and synthetic aperture functionality. What this means is that the system is capable of tracking moving targets below at sea and on land, as well as taking high-quality radar imagery of objects of interest for further analysis, even at night or in poor weather. The AAS is also specifically designed to work in littoral regions where it might have to scan both water and land areas simultaneously. Traditional surface search radars are typically optimized for one environment or the other, or have dedicated modes for each, and generally have difficulty covering both at the same time. All of this makes it a powerful information-gathering tool for the P-8A, which is set to not only replace the Navy’s P-3C Orion patrol planes, but also partially assume the missions of its specialized intelligence variants of that aircraft, such as the EP-3E Aeries II . The AN/APS-154 is itself a direct follow-on to the equally secretive AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System , another podded Raytheon AESA radar that some P-3Cs carry. The AAS is also just one bolt-on sensor suite that is in development for the Poseidon, as well. In addition, the AN/APS-154, combined with the P-8A’s networking and data-sharing capabilities, will enable planes carrying the pod to be powerful stand-off targeting platforms for other assets in the air, at sea, or on land, as well as its itself. The Navy is now working to integrate various stand-off weapons onto its Poseidons, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The AAS would also allow the aircraft to conduct rapid assessments of any strikes. A P-8A carrying four AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missiles under its wings., USN Beyond that, being an AESA type radar, the AN/APS-154 might have secondary electronic warfare capabilities. You can read much more about this sensor and what it offers to the Navy’s Poseidon fleet here . It’s not clear how many AAS pods the Navy has now, how many of its P-8As are configured to carry them, or what units those aircraft are assigned to. The Navy first contracted Raytheon to develop the radar system in 2009 and began testing it in 2014. As of August 2019, at least seven different Posiedons , including this particular aircraft, have been observed carrying the pods at various times. Some of these aircraft have been linked to some of the Navy’s most shadowy aviation units, which is the topic of a War Zone feature that will be coming in the near future. There have been more sightings of AAS-equipped P-8As in the last year or so, which along with the appearance of 169007 at Moffett Field, indicate that the Navy’s is making increasingly regular use of these powerful sensors.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 31, 2020",B-52 Bomber Made Run Straight At Crimea During Long Range Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says that it sent Su-27 Flankers to intercept multiple U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortresses flying over both the Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions today. In one of the encounters, one of the bombers was flying directly toward the Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin occupies, in what could have been a mock strike run. Another one of the B-52s subsequently made an emergency landing at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom following an unrelated in-flight emergency. The Russian Ministry of Defense and the country’s National Defense Management Center both released statements about the intercepts on June 17, 2019. The same day, U.S. Air Force’s in Europe released its own statement confirming that B-52s from the 5th Bomber Wing at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota had flown missions in support of three different exercises, but did not name them. The annual NATO-led Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) exercise is presently ongoing in and around the Baltic Sea, while the U.S. Army and Romanian Land Forces are hosting the latest iteration of Saber Guardian in the Black Sea region, both of which have included B-52s in the past. Online flight tracking software showed that at least three bombers had deployed from the United States and then two continued back to base after conducting the marathon missions. “On 17 June 2019, crews of the Russian Su-27 fighters… intercepted U.S. Air Force B-52H strategic bombers, which were approaching the state border of the Russian Federation from the direction of the Black and Baltic seas,” Russia’s National Defence Management Center said, according to state-run media outlet Sputnik . “The crews of Russian Su-27 fighter jets … have intercepted US Air Force B-52H strategic bombers, that approached Russian state border from the Black and Baltic seas,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in its own release, according to RT . Neither Russian government statement said exactly where the intercepts occurred or how many total aircraft were involved. The B-52s remained in international airspace the entire time, according to both releases, though the Kremlin contended that they were flying in a provocative manned toward Russia’s territory. The B-52H is capable of executing stand-off conventional and nuclear strikes using cruise missiles . Such operations may have looked similar to the flight profiles flown. There is no indication in either case that American and Russian aircraft came dangerously close together, as has been the case during other intercepts in recent years . Krasnaya Zvezda , the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, claimed that Russian aircraft had scrambled to intercept foreign aircraft close to the country’s airspace 10 times in the past few days, but again, with very limited detail about those encounters. Last week , there had been reports previously about Russian intercepting U.S. and Swedish intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea. But there’s definitely no denying that B-52s were in both the Black Sea and Baltic Sea regions on June 17, 2019. Plane spotters used online flight tracking software to monitor a trio of B-52s, using the callsigns Hodor 51, 52, and 53 – possibly a reference to a character from the immensely popular television show Game of Thrones , which recently concluded – flying in Europe throughout the day. Two of those bombers, Hodor 51 and 52, flew overland to Romania, likely to take part in Saber Guardian, which involves air, land, and sea forces training for a major conflict in that region. Hodor 52, however, appeared to break away at one point and fly out over the Black Sea toward the Crimean Peninsula. Russia has occupied this region since 2014 when it seized it from Ukraine and illegally annexed it. The bomber, in this case, did appear to be heading straight toward the Crimean coastline and came within 40 miles of the Peninsula, before turning around. The War Zone can’t remember a B-52, or any other U.S. combat aircraft, flying a similar flight profile in the Black Sea in the past five years, but even if it’s not necessarily unheard of, it’s definitely not common, either. It’s not clear what the objective of this run was, though the U.S. government has been particularly adamant in recent years about reinforcing its right to operate in international waters in the Black Sea near both the Ukrainian and Russian coasts, despite the Kremlin’s objections. This flight also follows a report from Defense One that Russia has further increased its defensive posture on the Peninsula in the past year and a half. Russian forces now operate S-400 surface-to-air missile systems at no less than five different sites and older S-300s at four more. There are combat aircraft deployed to four bases on the Peninsula and the Kremlin appears to be reactivating or otherwise improving a number of Soviet-era military installations there. Separately, the U.K. Ministry of Defense released photographs of a B-52 flying in the Baltic, which appears to have been Hodor 53. The pilot or pilots onboard a Royal Air Force (RAF) Eurofighter Typhoon from 121 Expeditionary Air Wing, which is presently deployed to Estonia as part of the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission, grabbed the shots of the bomber during “routine interoperability training,” according to an official Tweet . Beyond the interoperability training, the B-52 was likely making an appearance at BALTOPS, a large annual exercise that NATO leads in the Baltic Sea and surrounding areas. This is another sea, air, and land exercise that prepares forces from the Alliance and its partners for a potential major conflict in the strategic waterway. In addition to the United States, personnel and assets from Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden are taking part. The Scandinavian nations of Finland and Sweden are not NATO members, but have been growing closer to the military bloc in response to growing Russian threats . Exercises in the Baltic Sea, such as BALTOPS, regularly draw the attention and ire of the Kremlin, especially if aircraft and ships get close to its Kaliningrad enclave, which sits between Poland and Lithuania and is geographically separated from the rest of Russia. The Kremlin has already publicly announced that it is monitoring the BALTOPS exercise, as per usual . In March 2019, Russia intercepted Air Force B-52s – as seen in the video below – that it similarly accused of acting provocatively in the Baltic Sea, but also noted that they did not come within 90 miles of Kaliningrad. It’s worth noting that this region is so constrained that, at its widest, the distance between Kaliningrad and the Swedish shore on the other side is less than 200 miles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oUV4LuFVYcw As such, Intercepts in the region are common all around. On June 17, 2019, the RAF announced that it had scrambled its Baltic Air Policing jets twice in the preceding three days, as well. These were the seventh and eight intercepts the aircraft had conducted since arriving in Estonia in May 2019. After the three American bombers concluding their respective training missions and beginning the long trek back to North Dakota, one of the B-52s suffered a still-unspecified in-flight emergency over the United Kingdom, forcing it to land at RAF Mildenhall. Unconfirmed reports suggest that one or more engines may have failed, but there have been no reports of any injuries from the incident, thankfully. All told, the intercepts themselves seem to have been relatively routine based on the statements from all the parties involved, especially compared to previous incidents that were either dangerous or otherwise especially brazen . As with the deployment of six B-52s to Europe in March 2019, however, these latest encounters do seem to reflect an escalation in tensions between the United States, and its NATO Allies to a less degree, and Russia. The flight path of Hodor 52 toward Crimea certainly reflects a very different kind of American military activity in the Black Sea region than we are used to seeing. Though Air Force bomber activity in Europe has definitely been increasing in recent years, in general, it is intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft that typically fly near Russia’s borders . As long as these trends continue, we can expect to see a similar uptick in intercepts and other tit-for-tat activities. Hopefully, they’ll be as uneventful as these latest encounters in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that we here at The War Zone are fans of flight simulators , and the more detailed and immersive , the better . So you can be sure it caught our eye when a real U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk simulator appeared for sale through one of the U.S. government’s online auction houses. The Eastern Army National Guard Aviation Training Site ( EAATS ) at Fort Indiantown Gap in Annville, Pennsylvania is getting rid of the simulator through the General Services Administration’s GSA Auctions website. At the time of writing, the top bid was $40,488, but we don’t know if this meets the unlisted minimum reserve price. The GSA Auctions listing offers the following additional information: “The flight simulator was in operational condition when taken out of service, however repairs may still be required. This purchase includes the flight simulator and associated system components, including: A retractable gang plank, staircase and catwalk, spare components, test equipment, bookcases with technical manuals ECNs historical files, circuit cards, jacks, and other miscellaneous electronics. Buyer will remove items from its current location at Eastern Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (EAATS), Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, PA 17003-5004, a secure U. S. Army facility adjacent to Annville, PA. The on-site removal at Fort Indiantown Gap must occur no later than July 10, 2020 with a mandatory 3-week advanced appointment.” GSA A good view of the underside of the simulator showing the hydraulic struts that simulate yaw, roll, and pitch., GSA A view inside the simulator’s cockpit., GSA A console where personnel control the training simulation., GSA GSA GSA GSA A dataplate for the Black Hawk simulator., GSA These simulators, which Singer Defense’s Link Flight Simulation Division originally made, date back to the early days of the Black Hawk program in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They have received upgrades over the years and are intended to model the cockpit controls and handling of UH-60A and UH-60L Black Hawk variants. Rockwell Collins subsequently became the primary contractor after acquiring Link. Facilities, such as the EAATS, which “is fully accredited by The Army School System (TASS) as a ‘Learning Institution of Excellence’ charged to conduct National Guard Bureau directed training,” use these simulators to provide regular required pilot training. The room-sized systems, which look outwardly similar to commercial full-motion flight simulators one would fine at any training outlet, such as Flight Safety International , are capable of simulating a variety of environmental and operational conditions. They’re also capable of simulating potential faults and malfunctions. This kind of training has a lot to do with practicing procedures that pilots would follow during emergencies that are not easily recreated in the air, if it is advisable to do so at all. All of this offers a lower-cost and extremely low-risk way for Army aviators to test their skills. Of course, actual training sorties do still remain an essential component of pilot training regimens. This particular model of simulator, known as the 2B38, however, is steadily outliving its usefulness. The Army, including the National Guard, has been acquiring new and improved UH-60Ms , which notably feature an all-glass cockpit, since 2006. At the same time, the service has been steadily working to divest its remaining A models and a portion of its L variants. It is also in the process of upgrading UH-60Ls into the more advanced UH-60V configuration , which also features a glass cockpit. The UH-60L cockpit layout, at left, compared to that of the UH-60V, at right, which is similar to that of the UH-60M., US Army The Army has already invested in newer Black Hawk simulators, including Collins Aerospace’s Transportable Black Hawk Operation Simulator ( T-BOS ), in order to be able to train aviators to fly UH-60Ms. The service has continued to acquire improved designs and upgrade them since then, as well. One of the newest UH-60 simulators that the Army uses is the Black Hawk Aircrew Trainer, or BAT, the first prototype of which was installed at Fort Bliss, Texas in 2015. Three years after that, the service worked to develop an expanded version that not only reflected the cockpit configurations of new UH-60 models, but also allowed for simulator training that included crew chiefs and door gunners in addition to pilots. This means that complete Black Hawk crews can train together on a much broader set of mission skills in a lower-cost simulated environment. The quality of the simulated environments, and, as a result, the realism and immersion the simulators offer, is dramatically improved over the older designs, such as the one that the EAATS is now auctioning off. The U.S. military, as a whole, is also increasingly exploring how virtual reality might allow for even lower cost simulated training for helicopter and fixed-wing aircrews, as well as ground and naval forces . Augmented reality may also have useful training applications. As time goes on, big bulky simulators that need entire rooms to operate in, along with extensive associated infrastructure, may increasingly become a thing of the past . In the meantime, however, there remains a market for more traditional simulators. If you have a need, or just want to be able to take a different kind of spin in your neighborhood while social distancing, and you have between $40,000 and $60,000 burning a hole in your pocket, then maybe you’ll want to consider making a bid for this particular model.  You’ll have to act soon, though, since the auction closes on Apr. 23, just two days from now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 28, 2020",We’ve Got A Close Up Look At Syria’s MiG-29s And It Isn’t Pretty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syria has released a number of video clips showing some of its MiG-29 Fulcrum jets. The unusually high-resolution footage offers a close look at how these jets are faring after years of conflict and sanctions and its safe to say that they look pretty beat up. The Syrian Ministry of Defense posted these videos on its official YouTube page between May 5 and 6. The clips, along with a series of others where MiG-29s do not appear, feature various members of the Syrian armed forces making statements on the occasion of the country’s Martyrs’ Day , which falls on May 6 and honors the memory of Arab nationalists who the Ottoman Empire executed in 1916. You can watch the three full videos that include statements from MiG-29 pilots below: https://youtube.com/watch?v=WGHSFOub5oM https://youtube.com/watch?v=mvAbjrHbG_k https://youtube.com/watch?v=IA2SGHNPmHQ For what is clearly meant to be a show of national pride, the MiG-29s we see look to be in pretty bad shape. The jet that is the primary subject in all three videos has clear scrapes on its nose radome and a huge scratch along the left side of the fuselage underneath the cockpit. The windscreen looks discolored and the canopy framing is scratched and roughed up around the edges There is also damage to the front of the left wing glove behind the firing port for its internally-mounted 30mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 automatic cannon. The firing port itself is visibly rusty. There is significant corrosion on various portions of the aircraft. Parts of its two-tone gray camouflage scheme appear to have been hastily and irregularly touched up over the years and there is discoloration along panel lines all over the aircraft, too. A screengrap showing much of the wear and tear in question., Syrian MoD Another screengrab highlighting the damage visible on the nose radome., Syrian MoD Another clip showing more of the underside of this particular aircraft show oil and exhaust stains in various areas. The treads on the main landing gear tires also have what could be striations on their surface, which would raise questions about how worn they might be. This could also just be areas where dust and sand were present and got wiped away. Syrian MoD While some of what is visible could be categorized as normal wear and tear, the obvious damage and fouling on certain components is significant. Beyond that, the Syrian Ministry of Defense had to have deliberately chosen this particular aircraft to feature front and center in its official Martyrs’ Day footage, along with the others in the background that do not appear to be in much better states. One would imagine they would not have pick such a poor example to show off if there were better options readily available. As such, the videos can only call into question the ability of the Syrian Air Force to operate and maintain the MiG-29s and other jets after nearly a decade of Civil War and skirmishes with foreign powers, such as the United States , Israel , and, most recently, Turkey. The Syrian military has lost significant amounts of men and materiel, including multiple combat jets, since 2011, including two Su-24s and one L-39 in fighting just this past February with Turkish and Turkish-backed Syrian forces. International sanctions can’t have helped, either. Syria has also had a hard time getting new or even newish combat jets to replace its losses or otherwise bolter its fleets, to say nothing of modernizing them. Russia did supply a number of Su-24M2 Fencers to the Syrian Air Force starting in 2017, but plans to buy MiG-29SMT fighter jets and Yak-130 armed trainers have not materialized. As such, Syria has only committed its MiG-29s sparingly in the ongoing fighting, using them at times to conduct limited strikes with their cannons and unguided rockets. The Syrian Air Force certainly hasn’t sent any of its Fulcrums, or any other combat jets, out to try to tangle with Israeli aircraft that have conducted strikes on targets in the country a semi-regular basis with near impunity in recent years. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ocjshAk3dJk It’s not even entirely clear how many of the Fulcrums the Syrian Air Force still had in its active inventory by the tie the country’s Civil War broke out. The Syrian government had acquired around 48 of the fighter jets, a mix of single-seat MiG-29A fighters and two-seat MiG-29UB trainers , from the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, with them formally entering service in 1989. There is a report that a pair of Israeli F-15C Eagles shot down two of the Syrian Fulcrums in June 1989 , but this has never been confirmed. Israeli and Syrian authorities have both denied reports of a nearly identical engagement involving another pair of F-15Cs and the shootdown of two more MiG-29s in 2001. In 2018, Syrian rebels also said they brought down a Syrian MiG-29, but this has not been confirmed. Starting in 2011, Syria had also begun upgrading is MiG-29s, approximately 20 aircraft in total, with assistance from MiG in Russia, to a configuration similar in some respects to the modernized MiG-29SM. The single-seat MiG-29SM is based on the earlier MiG-29S, also known as the Fulcrum-C, which has a different airframe from Syria’s MiG-29As. In order to bring Syria’s aircraft up to a standard at all similar to the MiG-29SM, MiG reportedly developed a new package based on the older airframe design. The updated Syrian jets reportedly have the more modern N019ME pulse-doppler radar , a larger overall payload capacity, improved navigation and communications systems, and upgraded cockpit displays. A much lower-quality shot of one of Syria’s upgraded MiG-29s. , Syrian MoD It’s not clear if all of Syria’s MiG-29s actually received the full set of upgrades. It’s unclear if Syria’s improved MiG-29s have the ability to employ Russian precision-guided munitions, which standard MiG-29SMs can. Even if they do have this capability, there’s no indication that the Syrian Air Force has any significant stocks of those weapons or that is has employed them operationally, if it has any of them at all. By every indication, Syrian combat aircraft have only employed unguided bombs and rockets in its largely indiscriminate air campaign against militants opposed to the regime of Bashar Al Assad, as well as civilians in areas where those groups operate. The updated jets that did get updated did gain the ability to launch R-77 air-to-air missiles and have been seen carrying the launch rails necessary to fire those weapons. In addition, Syria has acquired a number of Talisman self-escort jamming pods from Defense Initiatives in Belarus. The state of Syria’s MiG-29 fleet has already been in question after a mishap in March. That jet apparently suffered a technical malfunction of some kind shortly after takeoff causing the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot. This was the first-ever confirmed loss of a Syrian MiG-29. One can only wonder if the general condition of the aircraft and the Syrian Air Force’s maintenance capacity may have been contributing factors in that accident. It’s hard to imagine any of Syria’s MiG-29s in this condition, especially non-upgraded ones, will be able to soldier on much longer without serious maintenance work.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2020",Iran Equipped Its F-14s With Modified Hawk SAMs That Had Bombs Attached To Their Noses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The current regime in Iran is well known for repackaging and repurposing aircraft, weapons, and other military equipment that the United States supplied to the country when it was under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Some of the earliest and most novel efforts took place during the brutal Iran-Iraq War, including the combination of elements of the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile and the 750-pound class M117 bomb to create an air-to-surface weapon called Yasser for the Iranian Air Force’s F-14A Tomcats . Development of the Yasser began toward the tail end of the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988. Iran’s desire for a stand-off air-to-surface weapon would have made good sense as Iraq continued to bolster its air defense capabilities during the conflict. While the Shah had obtained thousands of AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missiles in the 1970s, the Iranian Air Force’s stocks had begun to run low as the fighting dragged on. Shortages of American-supplied missiles had already prompted Iran to experiment with converting MIM-23 missiles into air-to-air weapons for the F-14 as an alternative to the AIM-54 Phoenix as part of a project called Sky Hawk. In the end, some of Iran’s Tomcats were modified to carry one of the large missiles on each of their two wing glove hardpoints, where were more commonly occupied by AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles. A picture of two Iranian F-14 Tomcats. the aircraft in the foreground is carrying a pair of modified MIM-23 Hawk missiles., Iranian State Media Testing of the air-to-air Hawks, which Iran dubbed Sedjils, uncovered a number of issues. The F-14A’s then-state-of-the-art AN/AWG-9 fire control radar was never meant to work with the MIM-23 and getting the two systems to work together proved problematic. There were also concerns about whether the Sedjil might severely damage the Tomcat launching it. Ultimately Iran did conduct tests the Sedjils in 1986 and converted a relatively small number of MIM-23s into these air-to-air weapons, but their use was equally limited . Iran also continued to use its increasingly limited supply of AIM-54s and also managed to bolster its stocks of those weapons somewhat thanks to the Iran-Contra scandal . Much more recently, in 2017, Iran claimed to have created a domestic derivative of the Phoenix, called the Fakour-90 . The first tests of Yasser followed relatively soon after those of Sedjil. From what is known, the air-to-surface weapon was created by simply removing the nose section of the MIM-23 and replacing it with a modified M117 gravity bomb with its tail fins removed. F-14s could carry two Yassers in the same manner as the Sedjils. An inert M117 bomb on display in a much more typical configuration., Cliff via Wikimedia A Yasser, or a mockup thereof, at an Iranian military event sometime in the 2000s., Fars News Though described as an air-to-surface missile, it’s not clear how, or even if, Yasser was actually guided. The semi-active radar seeker in the Hawk – a name that is actually an acronym standing for Homing All the Way Killer – was clearly removed as part of the conversion process. Some contemporary pictures, seen in the Tweet below, show Yassers with modified tail fins, which could point to some kind of beam-riding guidance system, whereby the F-14A’s radar might lock onto a target on the ground and then steer the missile toward it. Iran may have also been able to leverage the Hawk’s existing analog autopilot as a crude way of guiding it toward the general target area. Another option would have been a type of crude command radio guidance, where the crew would physically steer the missile toward its mark. This is a guidance concept used in many early-generation air-to-surface missiles, including the late 1950s-era U.S. AGM-12 Bullpup. There is the possibility that it could have been employed as a large unguided rocket, as well. That might have offered a means of attacking large and stationary, but critical targets, such factories, power plants, and similar structures, at close range. By all accounts, guided or not, the accuracy of the Yasser was very poor and its use was very limited, with only a few reported operational launches. The weapons did offer a longer overall range than the AGM-65, being reportedly able to hit targets between 12.5 and almost 15 miles away. Exactly what happened to any remaining Yassers, as well as Sedjils, after the end of the Iran-Iraq War is unclear. Iran revisited the Sedjil idea in the 1990s or has kept some of the earlier converted missiles inventory, but there is no indication that it has ever fielded them on any widespread basis. What appears to be an official Iranian Ministry of Defense video, which was posted on YouTube in 2016 and seen below, does show an F-14 carrying a Sedjil indicating that those weapons remain available for use, or at least did so until relatively recently, if necessary. Yassers, or mockups thereof, continued to appear at military parades for decades, with one appearing at an event to mark the 25th anniversary of the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 2013 . It’s not clear if this means the weapons have been or are still available for use operationally. Iran’s F-14A fleet, which has become ever more difficult to operate and maintain over the years due to U.S. sanctions, would be the only launch platforms for either of the MIM-23B-based weapons, greatly limiting their utility in any future conflict. In addition, Iran has developed a number of precision-guided air-to-surface bombs and missiles, including the Zoobin , a television-guided missile that also uses a modified M117 bomb as its warhead. The Iranian Air Force also now has the Qadr and Qased , television-guided bombs that use 2,000-pound-class Mk 84 bombs as their warheads and are visually similar to the U.S. Air Force’s old GBU-8/B and GBU-15/B bombs, respectively. There is also a rocket-boosted version of Qased, a design akin to the U.S. Air Force’s AGM-130 . A Zoobin air-to-surface missile, which also uses a modified M117 as its warhead., M-ATF via Wikimedia Whatever the fate of the remaining Yassers, Iran continues to reverse engineer and otherwise adapt American and other foreign-supplied weapons designs from decades ago to produce its own derivatives, some of which represent very practical capabilities , while claims about others can often be implausible, bordering on the ridiculous . Hawks, which Iran claims to have created a local derivative of called Shahin, remain in service as surface-to-air weapons, as well. The Yasser is a prime example of the lengths Iran has gone to over the years to develop new and more advanced military capabilities locally in the face of sanctions that have limited its ability to source weapons and other equipment abroad. It’s a demonstration of both the ingenuity of the country’s defense industry and just how limited its resources have been in the past and still remain, in many respects, decades later.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 30, 2020",X-37B Space Plane’s Microwave Power Beam Experiment Is A Way Bigger Deal Than It Seems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The shadowy X-37B , the Air Force’s unmanned, reusable spacecraft, is set to launch for its sixth flight on May 16 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. While most of the payloads set for the flight are standard fare for space experiments, at least the ones that are disclosed, one of them has immense potential implications for the future of remote power generation and especially long-endurance unmanned aircraft propulsion. The X-37B’s upcoming mission is known as both Orbital Test Vehicle-6 (OTV-6) and U.S. Space Force-7 (USSF-7). It will carry out missions that will assess the effects of cosmic radiation and other “space effects” on plant seeds and various material samples. According to a Space Force press release, which went out on May 6, another payload aboard the X-37B will be an experimental system designed by the Naval Research Laboratory that is capable of capturing solar power and beaming that energy back to Earth in the form of microwaves. While the press releases of the Department of Defense and the Space Force are scant on details, the Naval Research Laboratory’s head of beamed power has explicitly stated in the past that this system has enormous implications when it comes to long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In addition, it could allow satellites to provide reliable power anywhere on the planet or even to spacecraft or other satellites in orbit . The X-37B, USAF The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has been promoting similar-sounding technologies over the last year. In October 2019, the NRL conducted a three-day long demonstration of the Navy’s latest power-beaming capabilities at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bethesda, Maryland. In the demonstration, the NRL transmitted a completely silent, invisible beam of 2-kilowatt laser power over 300 meters through the air over attendees’ heads. The demonstration was meant to showcase the safety and technological readiness of this utterly transformative concept. As far as the aforementioned applications of this capability, research or military outposts in remote locations would no longer have to rely on low-power solar systems or haul heavy generators and large amounts of fuel , but instead could bring a rectifying antenna, or rectenna, to capture energy in the form of microwaves beamed from satellites overhead. In addition, areas ravaged by natural disasters could use the system to generate electricity to aid in reconstruction efforts long before traditional electrical infrastructure is rebuilt. It could even power autonomous ships at sea. Dr. Paul Jaffe, an electronics engineer with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory who is leading the NRL’s research into power beaming, says that the technology will open up entirely new frontiers in terms of long-endurance unmanned aircraft. “If you have an electric drone that can fly more than an hour, you’re doing pretty well,” Jaffe said. “If we had a way to keep those drones and UAVs flying indefinitely, that would have really far-reaching implications. With power beaming, we have a path toward being able to do that.” The Navy was granted a patent for a similar system in 2016 invented by Jaffe. Beamed Power Aircraft Using lasers to beam power to small UAVs has been a subject of research for some time. The U.S. Air Force began testing lasers as a source of propulsion for small “lightcraft” as early as the 1980s and managed to get small cone-shaped craft to fly hundreds of feet in the air propelled only by laser beams. This new concept is different, though, in that the beamed power UAVs the Navy envisions will feature traditional propulsion systems (such as rotors or propellers) and instead have rectennas that capture the energy from directed energy beams to constantly replenish their electrical power reserves. The laser lightcraft of the 1980s and 1990s featured a parabolic mirror afterbody surrounded by a shroud. Intense pulses of laser light beamed into the afterbody are used to heat and pressurize air enough to create lift., NASA In 2011, NASA’s Glenn Research Center published research on laser power-beaming systems with funding from the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Revolutionary Munitions Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base in order to examine “long-range optical ‘refueling’ of electric platforms such as micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAV)”. Also in 2011, a RAND Corporation study conducted on behalf of the Air Force found that while the concept of laser-beamed power is sound, atmospheric interference from clouds could pose limitations on flight paths and ceilings. DARPA held a power beaming roundtable in 2015 which featured representatives from top defense contractors, research universities, and various DoD-operated laboratories. In 2018, DARPA demonstrated its latest laser-powered aircraft, the Silent Falcon , which the project lead Joseph A. Abate says was meant to “demonstrate that remote electric refueling of DoD systems via high energy laser power beaming to extend mission operation time in contested and remote environments.” While lasers have been examined for their use in beaming power to UAVs, these have typically involved ground-based or possibly airborne lasers to beam power. Placing the source of power generation and transmission in space is a new take on this concept, offering superior lines of sight and a continuous, renewable source of energy via the sun. Still, low earth orbit satellites circle the planet at incredibly high speeds and their maneuverability is limited, so there will be limitations to the Navy’s latest beamed power system, but as a proof of concept, it is essential. A constellation of satellites would likely be necessary to have a truly 24/7 supply of power, enabling UAVs to be ‘passed’ from satellite to satellite for continuous or tightly scheduled recharging. The same can be said for any receiver applications on the planet’s surface. Beamed Power And The Future of UAVs In 2014, the superintendent of the Naval Research Laboratory’s Plasma Physics Division Thomas Mehlhorn published a paper in IEEE Transactions on Plasma Sciences which offered an overview of plasma physics and pulsed power as they relate to national security. The article spans a wide variety of topics including nuclear weapons, inertial confinement fusion, and high-energy laser weapons. In the paper, Mehlhorn also touches upon the Navy’s beamed power UAV research at the time, writing that the continuous flight times offered by beamed power systems could change surveillance, reconnaissance, and communications gateway/relay missions forever: “Building upon the concept of scalability, rather than using a laser beam to kill a UAV, they began to pursue the idea of beaming power to a UAV to allow continuous flight, with potential application to both surveillance [Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)] and countermeasure missions. The team has pursued this idea using NRL applied research funds with the vision that long-range laser power beaming to UAVs could allow for long-duration flights with reduced manpower requirements for many Navy and DoD missions, including off-board decoys, persistent surveillance, and communication relays.” According to an October 2019 Navy.mil press release , the Navy’s beamed power system has also been endorsed by the Marines, Army, and Air Force and is expected to throughout the Department of Defense in the near future. The extent to which such systems have already been tested or deployed is unclear, although the Department of Energy has explored the concept of beaming microwaves from space since at least 2014. Doing the same from the ground, within line of sight of the aircraft, which can still be dozens or even hundreds of miles away depending on the altitudes involved, is such an easier task that it would be a bit puzzling if the technology isn’t already under development, or even possibly in some sort of clandestine operational state. The NRL program is being funded through the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), which “incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities” and “fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance.”, DOD Doing so from another aircraft is also clearly an objective based on the existing literature and would help mitigate the line of sight limitations with ground-based power beaming stations, but would sacrifice endurance and simplicity. In the 2011 RAND study cited above, the authors write that possibilities for beamed power applications include “ultra-high-altitude observation stations or communication relays and flocks of high-altitude sensor probes powered remotely from a large aircraft ‘mother ship.'” Meanwhile, the China Academy of Space Technology claimed to already be testing such a system in 2019 and said that a fully-functional Chinese microwave beaming power station in space could be deployed by 2050. As you can probably tell at this point, this technology has massive implications not only for the future of UAVs, but for all of mankind. Such a system could be used to keep UAVs in the air for very long periods of time to replace cell towers or communications satellites in the event of a crisis in a region or even for normal operations of increasingly complex communications networks. Unlike a tethered aerostat , these UAVs would require far less infrastructure, could be moved around at will for optimum coverage, and could land quickly for servicing. They could even deploy dozens of miles, or even further, away from their base stations. With a space-based power source, they could fly anywhere on earth. Obviously, the implications for overhead surveillance are equally impactful. So, while the X-37B’s latest mission details seem neat on a scientific level, the reality is the microwave system it is testing could change the game for many military-related applications and could actually open the door for near-continuous unmanned flight throughout the atmosphere.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Navy’s newest ballistic missile submarine, the Project 955A Borei-A class Knyaz Vladimir , has headed out for its “final” sea trials, indicating that it could finally enter service in the near future. The boat was originally set to formally join Russia’s Northern Fleet back in 2017, but that schedule repeatedly slipped due to technical issues. On May 13, 2020, the official press service the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet announced that Knyaz Vladimir, or Prince Vladimir in English , had left port in Severodvinsk and was headed into the White Sea. The sea trials will last “several days” and will include activities with the boat running on the surface, as well as submerged, according to the press release. “During the trials, the quality of the removal of problems exposed earlier will be checked, after which the term for including the new vessel into the structure of the Northern Fleet’s submarine forces will be set,” the release added, according to a rough translation from Russian state-run media outlet TASS . The Russian Navy presently has three Project 955 Borei class submarines in active service, the first of which entered service in 2013. The Borei class traces its roots back to the latter years of the Soviet Union and the construction of the first of those boats, the Yury Dolgorukiy , first started way back in 1996. The aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, especially the impacts on Russia’s economy, contributed to the delays in finishing that particular submarine and starting to build additional boats in the class. The Project 955 Borei class ballistic missile submarine Alexander Nevsky ., Russian MoD The initial Boreis are already some of the most advanced submarines Russia operates and were the first boats in the country’s navy to feature a pump-jet propulsion system. Enclosed pump-jet propulsors offer significant benefits, especially in how quiet they are under certain circumstances, compared to traditional exposed screws, capabilities that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Being as quiet as possible is essential for the survival of any submarine and is particularly important for the Boreis , which are a key component of Russia’s second-strike nuclear deterrent. The Project 955 submarines are also the first and so far only ones in the Russian Navy to carry the new RSM-56 Bulava nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile operationally. Russia’s sole remaining Typhoon class submarine Dmitriy Donskoi was involved in testing the RSM-56. The boats in the improved Project 955A Borei-A subclass, of which Knyaz Vladimir is the first example, are said to be even more advanced . The new submarines are significantly different externally from their predecessors, notably in the streamlining of the hull to remove a box-like superstructure around the missile tubes and the revised shape of the sail. The rudders and vertical endplates are also updated. All of these features make the submarine more efficient and maneuverable above and below the waves and helps reduce its acoustic signature even more. The Borei-A s also feature pop-out auxiliary thrusters for additional power at low speeds, where the pump-jet propulsion systems are not as capable. This will help the submarines be able to efficiently cruise very quietly at low speeds, which will further help keep them concealed and ensure their ability to retaliate during a nuclear confrontation. The boat’s pump-jet is less efficient at slower speeds, making the auxiliary thrusters an especially important feature. Beyond these structural and propulsion features, the Project 955As also have upgraded communications and sonar suites, as well as a variety of amenities for their crews, including a banya , or sauna. You can read all about this unique feature and the other improvements to the Borei-A class in this past War Zone piece . A view of the Knyaz Vladimir showing its streamlined hullform, especially the absence of the box-like superstructure around the missile tubes behind the submarine’s sail., TV Zvezda capture The scope of the differences between the Boreis and the Borei-A s has been a contributing factor in the difficulties in getting Knyaz Vladimir into service. Russia laid down the submarine in 2012, but only launched it in 2017, the same year the Kremlin had originally expected it to go to the Northern Fleet. It’s planned commission date has been pushed back every year since then. Most recently, it was reported that it would enter service in January , which came and went. Dips in Russia’s economy in recent years have often prompted the cancellation or indefinite delay of major defense programs. Last month, it emerged that the Kremlin had completely abandoned plans for huge new nuclear-powered destroyers and supersized frigates in no small part due to financial constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic , which has further depressed the global price of oil , a key source of income for Russia, will only increase pressure on the country’s budgets. At the same time, the Kremlin has made clear that it views modernizing its strategic arsenals as a critical expenditure and defense budget cuts have often gone to preserving those programs. The Borei-As , three more of which are under construction now and two more of which are supposed to get laid down this year, are certainly an important part of revitalizing the Russian Navy’s strategic submarine forces. The bulk of the country’s ballistic missile submarines are Soviet-era Delta III and Delta IV class types, also known as Project 667BDRs and 667BDRMs respectively , which first entered service in the 1980s. The Russian Navy clearly hopes that Knyaz Vladimir is now conducting its last sea trials before commissioning. It should become obvious relatively soon whether or not the first Borei-A is finally set to enter service or will need more work.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 26, 2020",Here Are The Navy Pilot Reports From Encounters With Mysterious Aircraft Off The East Coast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly one year ago, Navy fighter pilot testimony about a seemingly bizarre rash of encounters with unidentified craft flying in restricted airspace off the east coast hit the news cycle with a bang . In the months that have followed, limited additional details about those encounters have come to light. Meanwhile, The War Zone has been slowly assembling the building blocks of a case that may explain them. What we were still missing was any official Navy documentation that alludes to them. Now that has changed, and you may be surprised as to what these newly obtained documents actually say and when the incidents they described occurred—or didn’t occur—for that matter. The War Zone obtained the eight hazard reports, all of which are marked “Unclassified” and “For Official Use Only,” via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Naval Safety Center. Seven of them involve F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and occurred at various times between 2013 and 2014 in a patch of airspace off the coast of Virginia and North Carolina known as the W-72 warning area. The eighth incidents took place in 2019 and involved an EA-18G Growler flying in a different portion of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Maryland called the W-386 warning area. The FOIA officer handling our request said that these were the only eight reports in the Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS) Aviation Mishap and Hazard Reporting System (WAMHRS) to deal with naval aviation encounters with unidentified objects, balloons, and any other similar objects anywhere. WAMHRS is a centralized computer database that is supposed to contain all such hazard and flight incident reports that Navy aviation units file with the Naval Safety Center. An airspace map of the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States showing the W-72 warning area, where the incidents in seven of the eight reports occurred. The last incident occurred in Warning Area W-386, which is also seen here., vfrmap.com #1, June 27, 2013: F/A-18F Super Hornet, Strike Fighter Squadron 11 On June 27, 2013, an F/A-18F Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia had an encounter with an “aircraft [that] was white in color and approximately the size and shape of a drone or missile” in the W-72 warning area. The jet’s crew “visually acquired” it as they saw it “pass down the right side of their aircraft with approximately 200 feet of lateral separation” while flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet. It was climbing and had a visible exhaust trail. Neither the Super Hornet nor NAS Oceana recorded a radar track of the object. Commander, Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic, abbreviated in the report CSFWL, “contacted operating units but no one reported operations of this nature.” Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FASCFAC VACAPES) “reviewed radar tapes and no aircraft was indentified [sic] or noted in the area.” The Navy did not issue any Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) or Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) based on this hazard report, but did issue internal notices to tactical aviation units, air traffic controllers, and unmanned aerial vehicle operators to be aware of the potential hazards posed by unauthorized or uncoordinated drone operations. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA #2, Nov. 18, 2013: F/A-18E Super Hornet, Strike Fighter Squadron 143 An F/A-18E Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 143 (VFA-143), flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, spotted an object in the W-72 warning zone via radar off its nose at around 12,000 feet and a speed of approximately 0.1 Mach on Nov. 18, 2013. “The aircraft had an approximately 5-foot wingspan and was colored white with no other distinguishable features,” according to the pilot who was able to visually acquire the object and tracked it for an hour. This report says that the Navy concluded that this object was an unmanned aerial system (UAS), but that Commander, Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic and Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FASCFAC VACAPES), the latter of which is also identified here by its callsign Giant Killer, was not able to ascertain the operator. As was the case on June 27, the Navy issued a series of internal warnings, but there is no indication that it issued any Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) or Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). The unit insignia for Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FASCFAC VACAPES), which also includes the Giant Killer callsign., USN Most curiously, this report notes that “surface traffic was light with only a single stationary commercial fishing trawler and a single unidentified US Naval vessel traveling south” during the incident, but that “the identity of the Naval vessel in the vicinity was undetermined.” It’s not at all clear how the Navy was able to determine that one of its ships was operating on the surface in the same general area, but not able to figure out which ship it was specifically. At the end of the report, the concern regarding unknown aircraft operating in the warning areas is clearly growing more palpable. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA #3, Nov. 18, 2013: F/A-18E Super Hornet, Strike Fighter Squadron 14 3 The report is effectively identical to the other one from Nov. 18, 2013, but is confirmation from the pilot of a second F/A-18E Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 143 (VFA-143) that they saw the same object at roughly the same position. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA #4, Mar. 26, 2014: F/A-18E Super Hornet, Strike Fighter Squadron 106 On Mar. 26, 2014, an F/A-18E Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 106 (VFA-106), flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana, detected a possible radar track at around 19,000 feet and with a speed of 0.1 Mach in the W-72 warning area. The pilot’s wingman did not have the object on radar and there was a debate about whether it might be a false track given high winds, gusting at over 100 knots at 18,000 feet. “The unknown aircraft appeared to be small in size, approximately the size of a suitcase, and silver in color,” according to the report. The pilot was only able to pass within 1,000 feet of it and could not identify it. After that pass, they lost sight of it and never regained visual contact. This report notes that Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FASCFAC VACAPES)  again did not spot this object on its radar screens. However, the commanding officer of VFA-106 also noted that FASCFAC VACAPES “cannot detect a target this size if it is not squawking IFF [Identification Friend or Foe] or communicating via radio,” which “presents a significant safety concern, given that this unknown aircraft was detected in an exclusive use area.” “I feel it may only be a matter of time before one of our F/A-18 aircraft has a mid-air collision with an unidentified UAS [unmanned aerial system],” the head of VFA-106 added in their comments. The report also says that “FACSFAC VACAPES has received multiple UAS sightings in the recent months,” but does not say how many of those sightings resulted in sending in hazard reports. There’s no indication that this particular report resulted in any Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) or Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), though it did spark additional internal Navy alerts. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN #5, Apr. 23, 2014: F/A-18F Super Hornet, Strike Fighter Squadron 11 Another F/A-18F Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11) had an encounter with multiple “unidentified aerial devices” (UAD) on Apr. 23, 2014, while flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana and operating in the W-72 warning area. The crew initially detected two UADs on radar, one at 12,000 feet and another at 15,000 feet, both apparently stationary or near-stationary at 0.0 Mach. They then confirmed both of these objects using the jet’s Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) system. While investigating the first pair of UADs, another two appeared to pass through the ATFLIR field of vision at high-speed. The two moving objects did not appear on the aircraft’s radar. The typical slew of internal warnings followed after the Navy determined it could not identify the objects or their operators. The commanding officer of VFA-11 notably included a note similar in tone to the one that the head of VFA-106 submitted along with the hazard report on Mar. 26, 2014. “Although this report is primarily submitted for tracking purposes, it is only a matter of time before this results in a midair [collision] in W-72,” they said. In addition, the VFA-11 commander noted that this was the second instance in 10 months that one of the aircraft’s squadron had had such an encounter. This is a reference to the June 27, 2013 report and makes clear that this particular squadron had not run into any other unidentified object in between these two incidents. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA #6, Apr. 24, 2014: Two F/A-18F Super Hornets, Strike Fighter Squadron 11 On Apr. 24, 2014, within a day of the F/A-18F Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11) having its encounter with four “unidentified aerial devices” (UAD), two more F/A-18Fs made radar contact with another UAD in the W-72 warning area while conducting Basic Fighter Maneuvering (BFM aka dogfighting) out of Naval Air Station Oceana. Both aircraft were able to maintain a radar track with the object, which was stationary or near-stationary at 0.0 Mach at 11,000 feet. The aircraft were also able to lock onto the object with their CATM-9Xs, a captive-carry training version of the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile . However, in this instance, neither one made visual contact. The Navy issued more internal warnings and the commander of VFA-11 noted that this was the third such incident in 10 months for the squadron. That officer also noted that this encounter had occurred less than 24 hours after the one on Apr. 23. USN USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA #7, Apr. 27, 2014: F/A-18F Super Hornet, Strike Fighter Squadron 11 On Apr. 27, 2014, for the third time in five days, the crew of a F/A-18F from Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), flying out of NAS Ocean and operating in the W-72 warning area, reported encountering an unknown aerial device. This report is the most spartan in its details of the three, but describes a “near mid-air collision with balloon like object.” This is a notably more serious report than the other two from April 2014. It is also the first to give any kind of substantive description of the object, one that would match up with the two previous reports of stationary or near-stationary UADs at high-altitude in the W-72 warning area. Again, Navy officials sent out a host of internal warnings. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA #8, Feb. 13, 2019: EA-18G Growler, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 On Feb. 13, 2019, nearly five years after the last recorded encounter with an unidentified object in the Naval Safety Center’s databases, the crew of an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23), flying out Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland and conducting activities in the W-386 warning area, visually spotted what they specifically described as “a red weather balloon” at 27,000 feet. Neither Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FASCFAC VACAPES), again referred to by its callsign Giant Killer, nor the Echo Control team responsible for overseeing operations in the Atlantic Test Ranges off the coast, were aware of any scheduled balloon activity. The Federal Aviation Administration did not have any relevant notices to airmen (NOTAM), either. The report says that the Navy did not identify the individuals or organizations that might have released the balloon and issued various internal warnings in response to the incident. USN via FOIA USN via FOIA USN via FOIA More reports? As noted, these are the only eight hazard or flight incident reports covering naval aviation encounters with unidentified objects, balloons, and any other similar objects anywhere that appear in the Web-Enabled Safety System (WESS) Aviation Mishap and Hazard Reporting System (WAMHRS), according to the Naval Safety Center. This is immediately curious given extensive previous reports, including from The War Zone , citing Navy pilots, on and off the record, who have said that these kinds of sightings over the Atlantic were occurring frequently between 2014 and 2015. In addition, The War Zone obtained a copy of a report of another incident involving an F/A-18E Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 106 (VFA-106) that occurred on March 13, 2018. The pilot in this instance said they tracked four separate unknown objects on their radar in the W-122 warning area, which sits off the coast of North Carolina. The additional incident report that The War Zone received., Anonymous The objects were all flying at approximately 0.1 Mach at altitudes between 16,000 and 22,000 feet, according to the report. The pilot visually identified one at 20,000 feet that “appeared to be a quadcopter-type drone, 3-4 feet wide.” They added that the objects did not appear to be doing anything in particular and were stationary or near-stationary. They were also spread out across an area approximately 40 to 50 miles wide, with the closest one being 15 miles away from the one boat that the pilot noted seeing down below. An airspace map showing the W-122 waring area of the coast of North Carolina where the incident in the report The War Zone received reportedly occurred. W-72, where the bulk of the incidents in other reports we obtained took place, is visible to the north., vfrmap.com This specific description of something approximating a quadcopter is interesting, as is the fact that the report identifies the jet as one equipped with the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The War Zone was first to explain how this new radar for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets could allow them to more easily spot objects with small radar cross-sections that would have gone unnoticed by previous mechanically scanned-array fire control radars. The report lacks a serial number, raising questions about where it might have ended up being submitted in the end and what official action it might have prompted on the Navy’s part. From our understanding, VFA-106 received this and other reports relating to encounters with unidentified objects and then passed them the chain of command to Commander, Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic. The assumption would have been that these would have then gone to the Naval Safety Center via WAMHRS, but, per our FOIA, this does not appear to have been the case. Given the general safety concerns that the commanding officers of the squadrons involved in many of the incidents clearly had, it seems odd that these reports would not have made it into that database. There is the possibility that, for whatever reason, these reports subsequently began going through separate or even classified channels to commands other than the Naval Safety Center. However, again, given the broader flight safety concerns, one would imagine it would still have imperative to notify the entire service’s aviation elements of the potential risks via an unclassified hazard report. The Apr. 27, 2014, report would seem to show that it is possible to prompt those kinds of alerts even with a report with very minimal specific details. The apparent existence of hazard reports that did not actually make their way to the Naval Safety Center is reminiscent in some respects to the investigation into the so-called Tic Tac unidentified object that a pair of F/A-18F Super Hornets spotted flying near the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in 2004. After that encounter, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group’s top intelligence officer sent a full report to the intelligence office within the U.S. Navy’s 3rd Fleet, which is headquartered in San Diego, California, via secure Email. For reasons that remain unexplained, the senior intelligence officer there declined to send the report any further up the chain of command and deleted the Email. What is also puzzlingly absent from this group of documents are any reports that occurred in the late-2014 to mid-2015 timeframe. A limited number of high profile aircrew witnesses have attested that this is when a rash of strange encounters happened, especially surrounding work-ups of the USS Theodore Roosevelt prior to deployment. Reporting surrounding these accounts have consistently made international news and are constantly touted as evidence that UFOs, at least in the traditional sense, exist. No safety reports about those encounters have been issued according to the people that are officially tasked with handling them. In addition, it was claimed by one of the pilots that have discussed these events publically that safety reports surrounding the 2015 incidents led to the issuance of a Notice To Airman (NOTAM) warning of such risks out in the controlled airspace off Virginia’s coastline, although we haven’t been able to find proof that such a NOTAM actually existed. The sprawling ramp at the Navy’s master fighter base on the East Coast, NAS Oceana. , Google Earth It is also curious that nearly half of the incidents that were reported came from one squadron, VFA-11, with the rest being based on experiences by one squadron each. Considering that there are many squadrons based at NAS Oceana, and many more based at other bases nearby, this could point to a situation in which only certain units were officially reporting these encounters or that the criteria for doing so varied from one unit to the next. For instance, maybe one squadron would write and elevate a safety report if something was spotted in a restricted area, while another would only do so if a near-miss occurred. It also could be a function of the radar technology each unit possessed during the time period. As we discussed earlier, it is established that the Super Hornets that had the AN/APG-79 AESA radars could detect these small objects as opposed to Hornets and Super Hornets that had older AN/APG-73 mechanically scanned arrays. This, combined with the possibility that some of these reports were funneled through some other channel, could explain why so few reports exist and none of them come from when these incidents were supposedly at their height in terms of frequency. Yet this would be puzzling as it would ignore the safety of aviators who rely on this information. It is notable that an encounter with one craft that the Navy has now officially released a video of was not in these reports, either. On the other hand, maybe far fewer instances of this nature actually occurred than what we have been led to believe. It’s also worth noting that according to the reports that we now have, it’s clear that none of these objects possessed extreme performance as some have posited—quite the contrary actually. This also fits with what we have heard, both on and off the record, since these events were made public. So no, as we expected, there isn’t any proof here of extremely exotic flying craft or saucers with amazing kinematic performance. Assuming they do not belong to the U.S. government, the fact that they are being deployed in such sensitive airspace seemingly unimpeded is a far larger national security concern than it may seem at first glance. It is not the Navy’s job to police America’s airspace, it is the Air Force’s. So far, the Department of Defense has been all but silent about the Air Force’s involvement in these events. We have posed a number of specific questions about these facts to the Defense Department, but have gotten totally stonewalled in a remarkably rude manner. You can learn more about this bizarre saga in this past piece of ours , but suffice it to say, that in our attempts at engagement with the DoD on the Air Force’s involvement in all this, we did indirectly find out that according to Langley Air Force Base’s 1st Fighter Wing, which is located very near NAS Oceana and their F-22 Raptors use the same general airspace as the Super Hornets to train in daily, their crews had had not experienced any similar phenomena, or at least were not willing to disclose that they had. As to what the aircrews who did file the reports posted above actually saw and why those things were where they were, we believe there is an explanation, or at least explanations, of a very terrestrial nature. We have detailed some of this both directly and indirectly in the past , but suffice it to say, the electronic intelligence that an adversary could gather in the training ranges frequented by pretty much all of America’s tactical fighter aircraft and other high-end sensor aircraft, as well as surface combatants, would be extremely valuable, especially considering they would be operating unimpeded, largely using their full sensor, electronic warfare, and communications suites. Doing so would also sow a level of confusion while presenting little risk, too. This sounds like a page ripped from an increasingly familiar playbook. We will dive deeper into the possibilities surrounding these strange events off America’s east coast in an upcoming piece, but for now, at least we have all the safety report documentation that the Naval Safety Center says it has on these bizarre events.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 7, 2020",Navy Shelves Review That Might Have Cut Ford Class Production To Build Smaller Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has shelved plans to conduct a review of its aircraft carrier fleets , which was set to explore the possibility of cutting the troubled Gerald R. Ford class to just four ships and buying smaller flattops . This comes as Kenneth Braithwaite, the man in line to become the next Secretary of the Navy, has openly endorsed the Ford class and questioned the value of lighter carriers. USNI News was first to report that Acting Secretary of the Navy James McPherson had decided not to proceed with the carrier study, formally known as Future Carrier 2030, on May 12, 2020. News that the service would be reviewing its carrier force structure had only first emerged in March. McPherson took over as Acting Secretary in April after then-Acting Secretary Thomas Modly resigned in the wake of a scandal surrounding a major outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus onboard the Nimitz class carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and the decision to fire that ship’s commanding officer Captain Brett Crozier over a letter warning about the severity of that situation. “Acting Secretary of the Navy James E. McPherson recently determined the Department of the Navy will not, for the time being, move forward with the Future Carrier 2030 effort,” Navy spokesperson Commander Sarah Higgins informed USNI News . “DON will fully support the Department of Defense’s internal study on future force structure requirements, which will include a carrier review.” Acting Secretary of the Navy James McPherson, left, wearing a mask due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visits Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes in Illinois., USN That Navy is already involved in a major review of plans for the future structure of its surface and submarine fleets, which the service originally planned to complete some time in 2019. This assessment has gotten repeatedly pushed back amid a separate back-and-forth debate over the total size of the Navy fleets. Since 2016, there has been a Congressional mandate to meet a goal of 355 ships and submarines in the service’s active duty fleets, which it has continually struggled to work toward . Persistent troubles with the first-in-class Ford , which has, at best, limited capabilities at this time and looks set to be a non-operational training ship for the foreseeable future, along with the growing costs associated with the subsequent ships in the class, have been not insignificant factors in those discussions. How to integrate ever-larger and more capable unmanned surface vessels (USV) and unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) into the Navy’s fleets has also become an increasingly important topic of debate . The Navy only expects to take delivery of the last of the first four Fords , the future USS Doris Miller , in 2032. Reports indicated that the Future Carrier 2030 study would look at ending the acquisition of any more of these supercarriers at that time and shifting to a new, smaller, and cheaper class of likely non-nuclear-powered carriers. The service was also expected to reexamine how it employed carriers, in general, potentially moving away from using them for front-line operations during major conflicts and using them instead for controlling broad areas of the ocean, as well as protecting critical supply lines. A fleet of smaller carriers could be ideal for those kinds of missions and the concepts of operation are reminiscent of how the Navy employed dozens of light escort carriers during World War II. However, in written responses to questions ahead of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary of the Navy nominee Kenneth Braithwaite called the utility of lighter carriers into question and expressed clear support for the Ford class. “It is my understanding that a 2016 study completed by the RAND Corporation, which examined notional aircraft carrier variants that could replace or supplement the Ford class CVN, confirmed the design attributes of the Ford class CVN in a near-peer conflict,” Braithwaite said, using the abbreviation for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier when talking about the Ford . “It is further my understanding that the capabilities of survivability, maintainability, and power projection have been designed into our Ford class CVNs to support the high-end fight,” he continued. “However, should circumstances change, I will keep an open mind to other alternatives that provide the right warfighting capabilities required by the Combatant Commanders.” The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN It is worth noting that Braithwaite did not dismiss the possibility of revisiting alternate carrier designs in the future. In April, Defense News reported that the Office of the Secretary of Defense had produced its own initial review of the Navy’s force structure that called for the elimination of two carriers from the planned final total. At the same time, as is the case with the 355-ship-fleet, Congress has enshrined in law a requirement that the Navy must always be working toward having at least 12 supercarriers. Legislators have repeatedly pushed back at plans to cut flattops from the service’s force structure, most recently in the case of the Trump Administration’s brief and still curious push last year to retire the Nimitz class USS Harry S. Truman ahead of schedule. The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman ., USN What might actually happen in the end to the Navy’s carrier plans remains to be seen. Defense budget cuts were already looming before the COVID-19 crisis shook the U.S. economy. As Braithwaite himself noted by raising the RAND Corporation study from four years ago, discussions about the service possibly buying smaller, conventionally powered carriers that are cheaper to build and operate than supercarriers and could supplement or supplant those larger ships in a variety of operational scenarios are hardly new . The Navy, together with the U.S. Marine Corps, is already actively experimenting with the Lightning Carrier concept , which involves configuring amphibious assault ships for more sustained operations using F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . Again, ships in this configuration are not meant to replace supercarriers, but instead offer a valuable alternative, or supplemental aviation capacity for a traditional carrier strike group, in certain situations. The first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS Wasp seen with an unusually large number of F-35Bs on board last year., USN There also remains a standing debate about whether it makes sense to pour so many resources into a relatively small number of very large carriers. These concerns are magnified when considering the potential vulnerability of supercarriers to new and emerging anti-access and area denial capabilities that major adversaries, such as China and Russia , are steadily developing and fielding. The Navy has experienced a tumultuous past few years when it comes to its senior leadership, so it very much remains to be seen what direction the service will take, broadly, if Braithwaite does get confirmed . If and when this happens, which does seem likely, he will be the first confirmed Secretary of the Navy since Richard Spencer got forced out over a scandal concerning the handling of a war crimes case against Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher in November 2019. Spencer had also famously told President Donald Trump to fire him if all of Ford ‘s Advanced Weapon Elevators were not working when the ship departed its most recent major stint in dry dock. The former Secretary of the Navy had subsequently lashed out at members of Congress and shipbuilding Huntington Ingalls after it became clear that that goal would not get met. All told, despite all the criticisms and concerns, the Navy’s existing plans for the Ford class now seem secure for the moment. Still, the debates about the future composition of the service’s carrier fleets don’t appear to be going away, either. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 3, 2018",Raytheon Is Developing A Ramjet Artillery Round For The Army’s New Super Howitzers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has hired Raytheon, working in partnership with the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, to begin developing a new 155mm ramjet-powered long-range artillery round able to hit targets more than 60 miles away. This is one of a number of novel ammunition types that the service is now exploring as companions for its future long-range 155mm howitzers . Raytheon announced it had received $7.9 million from the Army to get started on the ramjet artillery shell, also referred to as the XM1155, on May 11, 2020. The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, better known by the Dutch acronym TNO, will be responsible for developing the ramjet engine. Raytheon will then integrate that into the rest of the projectile, which it will design and build. “The tactical 155mm XM1155 will be able to strike moving and stationary high-value targets on land and at sea,” according to Raytheon’s press release. “The maneuverable, extended-range airframe will be compatible with legacy and future 155mm artillery systems.” Raytheon did not offer any specific details about its design, but the ramjet will be at its core. The projectile will have to first get to an appropriate velocity for this engine to function optimally. Past ramjet artillery round designs have used rocket boosters or large conventional propelling charges to provide this initial burst of speed. The sustained supersonic flight, coupled with the fact the engine is actually pulling the projectile through the air, which helps reduce drag, are at the core of the significantly extended range capabilities. A diagram showing the basic components of a notional ramjet artillery round from a report that TNO employees presented a conference in 2018., TNO The company also said that it would leverage its past experience with the M982 Excalibur precision-guided 155mm artillery shell. The Excalibur, which the Army, as well as the U.S. Marines, have been using for more than a decade, is only capable of hitting stationary targets using its GPS-assisted inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package. The M982 has a maximum range of 20 miles. The XM1155’s ability to hit moving targets will require a more robust guidance system. The projectile will most likely feature some form of multi-mode guidance, such as using GPS-INS to get to the target area and then switching over to a combination of millimeter-wave radar or imaging infrared to find and then strike the target. This would also allow the shells to strike fixed targets using the GPS-INS guidance alone. A briefing slide showing the flight profile of a notional XM1155 shell., US Army Multi-mode guidance packages , which can also include laser guidance , are becoming increasingly the default for precision-guided munitions. In addition to the ability to hit moving objects, this allows for engagement of targets in bad weather and at night and gives the weapon alternate ways to find its mark even if the enemy jams or blinds one or more of the guidance systems. The XM1155 would also increase the flexibility of the Army’s 155mm howitzers just by virtue of its extreme range capabilities. A six-gun battery firing the Army’s new XM1113 155mm shell , a rocket-assisted type that can hit targets up to 40 miles away, can engage targets within an approximately 1,500 square mile circle around their firing positions. A ramjet-powered projectile with a range of just over 60 miles would increase that area to 12,000 square miles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mr81Uvoon7Y Howitzers and other ground-based artillery already have the benefit of being able to relatively rapidly shift focus from one target area to another, as well as respond to requests for fire support faster, compared to airstrikes, and don’t end up grounded or their capabilities degraded by bad weather. The also offer a lower cost alternative to fixed wing aircraft and helicopters that provides more persistent coverage , too. Raytheon and TNO’s ramjet-powered projectile would offer immense benefits for Army artillery units, especially in distributed operations, where they could find themselves having to rapidly support forces across a broad area. The added range also helps keep them protected from enemy counter-attacks. “The ramjet-powered artillery round will allow our nation’s military to strike farther and faster than anything our adversaries have in their arsenals,” Tom Laliberty, Vice President of Land Warfare and Air Defense at Raytheon’s Missiles and Defense division, said in the May 11 statement. Concerns about gaps in the Army’s artillery capabilities compared to potential near-peer adversaries, especially Russia, is what is driving the service to develop new longer-range ammunition, such as the XM1155, and huge new howitzers to fire those rounds. The service has also been working on similarly extending the range and capabilities of its ground-launched rocket artillery , as well as initiating programs to develop ultra-long-range “ super guns ” and land-based ballistic and cruise missiles . The ramjet-powered shell is set to be a key component of the overall Extended Range Cannon Artillery program , which is also developing new extra-long 155mm guns. Prototype self-propelled ERCA howitzers, known as XM1299s and derived from the venerable M109 family , have already conducted numerous tests and there has also been work on towed versions based on the M777 . A briefing slide shows the now-in-development self-propelled XM1299 howitzer and its new XM907 gun, as well as the XM1113 rocket-assisted shell and a notional depiction of the XM1155 ramjet-powered round, along with other systems in development under the Extended Range Cannon Artillery program., US Army The rocket-assisted XM1113 round, which General Dynamics and Norwegian defense contractor Nammo are developing, is another part of this broader artillery development effort. Boeing and Nammo have been working on a separate ramjet-powered design since 2018, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . The Army is also interested in ammunition to specifically expand the anti-armor capabilities of its howitzers. A mock-up of the Boeing-Nammo ramjet artillery round design., Joseph Trevithick In addition, BAE Systems is looking to develop versions of its kinetic Hypervelocity Projectile, or HVP, which it originally developed for use in electromagnetic railguns , that will work with conventional guns, such as 155mm howitzers and the U.S. Navy’s five-inch guns. You can read much more about the HVP in this past War Zone piece . A briefing slide showing the potential applications of the HVP beyond use in electromagnetic railguns., USN These Army artillery ammunition developments could be of interest to the Marine Corps, though that service says it is looking to scale back its howitzer units as part of a radical force restructuring plan . The Navy might also be interested in the ramjet-powered rounds as a way to finally make use of the 155mm Advanced Gun Systems on its Zumwalt class destroyers. The service canceled the development of its own long-range 155mm guided shell after costs ballooned , leaving the AGS as effectively dead weight. There has already been talk about integrating the HVP with these guns . With respect to the XM1155, the small size of Raytheon’s current contract indicates this particular program is still in the very early stages of development. However, the Army has made clear that it wants to modernize its artillery branch and do so quickly. Ramjet-powered artillery rounds definitely hold the exciting potential to further increase the capabilities of the service’s future long-range howitzers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 30, 2019",This Is What Ground Forces Look Like To An Electronic Warfare System And Why It’s A Big Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of the U.S. Army’s 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment has offered an interesting and unusually detailed look at the threat that electronic warfare and electronic support measures pose to American troops on the modern battlefield. The likelihood of a potential adversary monitoring friendly movements via electronic emissions and launching electronic attacks, as well as kinetic ones , on those units has only grown in recent years, with Russia , in particular, demonstrating just how effective these capabilities can be in Ukraine and Syria . American forces in Syria , as well as troops in Europe , have been also subjected to Russia’s electronic harassment, as well, underscoring these threats. On May 7, 2020, Army Colonel Scott Woodward, the commander of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment , posted an annotated satellite image on Twitter that showed the electronic emissions signature of a battalion-sized element, along with support units, or “trains,” during an exercise at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin in California. The 11th is the unit at the NTC that is dedicated to playing the role of enemy troops, or the Opposing Forces (OPFOR), during exercises and has a fleet of modified vehicles and other systems to mimic the capabilities and visual appearance of potential adversaries . Woodward’s Tweet was in response to a question about the value of certain types of modern visible camouflage . He did say that under the right circumstances that traditional methods of concealment, especially nets that break up the general outline of vehicles and make them harder to immediately identify, an important general camouflage concept , could still be useful. “Concealment will help you stay alive a little longer in the close fight,” he wrote along with sharing the image. “What does your EW [electronic warfare] footprint look like is the larger question. If I can see you like this, it doesn’t matter how much camo you have.” The colonel said that the specific force seen in the image had thought the natural cover in that area of the NTC, known as Moose Gardens, had sufficiently concealed their positions and that they were also protected by the fact that it was dark. He said that his opponents in the exercise used their electronic warfare systems to spot his troops from a distance of 12 kilometers away, or nearly seven and a half miles. Woodward did not explain exactly what systems were generating the electronic signature that his opponents were able to spot, but communications and data-sharing systems certainly produce regular emissions, as do certain kinds of sensors, especially radars. The colonel also pointed out that these dangers were only going to grow as time goes on and new systems begin to enter service. He specifically pointed out that the active protection systems that the Army is increasingly interested in installing on various vehicles to protect against anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-tank weapons can dramatically increase a unit’s signature in the electromagnetic spectrum. These defensive systems rely on a variety of sensors, including small radars , to detect incoming threats. The 11th’s commanding officer also did not say what type of system the other side had used to locate his forces. On the ground, the Army has a number of vehicle-mounted and dismounted signals intelligence systems that have secondary abilities to detect, geo-locate, and then track targets by their electronic emissions. The service also has aerial signals intelligence capabilities on both manned and unmanned platforms that can perform these functions. None of these systems have the ability to jam or otherwise attack the source of those emissions. For some years now, the Army has been working to reinvigorate its ground-based electronic warfare and electronic support measures capabilities with new and improved systems, as well as create new units focused on employing these tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well. Two years ago, the service’s Rapid Equipping Force (REF) notably created a prototype Electronic Warfare Tactical Vehicle (EWTV) based on an M1235 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP). The EWTV used a modified version of a system primarily originally designed to spot and then jam remotely-triggered improvised explosive devices (IED) to spot and monitor hostile electronic signals, as well as attack them. The prototype Electronic Warfare Tactical Vehicle., US Army The Army has also been looking to expand its aerial electronic warfare capabilities, especially podded systems that its MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones can carry. In 2012, the service had begun development of the Networked Electronic Warfare Remotely Operated (NERO) pod in cooperation with what was then the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), primarily as an airborne tool to jam IED triggers. As with the EWTV, NERO’s electronic warfare capabilities had the potential for broader applications. An MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone carrying a NERO pod., US Army More recently, the Army hired Lockheed Martin to develop the Silent CROW pod, which also has electronic and signals intelligence, as well as cyber warfare capabilities, as part of the service’s Multi-function Electronic Warfare-Air Large (MFEW-AL) program. On Apr. 29, Lockheed Martin announced Silent CROW was moving into the second phase of development after initial risk reduction testing using an Army UV-18 Twin Otter fixed-wing aircraft as a surrogate platform to carry the system. An artist’s conception of an MQ-1C Gray Eagle carrying the Silent CROW pod under its right wing., Lockheed Martin This is all in line with a resurgence of interest in electronic warfare, as well as emerging cyber warfare capabilities , across the U.S. military. The U.S. Marine Corps is pursuing similar efforts to the Army’s to improve the ability of its ground forces to fight in the electromagnetic spectrum and the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy both have significant electronic and cyber warfare projects in the works, as well. This is on top of the extensive electronic warfare and electronic support measures systems that both of these services field already . With even more robust electronic warfare systems that also incorporate intelligence-gathering and cyber capabilities, Army units, as well as those from other branches, will have the ability to spot their opponents at extended distances regardless of how concealed they might be visually, just as they did with the elements of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at the NTC. They will also be able to monitor their activities to glean additional information and launch electronic attacks on them. Jamming and cyber attacks could make it difficult for them to coordinate other friendly units and cut them off from other sources of information. It could also disorient and confuse hostile forces, including by creating virtual decoys that appear to an adversary’s sensors , or even on their own electronic warfare systems, to draw their attention away from actual American troops. The RC-12 Guardrail has been one of the Army’s most powerful signals intelligence tools for decades. Now in its latest RC-12X form, it provides multi-mission electronic surveillance support. , US Army Just being able to geolocate enemy forces electronically, which they might not be aware is even happening, opens up the immediate possibility of launching artillery or airstrikes against those positions. Mixing those strikes together with additional electronic or cyber attacks could be particularly devastating. American forces are also at risk of having the same things done to them. The role that electronic warfare, alongside electronic and other intelligence activity and cyber attacks, has played in Russian operations in Ukraine has been a major factor behind this renewed focus on similar capabilities within the U.S. military. Christian Brose, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the head of strategy at tech startup Anduril Industries , described a prototypical series of events during an engagement in Ukraine in his new book The Kill Chain: Defending America in the Future of High-Tech Warfare . Brose describes an incident in which someone, likely a member of Russia’s intelligence community , spuriously called the mother of a Ukrainian commander and told her that her son was dead. She then hurriedly called his unencrypted cell phone to try to confirm whether this was true. When he called her back to tell everything was okay, Russian troops geolocated his forces’ positions from his cell phone signal and hit them with a rocket artillery barrage, killing him in the process. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense editor and good friend of The War Zone shared the full passage on Twitter. This is just one of a number of similar anecdotes that have come out of Ukraine’s conflict with Russia, as well as Russian-backed proxies , in its eastern Donbass region since it began in 2014. There have also been reports that American troops in Europe have been victims of similar cyber attacks and other electronic espionage seeking to gain information about their families, among other things. Geo-locating and attacking forces by their electronic emissions, as well as jamming those transmissions to sow further confusion, has become an important component of Russia’s tactical doctrine . GPS spoofing is another emerging capability that Russia has been quick to embrace. Russia has not limited these activities to Ukraine, either. There have been numerous reports of Russian electronic warfare attacks in Syria that are either directed at American forces or otherwise impact their operations indirectly. Electronic warfare has become such a major component of large-scale exercises in Russia that the effects often spill over into neighboring countries , as well. A Russian R-330Zh Zhitel electronic warfare system, which is used to jam cellular satellite communications., Vitaly Kuzmin The Kremlin hasn’t been the only one to embrace these capabilities, either. China , as well as other smaller countries , also see a clear benefit in developing electronic and cyber warfare systems, especially to counter countries, such as the United States, that have long held advantages in areas including long-range communications and data-sharing, electronic and signals intelligence, and satellite navigation. So-called “emissions control” tactics, or EMCON, are valuable to reduce the risk that electronic surveillance and attacks pose, but can also limit a friendly forces’ general situational awareness and their ability to coordinate with each other. As such, forcing an opponent to go into a reduced emission state or a fully radio-silent operating mode can still have the effect of degrading their capabilities to some degree. The Wolfhound is a backpack-mounted radio direction-finding system that can detect enemy communications signals and determines their approximate location., US Army This is driving separate work in the U.S. military, among others, on electronic systems, especially sensors, such as radars and communications systems, that can work effectively in passive modes or otherwise have a low probability of intercept, making them more difficult to detect and more resilient against jamming or spoofing. You can read more about this in these past War Zone pieces . Regardless, these electronic threats are definitely real and it’s good to see the U.S. military taking them seriously now, as well as working to give its own forces their own electronic and cyber warfare tools. When it comes to exercises at the National Training Center, it looks like Colonel Woodward and the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment will be faced with a growing array of capabilities in the electromagnetic spectrum that will keep challenging their ability to stay hidden and get the drop on their opponents.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 4, 2021","No, Iran Isn’t About To Send A Stealth Destroyer To Venezuela Or Off The Coast Of The U.S.","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has claimed it will send a naval flotilla, which may include its newest corvette, the Sahand , into the Atlantic Ocean and possibly to Venezuela in the coming months. But the Iranians, who regularly object to the presence of American warships near their territorial waters in the Persian Gulf , have been suggesting they could make a similar show of force near the United State for nearly a decade and has never followed through. The Iranian Navy doesn’t look to be in any better a position to carry out this mission than it has in the past. Iranian Navy Admiral Touraj Hasnai Moqaddam, the service’s deputy commander, stated the plans on Jan. 4, 2019, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency , or IRNA , reported. It is unclear whether Moqaddam’s comments were new, though, as he had made virtually identical remarks at the commissioning ceremony for Sahand on Dec. 1, 2018. “The Atlantic Ocean is a long route, and it is likely that this Iranian mission would take five months to complete,” he said, according to IRNA . “Among our plans in the near future is to send two or three vessels with special helicopters to Venezuela in South America on a mission that could last five months,” the senior Iranian naval officer had told the semi-official Mehr news agency in December 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=GePGUEaZkzQ It seems likely that Sahand , which carries the same name as an earlier corvette the U.S. Navy sank during a skirmish in 1988, would be among those ships. Iranian authorities tout it as not only the most advanced warship in their country’s navy, but the most capable one anywhere in southwest Asia . This is, at best, debatable given what is known about the ship’s features as compared to larger warships in service in the region in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By every indication, this is unsupported bluster. Iran describes the Sahand as a destroyer, despite the fact that it displaces around 2,000 tons, making it a corvette by any reasonable definition. Iran also claims that it is an entirely Iranian design, but it appears to be derived from the earlier Moudge -class , which was itself reverse-engineered from the British-made Alvand -class that the Islamic Republic inherited from the previous imperial regime. In addition to Sahand , Iran has three Alvands and a single example of the Moudge -class in service. A second Moudge -class ship, the Damavand , sank in the land-locked Caspian Sea after running aground in December 2018. The Iranian Navy’s Moudge -class corvette Jamaran ., Mohammad Sadegh Heydari via Wikimedia Like the earlier Moudge -class ships, Sahand has a helipad, but no hangar to shield a helicopter on board from the elements during sustained operations. There is nothing about the ship’s design to support the claims that it has any stealthy features . The Sahand ’s armament includes Qader sub-sonic anti-ship missiles, derivatives of the Chinese C-803, as well as Sayyad-2 surface-to-air missiles, a reverse-engineered version of the U.S. RIM-66 Standard Missile-1 (SM-1). They also have a 76mm main gun, a close-in self-protection system, torpedo tubes, and various smaller automatic cannon and machine guns. That’s not to say that Iran’s desire to deploy some type of naval vessel into the Atlantic and to have them make a visit to Venezuela isn’t real or doesn’t make sense. In December 2018, the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis and her associated strike group sailed into the Persian Gulf . The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis , in the foreground, sails alongside the amphibious assault ship USS Essex , in the Arabian Sea in December 2018., USN There had not been an American flattop in that body of water since March 2018, an unprecedented gap period after years of rotational deployments to the region support various conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Though the ship and its air wing are now supporting the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the future of which is now uncertain, the move also appeared to be a signal to Iran . In November 2018, President Donald Trump’s administration had put a raft of sanctions against Iran back into place , a product of the United States’ decision to pull out of the multi-national deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program. Iranian and U.S. officials had traded various threats and other inflammatory rhetoric throughout 2018. U.S. relations with Venezuela are also strained at present over the policies of its increasingly dictatorial president Nicolás Maduro. An Iranian military visit to the country to show support for Maduro’s regime would be sure to incite the ire of officials in Washington. The United States vocally criticized Russia’s deployment of Tu-160 bombers and supporting aircraft and personnel to the Latin American country in December 2018. A member of the Russian contingent, at right, gives a Venezuelan officer a Tu-160 model after arriving in the country on Dec. 10, 2018., Russian MoD But Iran has long decried the presence of the U.S. military in the Persian Gulf and since 2011 has claimed it is preparing to conduct similar naval patrols near the United States. None of those pronouncements has actually led to Iranian warships operating in the Atlantic at all, let alone close to American or Venezuelan shores. Despite Admiral Moqaddam’s claims, the Iranian Navy simply lacks the logistical capacity to project power globally. The Alvands have a maximum range under ideal conditions of around 4,500 miles. It is not clear how much additional range the Sahand , a derivative design, might have, if any. Iranian officials have discussed the possibility of establishing bases in friendly countries in the Middle East , but have yet to do so. The country also lacks a true at-sea replenishment capability , though it has deployed the Kharg , a modified fleet tanker , to support previous deployments into the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Iran insists on calling the Kharg a “ helicopter carrier ,” but it is no such thing. Even if the Iranian flotilla made its way out into the North Atlantic via the Mediterranean Sea, there is no guarantee it would be able to make it across the Pond. The shortest distance between West Africa and Venezuela is around 3,000 miles, which leaves little room for bad weather or other problems that could slow up the ships and threaten to leave them stranded in the middle of the ocean without fuel. Iran’s “helicopter carrier” Kharg passes through the Suez Canal in 2011., AP A more circuitous route that takes the ships further down the African coastline and then a much shorter distance across to Brazil might be feasible, but could also run the risk of political difficulties. Brazil’s new hardline, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking closer ties with the United States, has previously criticized Iran , and opposes Venezuela’s present regime . As such, he might seek to block Iranian warships from entering Brazilian ports. Any other country that does not have overtly friendly relations with Iran might also be wary of letting the flotilla in. Russia found itself in a similar predicament in 2016, when Spain refused to allow the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov into port to refuel under heavy international pressure. The flattop and its aircraft were on their way to Syria and the ship subsequently had to wait for tankers to arrive to refuel it at sea before it could continue with its deployment. The entire episode was extremely embarrassing for the Kremlin. Similar logistical considerations likely forced Iran to scrap another planned naval deployment into the Atlantic in 2014 . The Alvand -class Sabalan and the Kharg only appear to have gotten as far as the Gulf of Aden, where they conducted counter-piracy missions, before returning home. As we at The War Zone have noted before, Iran poses a real threat to U.S. naval activities and commercial maritime traffic in the Persian Gulf, and the strategic Strait of Hormuz , in particular. Via its proxies, it has been able to extend some of those capabilities regionally , as well. This is to say nothing of its non-naval capabilities , including its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles , and expansive ties to militant and terrorist groups. Its ability to project naval power outside of the Middle East, however, is virtually non-existent at present. Even if Iran does finally manage to send ships into the Atlantic after all these years, it would be such a small deployment requiring immense effort and resources that it would not reflect a real military capability. Whether or not officials in Iran decide it’s still worth it for the potential propaganda value remains to be seen. There are legitimate reasons to criticize Iran’s foreign policy and its interventions in various conflicts, especially in Syria and Yemen . But any concerns about Iranian warships heading into the Atlantic and possibly toward the American coast – events that seem as unlikely as ever to occur at all – are decidedly overblown.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 22, 2020",B-1B Bomber Brandishes A Belly Full Of Stealth Cruise Missiles While Deployed To Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The “Bone” is back on the island of Guam and it brought with it the ability to deliver up to two dozen stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSMs)—the conventionally-armed bomber’s weapon of choice during the opening stages of a major conflict—to America’s warfighting capabilities in the Pacific. It’s now abundantly clear that the Pentagon wants to make sure that friend and foe alike are aware of that fact based on the pictures the service just posted. The photos show one of the B-1Bs currently calling Guam home having one of its three cavernous weapons bays stuffed with live JASSMs. The images showcase the fact that the B-1B can put even a peer state’s most defended targets at risk from a standoff distance. The JASSM has a declared range of around 230 miles, while its enhanced successor, the JASSM-ER , can reach out and touch targets nearly 600 miles from its point of launch. The B-1B itself has an intercontinental range. All told, it’s a potent message to send and one that is fairly certain to get its intended recipient’s attention. A very interesting view of the JASSM that showcases its stealthy shaping and low-observable glazing over its imaging infrared sensor that is used for extremely precise targeting during the terminal phase of the missile’s flight. , USAF We were the first to report last month on the Air Force’s abrupt ending of its continuous bomber presence at Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam after a decade and a half. In that time, there were always a number of bombers assigned to the island outpost. We were also first to report on what would become a flurry of B-1B activity throughout the Pacific, with the swing-wing bombers flying roundtrip missions from the continental U.S. to as far as the South China Sea and back over the last few of weeks. Now, even though B-1Bs are back at Andersen Air Force Base, just how long the bombers will stick around there is anyone’s guess. What underpins this new strategy is a Pentagon’s buzzword called ‘dynamic force employment.’ Basically, it entails going from being fairly predictable with the movements of strategic assets to being far less predictable in those deployments, albeit at the cost of persistence in a particular area of operations. The grim reality is that all of America’s runway-dependent airpower positioned from Guam west would have a huge target on it during the opening shots of a conflict with China. While Guam has a THAAD battery for ballistic missile defense, China would overwhelm any defenses with a massive barrage of ballistic missiles in an attempt to destroy any airpower there or at least neuter its effectiveness via denying it access to the runways and other support infrastructure it relies on. With this in mind, not being so predictable doesn’t seem like all that bad of an idea. Still, it’s hard not to imagine that the move to end the continuous bomber presence at Andersen wasn’t at least partially influenced by the state of America’s overworked B-1B bomber fleet . When it comes to loading cruise missiles onto a bomber at Andersen Air Force Base, it is no easy task. The base, with all its expansion and improvements over the years, still lacks the facilities needed to pre-load rotary launchers with missiles into ‘packages’ that can then be more rapidly uploaded onto bombers. Instead, each missile has to be loaded directly onto the jet, an arduous process that can take many hours. You can read all about this situation in this past piece of ours. USAF As things heat up in the South China Sea , it isn’t a surprise that Pentagon is using its intermittent bomber missions in the region to send a variety of increasingly blunt messages. Above all else, it gives some credence to the idea that the end of the continuous bomber presence in the Pacific wasn’t really a strategic withdrawal from what is an increasingly volatile part of the world.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has released a video of the rollout of the first of two Block III F/A-18F Super Hornet test jets for the U.S. Navy. The service plans to use these aircraft, which do not feature the full set of upgrades, for various flight tests and to explore new concepts of operation ahead of the delivery of jets with the complete Block III package, which is set to begin later this year. The Chicago-headquartered plane maker announced the final assembly of the first Block III Super Hornet testbed at its production facility in St. Louis, Missouri on May 8, 2020. The video offers views of the exterior of the jet, which remains largely unchanged from earlier Super Hornets. This particular aircraft does not have its conformal fuel tanks fitted, though that is a key piece of the full Block III upgrade. The video also highlights the customizable wide-area multi-function display in one of the F/A-18F’s two cockpits, which is another important element of the Block III package. In addition, the Block III jets will also receive new satellite communications systems and have the ability to use podded infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, which are being developed for the Block III and existing Block II Super Hornets. You can read more about all of these upgrades in these past War Zone pieces . An infographic showing the basic components of the Block III upgrade package, including the elements carried over from earlier efforts., Boeing It’s not yet clear when Boeing might deliver the second testbed aircraft. In January, the company had said that it hoped to have the first test jet finished and delivered to the Navy by the end of March. It had already been conducting flight tests of systems related to the Block III upgrade on jets ahead of the completion of the first test jet, as well. “Block III delivery is just steps behind and the production lines won’t miss a beat, with the first two U.S. Navy Block III test jets delivering in the next two months,” Navy Captain Jason Denney, the F/A-18 and EA-18G Program Manager for the service, had said in April . That month the Navy accepted delivery of the final Block II F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, finishing off that earlier upgrade program, which had begun in 2005. In total, the service has received 322 single-seat F/A-18Es and 286 two-seated F/A-18Fs with the Block II modifications over the past 15 years. The Navy now plans to upgrade a significant number of its remaining 540 Super Hornets to the new Block III standard. A Block II upgrade effort for the service’s EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft is also in the works and there are already discussions about additional Super Hornet improvements, such as enhanced performance engines. Back to front, an F/A-18E Super Hornet, an F/A-18F Super Hornet, and an EA-18G Growler., Boeing Beyond the Navy, Boeing is now pitching advanced Super Hornets, with at least some of the Block III upgrades, to foreign customers and is already developing a new life-extension upgrade for the F/A-18E/Fs. Kuwait, which helped fund portion of the Block III program, already has 22 F/A-18Es and six F/A-18Fs on order that will be in a sort of hybrid configuration between Block II and Block III aircraft. Germany also recently announced plans to acquire a mix of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, as well as EA-18G Growlers , as part of its plans to replace its aging swing-wing Panavia Tornado combat jets . The German Tornado replacement effort is a saga that is separately tied to NATO nuclear weapons sharing agreements, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . Boeing has also pitched the F/A-18E/F for the Indian Air Force’s long-troubled fighter jet tender and separate program by the Indian Navy to acquire new carrier-based fighters. The Super Hornet is taking part in a number of other fighter competitions elsewhere around the world, as well as, including those in Finland , Switzerland, and Canada . “Though we’ve done tremendous work to meet readiness requirements, we know continual forward momentum is needed to sustain that readiness while maintaining our tactical advantage to be more lethal and survivable than our potential adversaries,” Captain Denney, the Navy’s Super Hornet and Growler program manager, had said in April. “The solid partnership with Boeing for the Block III production and modification programs ensures the Super Hornet will remain not only relevant, but ready to fight in today’s dynamic global environment and well into the future.” With the rollout of the first Block III test jet, the Navy is now even closer to getting its newest and most advanced Super Hornets later this year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 2, 2020",Satellite Images Show Armadas Of Vacant Cruise Ships Huddling Together Out At Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of all the industries that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the cruise industry has probably been hit the hardest. Not only are their operations shut down, but they became the face of a global nightmare early on, with hulking pleasure ships being turned into floating prisons rife with infection. Now, according to satellite imagery and transponder tracking data, with no revenue and nowhere to go, cruise ships are seeking refuge in clusters out in the Caribbean and Atlantic, attempting to ride out a storm that they were never designed to handle. Storing cruise ships in port is not a cheap proposition, nor is there enough space to accommodate them in traditional berths. Beyond that, the international crews that man these huge vessels are not allowed to step on land due to infection risk. With the vast majority of these ships flagged in relatively small and poor countries that have little capability to impact the situation, the only place for them to go is out to sea. And that’s precisely where many of them have been. One armada, in particular, off Coco Cay and Great Stirrup Cay —the former is owned by the Royal Caribbean cruise line and the latter is owned by the Norwegian cruise line—in the Bahamas is remarkably large. The sad flock of cruise ships is spread out loosely in three groups spanning some 30 miles—from one just off the islands, to another roughly ten miles west, to another some 30 miles west. Check out the satellite photos below to get an idea of just what we are talking about. Keep in mind that it seems these groups are in constant flux, with the formation and general makeup of the ships in each group changing fairly regularly.

More are anchored just off major embarkation points along the Florida coastline and elsewhere, as well. Overseas there are similar huddles of ships that spot the map. In this photo provided by the Philippine Coast Guard, cruise ship MV Ruby Princess , second from left, stays anchored with other ships waiting for clearance from the Bureau of Quarantine before they dock in Manila, Philippines on Thursday, May 7, 2020. A cruise ship being investigated in Australia for sparking coronavirus infections has sailed into Philippine waters to bring Filipino crewmen home., AP Although there are no passengers aboard these ships, some of which cost well over a billion dollars to build, there are plenty of people still on board. Much of their crews are literally trapped on these vessels. As the world cut back travel due to COVID-19’s explosive spread around the globe and cruise ships became very unwanted guests at long-established ports of call, cruise line workers were trapped at their floating workplaces far from home. Many of the countries they hail from are not wealthy enough to repatriate them even if they could, so for now, they are stuck in a hellish paradise of sorts on gargantuan pleasure boats that have been banished to the sea—barely moving islands onto themselves. Meanwhile, they too have loved ones to worry about back home, but have no way of impacting their situations directly. CNN writes what it is like for crewmen trapped on the vacant luxury liners: Isolated, denied the swift repatriations offered to passengers and, in some cases, made to endure tough conditions without pay, some of those sequestered at sea have been describing the bureaucratic tangle that has trapped them, often within meters of shore. “I’m hoping we don’t get forgotten about, to be honest,” says MaShawn Morton, who works for Princess Cruises. “It seems like nobody cares what’s happening to us out here.” As of May 5, there were over 57,000 crew members still aboard 74 cruise ships in and around US ports and the Bahamas and the Caribbean, according to the US Coast Guard. Many more hundreds were stuck on vessels elsewhere across the world’s oceans. With no passengers to look after and their quarantines completed, the employees are left wondering why they haven’t been allowed home. … American Alex Adkins, a senior stage technician on Freedom of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean ship, has been waiting at sea since mid-March when the vessel’s guests were offloaded in Miami. “Since then, we’ve had no guests and we’ve just been floating off the coast of Barbados,” he says. For the first week, the crew took advantage of the Freedom of the Seas’ pool and the gym, enjoying facilities empty of guests. Then, they went into a mandatory two-week self-isolation, says Adkins. Adkins tells CNN that crew members have since been told that they’re no longer considered working employees and they were paid out through the end of April. CNN’s report does note that some repatriation efforts are beginning to take shape, but that exactly how they will play out for all the crewmen on board these ships remains unclear. The reality is, these big vessels need a sizeable crew onboard to exist, especially without a port to dock in. On March 13th, due to the quickly unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, the cruise industry shut down all operations. This was at first supposed to be a 30-day measure, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. subsequently issued a do not sail order that could last for months to come. As a result, the future of the industry is very much in doubt. The Disney Wonder cruise ship, right, sits at anchor in front of Celebrity Cruise’s Millennium cruise ship, as people pass on the beach Thursday, April 30, 2020, in Coronado, Calif. The ships are just two of many cruise ships sitting idle along the country’s coastline, as the travel industry feels the effects of the battle to slow the spread of the new coronavirus., AP Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and others say they will start operating again this summer, while Norwegian now says the entire industry might not survive, at least in the form it once was. It isn’t clear how restarting cruise operations would be possible with the virus still widely circulating. These ships become huge liabilities during an outbreak and end up being geopolitical footballs that nobody really wants to touch. There is also the factor of direct legal liability for operators that are embarking passengers that could potentially die from a disease that has proven to be very hard if not impossible to contain aboard once it rears its ugly head. So, as you can see, the viability of the cruise industry and the massive ships—big moneymakers during the best of times, but huge money pits when cruisers are not on board—is far from certain. It is hard to imagine what would happen to all of these ships, some of which are modern marvels, if they simply had no demand for their services on the horizon. Few industries exist where such huge capital outlays can turn into equally large liabilities under these highly unique circumstances. Whereas air travel and hotels, both industries that are in great jeopardy, still serve a necessary service during a pandemic and during the economic recovery that hopefully follows, these decadent and hulking ships serve no purpose other than entertainment. So, unless the COVID-19 situation takes a miraculous turn for the better, it’s hard to imagine a set of circumstances where throngs of cruise ships aren’t left out to sea.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s extremely important for any military to make its training regimens as realistic as possible to give its forces the best sense of the threats they might face in combat and how to respond to them. Unfortunately, developing high-quality surrogates for the weapons and other systems that potential adversaries might employ is not always easy and in some cases, it ends up being possible to just go to the source of the threat itself. The U.S. Navy faced just this predicament in the 1990s when it went looking for a high-speed target to simulate supersonic anti-ship and anti-radiation missiles and ultimately decided to just buy the MA-31, a derivative of Russia’s air-launched rocket-ramjet-powered Kh-31 missile. In 1995, McDonnell Douglas first received a contract to deliver modified Kh-31A missiles as part of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) to see if they could meet the Navy’s requirement for a Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST). The American company subsequently worked with the Russian manufacturer, Zveda-Strela, to develop the MA-31 . Zveda-Strela had first begun the development of the Kh-31-series in the late 1970s in what was then the Soviet Union. The original requirement was for a high-speed anti-radiation missile that would be able to home in on and destroy the radars associated with then-new and emerging western air defense systems, such as the U.S. Army’s Patriot surface-to-air missile system and the U.S. Navy’s Aegis combat system . The first Kh-31, also known to NATO as the AS-17 Krypton, was test-fired in 1982 and the weapons began entering Soviet service in 1988. The initial anti-radiation variant, the Kh-31P, was quickly followed by an anti-ship version, the Kh-31A, and both appeared publicly for the first time in 1991, the same year the Soviet Union collapsed. Russia has since developed additional Kh-31 improved variants, which remain in service with its military, as well as numerous foreign militaries, to this day. An infographic showing the features of the Kh-31 and various loadout configurations for different Russian aircraft. The complete missile depicted is a Kh-31P anti-radiation variant, with the alternate guidance and warhead configuration for the anti-ship Kh-31A variant is also shown below., Boeing All Kh-31s use a rocket-ramjet propulsion system to achieve sustained supersonic speeds. A rocket in the rear of the weapon boosts it to an optimal speed for the air-breathing ramjet to takeover. The Kh-31P, with its high-altitude flight profile, can hit speeds of up Mach 3.5. The sea-skimming Kh-31A can still get up to Mach 2.5. At around the same time that the Kh-31 was in development, the Navy was developing the Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (SLAT). This high-speed, low-flying target was to be a critical tool for testing the Aegis combat system. The service had been trying, with great difficulty, to develop a target to mimic supersonic anti-ship missiles since the 1970s, canceling two prior programs, the ZBGM-90A and the ZBQM-111A before that decade was over. As an interim option, it had converted a number of retired RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missiles into MQM-8G Vandal target missiles, starting in 1975, but these offered a limited ability to act as loose surrogate anti-ship threats. The launch of an MQM-8G Vandal from San Nicolas Island, California, in 1999., USN In 1984, Martin Marietta got the SLAT contract and began developing its target, which eventually became known as the YAQM-127A . Testing of this target, which also featured a rocket-ramjet propulsion system, was beset by problems. Only one of six launches between November 1987 and January 1989 was successful. Two more launches, one in November 1990 and another in May 1991, were also declared failures. Congress subsequently forced the cancellation of the program. An artist’s conception of the YAQM-127A SLAT., Martin Marietta With the Soviet Union gone, the Navy was presented with a novel situation. The Russians were severely cash-strapped and the country’s state-owned enterprises, including its defense industries, were decidedly open when it came to prospects for new international business. American aviation firms, such as Boeing , which subsequently established a significant presence in the country, were equally eager to see what new opportunities for partnership there might be. As such, the service could now just go buy a representative target based on an actual potential threat weapon. After getting the contract, McDonnell Douglas acquired Kh-31 missile bodies and motors, stripped of their warheads and guidance systems, for conversion into targets. The resulting MA-31s had a Universal Remote Autopilot (URAP) guidance system, tracking beacon, telemetry equipment, and a flight termination system installed in the empty noses of the Kh-31s. The guts of the new nose for the MA-31., Boeing These targets had essentially identical performance to the original Russian weapons and could fly both anti-ship and anti-radiation profiles just like the missiles they were based on. This included being able to perform multi-axis maneuvers at up to 15 Gs while skimming over the waves. A Boeing briefing slide showing the MA-31’s performance envelop compared to other targets, including the MQM-8G., Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing, which absorbed McDonnell Douglas in a merger in 1997, continued the program. In 1999, the MA-31 beat out Honeywell’s Sea Snake, an improved derivative of the MQM-8G, and Boeing secured a contract to build a total of 34 of the high-speed targets. The flight testing of the modified Kh-31s continued after that and, in total, between 1996 and 2003, there were 13 launches, all from F-4 Phantom II fighter jets. Three of these failed, two due to faulty Russian power supplies and fuel controls and one due to a failure of target missile’s URAP. Boeing Still, the Navy had eyes on a more advanced supersonic target that would offer better range and accuracy over the Russian-based design. In 2000, the service had hired Orbital Sciences to develop what would become the GQM-163A Coyote . In 2004, the year the GQM-163A first flew, Boeing proposed an improved version of the MA-31, the MA-31PG, which replaced the URAP guidance system with one based on the GPS guidance package from the company’s Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kit. The JDAM kit had allowed both the Navy, as well as the U.S. Air Force and Marines, to rapidly convert dumb bombs into precision-guided munitions that can strike fixed targets in any weather conditions. A briefing slide discussing the proposed MA-31PG variant., Boeing At that time it was also working on developing a kit that would allow F-16 Vipers, in addition to aging F-4s, to launch the MA-31s. This would have increased the air-launched target’s flexibility and expanded the potential customer base to include the Air Force or any other Viper operator. A low-quality image showing an F-16 carrying an MA-31 during a test., via @Ninja998998 The MA-31’s days had already been numbered due to factors beyond Boeing’s control. In 2001, Russia, under its then-new President Vladimir Putin, had imposed new export restrictions that led to delays . President George W. Bush’s decision to pull out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in December of that year also chilled relations between Washington and Moscow. By 2005, Boeing had only been able to make 18 of the contracted 34 MA-31s due to political and bureaucratic hurdles, according to a report from the Defense Science Board’s Task Force on Aerial Targets. The success of the GQM-163A was the final nail in the coffin for the MA-31. The Navy eventually expanded all of these Kh-31-based targets it had acquired and canceled the program for good in 2007. The Coyote, which remains in use today, is yet another rocket-ramjet-powered design. Orbital Sciences, which evolved first into Orbital ATK and is now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, was able to keep the cost of the target low by using established components from proven Standard Missile 1 and 2 variants and the smaller AQM-37D supersonic target. A breakdown of the GQM-137A’s features., Orbital Sciences In 2008, the Navy had also hired Alliant Techsystems to begin work on a further advanced supersonic target, the ZGQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST), primarily to emulate the anti-ship versions of Russia’s Kalibr family, also known as SS-N-27 Sizzler missiles to NATO. While these weapons are subsonic for most of their flight profile, they execute a supersonic sprint in their terminal phase. A GQM-173A during a test., USN The Navy canceled the MSST program in 2015 , but is still interested in developing a target to meet that requirement. The service is also likely to need some way to represent new supersonic and hypersonic anti-ship threats that Russia , as well as China , are now developing. Whatever new air-launched targets the service develops, U.S.-Russian relations have only worsened more since the early 2000s and it won’t be buying any more Russian-made designs any time soon. Still, the MA-31 program harkens back to a very unique time in military and geopolitical history, on when a Navy could suddenly just buy the threatening weapons that were developed to sink its ships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 26, 2020",Breaking Down The Absolutely Batshit Botched Coup Attempt Against Venezuela’s Maduro,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New details and developments relating to a bizarre abortive coup attempt against Venezuela’s dictatorial President Nicolas Maduro , which involved a botched amphibious raid by a group that included former U.S. Army Green Berets and Venezuelan expats, continue to emerge days after the start of the incident. Everything about this fiasco, which apparently has yet to reach its final conclusion, seems less of a modern incarnation of the infamous CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 and more reminiscent of the differently infamous Wonga Coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea in 2004, or even the life of Bin Laden hunter Gary Faulkner , or an over-the-top Hollywood dramatization of either of those events. The United States has flatly denied any involvement in this putsch, which the plotters dubbed Operation Gideon. “If we had been involved, it would have turned out differently,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on May 6, 2020. “Whatever it is, we’ll let you know,” President Donald Trump had also told reporters on May 5. “But it has nothing to do with our government.” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has also denied any U.S. military involvement in the coup attempt. The CIA reportedly even attempted to convince the group not to go ahead with its plan. What even happened? This CIA’s call to abort the attempted coup clearly went unheeded as Operation Gideon, ostensibly an effort to capture Maduro, began on May 1. On that day, a total of 60 men left Colombia in two boats and headed toward the Venezuelan coast near the country’s capital Caracas, according to a statement from Captain Victor Pimenta, a deserter from the Venezuelan military who joined the coup plot and is now in custody in that country. Pimenta said that one of the two boats, which was carrying Captain Antonio Sequea, another former Venezuelan military officer, and two retired U.S. Army Green Berets, Airan Berry and Luke Denman , had engine problems, aborted the mission, and attempted to flee to the Dutch island of Bonaire off the coast of Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea. The motor ran out of fuel well before that, forcing them to attempt a landing. The occupants of both boats were quickly engaged by Venezuelan security forces. Authorities in Venezuela initially claimed that they had killed eight of the raiders, but have since revised that body count down to six . Another 13 individuals, including Berry and Denman, who were both carrying their U.S. passports and other identifying documents, ended up being captured. The detained Venezuelans were all also carrying ID cards or other means of identification, as well. The status of the rest of the 60-man force is unknown. Venezuelan authorities also seized vehicles, weapons, and equipment that they captured from the raiders’ boats, as well as from a safe house inside the country. There was at least one Ford pickup, along with a pair of Toyotas, all painted black, at the house, the latter two of which were armed with 7.62mm M240G or FN MAG machine guns . Belts of ammunition were scattered in the trucks’ rear beds. The mercenaries’ arsenal included a number of AR-15/M16-type rifles and 100-round Beta C-Mag drums to go with them. At least 14 Glock pistols and, curiously, at least one Airsoft pellet gun, were also among the weapons that Venezuelan officials captured. It is possible that the airsoft gun was potentially brought to discreetly take out lights. Unencrypted handheld radios, tablet computers, body armor and helmets, some with American or Venezuelan national flag patches, and Aoutacc airsoft face masks with a fanged mouth motif meant to be reminiscent of feudal Japanese samurai armor, were among the other items seized. If the basic details of Operation Gideon seem relatively straightforward, if amateurish and ill-advised, a closer examination of the origins and the execution of the coup attempt are anything but. In fact, in what is perhaps the first and most bizarre element to the story, the Operation Gideon plot had already been public knowledge since May 1, when the Associated Press published an exclusive expose on what they described as a “failed attempt to oust Venezuela’s Maduro.” That story included on-the-record interviews with former associates of the coup plotters and Venezuelan authorities, who also said their intelligence services had infiltrated the group. Those latter claims are supported by previously unexplained reports of increased security in the areas where the Operation Gideon force ultimately landed. Jordan Goudreau, another former Green Beret and head of small private security firm Silvercorp USA, who helped organize the coup attempt, declined to give the Associated Press an interview for that story, but issued a statement refusing to confirm or deny any of the details they had asked him about. This means he knew that story was in the works and that the operation would be compromised, something the coup plotters either disregarded or had forced them to speed up their timetable. It certainly didn’t help the plot’s execution that Goudreau publicly announced that it was underway on May 4 in a now-deleted Tweet that also tagged U.S. President Donald Trump. The retired Green Beret had issued a similar videoed statement on social media while standing alongside Javier Quintero Nieto, a former member of Venezuela’s National Guard who was among the coup plot’s top leadership. It’s not at all clear what the exact plan was or how it was ever meant to succeed. It’s hard to see how the 60-man force, even under the best of circumstances, would have been able to get into downtown Caracas and snatch Maduro, if they even knew where he would be and when. The Associated Press did manage to follow up with Gourdreau after Operation Gideon’s failure. When asked about why he had sent just 60 men to what is perhaps the most heavily defended part of Venezuela’s coastline, the retired American special operator reminded the reporters about how Alexander the Great had “struck deep into the heart of the enemy” and achieved victory over a numerically superior Persian force at the Battle of Guagamela in 331. Where did this all start? The Associated Press ‘ original story said that the plot dated back to at least March 2019, when Keith Schiller, a longtime bodyguard for President Trump, encountered Lester Toledo, met an activist acting as a coordinator for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela on behalf of opposition leader Juan Guaido, at an event in Washington, D.C. Guaido, with support from the United States and a number of other Latin American countries, had declared himself to be the rightful president of Venezuela in January 2019, following a disputed election and in the midst of years-long economic crisis. This triggered a still-ongoing political crisis with the Maduro regime, which remains in power with the backing of Russia and Cuba . Schiller then brought in Goudreau, who’s company, Silvercorp USA, had provided security at Trump rallies in the past, a detail that open-source investigative outlet Bellingcat uncovered earlier this week . Both Schiller and Goudreau then met with Guaido’s representatives in Maimi in May 2019. A screenshot from Silvercorp USA’s now-deleted Instagram page showing Goudreau providing security at Trump rally in North Carolina in 2018., Instagram via Bellingcat Initially, it appeared that Guaido was looking for additional security services to protect the opposition leader at various public rallies to boost support for his cause, something that Silvercorp USA would later provide. A purported contract covering “strategic planning, procuring equipment, and project execution advisement,” and worth at least $50 million, and possibly as much as $212 million, between Guaido and Goudreau is now circulating online . Its authenticity has not been confirmed and it’s unclear if it actually referred to anything beyond providing personal protection details. Regardless, over the course of Silvercorp USA’s work with Guaido and his associates, Toledo, the activist, reportedly introduced Goudreau to Cliver Alcala, a retired Venezuelan Army officer who had moved to Colombian 2018 and ran a network of Venezuelan military deserters in camps along the border between the two countries. Among the hundreds of men he supposedly had at his disposal was one involved in a drone assassination attempt against Maduro in 2018, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Alcala was and still is a dubious partner in any endeavor. He was involved in the 1992 failed coup attempt that the late Hugo Chavez led against then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, was hit with U.S. sanctions in 2011 for allegedly selling shoulder-fired man-portable surface-to-air missiles, often referred to by the acronym MANPADS , to the Colombia rebel group FARC in exchange for drugs, and has alleged ties to drug smuggling operations linked to Maduro and his family . In March 2020, Alcala turned himself in to U.S. authorities in Colombia after getting slapped with an indictment over drug trafficking and ending up with a $10 million bounty from the U.S. State Department on his head. There is now also a $15 million reward out for Maduro on drug-related charges. The Associated Press also indicated that Roen Kraft, a member of the famous cheese-making family, may have been involved in at least the early stages of Operation Gideon. However, while Kraft admitted to meeting with Goudreau, he denied involvement in the coup plot or that he ever gave Silvercorp USA any money to help carry it out. Goudreau has since said that the group was operating on a “ shoestring budget ,” which aligns with the Associated Press ‘ almost farcical description of the training camps in Colombia and that story’s claim that at least some of the deserters had actually deserted the coup plot, as well. That latter detail was among those that had led the reporters to believe that the entire putsch had collapsed before it even began. What’s going on now? The failed amphibious raid would, under any normal circumstances, seem to mark the end of this entire debacle. Despite all that has happened so far, Javier Quintero Nieto told the Miami Herald on May 5, that the group intended to continue on after it regrouped. “The operations will be halted given that a number of errors were made,” he said. “Definitely, the regime managed to infiltrate people [inside the group] and now we have to reorganize.” Both Nieto and Goudreau have indicated that there are or were sleeper cells inside Venezuela before the raid. This would match up with the Venezuelan government’s seizure of the safe house and its contents. Venezuelan security forces are still actively searching for other individuals involved in Operation Gideon. Everything we know now about Operation Gideon raises questions about a host of other still murky incidents since January 2019. For instance, in February 2019, authorities in Venezuela said they had seized a shipment of weapons aboard a charter flight, an incident that still remains largely unexplained . More recently, the Venezuela Navy patrol vessel ANBV Naiguatá sunk itself after ramming the ice-capable cruise ship RCGS Resolute in international waters off the country’s coast. The Venezuelan government subsequently claimed that the cruise liner, which reportedly had no passengers and was en route to the Dutch island of Curacao at the time, was involved in the deployment of foreign mercenaries. Maduro’s regime has not offered any hard evidence to support those assertions and experts and observers rightly noted at the time that rubber rafts present on the ship’s deck at the time were not an uncommon sight, with pictures showing members of the crew using them to taking passengers on excursions during past cruises. However, it now seems far more plausible than it did that Venezuelan officials might have actually had intelligence, or at least concerns, that the Resolute was tied to this plot brewing in neighboring Colombia. It’s also worth remembering that reports had emerged in September 2018 that Trump Administration officials had met with Venezuelan military officers who were plotting a coup against Maduro . The U.S. government reportedly declined to be involved in that potential putsch, in the end. A propaganda win for Maduro As things stand now, it’s hard to see how this incident will be anything but a propaganda victory for Maduro’s regime. The Venezuelan President and his associates routinely accuse the United States, as well as Colombia, or plotting to kill or overthrow him , though no hard evidence is ever provided. While there are no firm indications, as of yet, that the U.S. government was directly involved in this latest plot, it seems clear that it was aware that it was going on and made no efforts to shut it down. It’s hard to see how the Colombians would have been unaware, as well, and they also remained indifferent. Whatever the truth of the matter, Maduro now has a very clear incident to point to support his allegations. Just on May 6, the Venezuelan government released footage of Luke Denman being interrogated and issuing an obviously forced statement about the coup attempt. Denman tells his captor that he wouldn’t like it if foreign mercenaries were to launch an operation into the United States to kill President Trump and that he would consider it an act of war. Again, there is no clear indication that Operation Gideon ever planned to kill Maduro or that it had any official U.S. government backing. It is also almost certain to be an embarrassment for the U.S. government, regardless of its relationship to the plot. Goudreau, as well as Berry and Denman, all served honorably in both Iraq and Afghanistan and were notably among the Crisis Response Force from the 10th Special Forces Group that flew to Europe in the wake of the infamous and controversial 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Now, as noted, Berry and Denman are in Venezuelan custody and their future is uncertain, but there will definitely be pressure on U.S. authorities to secure their return to the United States. Secretary of State Pompeo has already said that the U.S. government will use “ every tool ” to get them back. Goudreau, with his ties to the Trump Administration and the Trump campaign, is almost certainly in violation of numerous U.S. laws and its hard to see how American authorities could justify not charging him in relation to a coup plot that he has publicly admitted to being a part of. The U.S. government has reportedly already been investigating Goudreau since March over potential arms smuggling in relationship to the Colombian government seizure of a cache of weapons and accessories that month. Cliver Alcala claimed ownership of that stockpile and might have given up more about the Operation Gideon plot after surrounding himself. Nieto’s claims now that Operation Gideon will continue despite the amphibious raid’s failure means that the bizarre saga is unlikely to fade from the public eye in the immediate future. We will just have to wait to see what new and absurd details will come to light as this entire debacle continues to unfold. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Well, there’s never a dull moment in Elon Musk land ! After the SpaceX and Tesla founder and his partner, the pop singer Grimes, welcomed their newborn into this world, they declared that the boy’s name would be “X Æ A-12.” Yes, you read that right. Social media had a field day with the announcement and people were speculating as to what the name meant, or if it was even real at all. Then Grimes tweeted out an explanation of sorts to the mysterious cipher. It turns out, the child is partially named after Lockheed Skunk Works’ Mach 3 spy plane it built for the CIA in the early 1960s, the A-12 , known internally by designers during its development as “Archangel.” The A-12 was the forerunner to the far more famous SR-71 Blackbird. Grimes’ tweet read: •X, the unknown variable •Æ, my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence) •A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft).  No weapons, no defenses, just speed.  Great in battle, but non-violent + (A=Archangel, my favorite song) ( metal rat) The spelling of A-12 in her tweet is clearly a mistake, but it seems clear that the futurist couple has a huge affinity to Kelly Johnson’s most enigmatic flying creation , just like many of us, although I don’t think anyone has thought about naming their kid after it! It isn’t clear if the name is actually legal, laws vary from state to state as far as what you can name your offspring, but that isn’t likely to stop the two from keeping the moniker. If the name sticks, I would imagine he would end up as “Archie” or something similar, but you never know! It is interesting that Grimes’ favorite song shares one of the names with the A-12, the other names it received during its development and short operational service life was Cygnus and Oxcart. Regardless, here’s to Elon and Grimes, we wish your son X Æ A-12 the very best of health and happiness!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 27, 2020","U.S. Mulls Pulling Spy Planes From Britain, Not Basing F-35s There Over Huawei 5G Plans: Report","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of the U.S. Senate are reportedly looking to block the future forward-deployment of two U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter squadrons to the United Kingdom. This follows reports that the White House is considering withdrawing RC-135 spy planes and other intelligence assets, as well as other U.S. military personnel, from the country. At issue are security concerns over the U.K. government’s decision to allow Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei to be among those working on the country’s national 5G mobile phone and WiFi networks. The Telegraph newspaper in Britain first reported the effort to prevent the F-35As from going to the United Kingdom, which is a proposed addition to the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year, on May 5, 2020. This same paper had reported that the White House was conducting its larger military and intelligence security review the day before. The summary of the proposed addition to the NDAA, which is only now starting to take shape in Congress, would “prohibit the stationing of new aircraft at bases in host countries with at-risk vendors in their 5G or 6G networks.” This could also upend any other forward-deployments of U.S. military aircraft to the United Kingdom or any other country that employs a telecommunications contractor, such as Huawei, that the United States deems to be a national security risk. If this provision were to become law, it’s not clear how this might impact plans to deploy U.S. Marine F-35Bs on the U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth during that ship’s first operational cruise, which is set to occur in 2021. How this prohibition might apply to rotational deployments, such routine visits by Air Force heavy bombers, is unclear, too. With regards to the broader White House review, forward-deployed RC-135 spy planes at RAF Mildenhall in southeast England are high on the list to be withdrawn if the U.K. government goes ahead with its 5G plans involving Huawei. The U.K. Royal Air Force is also an RC-135 operator, with its variants known as Airseekers , a program that is heavily tied together with its American counterparts. It’s unclear if that cooperation could also be put in jeopardy should the U.K.’s 5G plans go forward. Beyond that, the United Kingdom is part of the so-called “ Five Eyes ” intelligence network with the United States, along with Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. This arrangement allows these five countries to rapidly share very sensitive information back and forth with each other and means that the United Kingdom hosts a wide variety of other permanent and rotating American intelligence assets. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, deployments of U-2S Dragon Lady spy planes to RAF Mildenhall and RAF Fairford and the large U.S. Intelligence Community presence at RAF Menwith Hill . The Telegraph also said that the White House review was exploring withdrawing up to 10,000 U.S. military personnel in total, including non-intelligence related elements, as well. The U.S. military has a large precense in the United Kingdom, in general, which includes other Air Force units, including a fighter wing equipped with F-15C/D Eagles and F-15E Strike Eagles, an aerial refueling wing with KC-135R tankers, and a special operations wing. It’s not news, of course, that the U.S. government has concerns about potential security risks posed by allowing a Chinese firm to have a significant role in establishing mobile data networks across the United Kingdom. The fear is that the Chinese government could leverage Huawei’s involvement to either build in backdoors or otherwise gain access to these networks in the future and use them as a vector to penetrate into more sensitive systems. The Central Intelligence Agency has reportedly accused the company of having direct ties to the Chinese government, which is also well-known for using cyber attacks , as well as traditional espionage , to steal both commercial and government information. The U.S. military, as well as the U.S. Intelligence Community, have only become ever-more reliant on computer networks over the years. The F-35, specifically, which the United Kingdom also operates , is heavily network-dependent, with its cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) responsible for a host of mission planning, maintenance, and logistics functions. There have long been concerns about ALIS’ vulnerability to cyber attacks . “Our governments share a tremendous amount of security information,” Mick Mulvaney, then Acting White House Chief of Staff, said at a gathering for students Oxford’s debating society in February. “We are very much concerned that integrity of that information is hardwired into your computer systems, and if you folks go forward with the decision to include Huawei, it will have a direct and dramatic impact on our ability to share information with you. Period, end of story.” That same month U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly harangued U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson over Huawei. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, left, and US President Donald Trump, at right, shake hands at the 2019 NATO summit in the United Kingdom in December 2019., Michael Kappeler/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images Of course, there is no indication that the United Kingdom would ever allow Huawei to be involved in work relating to any sensitive portions of its national 5G network. At the same time, in an ever-connected world, even general access to commercial networks can still present real security risks to military and other government personnel. Beyond all that, the U.S. government has been in its own protracted spat with the Chinese firm, which has also been tied to an ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing, since 2018. In May of that year, the Pentagon banned the sale of Huawei cell phones, as well as those from Chinese firm ZTE, on its bases, citing security risks. Seven months later, Canadian authorities then arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S. government. In January 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice hit the company with a total of 23 separate indictments , including the theft of trade secrets and fraud. Then, in May 2019, President Trump essentially banned Huawei from operating in the United States entirely via executive order. The U.S. government has now also indicted Meng Wanzhou personally over stealing trade secrets and other charges , as well, which she denies. Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou leaves her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for an extradition hearing in January 2020., Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press via AP The U.S. has sought to pressure other allies to drop Huawei from their own 5G network rollouts, too. Australia, another Five Eyes member, ultimately blocked the Chinese firm from its own national network plans. Members of the U.K. parliament from Boris Johnson’s own Conservative Party have also been pushing him to terminate the deal with the telecommunications company. Relations between Washington and Beijing, as well as the Chinese government and those of other countries, have also cooled significantly in the past few months amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Key issues are evidence that authorities in China covered up the initial outbreak and that they are still withholding important information that could help global efforts to combat the spread of the virus. The White House security review and the push in the Senate to block the deployment of F-35s and other aircraft to the United Kingdom are only likely to add to the already mounting pressure on U.K. authorities to drop Huawei from its 5G plans.

Our friends at Airshowstuff.com had the scoop first, in which they noted that the jet shown was one of the same F/A-18E models painted-up in the special ‘Maverick scheme’ for Top Gun 2 before it was draped in its new navy blue attire. Make sure you read Airshowstuff.com’s entire post that also has the images in question linked here. You can see another set of images of the painted up Super Hornet in the tweet below: The original plan was for the Blues to transition to the Super Hornet between the 2020 and 2021 seasons, but with air shows now being canceled for some time, a move that could now last through the entirety of 2020, we may see them attempt to speed up the transition, or at least allow for more time to see it through. The team is set to receive 18 Super Hornets, some of the oldest in the fleet, which will be modified into the Blue Angels’ unique configuration. The team’s routine is also being modified for the new jets’ unique performance. You can learn more about these alternations to the planes and the team’s routine in this past post of ours. The Blue Angels are also set to start flying their new (at least to them) C-130J transport to fill the beloved ‘Fat Albert’ role any time now. The acquisition of a totally new set of enhanced mounts for the 2021 season was set to be historic for the team, but there is the chance that the pandemic could keep the 2021 season from happening as planned, too.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",Steve Carell’s Space Force Is The Military Documentary We Desperately Need Right Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you work are in the defense space, there are few shows that have ever looked as promising and bizarrely relevant as Space Force. Looking to be something between The Pentagon Wars and The Office , the show clearly aims to skewer the military-industrial complex and the current state of space affairs in the most entertaining way possible, and right now, we couldn’t need it more. It will probably end up having more in common with cringe-worthy reality than fiction. Listen, I am highly biased on this topic. The Office is one of the biggest comedy achievements in human history. It’s a show that even after rewatching it multiple times, you can throw an episode on and forget about your problems and just commit to the laughs. In fact, in this bleak and sudden age of coronavirus, I have been doing exactly that. It simply never gets old. Steve Carell was the heart and soul of the show even though it had one of the best ensemble casts ever, with each member having unique and often unlikely comedy capabilities to deploy with uncanny precision. Still, Michael Scott absolutely owned the camera. He was so familiar yet so alien to all of us. He was a guy you loved just a little bit more than you hated. When Carell left after the seventh season, the show just wasn’t the same, although it was still good for some laughs and the guest stars, notably James Spader as Robert California, were excellent. Now Carell and the creator of the U.S. version of The Office , Greg Daniels, have teamed up for Space Force and they brought with them an insane cast of familiar players that will make this show failing pretty damn challenging. The show revolves around General Naird, an Air Force pilot who always dreamed about running the branch, but instead, he gets assigned to start Space Force. Obviously, the premise is ripped from the headlines . The new branch’s almost comic book-like superficial absurdity has already drawn a ton of public interest, as well as the fact that it is one of President Trump’s pet projects. So, the show is already mirroring reality to a remarkable degree just based on its premise alone. The thing that made The Office so great was writing that may have been sensational, but it emanated from a large reservoir of common truths about the office workplace and the characters that you end up finding in it. The petty rivalries, the clamoring for attention from superiors, the enduring of often flawed business strategies, the lack of actual work, it was all there. Nearly everyone could relate. Space Force will undoubtedly mine similar rich ground within the sprawling and often clumsier than not military apparatus and the huge industry that supports it. The controversial metamorphosis of the space launch industry and the migration to commercial access to low earth orbit and possibly beyond is another honey hole that Space Force is sure to exploit for laughs. I mean take the news today, Tom Cruise is working with Elon Musk and NASA to shoot an action movie on the International Space Station. There is so much spoofing to do with mega-rich odd-ball tech celebrity personalities alone and society’s elevation of wealthy nerds to rockstar status. That is social commentary we desperately need! If you work in the defense industry or especially in defense media, sometimes you just have to laugh. There is so much waste, mismanagement, bizarre egos, misplaced bravado, political correctness and political incorrectness, let alone crazy ideas that cost billions of dollars and are extremely destructive by design, it can get outright absurd. The fact that it is all about war, or peace, depending on who you ask, is another dark element that is sometimes hard to quantify. With all this in mind, I think Space Force could be a spoof for the ages—a show that is in fact far closer to reality than some may care to believe. That alone could make this series truly out of this world. Space Force blasts off on May 29th on Netflix.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2020",Navy Wants To Buy 30 New Light Amphibious Warships To Support Radical Shift In Marine Ops,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy wants to buy as many as 30 of a new class of Light Amphibious Warships that would be significantly smaller and cheaper to operate than its existing fleets of large amphibious ships . The service is already exploring possible designs, including a roll-on-roll-off type with a stern ramp. These vessels will be a critical component of how it supports the U.S. Marine Corps’ new and still evolving plans for how it will conduct future expeditionary and distributed operations. Navy officials from PMS 317 said that the “objective number” of Light Amphibious Warships (LAW) it hopes to buy is between 28 and 30 at a briefing for defense industry representatives on Apr. 9, 2020. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) posted the briefing slides, as well as responses to questions, on the U.S. government’s contracting website beta.SAM.gov on May 5. PMS 317 is the program office within NAVSEA’s overarching Program Executive Office for Ships that is presently responsible for the San Antonio class landing platform dock program, as well as a program to acquire a replacement for the Whidbey Island and Harpers Ferry classes of landing ship docks. “Evolving threats in the global maritime environment causing the Naval Forces to re-evaluate/adjust their CONOPs [concepts of operation] to meet the new challenges associated with maintaining persistent Naval forward presence to enable sea control and denial operations,” is how PMS 317 described the underlying need for the new class of amphibious ships at the April briefing. The LAW is “intended to provide Naval Forces the maneuver and sustainment vessels to confront the changing character of warfare.” The Navy is still in an information-gathering phase, but does already have some key requirements for any potential LAW design, which it expects to be about 200 feet long overall and have 8,000 square feet of cargo space in total. Each LAW will have a crew of no more than 40 sailors and be able to accommodate at least 75 Marines. USN The ship has to be capable of “beaching on sand, gravel, shale, small stone, and man-made marine ramps” just like a traditional landing craft or larger landing ship. It has to be able to deploy all Marine Corps vehicles and other “rolling stock,” such as towed howitzers and equipment trailers, onto a beach with at least a two-and-a-half percent gradient, if not more, or into a situation where the vehicles would have to ford at depths of 42 inches or less. The LAWs also need to be capable of open-ocean operation in conditions up to Sea State 5, defined as “rough seas” with waves between eight and 13 feet high. The Navy wants the ships to be able to cruise at 14 knots and have a maximum range of 3,500 nautical miles. The vessels will need sufficient accommodations and amenities to support weeks-long, trans-oceanic voyages. USN The Navy says that it is willing to consider either adapting an existing commercial design, using a commercial hullform as a starting place, or a so-called “ Build to Print ” ship based on proven design elements and components. The goal in all of these courses of action is to focus on relatively low-risk, low-cost, mature designs, or at least design features, in order to both keep the ships cheap and make them faster and easier to build. The Navy has said it is interested in awarding at least one preliminary design contract by the end of this year with the hope that it could begin buying actual ships as early as late 2022. The service has also indicated that it might be willing to accept ship designs with relatively short expected service lives in order to help keep production costs low and speed up construction. The requirements now say that the LAWs have to have a life span of just 10 years, at a minimum. USN Exactly what the LAWs might look like remains to be seen. Last year, the Navy and Marines said that they were examining offshore support vessel (OSV) type ships as one possible option. The Navy has facilitated the development and delivery of OSVs to Iraq in the past and has employed modified commercial examples to support various experiments, including those related to work on unmanned surface vessels . However, these ships are not intended to safely beach themselves and do not necessarily have a ramp or other means of rapidly on-loading and off-loading vehicles, personnel, and other equipment at established port facilities. A nearly 200-foot-long OSV that the Navy managed the development of on behalf of the Iraqi government. , USN “He doesn’t call it an OSV, but he does say small, scalable, more maneuverable, flexible kinds of things,” Frank DiGiovanni, the Deputy Director of Expeditionary Warfare on the Chief of Naval Operations’ staff, told USNI News in February, referring to Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger’s calls for new, lighter amphibious ships in his planning guidance last year and other occasions since then . “The OSV is certainly a class or a type of ship we’ve worked with before.” Berger’s 2019 planning guidance, together with a concept called Force Structure 2030 that emerged publicly in March, describes ambitious plans to radically reshape the Marines for new kinds of expeditionary and distributed warfare operations, especially in the Pacific region. You can read more in detail about both of these new sets of guiding policies in these past War Zone pieces . The commandant’s plans focus heavily on being able rapidly deploy Marines to a specific area, such as one island in a chain, establish an outpost, conduct operations, and then quickly move those forces to a different location in the same general operating area. The idea is that this upends an opponent’s response planning, reducing the vulnerability of the Marines to counter-attack, while also forcing an enemy to stretch their own assets across a wide area to try and defend against threats from constantly changing vectors. Small amphibious ships are essential for both moving these elements around and keeping them resupplied. USNI News has since reported that the discussion between the Navy and the Marines regarding the new amphibious ship has now shifted to so-called stern landing vessels and one design, in particular, from the Australian firm Sea Transport Solutions (STS), to serve at least as a conceptual starting place. STS was notably not among the companies present at the April 2020 industry day gathering regarding the LAW. The U.K.’s Royal Navy is also investigating a larger type of adapted commercial vessel with a stern ramp to serve as a Littoral Strike Ship to support its own plans to transform the structure of the Royal Marines. The vessel that the British say they are considering is at least visually quite similar to the M/V Ocean Trader , a shadowy U.S. special operations mothership, which the Navy nominally operates and that the War Zone has covered extensively in recent years . What the Navy has outlined in its basic requirements for the LAW also sounds very similar in many respects to the Army’s General Frank S. Besson class Logistics Support Vessels (LSV), the largest types of ships in that service’s obscure, but significant watercraft fleets, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . The last two members of the Besson class actually form a distinct subclass and are designed to be much more capable of long-range, open-ocean operations. All of the LSVs can beach or can use their front and rear ramps to take on and unload cargo in more established ports. The General Frank S. Besson class Logistics Support Vessel USAV Major Robert Smalls . This is one of the two LSVs that form a more capable subclass with expanded long-distance and open-ocean capabilities., US Army At the April 9 briefing, in response to a question, the Navy said it had not reached out to the Army about what the service was doing as part of its Maneuver Support Vessel (MSV) program. In 2017, that service awarded the first contract for its new MSV (Light) landing craft , meant to replace its Vietnam War-era Landing Craft Mechanized Mk 8s. However, the Army had, at least in the past, been looking at larger vessels to replace both its Landing Craft Utilities (LCU) and LSVs as part of a larger MSV effort. At the same time, the service had been planning to retire the bulk of its watercraft fleets last year, before pressure for Congress prompted them to halt those plans . “Yes, we are aware of it and the capabilities. They may look similar, but the requirements are fundamentally different,” Navy officials said of the Army’s vessels, though it is not entirely clear which types they were talking about specifically. “[The] Navy needs more habitability, seakeeping, and intra‐theater focus for LAW.” The LAW requirements, such as they are known now, are also reminiscent in some respects to old Landing Ship Tanks (LST), which the Navy made heavy use of during World War II and that also saw significant service during the Korean War and Vietnam War. Those ships were notably larger than what the service is talking about buying now, though. In the late 1960s, the Navy also acquired a number of even bigger Newport class LSTs , which served into the 1990s. Still, the LAW definitely represents a blast from the past with regards to lighter amphibious capabilities that the service had largely moved away from decades ago. With the Navy looking to get the Light Amphibious Warship’s design phase underway as early as the end of this year, its requirements, as well as what shipbuilders are able to offer, are likely to become clearer in the coming months. It will be interesting and exciting to see what gets proposed for what could be one of the service’s most significant acquisitions of new amphibious ships in recent memory as it works to support the Marine Corps’ future operational ambitions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures emerged on social media of an accident over the weekend at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland involving an F-15C Eagle from the Oregon Air National Guard’s 142nd Fighter Wing . The fighter skidded off the runway and lost its radome after making an emergency landing. The pilot did not suffer any injuries, thankfully. Joint Base Andrews Public Affairs Office confirmed the mishap to The War Zone and said that it had taken place on May 2 at around 1:30 PM local time. There were no major impacts on the base’s operations as a result. The pictures showed that, in addition to the nose radome getting sheared away, the F-15C’s landing gear collapsed and the drop tank under the aircraft’s right wing got crushed. The jet’s radar antenna, likely an active electronically-scanned array for the AN/APG-63(V)3 , was also missing. Although we cannot confirm it, the F-15C was supposedly armed at the time of the mishap and missiles on its wing stations were removed afterward. It’s not clear what happened to any AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles it might have been carrying on its belly stations when it departed the runway. Last year, another Eagle from the 142nd fired or otherwise jettisoned all of its missiles , worth millions of dollars, into the Pacific Ocean before making an emergency landing at Portland International Airport. The statement from Andrews’ Public Affairs Office said that the F-15C had diverted to the base after experiencing an unspecified “in-flight malfunction.” Second-hand resports state that the brakes and steering failed and that the pilot missed the arresting cable/barrier or the hook did not otherwise engage it. The right main landing gear also collapsed. The jet was configurated for a combat air patrol at the time of the incident with live missiles onboard. The F-15 is said to be on a temporary air defense assignment from its home in Portland, Oregon to Savannah, Georgia’s Savannah Air National Guard Base. There’s no word yet on the total cost of the damage, but it is likely to be significant. With the F-15C/D’s service now set to end in the next decade, it will be interesting to see if the jet will be repaired or written off. An investigation into the mishap is now underway. We will update this story with more information as it becomes available. UPDATE : According to CNN , the F-15C was providing air cover over Camp David during a visit by President Trump to the retreat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 18, 2020",Everything We Learned From Boeing About Its Potentially Game-Changing Loyal Wingman Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what is a massive milestone for Boeing and potentially for unmanned aerial combat systems as a whole, the company officially rolled out the first of three pre-production unmanned teaming aircraft, which is the central component of a total system called the Airpower Teaming System, or ATS for short. The War Zone was part of a small roundtable of journalists that talked with two of the minds behind ATS ahead of the official unveiling and we learned a lot about this potentially game-changing system, to say the least. ATS is designed to work with manned aerial assets in the ‘loyal wingman’ role and to do so at a remarkably low cost. In effect, the concept has to potential to drastically expand the size of a tactical jet force at a fraction of the cost of buying full-up manned airframes, while also infusing a whole new set of disruptive tactics into an air arm’s playbook. It will also make manned assets more survivable by not having to risk them during the direst parts of some missions. You can read more about this concept overall, here . Boeing sees the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and a certain level of autonomy to be key in really creating a revolutionary capability that can work as a huge force multiplier for existing manned combat aircraft. These drones don’t fly with a pilot remotely at the controls in a traditional sense, like say an MQ-9 Reaper drone . They will be directed in more of a point-and-click desktop or screen-top style interface. With the help of AI, they can automate much of this process, leaving their human overlords to concentrate on the big tactical picture instead of on constant small navigation and tactical tasks. Even being in the right place at the right time before a major tactical decision is made by the operator, which would be flying in a nearby aircraft, could be a huge help in an air combat situation. The initiative, which is a cooperative effort between Boeing Australia and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), has moved at a remarkably fast pace. The program was announced just 14 months ago and the Boeing Australia team has been flying sub-scale demonstrators to test the software and concepts of operation behind the system for months now. The program is also somewhat unique in that it’s an ambitious venture between the Australian Ministry of Defense and Boeing Australia, with the aircraft being designed and built in Australia, as well. In other words, this is not a U.S. program, but the results of it could impact the future of airpower both in the United States and in many allied countries around the globe. Getting Off The Ground We were briefed on the program by Jerad Hayes, Senior Director of Autonomous Aviation and Technology, and Dr. Shane Arnott, Program Director of Airpower Teaming System, and were given plenty of time to ask questions, which both gentlemen were more than enthusiastic about answering. What we learned is fascinating. The team is super pumped—that’s a quote—to be part of what they see as a historic and unprecedented drive to create a new paradigm for autonomous unmanned combat aircraft. It’s the first time Boeing has brought a clean-sheet design alive outside the United States and the first time the RAAF has done so in over half a century. The three aircraft that Boeing Australia is building are not prototypes as we commonly understand such a thing in the aviation world. Instead of being hand-built one-offs that will be similar to their production cousins, the trio was built using automated production techniques on a line that is itself a proof of concept for what a full-rate production line would look and operate like. In general, these three aircraft will provide a demonstration of operational capabilities and work as a proof of concept for the entire system, which is much more than just an airframe. It includes user command interfaces, modular sensor packages, maintenance regimes, data-links, and of course, software. Flight testing of the Boeing ATS is slated to move well beyond basic testing with the trio of airframes being built for the endeavor. Once again, we are talking about aircraft that are intended to perform beyond what a traditional prototype would, including acting as a demonstrator for missionized systems and various experimental tactics so that their impact on the realm of air combat can be proven. If successful, these concepts would find their way into the production system and the operational doctrine that goes with it. In other words, these aircraft will be about showing off what they can bring to the fight as much as testing their basic airworthiness and kinematic performance. Much of the development for ATS has already occurred in the virtual space, whether that be in a simulator, including those that pilots can interact with and give feedback on how the aircraft performs at their command, or via the use of a virtual model of the aircraft itself, the most advanced the company has ever devised. This “digital twin” concept, which you can read about in-depth here , is basically a highly detailed virtual model of the aircraft and its related systems, allowing for a whole slew of testing, development, and training to occur without a physical manifestation of the craft being present. This saves lots of time and money and Boeing has such high confidence in the ATS digital twin that they say it allows their team to speed up the fielding of the system while it is still in development, a process often referred to as concurrency. The digital twin goes beyond just virtual simulation. The software and interfaces the craft will leverage have allowed subscale physical flying surrogates to stand in for the full-sized drones to allow for testing and risk reduction work to be done even as the planes themselves have been under construction. As it sits now, the first flight of the real McCoy is slated for before the next Avalon Air Show , which is scheduled for February of 2021, with testing ramping up rapidly after that as the other two airframes join the test and demonstration force. If everything goes as plan, it would mean that Boeing flew a relatively ambitious new aircraft design in less than two years from the program’s initial announcement. This would be a stunning achievement. Nose Job The ATS airframe has one heck of a snout. One of the biggest features on the aircraft is that the nose section can be rapidly swapped between missions, giving the drone a whole new set of capabilities depending on the mission set while the core airframe stays exactly the same. The eight-and-a-half foot long snap-on, snap-off nose has around 9,000 cubic inches of space to carry whatever can be stuffed inside of it. The ability to swap out payloads to re-role a drone like this is one of the key tenets I described years ago in my mega feature on unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), and it is more about just changing the role of a single unmanned aircraft with relative ease. If you can swap out the primary sensor and technology payload on an aircraft like this, you can tailor a swarm of them for whatever mission is at hand. For instance, if the mission is about taking on enemy fighters, one drone can pack an infrared search and track system, while two others pack radars, while another packs a communications gateway, while another packs an electronic warfare payload and defensive laser system. This way, you can get just the right feature mix you need to put the maximum pressure on the enemy while not having to buy a drone that needs to accommodate all these systems simultaneously, which would be far more expensive. What Boeing is doing here with a modular nose is far more of a game-changer than it may seem at first glance. Using the entire nose section is a great idea because that is where some sensors and payloads have to live in order to be most effective. The SR-71 Blackbird family of aircraft used a similar system successfully decades ago. The first completed ATS fuselage. , Boeing The entire system’s open architecture backbone means that various vendors and even foreign operators of the aircraft can design and build their own unique missionized payloads for the nose of the aircraft. Fielding integrated electronics that work within an air arms existing ecosystem can be one of the most challenging and expensive factors when exporting combat aircraft. This makes doing that much easier and it also means foreign purchasers—and yes, the aircraft is intended to be exported—can also get some industrial offsets and organic technological investment by developing these payloads for their own ATS aircraft. An Economical Loyal Wingman? A major objective of the program is to make these drones remarkably affordable. The concept is that an air arm should buy them in some quantity in order to enjoy their impact on the battlespace in the best possible way. Being able to risk them without a loss being a huge hit to a force’s tactical jet end strength is also really important. Although the Boeing ATS team couldn’t give any hard figures, they did say that they would be competitive with Kratos’ Valkyrie, a loosely similar product that is in testing with the USAF now that you can read all about in these past War Zone articles linked here , here , here , and here , all capabilities considered. The goal of that program is to make an ‘attritable’ (optionally disposable) loyal wingman drone that is survivable and highly flexible, but costs around $2M apiece—not much more than the price of a Tomahawk cruise missile. It isn’t clear exactly how closely the two programs match up, but considering these aircraft will be used in very high-risk scenarios, the idea that some will be lost in combat is factored into the general concept that underpins them. It’s all a balance of capabilities, including survivability, versus cost. This balancing act significantly influenced the ATS design. While the aircraft was designed with low-observable (stealthy) features, performance and cost had to be weighed against the airframe’s detectability. When asked why a flying wing wasn’t used instead of the more traditional fighter-like layout, the ATS team noted that flying wings are expensive to make and unforgiving to fly. They also noted that their design has some maneuverability tricks up its sleeve with its relatively simple, but powerful four-control surface arrangement, which includes relative huge ‘tailerons’ that are similar to those found on the YF-23 . As such, the team thinks their aircraft is ‘good enough’ across a wider range of performance and signature objectives, which allows them to keep its price and complexity relatively low. Speaking of complexity, or lack thereof, the ATS aircraft’s entire wing section is made out of just two big composite pieces, one for the upper wing and one lower wing. They are built using an advanced out of kiln resin-infusion process that was pioneered on the 787. The rest of the unmanned jet also uses advanced composite manufacturing that lowers cost and time of production, while also being strong, corrosion-resistant, and light-weight. ATS alongside an F-15 Strike Eagle derivative. , Boeing With all this in mind, Boeing is really trying to position this aircraft system as a disruptive force multiplier that is accessible to a multitude of air arms around the globe, not just its RAAF partners. This could eventually include the Pentagon’s own air forces. Boeing says that the company is already talking with the RAAF’s American counterparts about their requirements and how the ATS could fit into them. Clearly, with Kratos’ Valkyrie being a hot program within the DoD at this time, the interest in this type of capability is quite high, especially if Boeing Australia and the RAAF can outpace Kratos and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) team behind the XQ-58 Valkyrie program when it comes to the maturity, flexibility, and the cost of their new loyal wingman system. The wild card in the U.S. market is that we still don’t know what lives in the shadows, specifically what Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman have supplied the U.S. military with in regards to stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles over the years, if they have done so at all. Boeing also noted in our discussion that the ATS isn’t just capable of integrating with other Boeing aircraft, it can work with any manufacturer’s aircraft without deep integration expenses or elaborate hardware changes. This is how it was designed and that alone should break down some barriers when it comes to exporting their loyal wingman to non-Boeing aircraft users abroad. It’s Not Just About A Buddy For Fighter Jets The ATS won’t just leverage its snap-on nose payload and svelte airframe to assist fighters in their various missions, such as counter-air, strike, reconnaissance, and electronic attack. Instead, Boeing sees formations of their ATS drones accompanying larger combat aircraft, such as tankers, maritime patrol aircraft, and airborne early warning and control jets, too. This makes great sense for Australia, which is investing heavily in all these high-value aircraft types. This high-value asset protection mission would free up manned fighters for other front-line missions and would provide a ring of defense around an air force’s most vulnerable, but also most critical aerial assets. You can read all about this emerging mission set in this past piece of ours. Boeing realizes that even with a wide-panel display, the confines of a fighter jet’s cockpit may not be able to maximize the potential of the ATS. Larger aircraft, like those mentioned above, could include big ATS crew stations with wide screens to more intricately control a formation, or even formations, of ATS drones. Boeing noted that they see a single fighter controlling three or four of the unmanned aircraft, so it isn’t hard to imagine an aircraft like the E-7 Wedgetail controlling a multiple of this number. With this in mind, tethering these aircraft to really any mothership is possible, which opens up a lot of possibilities. That being said, when I asked about these aircraft acting as discreet unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) that would not be tethered to a manned airborne platform, the team declined to talk about it, but they did say their focusing is on the loyal wingman concept of operations. Some of this may have to do with regulations and red tape when it comes to deploying and even exporting an AI-infused high-performance air combat drone. Part of the looming demonstration phase will hopefully dampen any of trust concerns, many of which emanate from Hollywood more so than reality. So, it appears that the ATS will be kept on a leash, at least for now. The X Factor Although Boeing was willing to share a ton about their new loyal wingman with us, a number of questions still remain. These include just the basic targeted performance of this aircraft. What is its kinematic performance, range, G-rating, takeoff and landing requirements, life expectancy, and more? Even more importantly, what is its payload? Although its nose can snap on and off, what type of weapons and expendables can it carry and deploy? Can it be aerial refueled? And maybe most importantly, how much agency will the aircraft have over its own mission in the foreseeable future? Regardless of these lingering questions, this is a huge accomplishment for Boeing, which, as we have detailed before, was an absolute leader in pioneer advanced unmanned combat drone technology, but somehow got passed over when it came to realizing a pathway to see that technology make it into an operational state until recently. With the addition of the MQ-25 Stingray carrier-borne tanker contract in the U.S. Navy, and now the potential introduction of a very disruptive ATS into the global combat aircraft marketplace, Boeing could be poised to become the leader in what is undoubtedly the future of aerial warfare.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. defense contractor Leidos has partnered with the American subsidiary of South Africa’s Paramount Group to offer the latter company’s Bronco II light attack and surveillance aircraft to U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, for its Armed Overwatch program. SOCOM announced this effort earlier this year and hopes to buy as many as 75 light attack aircraft in total. Leidos announced the Bronco II team-up , which also includes U.S.-based Vertex Aerospace, on May 4, 2020. Paramount has been trying to bring the aircraft, and its predecessor, the Advanced High Performance Reconnaissance Light Aircraft (AHRLAC), to the U.S. market since at least 2016, when Boeing announced plans to help out in this regard. In 2018, the South African firm also founded Bronco Combat Systems , or BCS USA, a joint venture with Virginia-headquartered Fulcrum Concepts, with hopes of offering the aircraft to the U.S. Air Force for that service’s most recent abortive light attack aircraft program . “Leidos has a long history as a premier provider of airborne solutions,” Gerry Fasano, President of Leidos Defense Group, said in a statement. “The Bronco II demonstrates our commitment to providing the best-of-breed in technology, as well as our agility in meeting the needs of our country’s national security mission.” Concept art of the Bronco II., Paramount Group “Our collaboration with Vertex and Leidos will present best of capabilities for what will undoubtedly be a critical program to enable U.S Air Force Special Operations Command to deal effectively with the challenges and rigors of modern day asymmetrical warfare,” Steve Griessel, CEO of Paramount Group USA, added in the press release. “The Bronco II was designed specifically for asymmetrical warfare and will operate at a fraction of the procurement and lifecycle costs of an aircraft with similar mission applications and capabilities.” The Bronco II is a light pusher-prop design powered by a single turbroprop engine. Its name is an homage to the twin-engine North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco , but the only thing the two aircraft really share is a general high-wing, tandem cockpit, twin-boom tail configuration. A top-down view of an OV-10 Bronco showing its general planform., NASA Paramount says the much smaller Bronco II has a cruising speed of 218 knots and a top speed of 272 knots. With a stall speed of just 62 knots, the aircraft is also capable of flying very slowly and quietly over a particular area for a protracted period of time. The South African manufacturer also says that one of the planes carrying a total payload of 500 pounds could fly out to a range of 150 nautical miles, orbit there for up to four hours, and then return to base. Paramount Group That payload could consist of a mixture of various weapons – including small precision-guided munitions, guided and unguided rockets, and gun pods – or other stores on six underwing stations, as well as sensors or other equipment in a modular bay underneath and behind the cockpit. The Bronco II also has an integral sensor turret, capable of accomodating color television and infrared cameras, under the nose. Paramount says that the modular bay, which offers 53 square feet of space, can handle weights up to 1,764 pounds and that personnel on the ground can remove and reinstall payload modules in just two hours. This means that Bronco IIs could be quickly reconfigured in the field to perform different types of specialized missions, including signals intelligence collection. The bay could also be used to transport cargo and the official website says there are plans for a light air-drop capability, as well. A graphic showing the modular payload bay and two payload options, one with a second sensor turret and another with a singals intelligence (SIGINT) payload. , Paramount Group Other possible payload bay configurations, including an electronic intelligence (ELINT) payload or a light airdrop system., Paramount Group The Bronco II’s website also highlights the aircraft’s limited operational and logistical requirements and its ease of transport. A C-17A Globemaster II transport can carry two of the light attack planes in a broken-down state, while a C-130 can carry one. The entire package will also fit inside a standard 40-foot-long shipping container. Paramount Group All of these features could make the Bronco II an attractive contender for SOCOM’s Armed Overwatch program. This effort first emerged publicly in the Pentagon’s budget request for the upcoming 2021 Fiscal Year, which came out in February. American special operators have long had a desire for an organic, low-cost, manned light attack aircraft capability to support their missions below permissive airspace. In 2015, SOCOM notably conducted a field test in Iraq using a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Broncos . This operational experiment highlighted the value of having a persistent and responsive manned armed overwatch capability directly available to special operations forces, without having to rely on conventional combat jets or even drones, and the ability of light attack aircraft to operate with a very “small footprint” from austere locations with limited support. You can read more about these aircraft and their activities in these past War Zone pieces . This is only one of a number of light attack aircraft evaluations that the U.S. military, as a whole, has conducted in the past decade or so . Now, SOCOM wants $101 million in its next budget to buy the first of these aircraft and then hopes to acquire 10 more planes each year for the next seven years after that. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), which would actually take delivery and operate these Armed Overwatch platforms, says it plans to use them first to replace its fleet of single-engine U-28A Draco intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planes, an aircraft you can read about in more detail here . Of course, with contracts worth hundreds of millions on the line and the potential to secure years more worth of deals to support the aircraft, the Bronco II team is set to face stiff competition in the Armed Overwatch program. AFSOC is already planning to buy two A-29 Super Tucanos from the Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer to support efforts to train and advise foreign air forces, an outgrowth of the Air Force’s latest failed light attack aircraft program . The service notably already operates a small fleet of A-29s to train allied and partner forces, such as Afghanistan , Lebanon , and now Nigeria , to fly these popular and combat-proven aircraft . Air Combat Command is also set to get two Textron AT-6 Wolverine light attack aircraft , another very mature design, to conduct various networking experiments , another follow-on to the Air Force’s most recent light attack aircraft plans, which the service publicly announced it had canceled in February. You can read more about the saga of that program, which began in 2017, in this past War Zone piece . In addition to the A-29 and AT-6, armed crop duster designs from Iomax, which are also combat-proven , as well as similar aircraft that Air Tractor and L3 are producing, are almost certain to be among the competing offerings. In 2018, Czech aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody and Israel Aerospace Industries, or IAI, said they were interested in pitching a version of the former company’s Albatross light jet series to the Air Force for its light attack aircraft effort and they could easily do the same for SOCOM’s new program. Textron’s Scorpion light jet , which the Air Force has also employed as a sensor testbed , is another possible contender. On top of all that, just last August, Paramount filed for bankruptcy protection for the division responsible for work on the AHRLAC, also known as the Mwari, on which the Bronco II is based. That aircraft has been in development since 2009, first as a joint venture with Aerosud, another South African firm, and now in partnership with private investors. In 2018, the company announced the sale of the first one of these planes to a still undisclosed customer. As such, winning SOCOM’s armed overwatch deal would a be a major boon for the entire AHRLAC/Bronco II endeavor, but it looks set to be a very uphill battle for Leidos, Paramount, and Vertex.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 9, 2021",The F-111 Aardvark’s Air Inlet Spike Was A Work Of Engineering Art,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The swing-wing F-111 Aardvark had a very tumultuous genesis, but there was no doubt that it was extremely advanced for its time. It never ended up serving with the Navy, but the Air Force made good use of it for the tactical and strategic strike roles, as well as an electronic warfare platform in the form of the EF-111 Raven. The jet looked like a sharp, hot knife slicing through the air at low-level and high-speed. It certainly was fast, but this high-speed capability came in part from the result of the aircraft’s fascinating variable geometry inlet ‘spike and cone’ design that helped feed massive volumes of stable air into the jet’s troublesome twin Pratt & Whitney TF30 turbofan engines. The F-111’s spike and cone design almost looks organic it is so beautifully engineered. The complexity of the Aardvark’s inlet configuration is well known. After its initial configuration, it went through two subsequent design iterations, named the Triple Plow I and Triple Plow II, in an attempt to overcome issues with airflow to the TF30s that were becoming notoriously finicky. You can see the entire video from where the clip of the spike and cone transitioning was taken (at 22:17 runtime) below: The F-111’s overall intake design works to separate the boundary air layer from the fuselage and lower wings in order to provide stable, high-volumes of air into the engines. The variable geometry spike and cone arrangement is used to keep this boundary layer air out of the intake and keep supersonic air from hitting the engine fan face. You can read all about jet inlet design, which is one of the most challenging aspects of a high-performance aircraft’s design, as well some of the relatively exotic methods engineers have devised to simplify these complex systems and to make them better suited for modern low-observable (stealthy) aircraft, in these past War Zone pieces linked here , here , and here . In a study about the efficiency of the inlets, NASA describes an early-build F-111A’s inlet functionality as such: The test airplane had two external compression inlets beneath the wing-fuselage junctures. These inlets were approximately quarter-round segments of axially symmetric inlets, and each provided airflow to one of the engines through separate ducts about 4.11 meters (13.5 feet) long. The inlets incorporated variable geometry to attain inlet-engine airflow matching and to adjust the amount of compression throughout the operating range. Inlet geometry together with the free-stream Mach number and airflow demand of the engines fixed the position of the compression shock system. …The two-cone air compression surface or “spike,”… devices which were used to prevent low-energy boundary-layer air from entering the inlet… … Spike translation was controlled as a function of local Mach number (ahead of the inlet) and diffuser exit Mach number. This portion of the control included position feedback. Second-cone angle was controlled by the same parameters in a loop which maintained a scheduled shock position pressure ratio. … At subsonic and low transonic flight speeds, the inlet spike was normally positioned forward and the second cone fully collapsed by the inlet controller to minimize spillage drag and compression. As the aircraft Mach number increased, the spike translated rearward and the second cone expanded according to the preset control system schedule. In this way, increased compression was obtained as the supersonic flow was decelerated by two conical shocks prior to deceleration to subsonic velocities through a normal shock near the cowl lip. NASA NASA NASA The revised Triple Plow I and II intakes still relied on a similar spike and cone design, but in the case of the Triple Plow II, it was enlarged significantly. Other changes to the inlet design are discussed by F-111.net in some detail: Operational F/EF-111As, F/RF-111Cs, the first FB-111A (67-0159), and the canceled F-111Ks were fitted with Triple Plow I inlets, which featured hydraulically translated cowls. The remaining FB-111A/F-111Gs, as well as all F-111D/E/Fs were fitted with Triple Plow II inlets, which featured three ‘blow-in’ doors. This redesign increased the separation between the inlets and fuselage, removed the external splitter panel, and featured inlet spikes 18-inches longer than the Triple Plow I’s. The fuselage of Triple Plow II aircraft angled back ever so slightly at the inlets to create more room between the two structures. These aircraft also featured a small, round inlet between the engine inlet and the fuselage. Finally, the F-111D/E/F and FB-111A all had a pattern of gray, and/or fiberglass-brown panels of radar absorbing material (RAM) on the interior of their inlets. A couple of “special cases”: The second FB-111A (67-0160) was fitted with Super Plow inlets, which were similar to the Triple Plow II except that the translating cowls were replaced with two ‘blow-in’ doors instead of three. The first five F-111Bs (151xxx) were fitted with essentially Triple Plow I inlets, while the last two (152xxx) had essentially Super Plows. Refer to the Ginter Book on this subject for details. While the Triple Plow II inlet reportedly increased inlet area by ten percent, it’s unclear if that was precisely true. Measurements of the inlets suggest the TP II may be marginally larger than the TP I, but nothing like ten percent. However, the frontal area of the inlets may have increased by that much because of the shifting of the inlet farther out from the fuselage. Aussie F-111. , USAF While other swing-wing jets, notably the F-14 Tomcat, get most of the attention, the F-111 was truly an amazing aircraft. Most may remember it best for its precision strike, low-level penetration, and spectacular dump-and-burn capabilities , but its inlet design was definitely another of its truly fascinating features.

What started with the Air Force’s Thunderbirds flying over their hometown of Las Vegas in a show of support for those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, has spread across the nation.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 7, 2020",Kim Jong Un Has An Enormous And Totally Bizarre Waterpark Barge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has now re-emerged in public, dispelling weeks of rumors that he might be dead or dying . His disappearance had prompted experts and researchers to comb available open sources of information to try to glean details about where he might be and his actual condition. A closer look at luxurious villas in and around the city of Wonsan on the country’s western coast, which Kim is known to frequent, uncovered a very different kind of development. Satellite imagery shows that there is ongoing work on a bizarre 260-foot long pool party barge that features twin figure-eight water slides and a two-story lounge. Overall, it’s something that looks like it was ripped out of a Hollywood blockbuster centered on a comically over-the-top dictator. On May, 1, 2020, NK Pro published a deep dive into this floating water park, based on a number of satellite images, including a series of shots from Planet Labs from late April of a dock in Wonsan where the barge is typically parked when not in use. The story pointed out that the pool surface in the center of the barge appeared to have been stripped and suggested that the lounge structure might have been removed entirely at one point. There were also indications that there might be work being done on the slides. Other Planet Labs imagery shows that at least as of March, work had started to remove the underlying pool surface. A satellite image of the docks from Planet Labs, dated May 1, which The War Zone has now obtained, shows that the lounge structure is in place and that it appears to have gotten re-roofed, not removed. The pool also appears to be full of water, suggesting it got re-surfaced and was filled to test it for any issues. A satellite image of some of the docks at Wonsan, with the pool party barge visible toward the bottom on May 1, 2020. The dark center section indicates that the pool has been filled with water.

The available satellite imagery suggests that it has not left the Wonsan dock, at least for any protracted period of time, since September, but it’s unlikely that the open-top craft sees use during the Korean Peninsula’s often frigid winters anyways, making the last few months a perfect time for a refit before the summer season. The available satellite imagery indicates that the waterpark barge does go out sparingly and typically during the summer and early fall. It appeared at Kim’s main villa in Wonsan between in August 2019. It was also seen anchored off the coast of Wonsan’s Kalma Peninsula in the fall of 2019 and the summer of 2018, according to NK Pro .

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION It’s not entirely clear when or where the waterpark barge was first built, either. It’s not the only floating pool in the world , but it is definitely a niche craft and it’s very possible that one of North Korea’s own shipyards put it together specifically for the Kims. We do know that it is more than two decades old, at least, dating back to the regime of Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il. Italian computer programmer and part-time pizza chef Ermanno Furlanis mentioned it in one of a series of articles about a bizarre trip to the reclusive country, which he says involved extensive vetting beforehand, including brain scans and blood tests, in 1997. Ermanno Furlanis., Facebook Furlanis said that Kim Jong Il, a known gourmand , had been seeking out “culinary demonstrations of Italian regional cooking” and that he was invited to the country to show the North Korean dictator and his chefs how to make pizza. This particular demonstration took place on one of Kim’s equally extravagant yachts. Here is how Furlanis described his encounter with Kim’s floating waterpark: “Mr Om [Furlanis’ regime-assigned minder] told me to get ready because the next day we would be cooking at the seaside on a boat. When I expressed my doubts about this he cut me short with his usual smile and urged me “not to worry”. The next morning a cabin cruiser topped with a salon and kitchen was sent to pick us up like a private water taxi. The writing on her stern read: ‘Capri Miami-Florida’. Ah, the mysteries of international politics!” “We sped along for about half an hour to the languid notes of Korean music past the islands and islets that form an archipelago in front of the base. At last a kind of a semi-mobile, floating amusement park appeared before us which was able to anchor in different places every day. It was made up of two waterslides which dropped down into a swimming pool. On the other side of the pool there was a two-storey [sic] building with an observation deck on the roof. I doubt if even [Italian director and screenwriter] Federico Fellini could have concocted something of this magnitude. We did not draw near this floating fun fair, and our guides even tried to prevent us from gawking at it. They went so far as to physically, though partly in jest, turn our heads aside with their hands. About half a mile further on we came to a big ship which lay anchored in sea. The heart of this ocean liner was, needless to say, a fully equipped kitchen fitted with huge windows overlooking the sea and where it would be our pleasure to work.” The Kim Dynasty is well known for indulging in lavish and sometimes eccentric luxuries, ranging from expensive western cars to high-priced liquor to ski resorts , all while much of the country’s average citizenry lives in poverty and often at risk of starvation. The regime in Pyongyang operates significant smuggling operations to ensure that these imports keep coming, as well as skirt international sanctions in general. The floating waterpark is well in line with the regime’s excesses and is one of at least five party barges that have been in use over the years. Satellite imagery indicates that the North Korean regime dismantled one of the other five craft sometime around 2017. When it comes to the pool barge, after being of the Kim Dynasty’s hard-partying lifestyle for more than 20 years, it could easily just be in need of a major overhaul. A satellite image of the docks in Wonsan from November 2017, showing four of the five leisure barges, including the floating waterpark, as well as various yachts and other boats., Google Earth When not in use, all of the remaining barges, along with Kim’s yachts and other smaller leisure boats, call the docks at Wonsan their home. This fleet of luxury vessels and other craft includes a 95-foot Princess 95MY , made by Princess Yachts , a U.K.-based company that is part of a larger French conglomerate. That ship, which cost the regime in Pyongyang an estimated $7 million, first appeared in official North Korean state media in 2013. Kim Jong Un visits a fisheries station in 2013. The Princess 95MY yacht is visible docked to the right., KCNA The Kim family’s party barges aren’t only the floating amenity in North Korea, either. In 1998, during a period of detente on the Korean Peninsula, a South Korean company purchased the world’s first floating hotel and moved it to the Mount Kumgang tourist resort in the North. Originally built in Singapore in 1988, the hotel had gone first to Australia and then to Vietnam, before finding its way in North Korea. Last year, Kim Jong Un decried the overall state of the Mount Kumgang resort , as well as its aesthetics, saying it offered accommodations akin to “makeshift tents in a disaster-stricken area” and “the buildings are just a hotchpotch with no national character at all.” Kim called for the renovation or demolition of all of the structures at the resort in order to bring in line with the country’s “own sentiment and aesthetic taste,” which has brought the future of the floating hotel into question. Kim Jong Un stands in front of the floating hotel during a visit to the Mount Kumgang resort last year., KCNA Of course, North Korea’s tourism industry, which is small, but had been growing amid improving relations between it and South Korea, as well as other countries in the region, has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is very plausible that Kim Jong Un’s recent pronounced absence from the public eye in recent weeks was been due to extreme measures to isolate him from potentially contracting the virus. Kim has just made his first public appearance since Apr. 11, going to a ceremony to mark the completion of a fertilizer plant. With Kim Jong Un very much alive, it seems very possible that the work being done on his bizarre and massive pool party barge is in preparation for another season of fun in the sun for the country’s elite.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on and Americans remain urged to stay home as much as they can to help prevent further outbreaks, employers, including the U.S. military, have encouraged working from home whenever possible . At the same time, healthcare providers have expanded the use of so-called telemedicine, remotely diagnosing and prescribing treatments, giving the virus fewer opportunities to spread and reducing the strain on medical personnel and infrastructure. These two worlds converged in a way recently when a team of Air Force engineers, at times working from their bedrooms and basements, helped ‘diagnose’ a battle-damaged A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft and prescribe a ‘treatment’ plan to maintenance personnel downrange without ever having to meet to face-to-face. The A-10, nicknamed “The Unleasher,” took a bullet to its belly while flying from an undisclosed location, according to a news story the Air Force published on Apr. 30, 2020. In recent years, these aircraft have regularly deployed to support combat operations in Iraq and Syria against ISIS and against the Taliban and other militant groups in Afghanistan. A low-quality picture of The Unleasher at its undisclosed operating location., USAF The Warthog is famously designed to absorb damage , with the pilot sitting inside a titanium armored “bathtub” and the aircraft having a host of redundant systems to help make sure it gets back safely no matter what. A-10s can fly with significant portions of their wings or even an entire engine shot away. The A-10 has demonstrated its durability in combat on numerous occasions, with aircraft surviving serious damage to their wings, tails, fuselage, and engine pods. In one particularly famous incident, Air Force Major Kim Campbell flew safely back to base in a shrapnel-riddled A-10 after a sortie over Baghdad, Iraq, in 2003, using backup manual mechanical flight controls after the double-redundant hydraulic control system failed. Then-Captain Kim Campbell looks at some of the damage to her A-10 after safely making it back to base following a sortie of Baghdad, Iraq in 2003., USAF The A-10 was also meant to be repaired quickly in the field and put right back into combat. An accident in 2015, in which an A-10 suffered a catastrophic failure while refueling during a combat mission over Iraq, highlighted these design features. The aircraft subsequently made an emergency landing at Al Asad Air Base. Air Force personnel, with help from U.S. Marines at that base, had the jet flying again in just five days . Air Force personnel work to install a new engine on an A-10 under austere conditions at Al Asad Air Base in 2015 after the jet made an emergency landing there after suffering a catastrophic engine failure., USAF While The Unleasher was able to return safely to its operating base without incident, just like many other battle-damaged A-10s before it, it was still in need of repairs. Under normal circumstances, even when dealing with jets at austere forward locations , it would not necessarily be uncommon for a specialized team to physically go inspect the aircraft, determine the extent of the damage, and then help maintenance personnel devise and execute a repair plan. Engineers and supporting personnel assisting from other locations, even thousands of miles way in the United States, would typically hold face-to-face meetings, too. The COVID-19 pandemic has made executing all of these relatively routine activities much more complicated due to the demands for social distancing and other measures to mitigate the virus’s spread whenever and where ever possible. So, in the end, a team of Air Force engineers Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s A-10 division, based at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, provided invaluable assistance to maintainers downrange entirely over the phone and online. “The entire operation was managed by e-mail, file sharing over the Global VPN [virtual private network], and telephone with none of the team members actually meeting face-to-face,” according to the Air Force. “Basically, the team accomplished the mission from their bedrooms, basements, and home offices while flattening the virus curve by working from home.” The members of the A-10 division engineering team in their home offices., USAF “The team tested the teleworking capabilities during the previous weeks in anticipation of such an event,” Pamela Lee, the head of the A-10 Division at Hill, explained. “Because of this preparation, engineering was able to keep the lines of communication open with the unit to support the expedient response to this emergency repair.” The first thing the team needed to do was get more information about the damage. The initial report was that a projectile had struck the A-10’s underbelly and that there was no clear exit hole. The engineers instructed the maintainers to cut a 3-inch hole around the impact point, after which they found the bullet had sheered three fasteners in the aircraft’s internal structure before lodging itself in the fuel cell cavity floor, causing a crack. With the full extent of the damage determined, the engineering team at Hill worked out a repair plan and provided step-by-step instructions for the maintenance personnel at the forward operating location. The maintainers then sent back details about the final repairs. “The disposition and flight waiver from the chief engineer were then released back to the unit in less than 24 hours,” Lee, the A-10 division chief, said. “I’m proud to know our team helped keep this vital aircraft in the air, performing its close air support mission that is so important to our forces on the ground.” This entire process is an interesting example of how the U.S. military is balancing the need to continue conducting operations with efforts to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among its personnel. It’s also likely to offer valuable lessons learned going forward for Air Force operations going forward. The service is increasingly exploring expeditionary and distributed operations concepts due to the concerns about the vulnerability of known, fixed bases to enemy attacks during a major conflict. A member of the US Air Force works to repair a battle-damaged A-10 in 2003., USAF Operating from remote and austere outposts involves a number of logistical challenges. It might not be feasible to deploy dedicated teams to these locations to support battle damage assessments and subsequent repairs that could vital to maintained sustained operations. In those cases, options to provide that support remotely could be invaluable. The Air Force is also increasingly looking toward ways to increase the use of digital modeling and simulation to improve and streamline maintenance procedures, and, by extension, cut costs, broadly. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center has now demonstrated how this kind of ‘telemedicine’ for combat aircraft might work after helping to get The Unleasher back into the fight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 30, 2020",Navy Picks Italian Design For Its New FFG-X Guided Missile Frigate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has chosen Marinette Marine, a Wisconsin-based U.S. subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri , to build up to 10 of its new guided-missile frigates, presently referred to as FFG(X) . This follows reports just days ago that the service would award this contract soon , months ahead of its initial schedule. The Pentagon announced the contract award , valued at $795,116,483, in its daily contracting announcement on Apr. 20, 2020. This is a fixed price deal with incentives that covers the costs of designing and constructing the initial ship, as well as various other ancillary costs, and also includes separate options for nine additional frigates. Fitting the first FFG(X) out with the required weapons, sensors, and other systems could raise the total purchase cost to $1.281 billion , which is in line with previous cost estimates , according to Navy budget documents. The Navy hopes to see the average unit price drop to around $781 million as over the course of the production run. The full contract announcement is as follows: “Marinette Marine Corp., Marinette, Wisconsin, is awarded a $795,116,483 fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract for detail design and construction (DD&C) of the FFG(X) class of guided-missile frigates, with additional firm-fixed-price and cost reimbursement line items. The contract with options will provide for the delivery of up to 10 FFG(X) ships, post-delivery availability support, engineering and class services, crew familiarization, training equipment and provisioned item orders.  If all options are exercised, the cumulative value of this contract will be $5,576,105,441. Work will be performed at multiple locations, including Marinette, Wisconsin (52%); Boston, Massachusetts (10%); Crozet, Virginia (8%); New Orleans, Louisiana (7%); New York, New York (6%); Washington, D.C. (6%), Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin (3%), Prussia, Pennsylvania (3%), Minneapolis, Minnesota (2%); Cincinnati, Ohio (1%); Atlanta, Georgia (1%); and Chicago, Illinois (1%). The base contract includes the DD&C of the first FFG(X) ship and separately priced options for nine additional ships.  The FFG(X) will have multi-mission capability to conduct air warfare, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare, and electronic warfare and information operations.  FFG(X) represents the evolution of the Navy’s small surface combatant, with increased lethality, survivability and improved capability to support the National Defense Strategy across the full range of military operations in the current security environment. Work is expected to be complete by May 2035, if all options are exercised. Fiscal 2020 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $795,116,483 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured via the Federal Business Opportunities website and four offers were received. The Navy conducted this competition using a tradeoff process to determine the proposal representing the best value, based on the evaluation of non-price factors in conjunction with price. The Navy made the best value determination by considering the relative importance of evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation, where the non-price factors of design and design maturity and objective performance (to achieve warfighting capability) were approximately equal and each more important than remaining factors.  The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-20-C-2300).” Fincantieri’s proposal is based on the Franco-Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate, design, variants of which are in service with the Italian, French, Egyptian, and Moroccan navies. You can read more about the FREMM derivative the shipbuilder developed to meet the FFG(X) requirements in this past War Zone piece . The Italian shipbuilder beat out offers from a partnership between General Dynamics Bath Iron Works and Spanish shipbuilder Navantia, as well as ones from Austal USA and Huntington Ingalls. The competition first began in 2017. Lockheed Martin dropped out of the running in 2019 as a prime contractor, but is also a member of Fincantieri’s team of subcontractors. The five original FFG(X) teams. Lockheed Martin pulled out as a prime contractor in 2019., USN “The Navy’s Guided-Missile Frigate (FFG(X)) will be an important part of our future fleet,” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said in a separate U.S. Navy statement . “FFG(X) is the evolution of the Navy’s Small Surface Combatant with increased lethality, survivability, and improved capability to support the National Defense Strategy across the full range of military operations. It will no doubt help us conduct distributed maritime operations more effectively, and improve our ability to fight both in contested blue-water and littoral environments.” “I am very proud of the hard work from the requirements, acquisition, and shipbuilder teams that participated in the full and open competition, enabling the Navy to make this important decision today,” James Geurts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition, also said . “Throughout this process, the government team and our industry partners have all executed with a sense of urgency and discipline, delivering this contract award three months ahead of schedule.  The team’s intense focus on cost, acquisition, and technical rigor, enabled the government to deliver the best value for our taxpayers as we deliver a highly capable next generation Frigate to our Warfighters.” Fincantieri’s proposed FFG(X) variant of the FREMM, which is a very mature and still-in-production design, long appeared to be a very attractive and low-risk option for the Navy. In addition, the FREMMs feature a highly efficient combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion system, which could make the FFG(X) variant relatively cheap to operate, as well. The head of the Navy’s Program Executive Office for Unmanned and Small Combatants (USC), Rear Admiral Casey Moton, also told reporters that Fincantieri had done significant work to demonstrate the capabilities of its proposed ship. “I think we did a lot of due diligence,” he added. The contract is also an important win for the Marinette Marine shipyard specifically, which has been building Freedom class littoral combat ships as part of a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Fincantieri. With the end of the Freedom ‘s production run looming, another major U.S. military contract will help ensure it additional work down the road. Marinette Marine is also set to build four other frigates, derived from the Freedom class, for Saudi Arabia . At present, Navy expects the construction of the first FFG(X) to begin no later than 2022 and then take delivery of that ship in 2026. Depending on when it might exercise the remaining options in the contract, it could have eight more in various stages of production when the first one arrives. The service has said it does not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to impact these shipbuilding plans. Beyond all this, this is certainly an exciting announcement that will have significant impacts on the structure of the U.S. Navy’s surface fleets for years to come. The War Zone will continue to update this post with additional details as they become available. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Aaron Amick,"Updated on Jun 16, 2020",How The Experimental USS Narwhal Ended Up Being The Navy’s Stealthiest Nuclear Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USS Narwhal , also known by its hull number SSN-671, was a totally unique and experimental nuclear-powered attack submarine and one of the most successful boats of her era. Her unique design made her the quietest attack submarine in the U.S. fleet in the 1970s and she was routinely deployed far and wide to watch Soviet submarines in the Atlantic and around Soviet-supported satellite states in the Mediterranean Sea. In this piece, we will dive deeply into what made her quieter than any other operational nuclear submarine of her era and how the game-changing technology she pioneered was implemented in future United States submarine projects. In the first half of the 1960s, the U.S. Navy challenged the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation with constructing an operational prototype submarine using elements of the Sturgeon class hull design. It was to be quiet, fast, and lethal, while still leveraging existing technology and construction methods. To understand what made SSN-671 so special, we must understand what makes nuclear submarines vulnerable to detection and destruction. Any piece of equipment that moves is a potential noise source for a submarine. The heavier and faster it moves, the more energy is being exchanged, thus the more likely it is to become a detection problem. Some of that energy can be transmitted as vibration, a cyclical energy sonar systems detect. If the engineers can remove or improve these heavy energy loads, they will be successful in building a quieter nuclear submarine. Electric Boat identified areas that could be improved. The first was the Main Reactor Coolant pumps. These large, high-heat, high-pressure pumps spin under heavy load and can be the most vulnerable acoustic source of any nuclear-powered vessel. General Electric designed Narwhal’s unique S5G power plant with the reactor vessel situated low in the submarine’s hull and the steam generators situated above the reactor to facilitate a natural flow of the reactor’s primary coolant. This Pressurized-Water Reactor (PWR) design heated its primary loop in the reactor and convection moved the water into the steam generator near the top of the loop where energy is exchanged into the secondary system. With less energy, the primary coolant flows back down towards the reactor vessel in a return loop. This simple design relies on physics to move the water rather than a mechanical pump. Natural circulation only occurs under specific circumstances, so reactor coolant pumps were still used, but only when necessary. When the reactor is critical, but in a low power state, it may not have enough energy to maintain a natural circulation of the primary coolant. This is when the primary coolant pumps are used to maintain coolant circulation to prevent runaway heat generation in the reactor vessel. Conversely, in a high energy state, a mechanical coolant pump is necessary to keep up with the coolant demands. There is a wide region of power between these two conditions that allow the main engines and turbines to run normally without main reactor coolant pumps working at all. This portion of the envelope is where Narwhal would be able to operate with unprecedented stealthiness. Narwhal under construction., USN The next challenge was addressing the massive reduction gear system used in nuclear submarines. This mechanical complex of pinions and gears is used to convert high energy, high rotations per minute (RPM) main engine steam turbines’ motion into a high-torque, low RPM shaft rotation. Every metal-on-metal joining in this reduction system is a noise source. Collectively it can be very detectable at most speeds. Electric Boat removed it from the ship’s plans. They installed a revolutionary, direct-drive main engine turbine that was mechanically linked to the shaft. This system was larger than the original reduction gear design, 12 feet in diameter and 30 feet in length , resulting in a slightly wider submarine than the Sturgeon class, but also a significantly quieter submarine overall. Electric Boat was determined to remove as many noise sources as possible. They tackled the Main Seawater system next. Two seawater scoops were added to the exterior part of the hull that would force water into the main seawater system as the Narwhal moved forward. During low speed, slow approach operations these scoops moved enough water to cool the engine room loads. The main seawater system could be cross-connected to the axillary water systems effectively supplying all engine room seawater demands without pumps. With these changes planned, USS Narwhal’s keel was laid on 17 January 1966 at the Electric Boat’s yard in Groton, Connecticut with strictly compartmentalized access measures put in place to safeguard her secrets. A quiet, but proud, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover—the ‘father’ of the nuclear Navy —was present at the launch in September 1967 when Mrs. Glynn R. Donaho christened the submarine into Connecticut’s Thames River. His new cutting-edge S5G reactor was officially heading to pier-side trials. Launch of SSN-671. , USN The 5,300-ton displacement, 314-foot long, 38-foot wide submarine finished sea trials in 1969 with little rework needed. The crew of about 140 men successfully passed all technical and operational requirements. The sub performed very well and was amazingly quiet. Narwhal was assigned to Submarine Detachment Two in New London, Connecticut, and deployed to Holy Loch and Faslane, Scotland in 1970 and 1971. The unique submarine’s deployments took her “around the corner,” a term used when a sub enters the Barents Sea from the Norwegian Sea, where she successfully trailed Soviet submarines. She was awarded Meritorious Unit Commendations for these missions. The specifics of her operations are still classified, but she had a high operational tempo because of her incredible acoustic advantage. The Navy was maximizing her opportunities to collect as much data on the Soviet’s Northern Fleet as possible. Between 1970 to 1974, she deployed six times and was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation, Navy Unit Commendation, and Battle Efficiency “E” award. She was a ‘hot boat’ who deployed often and was rewarded for it with extended shore visits in northern Europe. Narwhal underway., USN From 1975 to 1979, she deployed to the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. There she operated with the fleet and independently earned two more Meritorious Unit Commendations, two Battle Efficiency “E” and two Anti-Submarine Warfare Gold “A” awards. The USS Narwhal is one of two remarkably successful submarines during this period for the Navy. The other was the USS Parche , which conducted Operation Ivy Bells in the Pacific , among other highly classified operations. After a drydock and repair period, SSN-671 was deployed back to the Mediterranean Sea and attached to the Sixth Fleet again. She earned another set of Battle Efficiency “E” and Engineering Red “E” awards between 1982 and ’85. She participated in annual wargames in the Atlantic and wrapped up the 1980s back in the Mediterranean Sea earning another award, the Supply Blue “E”. Another shot of SSN-671 underway on the surface., USN She returned to Charleston Naval Base in South Carolina to prepare for an upcoming overhaul period. With her reactor shutdown and diesel fuel offloaded, the sub was in no condition to go to sea when Hurricane Hugo appeared in the Atlantic. The crew doubled the mooring lines and nine wire cables held the submarine fast to the pier and they prepared to ride out the storm in the watertight, but not a seaworthy vessel. Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston hard and ripped all but one mooring line free. With the winds pushing the Narwhal out into the river, the captain was faced with two outcomes. Let the storm push the sub down the river and into anything that may be in the way or submerge in the river. He chose to dive and ride out the hurricane on the river bottom with the sail still exposed above the waterline. This was perhaps the most unique underway in submarine history. The captain was awarded a promotion for his quick decisive action in the most unlikely of circumstances. You can read a detailed accounting of these events in this past War Zone article . Narwhal at the bottom of the Cooper River following Hurrican Hugo. , USN The subsequent 36-month long refuel and overhaul included a sonar upgrade to the AN/BQQ-5D system. This gave the Narwhal the ability to beamform a new thin-line towed array, the TB-23 . This new towed array was much longer than the previous TB-16 tactical towed array, allowing much more directivity at low frequency. Low-frequency detection and directivity are important because frequencies below 100 Hz are more difficult to prevent at the source. New and well-maintained submarines may only have low-frequency vulnerabilities. Low frequencies also travel much farther in a water medium because they don’t lose as much energy as higher frequencies. With this in mind, the TB-23 towed array gave the Narwhal a very long-range detection capability. An obvious modification to the hull became known as the ‘turtleback.’ This was a large expansion of the hull topside just forward of the rudder that was made to house equipment. The Navy never officially released what the modification was for, even after decommissioning. Speculation among media sources suggests it sheltered a remotely operated vehicle or was a lockout chamber similar to the one on the USS Parche . It was probably was added to make room for the thin line towed array handling gear, but that has never been confirmed. A port bow view of the submarine tender USS L.Y. Spear (AS-36) tied up on the north side of one of the Destroyer & Submarine (D&S) piers at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. The nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Narwhal (SSN-671) is tied up inboard on the south side of the pier with a Sturgeon class nuclear-powered attack submarine outboard. A red arrow points to the large raised hump added to the Narwhal’s stern., USNA Revitalized, she returned to the Sixth Fleet in 1994. There she conducted some local operations in 1995 before taking a four-month-long journey around South America in 1996. In 1998, she began her 17th deployment, a six-month tour around the Mediterranean. She concluded a very secretive, but highly awarded career conducting operations in the North Atlantic and supporting operations in local operating areas off the east coast of the United States until her decommissioning in 1999. Decommissioning a submarine only a few years after refuel and overhaul is rare and suggests that something may have happened causing her early exit from operational status. Of course, this was a time of great drawdowns in end-strength after the end of the Cold War. Nuclear surface combatants were also being retired well before their service lives expired. With the submarine threat largely reduced by the collapse of the Soviet Union, keeping the one-off boat operational was likely a cost the Navy no longer thought was necessary. The cost of the service’s next-generation submarine program had ballooned and those boats would be incredibly capable, as well, further making the Narwhal less of a ‘unicorn,’ so to speak. The Navy incorporated the technology of the natural circulation in the S5G reactors into the newer S8G powerplants. The ability to cross-connect seawater systems became standard on United States submarines, but the scoops were never used again due to SUBSAFE restrictions. The SUBSAFE program was created in the wake of the USS Thresher disaster , which tragically killed everyone on board. Part of the safety program limited the size of any hull penetrations and the scoops exceeded those limitations. The direct drive was a technological marvel and very quiet, but due to its increased size, the cost in manpower, time, and money required to maintain it, it was not used again in future builds. Decommissioned submarines at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington circa 2016. Narwhal can be seen in the center of the group. , Chris Light/Wikicommons By the 1980s, a new submarine was on the drawing boards at Electric Boat that would become the most capable and quietest submarine the United States ever built, the USS Seawolf , also known as SSN-21. Even though she has been eclipsed by newer and more capable submarines, Narwhal will go down in history as one of the ‘hottest’ boats in U.S. Navy history and its experimental nature certainly plays into her unique mystique to this very day.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2019",Marine F/A-18 Hornets Fly Armed With Live Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles In Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A number of U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jets forward-deployed to Japan recently conducted an exercise while carrying a pair of live AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missiles . The Corps says that the training event focused on its ability to contribute to sea control and area denial missions, capabilities the service wants to enhance and expand as part of a radical restructuring of its forces that it first publicly announced last month. Japanese planespotter Seagull-jap4, who also goes by the Twitter handle @miejapan4 , posted some of the first pictures of Harpoon-armed Hornets on Apr. 29, 2020, but has since made their account private. The 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, the Marine Corps’ top forward-deployed aviation unit in Japan, has since posted a number of official pictures of the exercise online . The War Zone had already reached out for more specific details about the exercise, which signaled to potential adversaries in the region, such as China, that Marine Hornets are ready and able to fly out and counter hostile maritime activities. The F/A-18C/Ds that participated in the exercise, which took place on Apr. 28 at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni , came from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 115 (VMFA-115) and Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242 (VMFA[AW]-242), also known as the “Silver Eagles” and “Bats,” respectively. VMFA(AW)-242 is forward-deployed to Iwakuni, while VMFA-115 is presently on a rotational deployment there. Both are assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 12 (MAG-12), which is part of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. “During the exercise, MAG-12 focused on naval missions and simulated anti-ship long-range fires in order to enhance the Marine Corps’ ability to effect sea control and denial in the Indo-Pacific,” according to the official picture captions. It’s not clear if any of the aircraft live-fired their missiles against mock targets. One of VMFA-115’s F/A-18Cs taxies at MCAS Iwakuni during the recent exercise., USMC An F/A-18D assigned to VMFA(AW)-242 armed with Harpoons during the recent exercise., USMC The exercise certainly highlighted the continued ability of land-based Marine Corps Hornets to go out to an area and contest or defend it against a maritime opponent using the AGM-84D. This version of the Harpoon first entered service since the 1980s and you can read more about this family of missiles in this past War Zone piece . A Marine moves an AGM-84D Harpoon missile on the flightline at MCAS Iwakuni during the recent exercise., USMC Marines load an AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile onto one of VMFA-115’s Hornets during the recent exercise., USMC Other newer and more capable air-launched anti-ship weapons are becoming available, too, and more are in development , including in the classified realm . The Navy has already integrated the more modern AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) onto its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and this could be a future option for Marine Hornets. There are plans to add it to the arsenal of weapons that all three variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can carry externally. Raytheon and Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg are also working on integrating the Joint Strike Missile (JSM), a multipurpose air-launched weapon based on Kongsberg’s surface-launched Naval Strike Missile (NSM), which is now entering U.S. Navy service, on the F-35A. This could be another option for both Marine Hornets and Joint Strike Fighters, though the space limitations of the internal bays on the Corps’ F-35Bs could preclude internal carriage of the weapon. Beyond that, ever-improving networking and data-sharing capabilities will steadily expand the ability of Marine combat aircraft to pass targeting information between each other, as well as with other assets in the air, at sea, and on the ground, including those from other branches of the U.S. military or allied or partner forces during coalition operations. This will enable Marine jets to engage targets outside of the range of their own sensors and while staying as far away as possible from hostile threats, something that is particularly important as times goes on for the non-stealthy F/A-18C/Ds. The Marine Corps also says that the exercise at Iwakuni was “in-line with Force Design 2030.” This is a recently released force structure concept, which you can read about more detail in this past War Zone piece , that centers on expeditionary and distributed operations concepts that sees future Marines missions, especially in the Pacific, involving rapidly establishing austere outposts, occupying them for a limited period, and then shifting position in order to knock opponents off balance and make it more difficult for them to respond both offensively and defensively. A key focus of the force structure plans is expanding existing long-range anti-ship capabilities and acquiring new ones, such as land-based Tomahawk cruise missile launchers, so the aforementioned Marine outposts can contribute more to broader maritime operations. “Part of the homework that the Navy and Marine Corps done over the past six months is how we think we are going to need to operate in the future as an integrated naval force and that means the Marine Corps assumes a role that we have not had in the past 20 years which is how do we contribute to sea control and sea denial,” U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger told members of Congress in March. “What we need is long-range precision fires for a small unit, a series of units that can from ship or from shore hold adversaries’ naval force at risk.” Berger was specifically talking about the need for the ground-launched Tomahawks, but it’s not hard to see how this same thinking would apply to Marine aviation units, as well. Increasing the emphasis on the anti-ship capabilities of the Marine Corps’ land-based combat aviation units is well in line with the overall concepts outlined in Force Design 2030, as well as the equally ambitious planning guidance that the Commandant released last year, which you can read about in this previous War Zone story . The Marines are not alone in having an increased interest in anti-ship operations, either, with the Navy , Air Force , and Army all looking to expand their capabilities in this regard. Force Design 2030 doesn’t specifically mention any particular potential adversary by name as the prompt for this need for more anti-ship capabilities, but Berger did mention China numerous times in his 2019 planning guidance. The ballooning size of that country’s navy is one of, if not the primary driver behind this shift in focus. The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) expects the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) major surface and submarine fleets to exceed 400 hulls by 2030, according to a document it prepared in February for members of Congress that the Federation of American Scientists recently obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. A table on projected People’s Liberation Army Navy fleet totals, as well as U.S. Navy overall totals for comparison, through 2030 that the Congresisonal Research Service put together earlier this month based on the Office of Naval Intelligence’s estimates., CRS China is producing large and more modern warships, including aircraft carriers , amphibious assault ships , and other major surface combatants , as well as both nuclear and advanced diesel-electric submarines , at a prodigious rate. ONI’s projected PLAN fleet total notably also doesn’t include around 85 anti-ship missile-armed patrol craft that could pose a threat to American warships. The country is making strides in developing advanced weapons and other systems to go on those ships, too. “Chinese ship design bureaus and shipyards use modern software, design practices, machinery, and ship construction methods comparable to those used at U.S. shipyards,” according to ONI. “Chinese naval ship design and material quality is in many cases comparable to USN ships, and China is quickly closing the gap in any areas of deficiency.” The U.S. Navy, which has struggled to meet a long-standing goal of acquiring a 355-ship fleet , is in the middle of a protracted effort to develop its own new force structure plan . No matter what, the comparable size of what it calls its Battle Force is likely to be substantially smaller by the end of the decade. As such, finding additional and alternative means to counter China’s growing quantitative edge has become all the more important. Tensions between the United States and China have been ratcheting up in recent years over a host of different issues , especially with regards to Beijing’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea . This has led to a number of altercations between American and Chinese forces, including a near-collision between a U.S. Navy destroyer and a PLAN one in 2018. Friction between the two countries has grown again recently over aggressive Chinese responses to commercial ships from other countries operating in areas of the South China Sea that Beijing says are its sovereign territory. This month, Navy warships have also conducted a number of so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrols in that region, as well as the Strait of Taiwan, to challenge Chinese claims, which have drawn the ire of that’s country’s authorities. It is worth noting that the U.S. military as a whole has concerns about the vulnerability of land-based combat aircraft, especially those operating from known, fixed bases, such as MCAS Iwakuni, during any future high-end conflict, including against China in the Pacific. The U.S. Air Force is now exploring new and improved concepts for rapidly establishing fixed-wing aviation operations at austere sites, which is something the Marine Corps will also have to consider. It’s F-35Bs, of course, do offer the benefit of being able to take off and land vertically, allowing for runway independent operation , something that is set to only become an even more important component of the service’s concepts of operation. As the Marines refine and implement their Force Design 2030 plans, more information about these concepts of operations is likely to emerge. At the same time, anti-ship focused Marine combat aviation exercises, such as the recent one at MCAS Iwakuni, look set to become a much more routine sight.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",These Aerial And Satellite Photos Of An Airport Absolutely Stuffed With Airliners Are Nuts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Southern California Logistics Airport (VCV) in Victorville, California is an interesting aviation landmark, to say the least. It was once George Air Force Base, which hosted rows of fighter jets up until it was closed 1992. It then morphed into a fairly unique multi-use airport that supports everything from jet engine development to flight testing exotic aircraft . What it is best known for is for being a place where operators and manufacturers can store airliners where they’ll be dry and safe. So, when COVID-19 swept the planet and airlines needed space to store their soon to be mothballed fleets, VCV was at the top of their lists. VCV started this crisis with many airplanes already stored around its sprawling grounds, but just how many planes have joined their ranks is astonishing. Keep in mind, that the airfield already had a mass influx of Boeing 737Max jets that have been grounded for over a year before the epidemic struck. In satellite images that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, the first taken on May 20th, 2019, and the second taken on April 14th, 2020, you can see the throngs of airliners that have been put into storage at the big Mojave Desert airfield.

Although Southern California Logistics Airport is just one of a vast number of airports around the globe that have disused airliners littering their aprons and runways during the COVID-19 nightmare, it appears to have received the most aircraft by a substantial margin. It remains totally unclear when the airline industry will rebound or just how much long-term damage has been done by the pandemic, but it is almost impossible to imagine a situation where it won’t take years to recover. With that in mind, those airliners may be sitting idle on VCV’s runways and aprons for a long while to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2021",The Army’s Aborted XM8 “Starship Troopers” Rifle Lived On In The Hands Of Malaysian Frogmen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Very often, the decision by a country with a large, professional military, such as the United States, to adopt some new type of weapon or other military equipment leads to sales of those systems , or variants thereof , to other nations. Systems that do not have this kind of official stamp of approval or, worse, get rejected by the original intended customer , are often doomed to failure on the international market. Still, there are occasions where another country will see what is otherwise a failed project and give it a new lease on life. This is exactly what happened with the curious case of a Malaysian naval special operations unit fielding variants of the Heckler and Koch XM8 , a much-touted family of 5.56mm small arms that the U.S. Army had abandoned as potential replacements for various weapons, including its M16 rifles and M4 carbines . The Royal Malaysian Navy’s Pasukan Khas Laut , which translates to English as Naval Special Warfare Forces and is more commonly abbreviated PASKAL, first began using the XM8 series around 2010, five years after the Army officially suspended the project. Pictures are available online showing PASKAL operators carrying rifle and carbine variants, as well as examples of the especially rare personal defense weapon (PDW) configuration. PASKAL is roughly analogous to the U.S. Navy SEALs and routinely trains with that American unit, as well as other U.S. and international special operations forces. It traces its history the Royal Malaysian Navy’s decision to create a Naval Commando Unit within its Security Regiment Organization in 1977. This element officially became the country’s Naval Special Warfare Forces in 1981. The unit trains to carry out various typical maritime special operations missions, such as raiding ships and boats and conducting long-range reconnaissance missions in coastal environments. However, its personnel also train to perform a host of unconventional warfare activities behind enemy lines or for internal defense, such as training counter-guerrilla forces, more in line with the traditional mission set of U.S. Army Special Forces units . PASKAL is also on call to conduct various internal security and counter-terrorism operations at sea and on land. It not clear how or why PASKAL acquired the XM8s. The purchase appears to have been part of a larger shopping spree with Heckler and Koch, which also included orders for 5.56mm G36 and HK 416 rifles , 7.62mm HK 417 rifles , .45 caliber UMP submachine guns , and 4.7mm MP7 personal defense weapons . It’s unclear if Heckler and Koch ever made any XM8s for any other purpose beyond the approximately 200 it made for U.S. trials. So, it’s possible that these guns were either leftover from those tests or were assembled from the remaining parts that the company had made to support those efforts. A PASKAL operator with an XM8 rifle, at left, next to another individual with a G36K carbine., Rizuan via Wikimedia PASKAL operators take part in Malaysia’s 57th National Day Parade in 2014. The three individuals in the foreground are carrying, from left to right, an XM8 carbine, a G36 rifle, and an HK 416 rifle. Another individual with an XM8 rifle is seen near the end of the front row, second from the right., Rizuan via Wikimedia Another PASKAL operator in 2014 carrying a PDW version of the XM8., Rizuan via Wikimedia An XM8 carbine with an under-barrel 40mm grenade launcher on display during a PASKAL open day event in 2016., Rizuan via Wikimiedia The XM8 itself traces its origins back to the 1990s and a series of over-arching Army plans to field a variety of new and advanced infantry weapons and equipment. This included a program to develop a standard infantry weapon that would combine a compact 5.56mm gun with a 20mm grenade launcher capable of firing programmable ammunition that could be set to airburst above enemy forces hiding behind hard cover. A Heckler and Koch-led development team ultimately won the contract to build what was formally known as the XM29 Objective Infantry Combat Weapon . Technical issues, particularly work to reduce the overall weight and bulk of the ambitious gun, led the Army to reorganize the program and attempt to develop the two components first as separate weapons in 2004. The 5.56mm weapon became known as the XM8. The 20mm grenade launcher, which later evolved into a 25mm weapon, became the XM25, also known as the Punisher, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The very first version of the XM8 was a heavily modified version of the G36C carbine, part of the G36 rifle family that Heckler and Koch had first developed for the German military. The new gun made significant use of polymers in its construction and used a physical gas piston to cycle the operating mechanism. This helps keep unburnt gunpowder and other particulate matter out of the inner workings of the gun, reducing the likelihood of jams or other malfunctions, especially are long periods of use without cleaning. The M16 and M4 series of guns have so-called direct impingement systems that siphon off propellant gas and use that to cycle the action directly. The very first XM8 prototype., Jim Schatz via HKPRO.com Army Brigadier General James Moran, then head of the service’s Program Executive Office Soldier, complained that the original design looked too much like the German G36 for a weapon that American soldiers would carry, according to the late Jim Schatz , a long-time employee of Heckler and Koch’s U.S. subsidiary. Army officials specifically asked if the gunmaker could make it look “more Starship Troopers,” a reference to the loose 1997 film adaptation of the 1959 Robert Heinlein science fiction novel of the same name, according to firearms researcher Ian McCollum , who runs the website ForgottenWeapons.com . The futuristic-looking prop guns in that movie were built around modified Ruger AC-556 rifles in a so-called “bullpup” configuration , with the magazine and main action placed behind the pistol grip. The rifle versions also had a modified Ithaca M37 12-gauge shotgun mounted under the barrel. The “Morita” assault rifle., TriStar Pictures capture Heckler and Koch did refine the design into a sleeker, futuristic-looking package. The final XM8 prototype design, though formally designated as a carbine, was actually an impressive modular firearms concept that was in many ways ahead of its time. The Army’s Modular Handgun System program, which led to the adoption of variants of the 9mm Sig Sauer P320 pistol, followed a similar philosophy . The XM8 family had a common receiver design to which armorers could add different length barrels, handguards, buttstocks, and other features. The XM8 had an integrated sighting system, as did the G36 that it was derived from, as well. The gunmaker also eventually added accessory rails, which were not as widespread in the early-to-mid 2000s as they are now, to later iterations of some of the handguard options and the top of the carry handles for the rifle and carbine variants. An infographic showing the proposed XM8 family for the US Army., Heckler and Koch The guns performed relatively well in testing. For a time looked set to become the Army’s next standard infantry weapon and possibly enter service with the other branches of the U.S. military, as well. The XM8, or other guns clearly inspired by it, was a staple of video games in the 2000s and replicas also appeared in the movies Children of Men and District 13: Ultimatum . However, a combination of Army requirements demands and political factors, including a push by members of Congress to open the XM8 program up to other contenders, including American-headquarter gun manufacturers, together with debates about whether the new gun offered substantial enough improvements to justify the cost of adopting a new standard infantry weapon, ultimately conspired to kill the program in 2005. A US Army soldier with an XM8 carbine with a 40mm under-barrel grenade launcher, at left, and one with a full-length rifle variant, at bottom., US Army Heckler and Koch offered further refined variants, known as the XM8-Rs, which were more visually similar to the earlier generation of G36-looking guns, to U.S. Special Operations Command for its Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) program. The U.S. Navy, which was overseeing that effort, refused to accept the company’s submission after its proposal package arrived five days after the deadline. The American subsidiary of Belgian gunmaker FN subsequently won that competition. The XM8-R for the SCAR program., Jim Schatz via HKPRO.com In 2007, the Army bowed to pressure , particularly from some members of Congress, to test the FN SCAR and Heckler and Koch HK 416 rifle, the latter of which is a derivative of the M16 pattern that used a gas piston instead of direct impingement, as potential new service rifles. The service also included some of the XM8s, which it still had in storage, in the tests. The Army ultimately decided to stick with its existing M4 carbines, though the HK 416 became popular with U.S. special operations forces . The U.S. Marine Corps has also adopted versions in the infantry automatic rifle and designated marksman roles and is now looking to make it their standard infantry rifle . Special operators, as well as regular Army forces, have also now adopted designated marksman variants of the larger HK 417 . With the exception of Malaysia’s PASKAL, no other country has adopted any variant of the XM8. Heckler and Koch has had greater success with its HK 416 and HK 417 product lines than it has with its G36, as well. The company did take lessons learned from all of these guns in developing its latest HK 433 . It’s not clear if PASKAL has ever used its XM8s during actual operations, or how many it might still have in inventory in any configuration, either. Since 2010, it has conducted counter-piracy operations near Somalia and made deployments in support of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan. In 2015, the unit also deployed personnel as part of the response to the hijacking of the tanker MT Orkim Harmony in the South China Sea. In that case, the hijackers eventually abandoned the ship without harming any of the crew on board. The guns are also notably absent from 2018’s PASKAL: The Movie . During the production of that film, some of the actors trained with PASKAL operators , including making a visit to the Lapang Sasar Abdul Samad shooting range at the unit’s home base in the port city of Lumut. This is also notably the location where the video of the individual shooting the XM8 PDW, seen near the top of this story, was shot. That video was uploaded in 2018 and it’s unclear if this was related to the filming of the movie or not. Whatever the case, PASKAL’s decision to adopt the various variants of the XM8, even on a limited level, is a fascinating epilogue to the story of a gun that once stood looked like it would be the future of U.S. Army infantry small arms. UPDATE: 4/30/2020: After the publication of our story, Twitter user @amimJK let us know that the Malaysian Army Forces (MAF), as well as the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP), had trialed variants of the XM8 themselves in 2007. They also shared pictures from a local magazine at the time, showing variants in identical configurations to the ones that PASKAL operators were later seen carrying. This makes it more likely than not that the naval special operators received these XM8s after those trials concluded and the MAF and the RMP both decided against adopting the guns. It’s still not clear whether or not Heckler and Koch built entirely new weapons for these trials.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as The War Zone predicted over a week ago , the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels have executed the first in what will be a large number of flybys across the United States to honor those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now we have some awesome footage and images of the teams joining forces in the skies above New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. Our good friends over at Airshowstuff.com put together a supercut of the best clips and stills from the historic spectacle, it features external and in-cockpit footage of the teams not just executing their flyovers, but also refueling via what was a quartet of KC-10 Extender tankers. Check it out!: A couple of interesting notes: Some of the jets in the Blue Angels’ formation were using tablets during the flight. There appears to be a commercial ADS-B receiver on the dash of the Hornets. The Blues don’t wear oxygen masks during their performances because they can get in the way during very tight formation maneuvers and the demonstration sticks to low altitudes where they are not needed. During the flyovers, unlike the Thunderbirds, they are seen without masks, as usual, but during refueling, they have donned them due to the higher altitudes involved. Let us know what else you can see in the videos. The teams will continue to hit more cities in the eastern and central United States before splitting up and flying over various locales separately, with the Thunderbirds covering much of the western United States and the Blues taking the eastern portion of the country. Note, even the Blue Angels’ mask game is on-brand!: As we mentioned in our original piece regarding the possibility that these flyovers could occur after the Thunderbirds quietly deployed to Pensacola, Florida for unannounced ‘joint training’ with the Blue Angels, the pilots and support crews need constant training, regardless of if the jets wear gray or colorful paint. The money has already been set aside for both teams to perform the show season. At least this way the public and the services get some benefit from that flying. Priority tanker support is used for the teams when flying between locales during the air show season, as well, so tanker support for the flyovers isn’t an added expense. Four KC-10s were used to refuel the teams between flyover locales: There has been talk that the exact paths the jets would fly on may not be published for future flyovers as people tended to crowd together at key viewing spots to see them, which isn’t conducive in an era of social distancing. As such, some have even criticized the flights as potential catalysts for spreading the disease. Regardless, here is a tentative schedule of where the teams are headed, maybe they are coming to your neck of the woods. That schedule will likely expand in the days to come and local airpower is also participating in their own flyover events over their communities. So, get outside and look up!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 24, 2020",Navy Defers Decision On Reinstating Aircraft Carrier Captain Fired Over Ominous Letter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced it will conduct a broader investigation into circumstances regarding a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus among the crew of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt . In doing so, the service has at least delayed implementation of a key recommendation from a preliminary review, that Captain Brett Crozier, the carrier’s former commanding officer, who was sacked over a letter warning about the serious risks the virus posed to his sailors, be given back command of that ship . This all comes at the Navy says that it is beginning to move previously quarantined personnel back onto Theodore Roosevelt as preparations begin to get it back out to sea after weeks of being docked in Guam. Politico was first to report that Acting Secretary of the Navy James McPherson had ordered the new review regarding the Theodore Roosevelt and Captain Crozier on Apr. 29, 2020, which the Navy subsequently confirmed . This decision reportedly came after pressure from U.S. Army General Mark Milley , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had also argued for this additional investigation to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. “After carefully reviewing the preliminary inquiry into the events surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, provided me with his recommendations,” Acting Secretary McPherson said in a statement to USNI News . “Following our discussion, I have unanswered questions that the preliminary inquiry has identified and that can only be answered by a deeper review.” “Therefore, I am directing Adm. Gilday to conduct a follow-on command investigation,” the statement continued. “This investigation will build on the good work of the initial inquiry to provide a more fulsome understanding of the sequence of events, actions, and decisions of the chain of command surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt .” Former Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly fired Crozier earlier this month ostensibly over a breach of protocol over how specific the details were in his letter and his decision to send it over unclassified channels to a large number of recipients, increasing the likelihood it would leak to the press. It has since emerged that those assertions were, at best, misleading and that other members of the Captain’s chain of command may have also downplayed the situation on the Theodore Roosevelt and harangued officers on the carrier, saying their concerns were overblown. Modly resigned more than four weeks ago now after the debacle turned into a political firestorm, inflamed by a bizarre speech he gave on the ship in Guam in which he slammed Crozier, the crew’s very public support for him even after his sacking, and the media. It’s also worth noting that Milley and Esper had both initially publicly supported the decision to relieve the Captain of his command, as had President Donald Trump. Trump had previously threatened to intervene after “hearing good things about both people,” referring to Modly and Crozier. The entire discussion surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak on Theodore Roosevelt remains immensely political. Representative Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat and Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who has been an outspoken supporter of the fired Captain, has already responded to the news, saying a follow-on investigation is “perfectly acceptable.” However, “there was no reason to relieve him of his command,” he added. “I personally think Captain Crozier should be reinstated.” At the time of writing, there have been 940 confirmed cases among the nearly 5,000 sailors assigned to the Theodore Roosevelt . At least six of these individuals had to be hospitalized and one, Aviation Ordnanceman Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr., tragically died. Crozier himself contracted the virus and Modly had to go into self-quarantine after visiting the ship. The cluster of cases on the carrier represents an amazing 70 percent of all confirmed COVID-19 cases within the U.S. Navy and a substantial portion of the total number of confirmed cases across the U.S. military, including civilian employees, contractors, and dependents. Now the Navy has announced that it is working get the Theodore Roosevelt back out to sea. The carrier has been in Guam dealing with the outbreak since Mar. 27 . There is work underway to get the more than 4,000 sailors who have tested negative for COVID-19 back on the ship following an extensive cleaning and decontamination process. “After the ship’s arrival to Guam on March 27, approximately 700 Sailors remained on board to maintain critical ongoing operations and begin the cleaning. Since then, the ship underwent an aggressive, multi-pronged cleaning regimen, which balanced effective decontamination with protecting the ship’s critical systems,” according to the Navy . “Spaces were vacated for seven days – four days longer than the minimum recommended by the Centers for Disease Control – before being thoroughly disinfected. For spaces that were continuously operational, Sailors cleaned the area before leaving it, while the incoming Sailors cleaned it immediately upon arrival.” There continue to be concerns and uncertainties about how long individuals who are asymptomatic or otherwise carrying the virus in a dormant state might remain at risk of developing symptoms or otherwise being contagious. The Navy is now dealing with another outbreak on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd , where the first cases emerged more than a month after its last port visit in Hawaii. So far, 64 sailors on that destroyer, which is now in port in San Diego, have tested positive for COVID-19 and a number have already been medically evacuated ashore. USS Kidd arrives in San Diego on Apr. 28, 2020., USN The Navy kept the crew of the first-in-class USS Nimitz in quarantine for 27 days ahead of that carrier’s recent departure for pre-deployment exercises in an effort to prevent a potential outbreak, a decision that the service said was “ taking advantage of lessons learned .” A member of that ship’s crew had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in April, but was not on the ship at the time and was then placed in quarantine. The U.S. military, as a whole, continues to weather criticism of its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Apr. 27, ten Democratic Senators sent a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper complaining about unclear Department of Defense-wide guidance on how to mitigate and manage the spread of the virus, which they say has caused dangerous confusion at lower echelons of command. The Pentagon has disputed these assertions , but it is not the first time similar accusations have emerged . All told, the new investigation and the deferral of any plans to reinstate Crozier mean the saga of the response to the USS Theodore Roosevelt COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the heated debate over the Pentagon’s response to the pandemic, is unlikely to end anytime soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2018",Air Force Is Down To One Tired Old Jet To Fly Open Skies Surveillance Flights,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Only one of the U.S. Air Force’s two OC-135B surveillance aircraft is available to conduct missions under the Open Skies Treaty , a reality that is set to continue to be the case at least for the next two years. The other jet is now undergoing testing of a new digital camera suite, which replaces earlier wet-film cameras, and the other countries that are party to the agreement, including Russia, will need to re-certify that it is treaty compliant before it can return to service in this role. All of this comes as President Donald Trump’s Administration is eying abandoning the deal , which allows signatories to conduct largely unimpeded surveillance flights over each other’s territory, arguing that the Kremlin is abusing its provisions. On Apr. 28, 2020, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokesperson, confirmed to The War Zone that one of the OC-135Bs has received the Digital Visual Imaging System (DVIS) upgrade and is now in testing. The Air Force’s 55th Wing at Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska still “maintains one Treaty certified wet-film aircraft to conduct Open Skies missions,” she added. The Air Force first awarded Virginia-headquartered KIHOMAC the contract, valued at $36.6 million, to modify both of the OC-135Bs with the DVIS cameras and associated equipment in 2016. The work was supposed to take three years. The estimated completion date for the upgrade program is now February 2021 and the total estimated cost has risen to $43.9 million, according to GovTribe.com . “The committee supports recapitalization of the OC–135 but remains concerned about the Air Force’s ability to stay on schedule and meet the fiscal year 2022 aircraft certification and treaty compliance date,” a 2019 report from the House Armed Services Committee notes. “Unanticipated technical challenges with the DVIS sensors have already affected the schedule and could cause additional delays if not remedied soon.” It’s not clear exactly when KIHOMAC delivered the modified OC-135B to the Air Force for testing. In January, the company did highlight a meeting with personnel from the Air Force’s Legacy Tanker Division at Tinker Air Force Base, which is overseeing the DVIS program, on its social media channels. The post said that the firm had presented a model of the upgraded jet and involved the presentation of a challenge coin with the DVIS program logo. The model’s markings indicate that OC-135B serial number 61-2672 is the aircraft now carrying the DVIS package. The complete modification package includes two types of paired digital high-altitude cameras, one being a panchromatic type and the other being a RGB type , as well as a four-pack of digital low-altitude RGB near-infrared cameras. The DVIS modifications also involve the installation of new digital sensor operator work stations, equipment racks, and camera bay gimbals. USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF The cameras, and their associated equipment, offer improved reliability and ease of use over the aging wet-film cameras and dramatically shortens the time necessary to process the images after a flight. The cameras’ fidelity is still within the limits the Open Skies Treaty imposes, restrictions that are intended to prevent parties from exploiting it to gather more granular intelligence information that is not in keeping with the agreement’s principles. A look at the pre-DVIS workstations on one of the OC-135Bs. , USAF The agreement is intended to enable signatories to conduct largely unfettered flights over the territory of other members to broadly observe military activities. The process by which these flights are scheduled and monitored is heavily regulated. The underlying goal is to promote transparency and reduce the chances of dangerous misunderstandings, such as a military exercise being misinterpreted as a prelude to an invasion. The Treaty entered into force in 2002 and there are now 34 states signed up to it, including the United States and Russia. The Open Skies Treaty has been the subject of growing controversy for years now , with critics in the United States arguing that Russia has been violating its terms, including by restricting the time of flights over its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea and its southern border near a pair of breakaway Georgian regions that Moscow recognizes as independent countries. You can read more about these treaty compliance issues in detail in this past War Zone piece . These issues have led to a number of tit-for-tat responses between Washington and Moscow. Most recently, in September 2019, Russia blocked a U.S. request to overfly the Center 2019 military exercise on the grounds that it could not guarantee the safety of the aircraft over an area of active maneuvers. The U.S. government has disputed that this was the real issue, but the Treaty does say it is a valid reason for declining to allow an overflight. Some members of Congress have also alleged, without providing evidence, that Russia has used the treaty as a cover to conduct unscheduled surveillance missions over U.S. territory and may be using sensors that are not treaty compliant. It is hard to see how this could be possible given the lengthy inspections of the aircraft and the presence of U.S. monitors on board during flights after they arrive in the United States. A graphical representation of the timeline for requesting and conducting overflights under the Open Skies Treaty., USAF In 2018, the Trump Administration went so far as to briefly refuse to certify Russia’s newest Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft. The U.S. did have concerns over the years about the sensors that the Tu-214ON might carry, but the Russians ultimately deployed it with the same digital camera suite that it had already certified on its older Tu-154M-LK-1 aircraft. It remains to be seen whether the Kremlin objects in any way to the installation of DVIS on the OC-135Bs, which gives the United States comparable capabilities to the Russian aircraft. Russia’s Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft., Dmitry Terekhov via Wikimedia The improved capabilities that the DVIS camera suite offers may also be limited by the aging and increasingly unreliable nature of the OC-135B aircraft themselves. “The current aircraft are old, have bad maintenance rates and are prone to breakdown in Russia, putting our crews in bad situations where they are harassed by Russian authorities,” Representative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, a proponent of the Open Skies Treaty, and former commander of the 55th Wing, said in March . So far, this year, the United States has piggy-backed on a number of allied Open Skies flights, likely due in part to the availability of the OC-135B aircraft, including the fact that one is now not treaty compliant due to the upgrade process. The COVID-19 pandemic has also curtailed some Open Skies missions . All of this may be increasingly moot as more reports emerge that the Trump Administration is moving to exit the treaty entirely . Critics of the deal in Congress have repeatedly highlighted the aforementioned Russian violations of the treaty and alleged covert activities to underscore their arguments. They also claim that the Kremlin gets more out of the deal than the United States, which could easily conduct the same kind of surveillance using satellites. The Russian government also notably has much more limited access to space-based imaging capabilities than the United States. Those same critics had also previously sought to block Air Force efforts to acquire newer business jet type aircraft equipped with the DVIS camera package to replace the OC-135Bs. In March, the Pentagon said it was holding off on finally awarding the contract for these replacement jets until it was clear whether U.S. participation in the Open Skies Treaty would continue for the foreseeable future. It is worth noting that, by the Air Force’s own admission the United States conducts more Open Skies flights each year than Russia does. Supporters of the Treaty point out that Russia and the United States are not the only two parties to the deal. The agreement enables many smaller countries, such as Georgia and Ukraine, to conduct their own overflights over Russian territory, offering them surveillance opportunities to monitor potential nefarious Kremlin activity that would almost certainly be unavailable to them otherwise. An official US Air Force briefing slide from 2019 underlining various points about the importance of the Open Skies Treaty., USAF Whatever happens now, the Air Force’s ability to conduct Open Skies missions using its own aircraft has already become more limited with only the one OC-135B equipped with the old wet-film cameras available for these flights now and the first aircraft carrying the new digital cameras is still years away from being certified as treaty compliant.

The plan is borne out of concerns about America’s shipbuilding industry and associated supply chains, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic . It could also involve hiring a second shipyard to help with the production. Breaking Defense was first to report the Navy’s possibly imminent award of the contract for the first 10 frigates on Apr. 28, 2020. Defense News had also reported in February that then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly was looking into accelerating the acquisition and that a contract award could come “ within the next few months .” The service wants to buy at least 20 of these ships, which are to be derivatives of an existing in-production design, and had previously said that it would pick a winner in July 2020 . The FFG(X) contract has long presented a lucrative opportunity, with the Navy expecting to pay around $1.2 billion for the first example. The service has said it hopes that leveraging a design that is based on one already in production together with proven technologies will help drive the average unit price of the first 20 ships down closer to $800 million , in the end. Four contenders are still vying for the FFG(X) contract. Italy’s Fincantieri Marine Group has submitted a design based on its Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. General Dynamics Bath Iron Works teamed up with Spanish shipbuilder Navantia to offer a derivative of the latter shipbuilder’s F100 Álvaro de Bazán class . Austal USA has pitched an expanded version of its Independence class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Lastly, there is Huntington Ingalls, which has categorically declined to offer details about its proposal, which is widely believed to be a variant of the Legend -class National Security Cutter that it developed for the U.S. Coast Guard. An Italian Navy FREMM frigate sails in front of a US Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer., USN Lockheed Martin had presented an enlarged variant of its Freedom class LCS, but dropped out in May 2019 . The firm is still a member of the team of subcontractors behind Fincantieri’s FREMM proposal. The Maryland-headquartered defense giant also remains a key supplier of systems that will go into any winning FFG(X) design, including the COMBATSS-21 combat system, which is a derivative of the Aegis combat system , and the Mk 41 vertical launch system . The Navy’s requirements call for at least a 32-cell Mk 41 array, which are to be primarily loaded with quad-packed Block II RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), for a total of 128 missiles. These cells could accommodate other weapons, in the future, as well. A Navy briefing slide showing the original five contenders for the FFG(X) contract and their associated subcontractor teams. Lockheed Martin has since dropped out of the running as a prime contractor., USN The FFG(X) will also have deck-mounted launchers for RGM-184A Naval Strike Missiles , as well as a 57mm main gun in a turret on the bow and torpedo tubes. The Navy has also said it wants proposals that set aside potential space and power generation capabilities for directed energy weapons, which the service is actively developing now . The Navy wants its frigates to have a three-face fixed array Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), a modular active electronically scanned array type that you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , as its primary sensor. The ships will also have various sonars, visual and infrared sensors, and electronic warfare suites. All told, the FFG(X)s, which The War Zone has previously explored in-depth , are set to be capable multi-purpose ships with robust anti-aircraft, anti-surface, and anti-submarine warfare capabilities for their size. The Navy has billed these ships as an important component of its overall surface fleets for years to come and this has remained the case even as it has gone back and forth internally , as well as with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the White House , over its future force structure. On Apr. 20, Defense News reported that an Office of the Secretary of Defense assessment had notably called for cutting the total number of Navy aircraft carriers from 11 to nine, despite a legal requirement to do everything possible have at least 12 flattops in service, and to essentially freeze the size of its large surface combatant fleets. The latter category includes its Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Ticonderoga class cruisers . The service is presently exploring options for replacing the Ticonderogas and older Arleigh Burkes , including a common hullform design that could fill both roles. The USS John Finn , a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyer, one of the most advanced examples in service now., USN That same study called for adding 15 “small surface combatants,” likely FFG(X)s, on top of the proposed purchase of 20 of these frigates. It also proposed dramatically expanding the Navy’s unmanned surface and undersea vehicle fleets, something the service has been increasingly in favor of doing itself, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . How an accelerated purchase of the first batch 10 FFG(X)s might impact these plans is unknown at this time. “After the first award for ten ships, the Navy will launch a new competition for the next ten, possibly splitting the class and giving other shipbuilders another bite at the apple,” according to Breaking Defense . It’s not clear if the Navy intends to entertain offers for a second batch of entirely different frigates. The service has hired multiple shipyards to build the same classes of surface warships, as well as submarines , in the past. This includes its last class of frigates, the now-retired Oliver Hazard Perry class , which Bath Iron Works and Todd Pacific Shipyards both built in the 1970s and 1980s. However, previously, the Navy has made these multi-yard arrangements from the very beginning, not after buying an initial batch of the ships. It is possible that the service could decide to hire a different company to build entirely different ships, just as it did with LCS program. Of course, the much-derided decision for a split-class buy for LCS was also made at the start of the production of those ships, so the Navy’s FFG(X) plans could reflect a new acquisition model for such purchases. The first-in-class USS Independence , in the foreground, sails alongside the first-in-class USS Freedom ., USN Regardless of how it plays out, this is a move that seems primarily aimed at helping to shore up the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base by offering an opportunity to spread work around to multiple shipyards. Congress has already sought to intercede and add in “buy American” requirements for the FFG(X) program, which the Navy has said could lead to delays and cost increases. The Navy may also just feel that it will need multiple yards to build 20 frigates within its desired timeframe. For years there have been larger concerns about the long-term viability of American shipbuilders and the stability of the entire shipbuilding industrial base . The COVID-19 pandemic has only put additional and more serious strains on supply chains across virtually all industries, including defense concerns, such as shipbuilders , making those issues even more pronounced. The underlying fear is that if a significant number of shipyards were to curtail operations, or close outright, that there might not be the necessary capacity to surge ship production, a decidedly long lead time affair to begin with, during a major conflict or other crisis. However, a competition to hire a different yard to build a ship it has no experience with could lead to cost growth and delays and favor the firm that won the initial contract. Still, the fact that the Navy wants to choose a very mature design, to begin with, could help offset that risk. On the other hand, buying and operating two different types of frigates could also lead to increased costs, though the use of common systems could help mitigate that to some degree. In both cases, competition between companies could also put pressure on them to lower the price of their bids. It will be very interesting to see how the Navy proceeds now with FFG(X), and what winning design it might pick, even if just for the first batch of 10 ships, and how that might impact its overall planning regarding its surface fleets going forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 5, 2019",U.S. Marines Launch Mock Amphibious And Air Assaults On Saudi Islands In The Persian Gulf,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Marine Corps and Navy forces recently conducted mock amphibious and air assaults on a pair of small islands in the Persian Gulf that belong to Saudi Arabia. The exercise came just days after a swarm of small Iranian boats performed dangerously provocative maneuvers around a number of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels during training elsewhere in this same body of water. The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) and the Navy’s Bataan Amphibious Ready Group conducted the exercises on Karan and Kurayn Islands between Apr. 20 and 22, 2020.  For its present deployment, the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group includes the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan , the San Antonio class landing platform dock USS New York , and the Harpers Ferry class dock landing ship USS Oak Hill . It is also receiving support from the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Stout . The general location of both Karan and Kurayn Islands in the Persian Gulf., Google Maps The Bataan Amphibious Ready Group and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit went through many of the preparations that would be required before launching real assaults on an island. Reconnaissance Marines used inflatable rubber boats and the cover of darkness to scout out the beaches and other parts of the islands ahead of the main phase of the exercise. A reconnaissance Marine wearing scuba gear emerges from the water during the recent training exercise in the Persian Gulf., USMC Reconnaissance Marines approach one of the Saudi islands during the exercise., USMC In an actual combat scenario, these teams, referred to as Maritime Raid Forces (MRF), would have helped locate threats, such as mines , and other natural hazards that could hamper the movement of amphibious vehicles or Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC), or outright destroy them, as they moved personnel, vehicles, and equipment to the beachhead. They could also have launched their own small raids to distract or confuse hostile forces ashore. HMMWVs disembark from an LCAC hovercraft on Karan Island., USMC USMC “The control of key maritime terrain requires specially-trained Marines,” Marine Captain Cory Moyer, the company commander of the 26th MEU’s MRF, said in a statement. “The MRF provides the MEU a force that can deliver decisive victories that reduce enemy capabilities, induce confusion, and create a gap to exploit with follow-on combat power.” Marines subsequently conducted an amphibious assault on Karan Island using Assault Amphibious Vehicles and LCACs and an air assault on Karan and Kurayn Islands using MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors and CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters. Marine AV-8B Harrier jump jets, as well as AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and UH-1Y Venom utility helicopters provided simulated close air support. Marines take up positions near an Assault Amphibious Vehicle after arriving on Karan Island., USMC Marines exit an MV-22B after touching down on Karan Island., USMC “I extend my sincere appreciation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for providing this unique and effective training opportunity,” Navy Vice Admiral James Malloy, head of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, said in a statement. “These training evolutions not only contribute to our readiness to respond to crisis, but also demonstrate the Navy-Marine Corps team’s significant contribution in ensuring freedom of navigation, the free flow of commerce, and lawful control of the maritime domain in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.” Malloy didn’t specifically mention Iran, but, in this particular region, his latter comments are unmistakably in reference to the regime in Tehran, which has been responsible for a wide array of provocative acts in the region in the past year or so, including shooting down a Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk drone, seizing commercial ships , enabling a string of attacks on oil tankers, and at least supporting unprecedented cruise missile and suicide drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure, to name just a few . On Apr. 15, five days before the 26th MEU and the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group kicked off their exercise, 11 small Iranian boats had swarmed Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Persian Gulf, coming worryingly close at times, raising the risks of a collision or of American sailors believing they were under attack. Last week, President Donald Trump threatened in a Tweet to have the Navy destroy any Iranian boats involved in any future harassment, a statement that he later walked back. Iranian authorities said they would respond in kind to any such attacks, which could easily escalate in a broader confrontation, in which the Persian Gulf would likely be a major flashpoint . The body of water presented an especially constrained environment and would quickly become a deadly shooting gallery for forces on both sides, raising the question of how likely the Navy and Marines would be to even attempt traditional amphibious and air assaults, during which amphibious ships and forces heading ashore can be particularly vulnerable . Those operations could still be part of a larger over-arching plan. There would certainly be a desire to seize or otherwise neutralize the various Iranian island outposts in the Persian Gulf, which it has used to launch attacks and harassment operations in the past. In January 2016, the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized two Navy Riverine Command Boats (RCB) and detained the 10 sailors on board after they drifted near Farsi Island, which is less than 30 miles northeast of Karan and Kurayn Islands. The U.S. government successfully negotiated the release of the Navy personnel, but not before Iranian authorities broadcast propaganda images and videos of them surrendering and in detention. With all this in mind, it’s hard not to see the exercises on Karan and Kurayn Islands as a signal to Iranian forces. In addition, on Apr. 23, the land-based Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command, or SPMAGTF-CR-CC, which is forward-deployed in Kuwait to the north, also conducted its own exercise, simulating the recovery of personnel, such as a combat search and rescue mission to secure the crew of a downed aircraft, on the two Saudi Islands. This task force could also be called upon to respond to Iranian provocations in the region, including any future seizure of American personnel. Members of Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command carry a simulated casualty during their personnel recovery exercise on Karan Island., USMC SPMAGTF-CR-CC was also notably one of the first units to rush to reinforce the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , Iraq after a mob, including members of Iranian-backed militias in that country, attacked it in January. That incident was part of a period of escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran, which led to the U.S. government’s decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in the Iraqi capital, an act that then prompted unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at American troops. The activity on Karan and Kurayn Islands also comes amid an increase in U.S. military maritime training activities in the Persian Gulf in the past two months , in general. This all is happening as tensions, broadly, between the United States and Iran appear to be steadily climbing yet again. In that context, as concerns grow about threats from the regime in Tehran, it seems almost certain that we will only see more exercises, especially in the Persian Gulf, intended to signal America’s ability and willingness to respond.

Arguably the most stunning military aviation images taken on terra firma these days are being shot by Christopher McGreevy, who goes by the handle Ohwiss on his must-follow Instagram page . They show America’s greatest fighters and trainers blasting through incredibly rugged and beautiful terrain at very low-level. While the Mach Loop in the UK is famous for this kind of aviation photography and the now tragically restricted Star Wars Canyon was once a similar Mecca for aviation photographers , no well-defined vantage points exist today in the United States for capturing this kind of action. McGreevy, an adventurous spirit, didn’t let that stop him. He decided to hunt down new perspectives to quench his military aviation low-level flying thirst and the results of his efforts are absolutely stunning. The images you are about to see below didn’t just fall into Chris’s lap, nor were they taken while sitting in a car outside the airport fence—he puts the work in. They are captured deep in the Sequoia National Forest at a number of undisclosed locations. We asked Chris a bit about his passion for this unique form of photography and how he successfully captures $80M fighter jets ripping through rugged terrain at over 500 miles per hour: “I’ve had an interest in aviation since I can remember. My Grandfather was a B-24 pilot in the Pacific and TWA Captain, so as a kid I spent a lot of time at airports and playing with model airplanes. As a teen, I moved onto building models, flight simulators, and borrowing my parent’s film camera for airport day trips. Somewhere along the way airliners started to lose my interest and low-level military flying became the ultimate shoot for me. Star Wars Canyon was a great place for that, but with the closure, a few others and I were forced to search elsewhere. I love spending time in the backcountry and hiking, so hunting jets out there is a fun addition to those trips. … Gone are the days of driving your car to a paved parking lot at Star Wars Canyon and getting quality shots. Hiking an hour or more in the mountains or desert with 50 pounds of cameras, water, radios, and a map is now the norm. I spent a lot of nights looking at maps, searching for spots that I think a jet could fly, then I try to plan a day to go and see for myself. I always check the weather beforehand and make plans based on that—sunny and calm winds are what I’m looking for. These trips typically involve a lot of hiking and bushwhacking through brush, so the danger of snakes and ticks are always on my mind. I’ve encountered a few rattlers, came home with a tick, and even saw a black bear once. Once I’m at my destination I rely on several scanner radios that I bring, each scanning a few specific frequencies, but my ears are the best tool I’ve got.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A task force of Russian special operators and paratroopers recently conducted an unprecedented high-altitude airborne training exercise in the Arctic, with some personnel jumping from Il-76 Candid transport aircraft flying at close to 33,000 feet. This is is yet another high-profile demonstration of Russia’s steadily growing capabilities in this ever-more strategic region and showed off its ability to quickly send special operations forces there or anywhere else. The three-day exercise took place last week on Alexandra Land, an island in Russia’s Franz Josef Land archipelago, which sits on the Arctic Ocean well above the Arctic Circle. Russian special operations forces, often referred to collectively as s petsnaz , from both the military Special Operations Forces Command and the Federal Security Service’s Special Purpose Center, took part in the event, together with Russian Army paratroopers. The drill itself included troops setting up a base camp once on the ground, conducting reconnaissance patrols using snowmobiles and drones , and launching a raid on a mock camp filled with “saboteurs,” a term Russia often applies to terrorist cells or other small groups of hostile actors, including enemy special operations teams. “Today, for the first time in world history, we conducted a group landing of personnel with special parachute systems in Arctic conditions from a height of 10,000 meters [~32,808 feet] using oxygen equipment followed by combat training missions.” Russian Deputy Defense Minister Lieutenant General Yanus-Bek Yevkurov, who was on hand of the exercise, said. “Nobody has done such a thing before us.” The Russian Ministry of Defense, as well as its official television station, TV Zvezda , have since released video footage of the exercise, including personnel jumping out of the Il-76s, landing on the frigid terrain below, and conducting various types of operations. This includes the aforementioned raid, in which snowmobiles towed sleds full of special operators and paratroopers, gun blazing, toward the saboteur’s camp. In one particular clip, seen in Tweets below, which TV Zvezda broadcast as part of its daily news programming, personnel are seen shooting blanks in what appears to be all directions – one individual is seen firing a pistol straight up in the air – as they get close to the objective. This footage is notably absent from the b-roll that the military television channel, as well as the Ministry of Defense, released separately online. The footage also shows DT-30PM heavy tracked transport vehicles, which are specifically intended for operations in the Arctic and on other rugged terrain. Russia has even acquired specialized surface-to-air missile systems based on these vehicles for its Arctic forces. These are not air-droppable, meaning that they linked up with the special operators and airborne troops once they touched down. A small drone flies in front of a DT-30PM tracked vehicle during the recent exercise on Alexandra Land., via @RALee85 The participants represent some of the most elite elements of the Russian security forces, as well. The Special Operations Forces Command reports directly to the Russian Ministry of Defense and its units, commonly referred to by the acronym SSO, are routinely deployed for foreign interventions, such as in Syria , and other highly sensitive operations. The Federal Security Service , or FSB, was one of the agencies to succeed the Soviet-era KGB intelligence agency, and the units assigned to the Special Purpose Center, or TsSN, are often described as analogous to American so-called “Tier One” units, such as the U.S. Army’s Delta Force or the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team Six . Russia’s airborne forces, or VDV, are among the best trained and equipped elements of the country’s army. A Russian special operator from either the SSO or TsSN during the recent exercise on Alexandra Land., via @RALee85 The entire exercise was clearly meant to demonstrate Russia’s ability to rapidly respond to crises, including the sudden detection of a small group of hostile special operations forces, or intelligence suggesting their precense, somewhere in the Arctic. Since 2014, Russian military forces have also conducted a number of similarly high-profile airborne exercises in the general vicinity of the North Pole as part of the country’s expanding focus on Arctic operations. In that same time frame, the Kremlin has embarked on various programs to expand bases and other military infrastructure in its far north regions and acquire specialized weapon systems and other equipment to support those activities. For years now, global climate change has been causing the polar ice caps to recede and leading to similar drops in seasonal ice coverage, opening the Arctic to both increased activity and competition. Paratroopers on skies, pulling gear in sleds, during the recent exercise on Alexandra Land., via @RALee85 Alexandra Land, where this recent airborne exercise took place, is home to the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , or the Arctic Trefoil, a particularly large and self-sufficient new base Russia unveiled in 2017. After the spetsnaz and airborne troops completed their training missions, they went to that facility ahead of leaving the island. https://youtube.com/watch?v=C58AdoDqk6A Russia has also used special operations raids as the initial phase of major interventions, including the seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. Similar airborne, as well as airmobile, exercises in areas outside of the Arctic have signaled the country’s continued ability to launch these kinds of operations. The heavily documented event on Alexandra Land, where a stereotypical “ right next to the action ” TV Zvezda reporter was there waiting on the ground as some personnel parachuted into the landing zone, also offered an opportunity to tout the skills of some of the country’s most capable forces, in general. A TV Zvezda reporter interviews a member of the Russian security forces right after landing during the exercise in Alexandra Land., TV Zvezda capture When it comes to the recent exercise in the Arctic, Deputy Defense Minister Yevkurov said that this would not be a one-of-a-kind event. “We will conduct a similar exercise annually, in different regions of the Arctic, with different compositions of the participants involved and at different periods of training,” he explained. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Lieutenant General Yanus-Bek Yevkurov, at center, walks with Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov, head of Russia’s airborne forces, or VDV, during the recent exercise in Alexandra Land., via @RALee85 It’s a given that we will only continue to see more Russian military activities, both for operational and training purposes, in the Arctic region. However, it remains to be seen whether the country’s elite troops will conduct more of these unusually high-altitude jumps from altitudes of more than 30,000 feet elsewhere in Russia’s far north.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2021",Navy Officially Releases Controversial UFO Videos,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has formally declassified three now-infamous videos that pilots flying F/A-18 Hornets shot of unidentified flying objects , also referred to as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), on separate occasions in 2004 and 2015. One of these videos had been floating around online for years, but all three became national news in 2017 and 2018 as part of reporting surrounding the Pentagon’s still very enigmatic efforts to study these and other similar incidents, as well as the activities of the private company To The Stars Academy and its founder, former Blink-182 frontman Tom DeLonge . The Pentagon announced the official release of the trio of videos, commonly known by their filenames “FLIR,”  “GO FAST,” and “GIMBAL,” on Apr. 27, 2020. Naval Air Systems Command posted copies of all three online via their Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) document library . The first video, which first appeared online more than a decade ago, shows an object that has become colloquially referred to as the “ Tic Tac .” By every indication, all three videos are identical to the ones that have been circulating widely online for years now . The full Pentagon statement is as follows: “The Department of Defense has authorized the release of three unclassified Navy videos, one taken in November 2004 and the other two in January 2015, which have been circulating in the public domain after unauthorized releases in 2007 and 2017. The U.S. Navy previously acknowledged that these videos circulating in the public domain were indeed Navy videos. After a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena. DOD is releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos. The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as “unidentified.” The released videos can be found at the Naval Air Systems Command FOIA Reading Room: https://www.navair.navy.mil/foia/documents .” The comment about “misconceptions by the public” is a clear reference to a still-developing saga surrounding exactly how the videos first came out to the public and how they found their way into the possession of To The Stars Academy. In September 2019, the Navy confirmed to John Greenewald, a prolific FOIA requester and author who runs TheBlackVault.com , that the videos were authentic, but said that their release had never been authorized. To The Stars Academy claims to this day that the service had already officially declassified the clips. You can read more about this back-and-forth in great depth here and here . With regards to “whether or not there is more to the videos,” specifically, in January, Vice’s Motherboard had also reported that the Navy still had classified video about various UFO incidents. This was based on the response to a FOIA request, which the story said implied that there was additional footage that had not yet made its way out into the public eye. However, it is very possible that the FOIA response was referring to the fact that the three well-known videos were still classified at the time. The Navy has also confirmed in the past that it has given classified briefings to multiple members of Congress on unidentified aerial phenomena. Whether or not this release and the Pentagon’s statement will actually settle any of these debates or put an end to various speculation regarding the videos or the events they depict remains to be seen. Some members of Congress have expressed frustration about the information they’ve received behind closed doors and it has often been difficult for the media to get straight answers on even basic points. The War Zone itself had an especially grueling and ultimately fruitless experience attempting to secure details about the U.S. Air Force’s part in any of these or other UFO incidents in recent years and what that service is doing to monitor and investigate these reports. We only obtained some information in the end by way of one of John Greenewald’s FOIA requests. You can read more about this bizarre situation here . It seems very likely that the Navy’s official release of these videos, so many years after the fact, is likely to prompt renewed debate and more questions about the events they show and other U.S. military encounters with and activities related to unidentified aerial phenomena.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 5, 2020",The Real Story of the USS Ponce as the American Sea Base Sails Into Retirement,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Navy’s most unique ships, the USS Ponce , has returned home to the United States after spending more than five years as a floating base in and around the Arabian Sea. Though she was the subject of intense public interest during that time, thanks to internal histories The War Zone obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, we can tell the story of a ship that went from being infested with bugs and headed to the scrap heap to a hub for conventional and special operations elements in the Middle East that helped set the stage for an all-new classes of ships. On Sept. 27, 2017, Ponce , also known by the nickname “the Proud Lion,” sailed back into Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia after her extended tour of duty in the Middle East attached to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, where she acted as a crisis response command center, ready to assist with a wide array of missions, including mine sweeping , hunting pirates and terrorists, and general maritime security and humanitarian relief. The Navy plans to formally remove her from the rolls next month and beginning breaking her apart by the end of the year. “The U.S. Navy’s ‘Proud Lion’ is America’s proof of concept of innovative warfighting operations and a testament to unmatched professionalism,” U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General Francis Donovan, the commander of the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, told the ship’s combined crew of Navy sailors and civilian merchant mariners after their return. “It’s simply not possible to recount the extraordinary things Ponce has accomplished in her 46 years of service, but it is sufficient to say that the durability, flexibility and clarity of design inherent in Ponce will be missed. This is well-reflected by the fact that Ponce has outlived whole classes of ships that were commissioned when Ponce was already 10 years old.” Donovan’s remarks might sound a little like canned praise, the kind of which could accompany the end of any mission overseas, but it’s hard to overstate the significance of Ponce . In 2012, she was just one of just two Austin -class landing platform docks, an amphibious operations ship displacing more than 16,500 tons with a full crew and load of Marines and their equipment, still in service. In service since 1971, she was already destined for the scrap yard. Instead, in 2011, in something of a surprise decision, the Navy changed course and refitted her for new mission as a dedicated forward base in a part of the world were facilities on land might be vulnerable to attack or otherwise difficult to maintain. The USS Ponce after its refit as a sea base., USN A note on a napkin In December 2011, a number of senior naval officials, including the service’s then top uniformed officer, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, officers gathered at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for the annual Aviation Flag Officers’ Symposium. Also in attendance were Admiral John Harvey, head of U.S. Fleet Forces Command, and Rear Admiral Mark Buzby, in charge of Military Sealift Command. Though the topics of the day were primarily centered on naval aviation issues, Harvey had something else pressing on his mind. Some 10 months earlier, U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis, then head of U.S. Central Command, the top headquarters for American military operations in much of the Middle East and Central Asia, had written an urgent request for some form of afloat forward staging base that could support the myriad ongoing operations along the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Gulf of Aden. So, on the sidelines of the symposium, Harvey slipped Buzby a handwritten note on a napkin asking if it would be possible to save Ponce from retirement and use the ship to meet Mattis’ needs, according to one of three Command Operations Reports for the ship’s official internal histories, which we got through FOIA. “Buzby nodded affirmative from a distance,” the annual review noted. USN via FOIA Mattis would likely have been well aware of the capabilities of such a ship. As a colonel nearly a decade earlier, he had commanded Task Force 58 in southern Afghanistan, the first Marine officer to head a Navy task force. As part of that planning process in 2001, and surely as he ascended the ranks thereafter, he would have learned that the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk had acted as an impromptu staging area for special operations elements, including helicopters from the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), the “ Nightstalkers ,” in the initial stages of the American intervention against Al Qaeda and their Taliban allies. The Navy’s official news story about Ponce ’s arrival at Norfolk says the experience with Kitty Hawk directly led to the decision to reconfigure the amphibious ship specifically for such a role. However, the amphibious ship was smaller, lacked the carrier’s large flight deck and other support facilities, and was configured more as an assault transport than anything else, focused on bringing Marines and their gear to an area and get them ashore. Not to mention, the Austin -class vessel was simply old, in increasing disrepair, and many of its basic systems were obsolete. Oh, and it was filthy. “When the crew arrived, it was estimated by the industrial hygiene team that an 850,000 [member] roach colony had inhabited Ponce,” one of the histories said. “Intense cleaning, persistent pest control and maintenance provided a shipboard environment fitting for the hardworking crew!” This low quality scan still gives a good sense of the condition Ponce was in before her refit., USN via FOIA Already slated for decommissioning, the Navy found it could not allocate funds for a full technology refresh either, and had to rebuild and refurbish computer system and other equipment. Personnel had to scour warehouses and work with the Defense Logistics Agency’s Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office, which deals in excess and surplus gear , to find the parts they needed to get everything working properly. “Fleet Forces Command, Military Sealift Command, Surface Forces Atlantic and Command Strike Force Training Atlantic invested a lot of time and resources in getting the ship upgraded with state-of-the-art equipment,” one of the histories explained. And they did it fast, having the newly refitted ship, reclassified as an Interim Afloat Forward Staging Base, out for sea trials within a month. The new Ponce retained a number of features from its original configuration, including the well deck and portions of her cargo space and accommodations for personnel temporarily embarked on board. Her defenses remained limited to a pair of Phalanx Close In Weapon System turrets with 20mm Vulcan cannons, another two 25mm automatic guns, and a number of .50 caliber machine guns and other small arms. She continued to have her fairly large flight deck at the rear, able to accommodate large helicopters, including the Navy’s MH-53E Sea Dragon mine hunters and the Army’s CH-47 Chinook transports. She had no manned aircraft permanently on board, but carried a compliment of small Scan Eagle drones to provide additional situation awareness over the water or even on land if she got close enough to shore. This was the first time the Navy had deployed Scan Eagle on a ship and in 2013, the unmanned aircraft flew more than 1,500 hours of surveillance missions, a U.S. Fifth Fleet public affairs officer told me in an Email in 2014. The crew of the Ponce launches a Scan Eagle drone., USN But the Navy added in a full suite of repair facilities so the crew could maintain an array of mine sweeping gear, special operations equipment, and even support operations with allied forces. More importantly, Ponce gained eight all-new “mission spaces,” command centers with video conference capability and more than 130 computer work stations. A larger central joint operations center was connected by satellite to six military networks ranging from basic unclassified connections to the top secret Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS. On top of that the ship had the first ever “Internet Café at sea, greatly increasing crew morale and reduced the bandwidth burden on the ship’s network,” the U.S. Fifth Fleet spokesperson also told me that their 2014 Email. A unique crew of 165 civilians from the quasi-miltiary Military Sealift Command and nearly 60 sailors, assigned to the ship as individual augmentees, manned the new sea base, more than 130 personnel less than the original full compliment for an Austin -class. This meant that the vessel had room from another 350 additional personnel to conduct specialized operations when necessary. The USS Ponce, in the foreground, sails with the USS San Antonio , the lead ship of the class that replaced the old Austins ., USN The idea of a floating base Though Kitty Hawk may have provided an example of what Ponce could do in her new guise, the idea of a floating base was hardly new to the Navy in 2011. During World War II, it had become particularly apparent that air power had become essential to the American way of war, but that it would be hard to support aviation operations in some newly liberated areas, especially after amphibious operations far from main allied bases. In 1944, as part of Operation Ivory Soap , the U.S. military converted six Liberty Ships and another 18 auxiliary freighters into a fleet of repair shops to support B-29 bombers and escorting fighters as American forces island hopped their way across the Pacific fighting the Japanese. A mixture of Army Air Forces and Merchant Marine personnel manned the repurposed fleet. There was already a certain knowledge base for these sorts operations from the Navy’s seaplane tenders. The demands of expeditionary operations continued after the war ended. In 1957, the U.S. Navy turned the tank landing ship USS Alameda County into another dedicated aviation support vessel. The next year, she sailed into the Eastern Mediterranean to support Marine aviators taking part in the American intervention in Lebanon. The USS Alameda County in Malta in 1960., USN Larger and more capable amphibious ships, along with the growing importance of the helicopter, began to change the nature of these operations and reduced the need for separate aviation support ships to support fixed wing aircraft ashore during an assault. The USS Austin , which entered service in 1965, and her class of landing platform docks, was part of this transformation. Ponce herself spent much of her history as an amphibious ship supporting expeditionary operations, including participating in the response to the 1983 bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, the evacuation of American civilians and the reinforcement of the American embassy in Liberia in 1990, and the first Gulf War in 1991. Before formally becoming a sea base in 2012, the ship had stood ready for mine sweeping operations in the Persian Gulf during the 2000s on a rotational basis. The idea of the dedicated sea base never went away though. During the Vietnam War, the Navy repurposed flying boat tenders, unpowered barracks barges, and other floating platforms to support both conventional and special operations elements on and above South Vietnam’s winding water ways. The bases of the “ brown water navy ” gave commanders additional flexibility and some additional protection compared to small outposts on land. The barracks ship USS Colleton with a dozen Armored Troop Carrier boats alongside during the Vietnam War., USN During the so-called “ Tanker War ” sideshow to the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s, the U.S. military again established temporary floating facilities to support operations to protect international shipping in the Persian Gulf. Two leased oil support barges , the Hercules and Wimbrown , hosted conventional and special operations elements to attack Iranian fast-attack boats and mine layers, as well as neutralize any floating obstacles. In particular, the platforms provided a landing pad for AH-6, MH-6, and MH-60 helicopters from the 160th SOAR. Conventional Army aviators eventually replaced that unit with then-new “AH-58” Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopters. Cruisers, destroyers, and frigates coordinated additional escort activities with these forward deployed forces. An MH-60 Black Hawk from the 160th SOAR touches down on the modified oil barge Hercules during the Tanker War., USN As already noted, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Kitty Hawk helped provide a base of operations for some of the early special operations elements moving into Afghanistan. Other aircraft carriers had taken up the role as a staging base for joint operations before then, too. When the U.S. military intervened in Haiti in 1994 to upend a military junta that had taken control of the island three years earlier, USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS America turned their deck space over to Army aviators and special operations forces, including members of both the 10th Mountain Division and the the 160th SOAR. Eisenhower alone carried nearly 60 helicopters, a mix of AH-1 Cobra gunships, OH-58 Kiowas, and UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook transports. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrying Army helicopters during the 1994 intervention in Haiti . , USN Ponce goes to the Middle East On July 6, 2012, Ponce arrived in Manama, Bahrain, home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet headquarters, to take up her new post in the region. In line with her main job as a base for possible mine clearing operations , a long-standing U.S. military concern in the Persian Gulf given its past experiences with Iranian naval forces, the crew of the sea base had already begun training with MH-53Es  from Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15 (HM-15) before it even reached the port. That year, and every year through 2016, Ponce was a major player in the annual massive multinational International Mine Countermeasures Exercise (IMCMEX) in the Persian Gulf. More than 4,000 personnel from more than 30 different countries aboard more than 30 ships made the 2016 iteration one of the largest naval drills in the world ever. Ponce became a test bed for various new anti-mine technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles. She also famously became the first ship to feature an operational laser weapon , which was able to attack targets both on the surface and in the air. And though she was never called upon to perform the mission during an actual crisis, mine sweeping became the major public face of Ponce ’s activities in the region. However, her operations were significantly more varied right from the beginning. The internal histories notes, though, that the first thing she did upon entering the Persian Gulf on July 1, 2012, was host aviators from the United Arab Emirates Air Force’s Group 18, the helicopter element attached to that country’s special operations command. The reports don’t say which types of helicopters qualified to land aboard point, but the unit had UH-60M Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook transports, as well as AH-64 Apache gunships, at the time, among other types. In August 2012, a pair of U.S. Army Apaches touched down for deck qualifications and additional over-water training. Over the next five years, these drills would become a routine and important part of regular Army and Army National Guard deployments to Kuwait, which also often featured representatives from regional militaries, including both the Kuwaitis and the Emiratis. The Ponce ’s galley staff provided a signature box lunch for every aviator who touched down on board, a document attached to one official history noted. A list of achievements in a program from Ponce’s change of command ceremony in December 2013., USN via FOIA In December 2013, Ponce hosted Army AH-64s as one part of large joint exercise called Spartan Kopis. In addition to the Apaches, Navy and Coast Guard destroyers and patrol craft, together with embarked Marines and Air Force B-1 bombers, worked together to locate and destroy a variety of mock naval targets . These exercises were especially important given the continuing propensity for the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to harass American military vessels in the region and the potential for a larger crisis. In 2013, Ponce alone had more than 60 interactions with Iranian naval forces and “never pulled the trigger,” according to one historical review. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NholfY8elz0 The possibility of a crisis erupting became particularly apparent in January 2016 when Iran captured 10 sailors and two Riverine Command Boats, touching off a major international incident. Ponce had been involved in the operations of these craft, often acting as a mothership, for more than two years by that point, supporting counter-piracy and basic maritime security efforts, sometimes stopping to rescue civilian fishermen after accidents or mechanical breakdowns. The sea base also “mothered” Avenger -class mine clearing ships, Cyclone -class patrol craft , and various secretive special operations boats . Special operations were a major component of Ponce’s routine activities. Beginning in Sept. 2012, she trained regularly with the standing special operations crisis response element in the region, as well as other elite elements, including Navy SEALs and special boat units. US Navy special warfare personnel tie up a Combat Craft Assault stealth boat inside the well deck of the landing ship dock USS Carter Hall., USN As ISIS terrorists surged into Iraq in 2014, the sea base repositioned into the northern end of the Persian Gulf to join the American response to the growing crisis. We don’t know exactly what the vessel did specifically, but that year she worked with Marine Corps MV-22 Ospreys from the Marine Expeditionary Unit assigned to the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan and the rest of her Amphibious Ready Group. Those tilt-rotor aircraft support a number of special operations activities during their time in the region, including the survey of the situation on top of Mount Sinjar in late 2014. Members of Iraq’s Yazidi religious minority had fled there to escape death, torture, and rape at the hands of ISIS, but found themselves trapped and without food and water. Ultimately, the United States opted to rush in humanitarian relief rather than attempt to evacuate the thousands of people who had gathered on the mountain. Ponce continued to be active throughout the region. In October 2016, the sea base came under direct threat from Iranian-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen, who fired anti-ship missiles at her and the USS Mason , an Arleigh Burke -class destroy that had been acting as an escort. She had moved into the area as part of a larger response to earlier attacks on American and other foreign vessels. An MV-22 Osprey lifts off from the USS Bataan ., USN The future of sea basing Though Ponce now appears truly destined for retirement, she definitely helped set the stage for the service’s operations for the foreseeable future. As Ponce was proving her worth in the Middle East, a new class of sea bases took shape. On June 10, 2017, the USS Lewis B. “Chesty” Puller , left Norfolk to pick up where the “interim” sea base had left off. Classified as an Expeditionary Mobile Base, Puller is a highly modified oil tanker specifically configured to support the same wide variety of missions. Originally part of Military Sealift Command, the ship has become attached to U.S. Fifth Fleet. The War Zone ’s own Tyler Rogoway has written a deep profile of this new ship, which you can find here . USS Lewis B. Puller , USN Suffice to say, sea basing is here to stay, enshrined in the U.S. Navy’s understanding of how it will fight wars and respond to other crises for the foreseeable future.  There is even the possibility that these ships might become capable of rapidly turning into floating fire bases if necessary. Both the Army and the Marine Corps are already interested in the possibility of firing guided artillery rockets from the decks of ships, using the truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Both services are looking at expanding the utility of these systems with new long-range ballistic and anti-ship missiles . A 2016 document describing future concepts for Marine Corps wargaming scenarios suggests that it could also install these systems on unpowered barges and other floating platforms to provide additional fire support. One idea, dubbed “Box O’Rockets,” would involve a containerized launcher for rockets, cruise missiles, and other guided munitions that would fit easily on almost any platform, mobile or otherwise. “If the enemy has a capability to shoot my large ship or my destroyer or my carrier from a couple hundred nautical miles away – or maybe longer – I’ve got to do something about that,” Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller said at the Marine Corps League’s annual Modern Day Marine exposition on Sept. 20, 2017. “That’s why it’s  important that all of these ships have the capability to do some sort of strike or denial – or some way to suppress that capability.” A rendering of the notional “Box O’Rockets” on floating platforms., USMC Special operations forces have also taken notice. Though we haven’t heard anything about it lately, U.S. Special Operations Command has been working to turn the M/V Cragside , a sleek-looking roll-on/roll-off cargo ship, into its own dedicated floating hub. This “Maritime Support Vessel” is slated to become part of Military Sealift Command. Modularity and flexibility have always been at the very core of the basic sea base idea. It’s unlikely we’ve seen everything these types of ships have to offer. There’s a slim possibility Ponce might survive the scrap yard once again. Earlier in September 2017, unconfirmed reports appeared suggesting that Argentina might be interested in acquiring the old ship. Depending on how much the U.S. Navy strips away, the Argentinian Navy could face the prospect of having to invest a significant amount in reactivating the ship though. What we do know is that the “Proud Lion” and its perhaps inauspicious origins as a floating base have played an outsized role in making this concept a signature component of the future U.S. Navy.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 1, 2020","When It Comes To The Demise Of Kim Jong Un, Be Careful What You Wish For","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today we have gotten another round of reports that Kim Jong Un has died. This time they have emanated from a Japanese news magazine, which lends more credibility to the possibility that they are true. The North Korean leader hasn’t been seen in weeks and supposedly had undergone surgery on his heart that may have gone awry. A top Chinese medical team was reported to have been dispatched from Beijing to help the ailing dictator. The reality is that all or none of it could be true. Kim has disappeared before amid reports of his death, just to reappear weeks later. Regardless, there is a lot of sentiment that seems to celebrate his demise. Be careful what you wish for in this regard, here’s why. Kim is a maniacal dictator who treats human life like trash. He oversees a military dictatorship that is the most repressive of any in the world. His regime is involved with a dizzying array of criminal activities focused on raising hard cash to support itself. His people starve while he builds empty resort towns and high-rise business districts. The state kidnaps people and it mass incarcerates entire family lines under the worst of gulag conditions. Kim is a brutal leader who has consolidated power via the business end of anti-aircraft cannons . He also presides over a nuclear arsenal and a massive conventional military force that could lay waste to large portions of South Korea and bombard American interests and its allies in the region with ballistic missiles. If Kim goes, it is far from clear what we will get in his place. Instability at the very highest levels via the death of a god-like ruling family dictator in a country that is already starving and experiencing a global pandemic with little resources to fight it wouldn’t just be troubling, it could be terrifying. Command and control over Kim’s young nuclear arsenal is already murky. If he is incapacitated, the risk goes up substantially. If he is dead, the question over who controls North Korea’s nuclear enterprise rises is a whole other level concern. Kim Jong Un inspects a thermonuclear warhead design in 2017., KCNA It’s not just about who takes Kim’s place if he goes. It’s a question of factions within North Korea’s ruling elite that may diverge in opinion as to who that successor is and what their true level of power and influence may be. The old military guard that surrounds Kim has one business—perpetual conflict with the United States, South Korea, and their allies. It underpins the entire North Korean power structure. It’s what defines it. Peace could be great for the North Korean people, but it would probably mean a power and control bankruptcy for those at the tip of the pyramid that benefit so heavily from an enduring adversary and scapegoat. KCNA Kim got as far as he did with engaging with South Korea and the United States because he had proven himself to be a cunning geopolitical player and had consolidated power with ruthless abandon. Who knows just how far he could have taken it if he wished, although there was never any real indications he would give up anything substantial to achieve any sort of lasting peace. Many of those that surround him and below likely opposed substantive detente with the United States and any meaningful reforms that would result from it. This is especially the case when it comes to turning over any of the nuclear weapons capabilities that elevated the country to a position of negotiation and into the international spotlight in the first place. As such, we are likely to get someone far less predictable than Kim, at least initially, to take his place—one that will have to satisfy many competing interests to preserve their own foothold on power in order to survive—until they, like Kim, can consolidate additional power and prove themselves to be a capable manipulator of foreign interests. That is if we even get a durable successor at all. It is very possible that nothing but a puppet of sorts is installed to continue with the Kim family myth. Even that could prove to be impossible, with factions within the top levels of power in Pyongyang and among the ruling military cadre digging in for a fight for control over North Korea’s future. Yes, I am talking about the possibility of a series of successive coups or even outright civil war. Kim Jong Un rides on a horse alongside his wife, Ri Sol Ju. Being an expert horseman is important part of the Kim dynasty’s cult of personality., KCNA Any of this is highly troubling for a country that has dozens of nuclear weapons and that is in dire need of cash. Kim may never have had an interest in exporting a nuclear warhead or two because it would likely ensure his own demise, but in a power struggle, where lower-level actors with access to these weapons and the materials that make them up find themselves in a free-for-all, it is not outside the realm of possibility. Not only would chaos in the Hermit Kingdom be highly troubling for the United States, South Korea, Japan, other regional players, as well as the free word overall, but it would be especially concerning for China, North Korea’s closest ally and neighbor. The idea of massive numbers of starving North Koreans fleeing across the border into China during a period of chaos in their country is an all too real possibility for Beijing, one that the Communist Party there has no interest in entertaining. That being said, an outright civil war in North Korea would be absolutely unconscionable embarrassment for China, especially when they are already under international fire over their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. North Korea has long been their junkyard dog—a state that exists largely at the will of the Communist Party of China. Seeing it all fall apart and endanger the entire world in the process is hardly a look that an aspiring global superpower wants to wear. Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping., KCNA Still, the reality is that China is the only real backstop in place from the worst of all possible fears coming to pass. The idea is that China would directly intervene to stabilize North Korea if the situation became dire. This could be done by politically and economically backing one faction if a fracture occurs, or supporting the initial successor so that those fractures don’t happen in the first place. How this will be possible under the current international sanction regime in place on North Korea is unclear, but where there is a will there is a way and sanctions could even be relaxed so that a complete power vacuum doesn’t come to pass. Could China use its military might to occupy North Korea? That’s very unlikely, but these are unprecedented times, so anything is possible. Doing so would only work if direct opposition to such a move wasn’t widespread within the North Korean military machine and it would be a highly troubling trade-off between total instability and expanding China’s direct territorial control to the demilitarized zone, something South Korea and the United States would have a very hard time coming to terms with. So, with all this in mind, if Kim dies and a successor is named without a rash of instability and violence, the best we can likely hope for is a ruler that has to satisfy the hardline ruling elite and consolidate power by acting tough and dangerous, like their predecessors. Considering where North Korea is with its nuclear weapons and delivery systems programs, this would be quite troubling. On the other hand, we could enter into an unprecedented era of instability on the Korean Peninsula, where the nuclear weapons themselves could become trophies of sorts that signify who holds the real power—truly a terrifying situation to comprehend. Kim Jong Un with his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who has been a close confidant and personal assistant to the North Korean leader. She is also seen as one of Kim Jong Un’s potential successors. , Pyeongyang Press Corps/Kyodo via AP Such a situation would very well push the U.S. and its allies to act to destroy as much of that arsenal, its delivery systems, and the infrastructure that supports the entire North Korean nuclear enterprise as possible, which would open up a whole other pandora’s box—open war on the Korean Peninsula. So, with all this in mind, don’t be too quick to cheer Kim Jong Un off to the gates of hell. What comes after his demise could be far worse than anything we have previously seen or even imagined.

The video in question, from ARithner Photography , shows the jet making an extremely rapid descent on its approach to landing at the mountain airbase. The pilot pulls up at tree-top level and then soars to a smooth landing amongst the clear jubilation of plane spotters and other onlookers on the ground. That approach and then brick one baby!!! AWESOME . Fantastic video @axalppro pic.twitter.com/1ezt5ojw81 — Combat Learjet (@Combat_learjet) April 24, 2020 It’s a fantastic display of the pilot’s skill and the Rafale’s maneuverability. The scenic location doesn’t hurt, either. The clip is from the Mollis Zigermeet 2019 airshow, which took place in August of last year. A pair of French Rafales took part in this event, performing aerobatic routines above the scenic airport, which is located in a valley at the northeast edge of the Swiss Alps. You can see more video their full routines below. Mollis Airport was previously a Swiss Air Force base and a stereotypical one for a country well known for building hardened military facilities inside mountains. Mollis’ command center and aircraft hangars were built into a nearby mountainside, providing good protection against surprise attacks. Aircraft had to cross a nearby road to get from their shelter to the main runway. A satellite image of Mollis Airport., Google Earth A close up of the north end of the runway at Mollis showing the old taxiway leading to the hardened “aircraft cavern” to the right.

The service’s other remaining fighter jet bases, Payerne and Emmen Air Bases, are both situated in more open areas of the country. Meiringen is also situated near the Axalp-Ebenfluh, which is host to another annual air show in Switzerland, the Fliegerschiessen Axalp . Last year’s Zigermeet notably came around two months after the Swiss ended in-country evaluations of five different fighter jets as part of the Air 2030 program . The Swiss Air Force is looking for a replacement for both its remaining Cold War-era F-5E/F Tiger II combat jets and its F/A-18C/D Hornets, the latter of which it acquired in the 1990s. The Rafale is one of the aircraft in the running for the Air 2030 tender. The competition also includes the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing’s F-18E/F Super Hornet, and the Lockheed Martin F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. Saab has also submitted it Gripen E for consideration, but did not take part in the fly-off last year. In 2014, the Swiss government had announced it would buy Gripen Es as the replacement for its F-5s and F/A-18s, but that plan collapsed after a public referendum against the purchase. The Swiss government is looking to make a final decision on the winner of the Air 2030 competition either later this year or early next year. Depending on the outcome, Rafales may become a more common sight in Switzerland’s skies, though they might not always be making such spectacular displays of their agility.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s top leadership has recommended that Captain Brett Crozier, the former commanding officer of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , be reinstated to that position. Former Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly had relieved Crozier of his command at the beginning of this month after the captain sent an unprecedented letter calling for dramatic action to mitigate a serious outbreak of the COVID-19 on board the carrier and avoid the death of any of his sailors. The entire debacle, which also included Modly making a bizarre speech on the carrier criticizing the crew and the media for their support of Crozier , quickly turned into a political firestorm, which resulted in the Acting Secretary of the Navy resigning . Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday, the service’s top uniformed officer, and the new Acting Navy Secretary, James McPherson, briefed Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on their recommendations earlier today, according to The New York Times . The recommendation to reinstate Crozier was part of a formal investigation into his conduct. Modly had sacked the captain ostensibly for breaching protocol over his letter’s contents and for transmitting it over unclassified channels, which the then-Acting Secretary of the Navy had contended increased the likelihood that the missive would leak to the press and contained overly detailed information about the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s readiness status. A subsequent report from The Washington Post had already shown many of these assertions, especially Modly’s claim that Crozier’s letter had gone directly to 20 to 30 different people, including individuals outside of his chain of command, were at best misleading. However, Esper has now asked for additional time to consider the recommendations, despite Navy officials believing that the results of the investigation into Crozier would be announced formally sometime today, according to The Times . “Mr. Esper’s decision to hold up the investigation has surprised Navy officials, who believed that the defense secretary would leave the process in the hands of the military chain of command,” the paper reported. Esper “is generally inclined to support Navy leadership in their decision,” Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman had said earlier in the day , adding that the Secretary of Defense would go into his meeting with Gilday and McPherson with an “open mind.” Esper publicly supported Modly’s decision to fire Crozier and said he had not even read the captain’s letter hours after it had first leaked in full to the press and had become a national news story back on March 31. For better or worse, the entire situation is now immensely political, with President Donald Trump at one point threatening to get involved directly and saying he had “heard very good things about … both gentlemen,” referring to Crozier and Modly. Former Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly., DOD What happens to Crozier now will not only be a referendum on how the Navy responded to his impassioned letter, but how it is handling the COVID-19 pandemic, in general. The captain had received a rousing sendoff from his crew after his firing and was widely lauded for his concern about the sailors’ wellbeing. At the time of writing, Theodore Roosevelt remains docked in Guam indefinitely with only a skeleton crew on board. The Navy has finished testing all of ship’s nearly 4,000 crewmembers for COVID-19. There have been 856 confirmed cases. Of those, 112 individuals have recovered, but, one, Aviation Ordnanceman Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr., has tragically died . At least six others have been hospitalized . NEW: The number of positive coronavirus cases among USS Theodore Roosevelt crew members has reached 856, the Navy says. Of the total, 112 have recovered. Another 4,098 have tested negative — Dave Brown (@dave_brown24) April 24, 2020 Crozier’s letter warned that there could be more than 50 fatalities if efforts weren’t undertaken to get the bulk of the carrier’s crew into quarantined accommodations ashore. The captain also contracted COVID-19 . Modly went into self-quarantine after his surprise visit to the carrier earlier this month. The outbreak among the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s crew represents a significant portion of the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the U.S. military. The Navy also has a higher overall number of confirmed cases than the U.S. Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps. As of Apr. 23, the service had confirmed that there was at least one person with COVID-19 among the crews assigned to 26 different ships . It’s not clear how many of those individuals were on their ships when they tested positive for the virus and what the risk may be to the rest of the respective crews. Earlier today, the service did also confirm that there had been a new significant outbreak on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd . So far, 18 members of that ship’s crew have tested positive, one of which was medically evacuated. Kidd , which had been conducting counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific, is now heading for as yet to be disclosed port in order to disembark its crew. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd ., USN “The first patient transported is already improving and will self-isolate. We are taking every precaution to ensure we identify, isolate, and prevent any further spread onboard the ship,” Rear Admiral Don Gabrielson, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command and U.S. 4th Fleet, said in a statement. “Our medical team continues coordinating with the ship and our focus is the safety and well-being of every Sailor.” The War Zone had pointed out when news first emerged about the COVID-19 outbreak on the Theodore Roosevelt that it could become a canary in the coal mine-type event for the Navy with regards to how the pandemic might impact its operations. The virus’s spread among the carrier’s crew, and the confirmed cases among the crews assigned to dozens of other ships, all seems to vindicate Crozier and add weight to the concerns he expressed in his now-famous letter. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 5:05pm EST: Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman now says that Esper received a “verbal update” from Navy officials on Crozier’s case, but is now waiting on “a written copy of the completed inquiry,” according to Politico . After getting the full report, “he intends to thoroughly review the report and will meet again with Navy leadership to discuss next steps,” Hoffman added.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2020",Air Force Sends Full B-1B Airframe From Boneyard To Kansas To Create Its “Digital Twin”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is sending the hulk of a B-1B Bone bomber from the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona to the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University in Kansas. Researchers there will 3D scan the entire airframe to create a highly detailed “digital twin” model to help identify areas of the aircraft that suffer high levels of fatigue and otherwise collect data that could help predict future maintenance needs among the B-1Bs still in service. Structural fatigue, in particular, has long plagued the Bones and has become an increasingly more acute issue after years of heavy use in combat, leading now to serious restrictions on how and how much the bombers can fly during both training and actual operations. This is something The War Zone was first to report on in detail earlier this year. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) announced on Apr. 23, 2020, that the remains of the retired B-1B, identified by the serial number 85-0092, were headed to the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) by truck. It took a month to remove the tail and horizontal and vertical stabilizers from the rest of the airframe. Air Force personnel then loaded the 130-foot long fuselage onto a pair trailers in preparation for the 1,000-mile journey from Arizona to Kansas. Separate trailers carried the tail and stabilizers. The U.S. military already routinely works with NIAR to conduct stress testing of various aircraft. Air Force personnel stand on top of one of the wings from B-1B, serial number 85-0092, during the airframe’s disassembly at the boneyard at Davis Monthan Air Force Base ahead of its trip to the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University, USAF “We are taking a real aircraft from the Boneyard, and it will fly again in a digital format,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Lay, the service’s B-1 Program Manager, said in a statement. The service reportedly picked 85-0092 because it had flown a particularly high number of flight hours beyond its planned service life before its retirement nearly in 2002. This particular B-1B, which had carried the nickname “Apocalypse,” last served with the 128th Bomb Squadron at Robins Air Force Base. That squadron, part of the Georgia Air National Guard, gave up all of its bombers in 2002 and subsequently transformed into the 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron flying the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft. A morale patch from when B-1B, serial number 85-0092, served with the 128th Bomb Squadron., USAF Once the B-1B arrives at NIAR, researchers will 3D scan each part, “down to the nuts and bolts,” to create a highly detailed virtual model that they can reassemble and disassemble at will on a computer. This kind of scanning is already in increasing use in aircraft production and maintenance, as well as other commercial manufacturing industries, to help identify faults and for other quality control purposes. “Through the scanning process, we will discover all the places that saw structural failure or damage.  It will create a living medical record for the B-1,” Lieutenant Colonel explained. “Then we will be able to apply data from aircraft in the field to help us predict areas that are more likely to have structural issues,” he continued. “This living virtual model of the B-1’s structure will be superimposed with layers of maintenance data, test/inspection results, and analysis tools, which can be integrated over the aircraft’s life cycle.” The video below shows a demonstration of 3D scanning of an airframe for maintenance purposes. This information will be extremely valuable for ensuring the readiness of the Air Force’s remaining B-1Bs, which are now entering the twilight of their service. These bombers have been a go-to choice for combatant commanders in the Middle East and Afghanistan, especially, since the very beginning of the Global War on Terror, an operational history you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . They have also routinely conducted power-projection-type missions, especially in the Pacific region. One of the Bones just performed a 30-hour-long sortie from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota to Japan and back again this week. These near-constant operations have all taken a toll on the 60 B-1Bs that are still in service, with the highest time airframes having flown more than 12,000 flight hours since they entered service in the 1980s. In August 2019, it emerged that only six of them were mission capable, though the Air Force has since significantly improved the fleet’s readiness rate since then. The service now wants to retire 17 of the bombers in the coming year, while it also looks to expand the capabilities of the remaining aircraft, including adding new hypersonic weapons to their arsenal. The Air Force also says the virtual modeling with help with rapid prototyping of new replacement parts. “We have never had the ability to prototype a repair part,” according to Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Lay. A B-1B bomber after a major overhaul at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma., USAF “With this, we will be able to design a part and fit-test it in the digital world before we manufacture the real thing. The ability to do a virtual fit check could be very beneficial,” he added. “You would even be able to put on some goggles and take a virtual walk through the airplane, see how parts fit together and interact with each other without ever having to leave the office or your telework environment.  We expect to learn a lot about this platform.” Needless to say, the Air Force’s entire experience with the virtual model of 85-0092 could have wider applications across the service when it comes to maintenance procedures and upgrading aircraft. Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, has been a particularly outspoken advocate for the increased use of “digital engineering,” including highly accurate computer modeling and simulation, to reduce acquisition and operating costs across the service. These concepts are core components of Roper’s questionably ambitious plans for the rapid development of future fighter jets . Many of these technologies are already increasingly being used by aircraft manufacturers. Lockheed Martin, through its Skunk Works advanced design bureau, has been a notable pioneer in the use of modeling and simulation. Northrop Grumman is also employing digital engineering technologies in its advanced aircraft projects, including the B-21 Raider stealth bomber program, and 3D scanning in its production lines , as well. All told, almost 20 years after it went to the boneyard, and now a shell of its former self, 85-0092 looks to set to provide a new and valuable service to both its cousins that remain flying and the Air Force as a whole.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 23, 2020",The Mysterious Case Of Customs And Border Protection’s Unmarked S-76 Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Air and Marine Operations division, or AMO, operates one the largest air arms of any U.S. federal government agency outside of the U.S. military, often going back and forth with State Department’s sprawling Air Wing for the top spot on that list. AMO has a diverse array of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, as well as Reaper drones , none of which are particularly difficult to find information about, with the curious exception of a small and mysterious fleet of three Sikorsky S-76B helicopters. AMO, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as a whole, is extremely tight-lipped about the trio of S-76Bs. The Department of Homeland Security, of which CBP is a part, registered all three helicopters, which carry the U.S. civil registration codes N159CM, N269FL, and N844LC, in 2012, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records. They all wear a non-descript black-and-gray paint scheme that is distinct from other AMO aircraft and have no markings beyond their registrations. Sikorsky first introduced the twin-engine S-76 line in the late 1970s and began producing the B variant in the late 1980s. The S-76B evolved from what the company had originally marketed as the S-76 Mk II , which featured more powerful engines along with improved avionics and other upgrades that gave it a true all-weather capability. All of AMO’s S-76Bs were made in 1987, the first year that variant came onto the market. Newer models of the S-76 remain in production today and it has been a very successful product line for Sikorsky with more than 1,000 examples built in total to date. Variants are in service with militaries, law enforcement agencies, and commercial and civilian operators around the world. It is a top choice VIP transport duties, ranging from business executives and celebrities to heads of state even royalty. The Queen’s Helicopter Flight , which serves Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the British Royal Family, notably has a custom S-76C++ variant . Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven others were also flying in an S-76B when it crashed earlier this year , tragically killing all of those on board. A Sikorsky S-76B., Elisabeth Klimesch via Wikimedia AMO’s “Sikorsky S-76 helicopters are a medium-range, tactical apprehension aircraft used by CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) to protect the American public from threats of terrorism and drug smuggling, and to enforce airspace security over critical venues,” CBP’s brief official fact sheet on the helicopters says. “They are medium lift utility helicopters, which can carry multiple personnel and equipment for various law enforcement operations without sacrificing range or speed.” This is similar to how CBP describes the functions of AMO’s Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks and Bell UH-1N Twin Hueys . The “medium-range” descriptor separates all of these helicopters from the rest of its rotary wing fleets , which also include shorter-range Airbus AS350 A-Star , Airbus EC120 , and Bell Huey II helicopters. However, the “tactical apprehension aircraft” description is immediately curious. The S-76Bs notably lack any visible sensor turrets with visual and infrared video cameras or spotlights, which are common features on helicopters tasked with “tactical” law enforcement missions across the United States and elsewhere in the world, including AMO’s own UH-60s and UH-1Ns. One of CBP’s UH-60 Black Hawks with a much more typical law enforcement configuration, including a sensor turret under the nose and spotlight mounted in front of the landing gear strut on the right side of the helicopter., CBP The S-76Bs do have a number of non-standard antennas, typically associated with high-frequency radios and other communications systems, on top of and below their tail booms. In 2017, Rotor and Wing International magazine published an interview with CBP Air Interdiction Agent Will Suggs, which included a picture of him standing next to one of the S-76Bs. That piece noted that “Suggs is also a technical communications officer.” CBP’s own fact sheet for S-76B lists satellite communications capabilities, as well as night-vision capable cockpits, and the ability to seat eight passengers, as the helicopter’s notable features. The extent of CBP’s official fact sheet on its three S-76s., CBP Pictures of all three of the helicopters also show what appears to be tinted cabin windows and at least one picture of N269FL is available showing interior shades inside the main cabin. All of these features are more indicative of what one might expect to see on a helicopter tasked with a VIP transport or another form of specialized support mission. CBP’s public affairs office declined multiple opportunities to offer more specific details on the roles and missions of AMO’s S-76Bs beyond what is in the fact sheet online. “AMO often conducts contingency operations and national taskings, including disaster relief, humanitarian efforts, and high profile security events, therefore there can be a multitude of “secondary missions” outside the scope of border security,” a spokesperson for the agency told The War Zone broadly in response to questions about these particular helicopters. A VIP airlift or otherwise niche mission set would fit with the fact that all of S-76Bs are presently assigned to AMO’s National Capital Region Air Branch, also referred to as the Manassas Air Branch, which is headquartered at Manassas Regional Airport in the Virginia city of the same name. The airport is situated just shy of 30 miles southwest of downtown Washington, D.C. As of 2017, the branch also managed geographically separate detachments in Plattsburgh and New York City in New York state, as well as Houlton, Maine. Two of CBP’s S-76Bs are visible at the bottom in this satellite image of the agency’s facilities at Manassas Regional Airport in 2016. Aurora Flight Sciences, which is also based at the airport, operates out of the hangar above and its high-altitude, long-endurance Orion drone is seen parked out front., Google Earth “The Manassas Air Branch conducts security missions for events designated as National Special Security Events or given Special Event Assessment Ratings,” according to CBP’s website . “It is also responsible for conducting airborne surveillance missions for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.” The U.S. federal government generally routinely designates any major national-level gathering that could present an attractive target for terrorists or other nefarious actors as a National Special Security Event or otherwise gives it a Special Event Assessment Rating . These range from major government gatherings, such as State of the Union addresses, to the conventions the Republican and Democratic Parties hold during presidential election years, to national championship sporting events, such as the Super Bowl. The associated security assessments support subsequent planning for those events, which would include the positioning of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, along with quick reaction teams, to respond to any crisis and potentially secure and extract VIPs from harm’s way. A low-quality picture showing one of the Manassas Air Branch’s AS350 helicopters flying over Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center in 2016, when it was the site of the Democratic National Convention, a designated National Special Security Event, that year., CBP In 2015, the CBP S-76Bs with the registrations N159CM and N844LC were both spotted at Wings Field in Whitpain Township, Pennsylvania, which is situated some 15 miles northwest of Philidelphia, during Pope Francis’ visit to the latter city. The Papal visit certainly meets the definition of an event that would have gotten a Special Event Assessment Rating. There are also indications that the S-76Bs fly general patrols or other routine flights in the airspace over and around Washington, D.C. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , spotted N844LC orbiting for a period in Northern Virginia using online flight tracking software earlier this month. “It would not be irregular to see an AMO aircraft operating in the National Capital Region, likely originating from the Manassas Air Branch, as that is well within Manassas’ area of operations,” CBP’s spokesperson told The War Zone in regards to this specific flight. “AMO cannot provide details on the specific flight mentioned, as our aircrews frequently conduct missions in conjunction with federal, state, local, and tribal partners, and specific details are law enforcement sensitive.” Given the National Capital Region Air Branch’s “airborne surveillance mission,” it is also possible that the S-76Bs have some form of covert surveillance capability, such as carrying devices that mimic cell phone towers that can then, depending on the particular model, geo-locate an individual by way of their phone signal or even collect metadata or audio from calls. These devices are commonly called “ dirtboxes ” or “ stingrays ,” references to manufacturer DRT and a brand of products from L3Harris, respectively, and CBP is known to employ them . At the same time, at least one AS350 helicopter is permanently assigned to the National Capital Region Air Branch and other AMO helicopters with overt aerial surveillance capabilities are known to operate in the greater Washington, D.C. area, as well as the other areas of the country that are within the branch’s broader area of responsibility and that of its separate detachments. It seems most likely that the S-76Bs are primarily used on a day-to-day basis for ferrying VIPs from the CBP, and the Department of Homeland Security, as a whole, as well as important visitors to any federal agencies, around the Washington, D.C. area, while also being able to fly limited surveillance missions in a secondary capacity. The S-76Bs may also have a role in just ferrying VIPs from within CBP, and the Department of Homeland Security, as a whole, as well as important visitors to any federal agencies, around the Washington, D.C. area. These helicopters could also be integrated on some level into the U.S. government’s “ continuity of government ” plans, which include procedures for spiriting senior officials away to austere and hardened command and control facilities , often located deep underground, so they can continue to perform essential tasks during major crises. There are a number of U.S. military helicopter units in and around the nation’s capital, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , which are tasked with these types of missions. Whatever the case, CBP’s three S-76Bs are certainly an intriguing, if oddly murky component of the agency’s aviation capabilities. Their unmarked paint schemes and vague disclosed mission set only add to the mystery surrounding the trio of unique airframes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 22, 2020",We Have New Info And Photos From Yesterday’s Surprise B-1B Mission Across The Pacific (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone , with the help of our friend @Aircraftspots , was first to report on a peculiar B-1B mission that sent the swing-wing bomber over the Bering Sea, past Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, and around Japan yesterday. At the time it wasn’t clear if the bomber would land somewhere in the region or if it was a round-trip, ultra-long-range ‘global power’ sortie. It turns out it was the latter and now U.S. Pacific Air Forces has photos to show for it. @Aircraftspots continued to track the B-1B after our initial report. It circumnavigated much of Japan before getting refueled off the country’s northeastern coast where it was also met by USAF Air Force F-16CJ and Japan Air Self Defense Force F-2 fighters. As you can see, nobody was going to let the moment go to waste: USAF After the training and photo-op, the B-1B made its way all the way back to its home in South Dakota, ending what was an incredibly long and complex sortie that was clearly aimed at reminding America’s foes in the region that the U.S. can project power far from the mainland. This is especially critical now after the continuous bomber presence on the Island of Guam has officially ended after 16 years, another story The War Zone was first to report on . The Air Force says it is now opting for a far less predictable bomber strategy in the region. This flight would be the first example of that new strategy. Even the jet’s callsign, HYPER21, may be a signal to regional adversaries. Substantial news was made just weeks ago when a the head of Global Strike Command stated that the B-1B will likely receive the ability to carry dozens of hypersonic weapons in the not so distant future. As such, the odd callsign would make some sense, although we cannot say that was indeed the case for certain. The B-1B that flew the global power mission back at its home base after a very long sortie that spanned a good portion of the entire globe. , USAF Rest assured this will be the first of many flights like it that will occur in the days, weeks, and months ahead. We will also likely see bombers deploy to various bases in the region for short periods of time before heading back to the United States. Regardless, the Air Force is clearly doing what it can to remind adversaries that while their bomber forces may be gone from the region, they should not be forgotten. We will update this post when more information comes available about this important flight. UPDATE: 5:50PM PST— We have additional photos and full release from Pacific Air Forces. The statement reads, in full: In demonstration of the U.S. Air Force’s dynamic force employment model, a U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bomber flew from the continental United States and integrated with the Koku Jieitai (Japan Air Self Defense Force or JASDF) to conduct bilateral and theater familiarization training near Japan April 22. The B-1, flew a 30-hour round-trip sortie from Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., to the Indo-Pacific and teamed up with six U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons, seven JASDF F-2s and eight JASDF F-15s over Draughon Range near Misawa as part of a joint U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Bomber Task Force (BTF) mission before returning home. “This operation showcases our unwavering commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region through the employment of strategic forces from around the globe,” said Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., Pacific Air Forces and INDOPACOM Air Component commander. “From confronting invisible threats of a global pandemic to addressing military aggression and coercive activities, we remain a lethal, innovative and interoperable force focused on a shared vision of upholding a free and open lndo-Pacific.” In line with the National Defense Strategy’s objectives of strategic predictability and operational unpredictability, the U.S. Air Force transitioned its force employment model to enable strategic bombers to operate forward in the Indo-Pacific region from a broader array of overseas and CONUS locations with greater operational resilience. “Like the advancements of our Agile Combat Employment concept of operations, we continue to innovate and adapt our approach, to include how we deploy and employ the various weapons systems we integrate with our allies and partners,” Brown said. “Bringing the B-1 into theater ensures our bilateral interoperability accounts for any combination of flying operations to prepare for and outpace the rapidly growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region.” This marks the second CONUS-based bomber bilateral training to occur this year with the JASDF. On Feb. 3, two B-52s integrated with six USAF F-16s and more than 45 JASDF fighter aircraft in the vicinity of Misawa Air Base, Japan. Those bombers flew from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and Minot Air Force Base, N.D. “The rapid employment of airpower directly supports the National Defense Strategy and assures we can provide overwhelming force anywhere, anytime in support of American interests or our Allies and partners,” said Gen. Tim Ray, Air Force Global Strike Command and Air Forces-Strategic commander. “This mission is a demonstration to our friends throughout the region: we will continue to remain fully predictable in our commitment to ensuring peace, while also demonstrating that we have the ability to operate from numerous locations across the globe, even during the global pandemic.” The B-1 is assigned to the 28th Bomb Wing and the F-16s are assigned to the 35th Fighter Wing from Misawa Air Base, Japan. The last time the B-1 was in the INDOPACOM area of responsibility was January 2018, when the airframe and crews completed a six-month Continuous Bomber Presence mission at Andersen. During that time, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron from Dyess Force Base, Texas, conducted a number of sequenced bilateral missions with the Republic of Korea Air Force and the JASDF. USSTRATCOM has conducted BTF missions (previously known as Bomber Assurance and Deterrence missions) since 2014 as a demonstration of the U.S. commitment to collective security, and to integrate with Geographic Combatant Command operations. The first mission included B-52H Stratofortresses and B-2 Spirits traveling from the continental United States to Joint Base Pearl-Harbor Hickam in April 2014.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Trump Orders Navy to Destroy Iranian Boats That Harass Its Ships (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump says he has ordered the U.S. Navy to destroy any armed Iranian boats that harass American ships. This comes a week after 11 boats from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy swarmed U.S. military vessels in international waters in the Persian Gulf, getting dangerously close at times.Â It also follows Iran’s announcement that it had successfully placed its first military satellite into orbit after launching it using a Qassed space launch rocket. The United States and others accuse Iran of using its nascent space program as a cover for research and development into long-range ballistic missiles. Trump announced his new instructions to the Navy via Tweet on Apr. 22, 2020. He offered no specifics on the exact new rules of engagement for American warships with regards to Iranian boats. It’s not clear whether destroying foreign vessels in the absence of a physical attack or a formal declaration of hostilities would necessarily be legal under international law.Â “I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump’s Tweet read. I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2020 Last week, the Navy did highlight how Iran’s maritime harassment could be seen as threatening and raises the risks of miscalculations, as well as collisions. For its part, Iran later claimed it was conducting its own exercises and blamed â€œthe unprofessional and provocative actions of the United States and their indifference to warnings” for the incident, but offered no evidence to support its claims. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) also subsequently released its own footage of another separate encounter with an American ship in the Persian Gulf.

In December 2019, a large group of IRGC boats sailed very close to the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships from her strike group as they passed through the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz. The Navy later told The War Zone that that incident was “within normal behavior patterns for Iran.” Still, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ fleets of small watercraft do present a real threat, especially when deployed in swarms and if they are used in conjunction with barrages of anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles , submarine attacks , naval mining , and unmanned suicide drones and boats . The U.S. ships involved in the incident last week, which included the expeditionary sea base USS Lewis B. Puller , had been training with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters , which would be ideal for countering small boat swarms. In March, the Navy conducted an exercise with a U.S. Air Force AC-130W gunship that was also focused on small boat threats. It’s not entirely clear what prompted the President to declare this newly aggressive stance now, days after the most recent incident. However, the topic of Iranian naval harassment did come up on Fox News ‘ “Fox & Friends” hours before, as an aside to Iran’s space launch. Trump has said in the past that he is an avid watcher of this television program. It's been a week since the Iranians approached the U.S. ships, but Fox & Friends referred to the incident two hours ago when discussing a separate development involving Iran pic.twitter.com/RzvfZ8FJRb — Dave Brown (@dave_brown24) April 22, 2020 The satellite launch itself , which took place in the Dasht-e Kavir desert rather than at the Imam Khomeini Space Center , is almost certain to draw the ire of the U.S. government. Officials in Washington say that the regime in Tehran uses its space program to skirt international sanctions and other prohibitions on its ballistic missile programs and could help in the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which Iranian authorities deny. Iran described the satellite, called Nour, as a “ multi-purpose ” system, but its exact roles and capabilities are unclear. In addition to being Iran’s first successful deployment of a satellite for military purposes in space, the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it was responsible, which would be its first-ever space launch mission.

In August 2019, Trump notably Tweeted out a U.S. satellite intelligence picture of the remains of a Safir space launch vehicle after it blew up on the launch pad during another satellite launch attempt at the Imam Khomeini Space Center. Trump’s threat coupled with the space launch is almost certain to increase already heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Iran has been especially hard hit by the spread of the virus, raising concerns among experts and observers that the regime in Tehran might lash out to distract from growing domestic criticism of its response to the pandemic.Â The U.S. Navy, or any other American military service, sinking Iranian boats for any reason would almost certainly draw some sort of response, regardless. The U.S. decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, Iraq, in January, the penultimate event in the most serious spike in U.S.-Iran tensions recently, prompted Iran to retaliate with unprecedented ballistic missile strikes aimed at American troops . All told, the risk of conflict, or at least an active skirmish, between the United States and Iran, which was already relatively high, seems to be growing once again. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 11:30am EST: Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist has said that Trump’s Tweet reflects U.S. military’s inherent right to self-defense, rather than a new directive. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General John Hyten also noted that American forces would respond with “overwhelming force” to any hostile action. “I like that the President warned an adversary,” he added. “If you wanna go down that path, we will come and we will come large.” Senior DOD officials explain Trump's tweets on Iran today, saying it is not any new order to change U.S. military policy, just POTUS re-emphasizing ""inherent right to self-defense…"" — Tony Bertuca (@TonyBertuca) April 22, 2020 All U.S. Navy ships retain inherent right of self defense, Deputy Sec. of Defense says in response to POTUS' tweet.

If you wanna go down that path, we will come and we will come large."" – Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs today, re: Iran — Mackenzie Eaglen (@MEaglen) April 22, 2020 At the same time, Hyten said “you can’t let a fast boat get into a position where they can threaten your ship” and indicated that forces in the Middle East could use Trump’s Tweet as the basis for their rules of engagement going forward. The general also declined to say whether Navy captains should engage Iranian boats, in general, as the President has suggested.

At the time of writing, the U.S. military says that there have been 5,734 confirmed cases among its uniformed service members, civilians, contractors, and dependents.

UPDATE: 7:40pm EST: In response to questions about his Tweet, President Donald Trump has now said that he has not directed any changes to the existing rules of engagement for U.S. Navy ships operating in the Middle East. “We’re covered 100 percent” already, he added.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 23, 2020",The Blue Angels And Thunderbirds Jet Teams Are Secretly Planning Something Big (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With air show dates canceled for months to come, the U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels and United Stated Air Force’s Thunderbirds flight demonstration teams have continued training, and in the case of the latter, they have used some of their flight time to thank their hometown healthcare workers and other essential personnel, as well as those in Colorado, in a way that only they can. Now, in something that seems more and more like a ‘cloak and dagger operation,’ the Thunderbirds have deployed to the Blue Angel’s home base at NAS Pensacola in Florida for a rare cooperative training event. But there may be more to the story. By multiple accounts, something big is in the works—as in something so big that it could span the entire United States. Our friends over at the always remarkable Airshowstuff.com have laid out the clues and rumors that point to the two jet teams preparing to go on a national tour of sorts to salute all of America’s frontline healthcare workers that are fighting the war against COVID-19 and the essential workers who are keeping the country running in these bizarre and troubling times. We are essentially talking about a goodwill tour of a mammoth and unprecedented scale. Airshowstuff.com stated the following in a recent post: On Sunday, an extensive list of cities across the country was posted to social media with claims that it was a schedule for a number of flyovers to be conducted between April 23rd and May 2nd. The supposed plan would see the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels join forces for a mass flyover of East Coast cities like New York City and Washington, DC before splitting up to cover different sections of the country. The Thunderbirds would take the Western US while the Blue Angels cover the Midwest. They would again meet in Texas for a day of joint flyovers to close the program. This all seemed pretty far-fetched. A nation-wide campaign like this would take immense planning and resources, and would certainly require some travel in a time when travel is to be minimized. However, evidence is growing that the list of flyovers may in fact be a real plan. On Monday afternoon aviation spotters heard Thunderbird 1 check in with the air traffic control tower at NAS Pensacola with 8 other aircraft in his formation. Other spotters posted videos of the jets landing at the base . A local photographer, Laura Bogan, snapped pictures of all 9 jets flying over the area before landing. … For now, the teams are not confirming anything publicly and have made no comments on why the Thunderbirds have dropped in to Pensacola. We reached out to the teams for comment Sunday evening. As of Monday afternoon, we have not received a response. It is likely that they are remaining quiet while final details are worked out, and it is also possible that they will keep plans under wraps until the last minute to discourage any long-distance travel. The original post was deleted shortly after appearing and no further details have leaked. It is evident that something big is brewing; the teams spending any time together is a fairly rare and special event and they already spent time together earlier this year . This does not have the feeling of a normal “joint training” session. Make sure to read the entire post with more clues over at Airshowstuff.com View this post on Instagram A post shared by AirshowStuff (@airshowstuff) Both of the iconic teams are considered by many as national treasures and a showcase of American excellence and the best and brightest our military has to offer. Their purpose is often referenced as being primarily for recruitment, but really, these teams do much more than that. The Blue Angels’ mission statement says it all: The mission of the Blue Angels is to showcase the teamwork and professionalism of the United States Navy and Marine Corps through flight demonstrations and community outreach while inspiring a culture of excellence and service to country. With this in mind, there really isn’t a better or more visible ambassador to lift the American people’s spirits and to salute those who are serving the country—from doctors and nurses to grocery store clerks to EMTs to truckers—in their own unique way during this pandemic. Some will decry the cost of such an endeavor. While the funding for these teams is always a simmering debate, the fact is that they are all accomplished fighter pilots and support personnel who need to constantly train. Whether they are in or working on gray or colorfully painted jets doesn’t change that. So, why not at least use that flight time to spread a positive message and give people a little joy in what has been bleak and uncertain period? Who knows, maybe this is just some impromptu training event, but considering this ‘flying salute’ concept has already been tested by the Thunderbirds, I highly doubt there isn’t more to this story. We will keep you updated as more details about this “training event” emerge. UPDATE: 12:50AM PST— The 57th Wing Commander, who oversees the Thunderbirds, posted the following on his Instagram account. It is pretty much confirmation that something is indeed afoot: UPDATE: 1:52PM PST— Here is the original draft to ATC about the flyover.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 154th Wing based at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam put on one heck of a display of organic airpower on April 21st, 2020. Eight F-22A Raptors from the 199th Fighter Squadron , a C-17A from the 204th Airlift Squadron, and a KC-135R from the 203rd Air Refueling Squadron, all resident units, executed a stunning ‘elephant walk’ on one of the runways at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL). Aviation photographer and Instagrammer Chris Amendola was there to capture the unique event. Chris Amendola Chris filled us in on how he snapped the killer images of Hawaiian airpower at the state’s largest and busiest airport: So I’m a civilian worker at the airport, I work for Ramp Control and have total access to the airfield. I love planes and love taking pics and videos of them. I was out waiting to take some pics and talked to Hickam Airfield Management prior to the planes’ arrival, joking about getting some pics from the stairs they were using on the RWY. Well, he called ‘no joy’ on that, which was fine, but when he saw me standing on the back of my pickup truck trying to get shots he called me over and said run up and get a few pics as long as I don’t get in the way. I’m very used to taking pics on the fly and under pressure, so I ran up snapped off a few pics and here we are! Fantastic shots indeed, and there’s video too! The sprawling air base at Joint Base Peral Harbor-Hickam, which shares the runways with the international airport, is becoming increasingly critical to America’s strategic posture in the ever-more important Pacific Theater. It is far enough away from America’s potential foes and foes alike that it would be an essential staging ground in any crisis. B-2 Spirits have deployed there recently instead of their usual forward staging base on the island of Guam . Now that the continuous bomber presence on that island has officially ended , Hickam will likely see much more sporadic bomber action. The combination of F-22s, C-17s, and KC-135s gives the Hawaii Air National Guard amazing organic power projection capabilities of its own, as well as being able to support normal peacetime logistical operations and the air sovereignty mission, the latter of which is focused on protecting the island itself. It is truly a unique and highly capable unit within the Air Force’s portfolio.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 23, 2020",A B-1B Bomber Just Flew Near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula After Crossing The Bering Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what appears to be something of a rare move, at least in recent times, a U.S. Air Force B-1B Bomber flew over the frigid Bering Sea off mainland Alaska, toward Russian airspace. Although these types of operations do occur in Europe from time to time, such a move over the Pacific is far less common, especially with a bomber flight emanating from the continental United States. Russia, on the other hand, regularly flies its long-range military aviation assets, including bombers , into the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) off Alaska, resulting in the launch of E-3 AWACS, KC-135 tankers, and an intercept by F-22 Raptors, in most cases. The flight comes just days after the Air Force ended its Continuous Bomber Presence Mission at Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam after 16 years. The move, which The War Zone was first to report on , represents a significant strategic shift in a region that the Pentagon sees as being among the most volatile in the years to come. The flying force now says they will focus on less predictable bomber deployments to a multitude of locations throughout the Pacific Theater. With this in mind, this could be the first one of those missions in the post-Continuous Bomber Presence era. The movements were first spotted by our good friend and aircraft tracker extraordinaire @Aircraftspots , who followed the B-1B as it crossed the Bering Sea and headed towards the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is unclear where the bomber may end up, but Japan is one possibility, among others. Originally, the flight included two B-1Bs under the “HYPER” callsign, but one of the jets turned back while still near Alaska.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2020",Russia Has Abandoned Its Massive Nuclear Destroyer And Supersized Frigate Programs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Severnoye Design Bureau has stopped development entirely of its Project 23560 destroyers , also known as the Lider class, and the Project 22350M frigate, an expanded derivative of the Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class. The company has said these ships are among its most promising future offerings and the halting of the two programs has raised questions about its long-term financial stability. Russian newspaper Interfax reported the new developments at Severnoye, which is part of the country’s state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation, on Apr. 18. The information was reportedly contained in an annual review of the shipbuilder’s activities in 2019, which the outlet had obtained. The Project 23560 project first emerged publicly in 2015, but had reportedly been in development for two years already by then. The Krylov State Scientific Center had been responsible for the actual design, which Severnoye would then build. The Lider destroyer, also referred to at times as the Shkval , was clearly an extremely ambitious project, perhaps overly so, from the very beginning. Though originally intended to be a conventionally powered warship, plans subsequently shifted to a nuclear-powered design. Its expected displacement also grew from already massive 12,000 to 13,000 tons to 19,000 tons , stretching its classification as a “destroyer.” A model of the Project 23560 Lider class destroyer design., Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia For comparison, the U.S. Navy’s Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers will have a displacement of around 9,800 tons, equal to that of its Ticonderoga class cruisers . That service’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers are closer to 16,000 tons. At a displacement of 19,000 tons, size-wise, the Liders would be around halfway between more traditional destroyers and the Soviet-era nuclear-powered Kirov -class battlecruisers , which have a displacement of 28,000 tons with a full combat load. The Project 23560 design featured an especially heavy armament, including a vertical launch system array with 64 3S14 universal cells capable of firing various weapons, including Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles and Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles. The still-in-development hypersonic 3M22 Zircon cruise missile is also reportedly being designed to work with the 3S14 cell dimensions. The ships would also have a 56-cell navalized variant of the S-500 surface-to-air missile system, as well as separate launchers for the medium-range Redut surface-to-air missile and navalized Pantsir-M point-defense systems. As of 2019, the estimated cost of each Project 23560 destroyer was 100 billion rubles , or around $1.5 billion at the time, which is cheaper than what the U.S. Navy spent on its much smaller, conventionally-powered late-model Flight II Arleigh Burkes . This seems exceptionally low for a ship of this size and complexity and would seem to conflict with the fact that high costs had contributed to the Russian government’s previous decision to put the project on hold back in 2017. There were continued reports that the Kremlin still planned to begin building the first of these ships in 2022 or 2023, but Severnoye’s 2019 report makes it clear that all work on the project has now stopped. It’s unclear how serious Russia ever was about pursuing the Lider destroyer and it may turn out that Severnoye’s reported halt on work on the Project 22350M frigate may actually have greater impacts on the future of the Russian Navy, as well as that of the shipyard. The shipbuilder only reportedly finished work on the ship’s design in March 2019 . The Project 22350M design is a major upgrade of the existing Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class featuring a larger hull with 48 vertical launch system cells and a displacement of around 7,000 tons. The first-in-class Admiral Gorshkov , which is in service now and is arguably the Russian Navy’s most modern warship, displaces 5,400 tons and has 16 vertical launch system cells. These are all capable of firing Kalibr and Oniks cruise missiles, and are expected to eventually be able to accommodate Zircon in the future. Another Project 22350 frigate, the Admiral Kasatonov , is presently undergoing sea trials and the Kremlin plans to acquire six more, for a total of eight. At least two of these ships, the future Admiral Amelko and Admiral Chichagov , which Severnoye laid down last year, are expected to be in a subclass of ships with 24 vertical launch system cells. This is still half that of what the shipbuilder had proposed for the much larger Project 22350M design. The Project 22350M had been billed as a potential replacement for aging Soviet-era Project 956 Sarych and Project 1155 Fregat class destroyers, also known as the Sovremenny and Udaloy classes , respectively. Both of those classes notably lack vertical launch system arrays with universal cells capable of firing Russia’s more modern naval missiles. The Udaloy class destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov ., Brian Burnell/wikicommons Of course, it is possible that the Kremlin could again revisit either the Project 23560 design, as well as the Project 22350M, in the future, but it could take substantial resources for Severnoye to restart those projects. Military shipbuilding, in general, is an inherently long-term process requiring the cultivating of a skilled labor force familiar with the design and the establishment of supply chains to provide large amounts of raw materials and critical components. Russian President Vladimir Putin looks at a model of a Project 22350 Admiral Gorshkov class frigate during the keel-laying ceremony for the future Admiral Amelko and Admiral Chichagov in 2019., Alexei Druzhinin / Sputnik via AP The Severnoye Design Bureau also relies heavily on Russian government orders to sustain its military shipbuilding enterprise, as a whole, and the elimination of potential orders for Project 23560 and Project 22350M warships, at least in the near future, could have serious ramifications. The decision to fully halt work on both of these programs “do[es] not allow counting on the stable financial and economic situation” of the company, its 2019 review said, according to Interfax . It also can only call into question the full extent of Russia’s plan to modernize its surface fleets. Its lone aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov , has also been out of commission indefinitely after a major accident in 2018 in which the floating dry dock it was in sank. In December 2019, the carrier caught fire , making it more questionable when, or even if, it will return to service. A massive overhaul of the Admiral Nakhimov , one of the Russian Navy’s two remaining Kirov class battlecruisers, has been perpetually delayed . That, in turn, has pushed back plans to upgrade its sister ship Pyotr Velikiy . The decisions to end the Project 23560 and Project 22350M programs were also made before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic , which is having massive impacts on the global economy. This includes a significant drop in the worldwide price of oil, a major source of income for the Russian government, which has slipped further just in the last 24 hours on the heels of the complete collapse of a U.S. oil futures contract. Russia’s defense budgets have seen significant contractions in recent years already and there have long been questions about whether it has the funds to support its more advanced weapons development programs. The economic situation has repeatedly forced the country to cut programs shift funds around to support higher-priority programs, especially a host of new strategic weapon systems, as well. This includes new hypersonic missiles and still-in-development nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missiles and long-range torpedoes . It remains to be seen whether the Project 23560 and Project 22350M designs are gone for good, but by Severnoye’s own reported assessment of the situation, the future of either of those projects, is not bright. Of course, there remains a possibility that the Russian government could still try to raise these programs from the dead.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2019",Two Air Force F-35s Make Rapid Deployment To Jordan To Get Closer To Syria Action,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force sent two F-35A Joint Strike Fighters to an “undisclosed location” in the Middle East earlier this year, which appears to be Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan, demonstrating its ability to rapidly shift assets within the region to respond to emerging contingencies. Just days ago the U.S. military also publicized the flight of an F-35A over an isolated and strategic outpost in southern Syria, which has repeatedly come under attack from Iranian-backed militias and Russian forces in the past. The two F-35s from 34th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron began flying sorties from their temporary deployment location on Feb. 16, but the Air Force’s 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing’s public affairs office only posted images of Joint Strike Fighter flight operations from the “undisclosed location” on the official Defense Visual Information Distribution Service website on Apr 20. The 332nd is based at Ahmad Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait, but also oversees the 407th Air Expeditionary Group, which manages operations at Muwaffaq Salti. Elements of the 34th arrived at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, home of the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing, in November 2019, marking the start of the second F-35A deployment to the Middle East that year. “The 34th EFS [Expeditionary Fighter Squadron] is demonstrating the Rapid Unit Dynamic Employment, a concept for the 5th generation Lightning II enterprise, by forward deploying a small team of aircraft, maintainers, and pilots,” a caption for one of the pictures reads. One of the F-35As at the “undisclosed location” in the Middle East on Feb. 16., USAF USAF A pilot gets ready for one of the first F-35A sorties as part of the Rapid Unit Dynamic Employment mission on Feb. 16., USAF USAF This is not the first time that Air Force F-35As have gone to Muwaffaq Salti . In August 2019, elements of the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron flew there from Al Dhafra as part of Exercise Agile Lightning , which “demonstrated the adaptive basing methodology where personnel and aircraft can operate in austere environments to complete essential missions vital to the defense of U.S. assets and personnel,” according to the Air Force . Last year, Air Force plans to dramatically increase the available facilities at Muwaffaq Salti to support both longer and shorter-duration deployments also emerged, which The War Zone was first to report on. More broadly, the Air Force has been experimenting with a number of rapid deployment concepts in recent years as it works to expand its ability to quickly deploy various types of aircraft, manned and unmanned , especially stealth aircraft that typically require more robust infrastructure and logistics chains, to austere locations during expeditionary and distributed operations. Concerns about the vulnerability of existing fixed bases have been a major driving force behind these efforts and are pushing the service to explore ideas for how it might establish all new airfields right in the midst a major conflict. More photos of the F-35As from the 34th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron at the “undisclosed location” on Apr. 16., USAF USAF USAF USAF The service’s F-22 community had already pioneered this with the Rapid Raptor concept of operations, which has continued to evolve since it first appeared in 2014. At its core, Rapid Raptor, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , allows the service to quickly send four F-22s and necessary supporting personnel and equipment anywhere in the world and get them flying combat sorties all within 72 hours. In 2018, the Air Force performed a Rapid Raptor-like deployment to Muwaffaq Salti, as well. A KC-10A Extender aerial refueling tanker, also demonstrating its ability to serve as a cargo aircraft, helped the F-22s and their supporting elements deploy from Al Dhafra to the base in Jordan. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hl6_8UsLW8U When F-35As from the 34th expeditionary Fighter Squadron first arrived at Al Dhafra in April 2019, they took the place of F-22s that had regularly deployed to that base since 2009. As the U.S. expanded its activities against ISIS in Syria in the late 2010s, Raptors were among the aircraft most commonly employed to conduct patrols over that country. The F-22s had also regularly served as quarterbacks for broader U.S. and coalition air operations in Syria, a role that the F-35As, with their impressive sensor fusion and data sharing capabilities, now provide. Air Force F-35As have been conducting a variety of combat operations, including airstrikes, against ISIS in Syria, as well as Iraq , for months now. However, the rapid deployment to Jordan is likely linked, at least in part, to the continued U.S. presence at a garrison near the city of At Tanf, which lies along a major highway in the region and is situated fewer than 15 miles from both the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. U.S.-backed Syrian forces and American troops, primarily special operations forces, occupy this highly strategic location. On Apr. 10, a Joint Strike Fighter made a pass by the At Tanf garrison. Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the top special operations component of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, publicized the sortie. It was a clear signal to potential opponents about the U.S. military’s willingness and capability to defend the base. It also offered a rare look at an F-35 on an actual operational mission. At Tanf, which the U.S. government has directly linked to challenging the ability of Iranian forces and Iran’s regional proxies to move unfettered overland between Iran and Syria, as well as Lebanon, by way of Iraq, has certainly come under threat before. In 2017, American airpower countered a number of attempted attacks by Iranian-backed militias aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and armed with heavy armor and artillery. They also shot down multiple Iranian drones in the vicinity of the garrison. Russia also conducted multiple strikes on the base on June 16, 2016, but there were no U.S. troops there at the time. U.S. combat jets responded to the initial strike, but the Russians returned after those aircraft left to refuel. The incident prompted the United States to reinforce the garrison. In 2018, the Kremlin again threatened to attack the base. The Air Force’s ability to send F-35As to Muwaffaq Salti, where it also has F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets deployed and which is significantly closer to At Tanf than Al Dhafra, further demonstrates its ability to rapidly move reinforcements to the area to help protect the garrison, as well as conduct other contingency operations in the region . The overflights of At Tanf are also likely a valuable morale boost for the personnel manning the secluded outpost, the future of which is uncertain as the U.S. military sputter-starts its way through often-changing plans about drawing down its overall presence in Syria. An F-15E Strike Eagle is seen in the background of this picture of one of the F-35As at the “undisclosed location” on Feb. 16., USAF But, no matter what the future of the At Tanf garrison might look like, the Air Force’s rapid deployment of F-35As to Muwaffaq Salti definitely reflects expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations that the service looks set to increasingly employ in the Middle East, as well as elsewhere around the world to quickly respond to a wide array of contingencies.

Aaron Amick,"Updated on May 15, 2020",How Submarines Regularly ‘Fight To The Death’ Off The Bahamas,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Bahamas are home to white beaches, sun-scorched tourists, towering cruise ships, and the United States Navy’s most advanced weapons and sensor testing range. Beneath the revealing party goers dancing on the lido deck, submarines sail quietly through the Northeast Providence Channel into a secure area called the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, or AUTEC . Just like how Navy aircraft fight mock aerial wars over instrumented ranges where each player’s every move is tracked, those that deal in the shadowy art of submarine and anti-submarine warfare have a similar place in AUTEC. Here the Navy develops submarine-related tactics and weapons, validates the signatures of their own boats, and of course, fights mock undersea battles, pushing submariners to their limits. In 1963, the United States entered a joint agreement with the United Kingdom to develop the Ranges of Andros Island in the Bahamas on the condition that the Royal Navy would have access, as well. Shore facilities were under construction for three years, operated and maintained by the RCA Corporation. The Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics built two deep-sea submersibles to install the hydrophone ranges. In 1966, the Andros Ranges were officially renamed the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, or AUTEC for short. Delivered around 1968, AUTEC I and II submersibles were built by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics and were designated Turtle and Sea Cliff by the US Navy., Via cyberneticzoo.com The Bahamas achieved full independence from the United Kingdom in 1973 and the U.S. State Department negotiated a new agreement to use the range. After 1988, the U.S. Government agreed to lease the land (and water space) annually from the Bahamian Government. AUTEC’s main operating base on Andros Island.  , Wikited/wikicommons Located 100 miles southeast of Florida, AUTEC Site 1 is based on Andros Island. The topography just off the east coast of Andros plummets to about 1,000 fathoms—roughly 6,000 feet—in a north to south corridor called “The Tongue of the Ocean.” In this 500 square mile hockey stick-shaped area, the Navy tests some of its most advanced sensors, weapons, and tactics. The test range is surrounded by shoals and islands limiting the amount of ambient noise. This makes the range very quiet and perfect for testing submarines and associated weaponry. USN Two ranges are used for submerged testing: Shallow Water Mine Field near Berry Islands and Deep Water Testing Range ( formerly STAFAC ) southeast of Andros. Large fields of sound-sensitive hydrophones monitor the submerged tests. High gain measurement systems (HGMS) are used to ensure sound silencing standards are met after a submarine’s maintenance period because changes to existing equipment and installation of new equipment can significantly change a submarine’s sound signature. HGMS, USN During a signature profile measurement, a submarine slowly drives between a pair of submerged arrays that measure mechanical and flow noise. This is a very slow process as the sub must be configured with different equipment line ups between recordings. The result is an exact sound measurement level of the submarine performing a variety of evolutions. You can read all about this critical technology and its uses in this past War Zone feature. The deep-water testing range is broken into two zones, North Range and South Range. They can support multiple simultaneous tests and mini-war game events—when you get two or more submarines on the range, there’s going to be a mock battle. Both crews want to test their skill against the other and this tactical interaction is good for morale and qualifications. Site 1 on Andros Island. , Google Earth Close-up of Site 1. , Google Earth These little skirmishes between nuclear fast attack submarines (SSNs) are not only encouraged, they are scheduled. The Undersea Warfighting Development Center is responsible for formulating, improving, and testing submarine tactics. Some of this is done at AUTEC. Two or more submarines would be fitted with Noise Augmentation Units (NAU) and meet down on the range for a ‘mini-war.’ The NAU allowed American submarines to sound like any other submarine, from a Soviet-era Victor III to a Chinese Han nuclear-powered attack submarine. Scenarios involving anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft and NATO submarines would hunt the ’red force’ adversary sub playing the bad guy for days using new tactical approaches. These real-world tests were recorded in a 3D model in the AUTEC command building and analyzed for effectiveness. From these ‘mini-wars,’ NATO submarine tactical doctrine is molded and improved upon. A helicopter passes over the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) shortly after the vessel surfaced off the coast of Andros, The Bahamas during an emergency surface drill., National Archives The Fleet Operational Readiness Accuracy Check Site (FORACS) coordinates all tests on these versatile ranges. They are responsible for measuring the performance of sensors and navigation equipment installed on surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. With radar sites around the island and multiple fields of seafloor-moored hydrophones, the Range Safety Officer can watch every vessel and aircraft on the range in real-time. He is in constant voice communication with all aircraft, range craft, ships, and submarines via radio and underwater communication systems. Submarines from eight NATO countries come to verify their performance in a real-world environment, too. It is common for a United States Navy sub to be paired with a Royal Navy sub for equipment tests and sound measurements. If there are no delays, there is usually time at the end of the test schedule for the two vessels to go head-to-head in an undersea mock battle. This is when both crews can demonstrate their tactical prowess against an equal foe. Some of the support assets that make AUTEC a highly unique training destination and weapons and tactics development proving ground. , USN During a mock battle, the surface range craft leave the area and the submarines are allowed to enter the same water space, but are limited to different depth zones to prevent a collision. Battlestations are maintained for hours as two submarines slowly maneuver around each other in their quietest posture. When two of the world’s quietest submarines spar, it results in very close encounters. Sonar teams listen and scan for any noise that might give their opponent away. When detection is recognized, the sonar operator designates it “sierra one” (designation for an assigned sonar contact). The sonar supervisor calls out bearing, estimated course, and range based on only a few seconds of data. The approach officer, usually the commanding officer, initiates “firing point procedures sierra one, tube two,” referring to what torpedo tube to shoot). The conn aboard the USS Seawolf (SSN-21). , USN The weapons officer designates sierra one as the system contact and enters a target solution into the console. This data is sent to the exercise weapon in torpedo tube two. The weapon is powered on, torpedo gyros rapidly spin up, an internal system check is run, and the fire control solution data is set in memory. “Solution set!” is confirmed at fire control. The flooded torpedo tube is equalized to current depth pressure and the outer door is opened. “Weapon ready!” is announced by the weapons officer. The diving officer declares “Ship ready!” The captain authorizes launch with a short command, “Shoot tube two.” Torpedo launch is confirmed with the rumble of thousands of pounds of air forcing several hundred gallons of seawater into and through the torpedo tube. “Weapon startup” is confirmed from sonar when a new trace appears at the top of the display. “Wire clearance maneuver complete, weapon running normally.” Is verified by the sonar team. This entire frequently drilled performance is done in under 45 seconds. Because the target submarine is expected to counter fire. The command wire is cut leaving the torpedo to execute its orders within preset parameters and torpedo evasion begins. Countermeasures are launched and the submarine races away from contact. The target submarine will not have time to evade a well-placed shot at this short range. Exercise torpedoes will not actually hit a target as this can be extremely dangerous and would destroy the weapon. After a successful hit is confirmed by the weapon’s logic circuit, it will shut itself down and float to the surface. To become a warshot, a training torpedo must have multiple successful attacks at AUTEC. Mk46 exercise torpedo being recovered. , USN After each encounter, the torpedo retriever range craft drives in and picks up the floating exercise torpedo. This can take an hour or more and gives each crew a chance to debrief the attack and evasion in the control room. A more thorough reconstruction is done later with AUTEC’s range information showing exactly what happened during the event. This post maneuver evaluation is used to identify key moments of the engagement and results in better tactical performance in the future. AUTEC’s secure location makes it ideal for weapons testing.

The main site also has research, development, test and evaluation facilities called Range User Buildings that can support military contractor projects. This provides the contractor teams the ability to rapidly correct and modify devices during their onsite test time. A more recent addition to the north end of the range is a shallow water minefield near Berry Island . With a growing demand for littoral operations, submarine crews are spending more time near minefields, deploying special forces, and operating in shallow water. The shallow water minefield was key in developing the Navy’s submarine mine detection equipment and crew proficiency. The AN/BQS-15 and AN/BSY-1 sonar systems performed at a 60%-90% mine detection rate. Improved training and equipment upgrades in the ARCI phase IV sonar system resulted in greater than 90% mine detection. VADM John J.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 21, 2020",Russian Government Says It Sent Its New T-14 Tanks To Syria For Combat Testing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian government official says that the country field-tested its T-14 Armata main battle tanks in Syria, which, if true, would be the type’s first trip overseas. The Kremlin has long used the Syrian conflict as an opportunity to test new weapons and other military equipment, but it’s unclear how rigorous the testing of the T-14s in the Middle East actually was, if it even occurred. Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov made the comments about the T-14s in Syria on Apr. 19, 2020, in an interview with Nailya Asker-Zade on Deistvuyushchiye Litsa , or “Political Actors,” a program on Russia’s state-owned Rossiya-1 television channel. Alexander Potapov, CEO of the state-run T-14 manufacturer Uralvagonzavod, had told the Vedomosti newspaper in February that his company would deliver the first production batch of T-14 tanks sometime this year. “Yes, that’s right. They [Armata tanks] were used in Syria,” Manturov told Asker-Zade. “They were used in field conditions, in Syria, so, we took into account all the nuances.” T-14 tanks at the Alabino military training ground near Moscow in 2018., Ramil Sitdikov / Sputnik via AP The Minister offered no additional details about when or where in Syria the trials had taken place, how many total tanks were involved, and what the testing consisted of, specifically. There has been no word, as yet, from the Russian Ministry of Defense confirming the deployment or offering any additional information. The Russian military has tested other existing and new weapon systems and military equipment in Syria for the first time in the past, including its Kalibr sea-launched land-attack cruise missiles, Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles , Su-35S Flanker-E combat jets, BMPT Terminator ground combat vehicles, and unmanned ground combat vehicles , under actual combat conditions. Among other issues discovered during the Uran-9’s Syrian tests, there were problems with its running gear, 30mm cannons (could not fire on the move), its optics had reduced range, and it suffered 19 cases when it stopped responding to its operator. 2/ https://t.co/ih47ZgMC6f pic.twitter.com/1TftlpZ3VC — Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 2, 2019 However, with the exception of the small numbers of BMPTs, Russia has not previously sent heavy armor like the T-14s to Syria for its own use. Even if some number of T-14s did go to the country, it’s also very possible that the Russian military limited their actual use in order to curtail the potential for accidents or actual combat losses. Militant groups and terrorists who have been fighting the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, who relies heavily on Kremlin support to remain in power, have made good use of guided anti-tank missiles throughout much of the conflict , which first began 2011, and continue to do so. The T-14 does feature improved passive armor over older Russian tanks and has an active protection system specifically intended to defeat anti-tank missiles and shoulder-fired infantry anti-tank rocket. The design is also intended to make the crew less vulnerable by positioning them all low inside the hull and using an unmanned turret. However, there would still be a possibility that a confluence of factors could lead to a damaged or disabled tank, either of which would be extremely embarrassing for Russian authorities and a likely propaganda coup for anti-Assad groups. Similarly, in 2018, the Russian Air Force notably sent a pair of its pre-production Su-57 advanced combat jets to Syria, but only for a matter of days . Satellite imagery later showed that at least one of the aircraft sitting at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base outpost surrounded by sandbags to protect it from militant attacks . In December 2019, General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said Su-57s had returned to the Middle Eastern country for another deployment, but did not say when specifically that had occurred and otherwise offered very limited details. Sending the T-14s to Syria, no matter how briefly, could still be valuable for Russia’s own propaganda purposes and otherwise to demonstrate the country’s continued to commitment to the advanced tank project despite its persistent troubles. Russia first publicly unveiled the T-14 in 2015 during the annual May Victory Day parade, which commemorates the country’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, and announced plans to purchase thousands of them by the end of this year. Various issues, particularly the Armata’s high cost compared to other existing designs, threw a wrench in these plans and Russia now only expects to buy around 100 in the initial production batch. In 2019, Russia notably took delivery of more World War II-era T-34/85 tanks, obtained from Laos to use for parades and other promotional events, than T-14s. The Russian Army continues to receive larger numbers of upgraded variants of the Soviet-era T-90, T-80, and T-72 series, as well. In his interview on Deistvuyushchiye Litsa , Manturov expressed hope the T-14’s costs would come down as serial production expanded. “It [the T-14 Armata tank] is expensive because it is still undergoing extra trials and modernization after the defense ministry requested additional technical solutions in order to begin serial supplies starting from the next year under the existing contract,” he said. The Minister also talked about potential export orders, which could further help drive down unit costs, and said that there were “preliminary orders,” but declined to talk about who those possible customers might be. “Next year, when serial supplies of these tanks to the defense ministry are launched and an exports [sic] certificate is obtained, we will begin to work with foreign clients,” he added. Being able to say the T-14 has been “combat-proven” or otherwise employed successfully in Syria would help the Kremlin in marketing the tanks abroad. Whether or not Russia’s own production plans for the T-14 come to fruition remain to be seen, regardless of any Syrian deployment. The country’s defense budgets have seen regular cuts in recent years and the Kremlin has often shifted money around to meeting morphing priorities, especially in financing high-profile strategic weapon systems, including hypersonic missiles , controversial nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missiles , and ultra- long-range torpedoes . A drop in the global price of oil in 2014 had had significant impacts on the Russian economy, overall, and Russia and Saudi Arabia had just recently engaged in a new oil price war . U.S. diplomacy helped ostensibly bring an end to that spat. Unfortunately, just today a U.S. oil futures contract collapsed, with its price per barrel dropping below zero dollars , the first time this has ever happened. This highlighted serious volatility in the global oil market, especially because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . It will certainly be interesting to see what other details about the T-14’s supposed reported trip to Syria actually entailed and what impacts it might actually have on the tank’s future production and fielding.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2020",Air Force Eyes “Bomb Bay In A Box” To Rapidly Turn Airlifters Into Flying Weapon Trucks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking into conducting experiments involving palletized dispensers for stand-off munitions that could rapidly turn airlifters, such as the C-130 Hercules or the C-17 Globemaster III , into heavily armed weapons trucks . This could offer a relatively low-cost and low-risk path toward increasing the service’s capacity to launch large scale strikes across a broad area during a major conflict. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) first announced it was interested in gathering information on existing palletized munition concepts or proposed for new designs in February 2020. AFRL’s Air Force Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office, or SDPE, said it was looking for information on “potential availability … [of] systems suitable to support prototype experimentation” in both “ground and flight tests.” “The ability to mass firepower in future conflicts increases the range of OPLAN execution options against peer adversaries. Delivering standoff type weapons in mass, from non-traditional delivery platforms, is one potential option to deliver mass firepower and could prove pivotal in future conflicts,” SPDE’s February request for information explained. “The concept of ‘a bomb bay in a box,’ where mobility aircraft air drop multiple, independent munitions from outside of a threat area could augment traditional delivery methods.” The contracting notice does not specify a particular type of aircraft, but does say the “concept seeks to capitalize on current airlift capability to increase delivery of massed firepower.” Proposed designs also have to employ a “roll-on-roll-off deployment design (i.e. palletized options)” and use “use conventional airdrop infrastructure/techniques” indicating that munitions would exit the aircraft via a rear ramp. The Air Force’s primarily airlifters at present are the C-130 and the C-17, both of which have a rear ramp and would ideal candidates to carry such a system. Any system that works on both of those aircraft would also be able to be utilized in conjunction with the larger C-5 Galaxy, if desired, as well. An airman loads pallets of bombs onto a C-17 for transport. AFRL’s palletized munitions system envisions a way for airlifters to actually be able to employ large numbers of stand-off munitions., USAF AFRL says that the palletized munition system will be expendable, meaning crews will toss out them out of an airplane along with the munitions themselves with no expectation of recovering them after the mission. Anyone who proposes a system can use standardized government cargo pallets as a baseline or develop a new pallet system with the understanding that the U.S. government would eventually own that design if the project leads to an actual fielded weapon system. Any proposed system would “minimize connections between aircraft and pallet” and “require no aircraft modifications,” according to the request for information. AFRL also wants the complete system to include a mission separate pallet with the systems necessary to program munitions and enter targeting information before launch. All of this would allow for a palletized munition system that could be readily installed and uninstalled on any suitable airlifter, as necessary. AFRL says responses to its request for information need to include a description of the munition or munitions the proposed system will work with. The contracting notice indicates that companies can also propose entirely new munitions specifically for the palletized system if they want. Whatever the chosen munitions might be , they would have to have sufficient range to allow airlifters to safely launch them from well outside the range of potential hostile air defenses , which are only improving in capability . A list of characteristics AFRL wants any proposed palletized munitions system to have., USAF It’s worth noting that the basic idea of utilizing airlifters as strike platforms, as well as palletized and otherwise modular munitions dispensers , is hardly new. However, past concepts have typically involved cargo aircraft as a means, generally in permissive environments, of employing unguided munitions in more traditional level bombing roles or for dropping outsized specialized munitions . An MC-130E Combat Talon special operations transport drops a 15,000-pound BLU-82/B Daisy Cutter bomb during an exercise. The BLU-82/B is the kind of outsized munition that airlifters have been used to employ in the past., USAF There have also been more extensive conversion programs to turn cargo aircraft into more specialized strike platforms, the best example of which are the Air Force’s AC-130 gunships . There also roll-on/roll-off kits , such as the U.S. Marine Corps’ Harvest HAWK system for its KC-130s, which allow militaries to more rapidly and only temporarily convert airlifters into similar, if less robust gunship configurations. Those systems are still generally intended for use in permissive environments, as well. What the Air Force is exploring now is a significantly different concept that would allow airlifters to augment its long-range, stand-off strike capabilities in a high-end conflict. This makes good sense in many respects given the increasing capabilities of potential enemy integrated air defense networks, such as those that Russia and China , continue to improve and expand, which will pose a serious threat to all but the most advanced stealthy aircraft in the future. With that in mind, the question increasingly becomes what would be the functional difference between conducting mass long-range strikes using a large payload bomber, such as the B-52 , for instance, rather than an airlifter, such as the C-17, which is significantly cheaper per flight hour to operate and can possibly carry even more weapons using a palletized system? An airlifter carrying the palletized munition system would not need to have any targeting capability of its own, either, instead using ever-improving networking capabilities to get that information from other manned and unmanned aircraft , ships , and assets on the ground closer to the target area. Space-based sensors could also potentially contribute to the targeting ecosystem in the future. A B-52 bomber carrying a load of precision-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) under its wings., USAF AFRL already has a separate program underway, called Golden Horde , that is focused on exploring ways to network munitions together themselves so that they can operate as autonomous swarms. The Air Force , along with the Navy and the Army , are also exploring various means of improving networking to allow for more diverse offboard targeting options, as well. In principle, the Air Force could also use a palletized munitions system to deploy swarms of small drones, including expendable and recoverable types, from its airlifters, as well. A video that AFRL released in 2018 depicting various systems that service could be using in the 2030s included a segment showing a C-130-sized aircraft doing just this via a parachute-retarded air-launched canister-like module. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in cooperation with the Air Force, has also been experimenting with drones that airlifter can recover in mid-air under a project called Germlins . While AFRL’s focus, right now, is on stand-off strikes, there’s no reason to believe a palletized munitions system wouldn’t also be able to launch non-stand-off precision-guided munitions, such as GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), either. Loaded with these weapons, airlifters could exploit their long-range and large payload capabilities to loiter over permissive battlefields for extended periods of time and conduct close air support missions, as well. This could help free Air Force bombers from requirements to perform these types of missions , which is something the service says it wants to do , in general. How soon AFRL’s “bomb bay in a box” concept might turn into a viable weapon system, if at all, remains to be seen. The Air Force been kicking around ideas for an aircraft with a large munitions payload capacity, typically referred to as an “arsenal plane,” for decades now. In the aftermath of President Jimmy Carter’s decision to cancel the B-1A bomber program, the U.S. military explored lower-cost options, including, notably, a proposal from Boeing for a 747 airliner-based Cruise Missile Carrier Aircraft (CMCA). The CMCA concept, which you can read about more here , would have seen a 747-200C freighter adapted to carry 72 AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missiles, an idea not too far removed, in basic principle, from what AFRL is talking about now. Patent drawings showing the internal configuration of the proposed 747-based CMCA., USPTO The CMCA, and a host of other arsenal plane proposals , including past ideas to use airlifters as weapon trucks, have all failed to come to fruition. In November 2019, the Air Force said it was again looking into the “arsenal plane” concept, but that it could select a bomber already in service and adapt it to the mission. However, “the arsenal plane concept is probably better described as more of a clean-sheet approach to a platform that can affordably and rapidly fill the gap for long-range strike capabilities, and to go down more innovative paths,” Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees the service’s bomber fleets, said during Defense Writers Group telephone conference earlier this month. Many took this to imply he was interested in an all-new aircraft design , but it could also point to the development of a new munitions employment concept, such as a palletized munitions system. The U.S. defense budget, as a whole, again in a period of contraction and the Air Force looking to cut a large number of older aircraft to free up funds for other priorities. This includes plans to retire a substantial number of B-1B bombers in the next year, while also integrating new weapons , and more of them, onto the remaining aircraft. All told, the idea of being able to convert airlifters, at will, into low-cost stand-off strike platforms seems as attractive as ever. In addition, the costs associated with advanced, stealthy aircraft, such as the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber , that are actually capable of penetrating deep into denied areas littered with air defenses are only set to increase as time goes on. In order to be able to avoid losing any overall capacity to launch mass stand-off strikes from the air, having a lower-end companion will only become more and more essential. An artist’s rendering of a B-21 Raider stealth bomber., USAF In the past, critics of using cargo aircraft as arsenal planes have pointed out that there would likely be a high demand for airlifters in their primary role during any major conflict in the future. However, the Air Force has said in recent years that it wants to expand its airlift capacity , in general, including to support expeditionary and distributed operations concepts. A palletized munition system concept could be another argument adding significant numbers of additional airlifters to the service’s existing fleets. A palletized munition system for the Air Force’s airlifters definitely offers a very real path toward acquiring that capability and it will be interesting to see how AFRL proceeds with the proposals it receives.

The Air Force now says that it is focusing on Raytheon’s design on a sole-source basis. A formal down-select for the program wasn’t previously scheduled to occur until the 2022 Fiscal Year, according to the Air Force’s budget proposal for the upcoming 2021 fiscal cycle. “This is not a down-select per se ,” Elizabeth Thorn, the LRSO program manager at AFNWC, said in a statement . “Instead, we are reframing our relationship with Lockheed Martin to focus on specific technology maturation we believe either has future applicability for the final LRSO design or will reduce overall program risk.” Hard details about either LRSO design are scant. The new missile is set to eventually replace the aging AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), which has been in service since the 1980s. Unlike the AGM-86B, the LRSO will feature a new advanced stealth design to make it more survivable in the face of ever-improved integrated air defense systems, especially those that near-peer competitors, such as Russia and China, are fielding now or have in development. It will be the Air Force’s first stealthy nuclear-armed cruise missile since that service retired the then-state-of-the-art AGM-129A Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM) in 2012, which you can read about more in this past War Zone profile . The AGM-129A may now actually offer some clues as to the LRSO’s design. General Dynamics originally developed the ACM in the 1980s, but its missile divisions subsequently became part of Raytheon, which remained the prime contractor for supporting those cruise missiles before their retirement. Lockheed had also competed for the ACM contract with a stealth cruise missile with a shape derived from its F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jet. It has continued work on stealthy and other advanced missile systems, including the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family and its Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) derivative, since then. As the Air Force has described it now, the service will leverage that experience to help in optimizing Raytheon’s core design. “I am confident in the program office’s ability to execute the next phase’s contract negotiations in a single-source environment and maintain schedule and affordability,” Air Force Major General Shaun Morris, head of the AFNWC and the service’s Program Executive Officer for Strategic Systems, said in a statement . “We are committed to acquiring an affordable LRSO weapon system and we have exceptional cost and design insight into both contractors’ strategies, due to our progress with the acquisition reviews and the cost-capability trades.” Morris stressed that the decision to “off-ramp” Lockheed Martin as an LRSO prime contractor was an amicable decision with the company, unlike the spat between the Air Force and Boeing over the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile program. Last year, Boeing announced it would not bid on the next GBSD contract, saying competitor Northrop Grumman had unfair advantages. Northrop Grumman now looks all but set to design and build the final GBSD design. Regardless, the decision is a major victory for Raytheon over Lockheed Martin, the latter of which has been scooping up a large number of advanced missile contracts across the U.S. military in recent years, especially with regards to new hypersonic weapons , much of which remains highly classified. Lockheed Martin is also the prime contractor for JASSM and LRASM and the Air Force has separately hired the Maryland-headquartered defense giant to develop a new “extreme range” version of the aforementioned JASSM, known as the AGM-158D JASSM-XR . The company certainly has a lot on its plate already. The Air Force expects the LSRO to begin entering service in 2030, at which point it will begin replacing the AGM-86B. The ALCM is presently the only nuclear weapon that the service’s B-52H bombers are certified to carry. The service also plans to integrate the new LRSO on its B-21 Raider stealth bombers. Last year, Congress axed a requirement for a conventionally-armed LRSO variant, mirroring the AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM). The Air Force retired the CALCMs in November 2019 . It had appeared that the AGM-158D JASSM-XR would instead meet the Air Force’s requirement for an advanced conventional cruise missile with a significantly extended range over the AGM-86C/D. However, earlier this month, Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), raised the possibility that his service could continue with the development of a conventional LRSO regardless as part of its plans to expand its long-range conventional strike capabilities, especially for the B-1B Bone bomber fleet. No matter what, some eight years after the retirement of the AGM-129A, Raytheon is now set to be the primary supplier of the Air Force’s next stealthy nuclear-armed cruise missile.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to nuclear fast attack submarines (SSNs), it doesn’t get more hot-rod than the Soviet Alfa class. With a hull built of titanium, a highly automated control system run by a skeleton crew, and a reactor that was cooled by molten lead-bismuth, the Alfa class was absolutely cutting-edge when it debuted in the early 1970s. Able to hit speeds in excess of 40 knots while submerged, the Alfas were rocketships of the undersea world, with only the one-off K-222 “Golden Fish” submarine eclipsing their speed capabilities. They were also remarkably small, partially due to their reactor design, which had many advantages, but if its molten metal coolant stopped circulating, it turned into a mummified brick. Now, pictures from the removal of one of these reactors from a decommissioned Alfa class boat give us an idea of just how compact the class’s exotic reactors really were.Â Before you continue on, you can read and should read all about this marvel of a submarine in this past feature of mine . It’s essential to get a better understanding of just how remarkable these submarines were when they first emerged and the many tradeoffs in their design that truncated their fleet size to just seven boats.Â Alfa class submarine K-373 during better times. , Unknown Rare color photo of an Alfa class submarine underway while surfaced. , Unknown @Captain_Navy , a must-follow on twitter if you are into naval warfare, posted the shot below this weekend.

Just five years into its service life, K-123 suffered a major reactor failure. Globalsecurity.org describes the major tradeoffs in regards to the reactor design and the Alfa class’s capabilities as such: Project 705 and 705K submarines had record high underwater speed (more than 40 knots) and maneuverability, they successfully completed several long autonomous trips. It took them about 1 minute to accelerate to full speed, and it took 42 seconds to circulate with a 180Â° turn. For speed, the submarine of project 705 was even listed in the Guinness Book of Records. At the same time, even with good PPU, the operation of the boats of projects 705 and 705K with LMT had certain difficulties, such as the difficulty of eliminating malfunctions due to the tightness of the reactor compartment, the need for an external energy source when being at the base with the reactor shut off, the need for regular regeneration of the coolant … for these problems in the early 90s, when the submarine fleet began to decline, they began to be decommissioned. The K-705 submarines were decommissioned in 1990, and the 705K submarines in 1996. The commanders and officers of submarines with reactor facilities developed at the IPPE gave a very high rating to the submarine itself and its nuclear power plant, calling it a â€œmiracle boatâ€ that was far ahead of its time. Today it can be considered universally recognized that in the IPPE under the direction of A.I. Leypunsky laid the foundations for a new direction in nuclear energy, and a unique reactor technology was demonstrated on an industrial scale. This made it possible to ensure the compactness of the reactor installation, which is important when creating submarines of limited displacement, to ensure high maneuverability, and to increase the reliability and safety of the reactor installation. … With the withdrawal of the last submarine from the Navy from the Navy, a certain stage in the development of ship nuclear energy was completed. The use of liquid metal coolant reactors in nuclear submarines has two opposing views. Some, and most of them, considered this a mistake due to the accident rate and low reliability of the equipment. Others pointed to the high combat qualities of the nuclear submarines: project 705 and 705K boats could successfully evade enemy torpedoes precisely at the expense of speed and maneuverability, short time to bring the reactor out of a subcritical state into energy mode, and ease of control. … In April 1982, during a cruise of the K-123 nuclear submarine, a PPU accident occurred – due to improper crew actions, the alloy was thrown into the compartment through the impulse pipe of the gas system. PPU had to be taken out of action and â€œfrozenâ€. The subsequent revision of the PUF also revealed irreparable great corrosion damage to the steam generator pipe systems from the side of the secondary circuit, which required a complete replacement of the PPU compartment (there was a replacement BM-40A installation kit).

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has ended its uninterrupted rotations of bombers to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, which have been ongoing since 2004, as it shifts to a less predictable concept of operations. Five B-52H Stratofortresses left yesterday with no replacement aircraft in place, bringing an end to what the service had called the Continuous Bomber Presence Mission . This notably came just days after the bombers took part in a massive “elephant walk” readiness drill that also involved six KC-135R aerial refueling tankers , an RQ-4B Global Hawk drone, as well as a U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone, and an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter, which was seen as a significant statement of American resolve aimed China. Online aircraft tracker and friend of The War Zone @AircraftSpots spotted the five B-52Hs leaving Guam for their home at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota on Apr. 16, 2020. The bombers used the very pointed callsign “SEEYA” for the transit. “In line with the National Defense Strategy, the United States has transitioned to an approach that enables strategic bombers to operate forward in the Indo-Pacific region from a broader array of overseas locations, when required, and with greater operational resilience, while these bombers are permanently based in the United States,” U.S. Air Force Major Kate Atanasoff, a U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) spokesperson, confirmed in a statement to The War Zone . “U.S. strategic bombers will continue to operate in the Indo-Pacific, to include Guam, at the timing and tempo of our choosing.” Starting in 2004 , the Air Force began deploying B-52s, as well as B-1B Bone supersonic bombers and B-2A Spirit stealth bombers, for six-month stints to Andersen on Guam as part of the Continuous Bomber Presence Mission. As its name indicates, the concept of operations was meant to ensure that at least one task force of long-range heavy bombers was in position at the immensely strategic base at all times to respond to potential contingencies in the Pacific Region. The bombers on Guam had been a cornerstone of U.S. power projection and deterrence capabilities to the region since then. A scene from the elephant walk on Apr. 13, with the five B-52Hs present. Also seen are the six KC-135Rs behind the bombers and the RQ-4B Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, and MH-60S Sea Hawk in front., USAF The service had indicated earlier this month that it was interested in switching to shorter duration bomber deployments to Guam. At the same time, the U.S. military, as a whole, has also increasingly adopted a concept of operations known as Dynamic Force Employment , which aims to make major deployments less predictable in order to keep potential opponents, such as China and Russia, on edge. It also serves to demonstrate America’s ability to project force around the world on short notice and with little advance warning for adversaries. As part of this push, the Air Force has been experimenting with sending bombers to new or less common deployment locations in the Pacific, as well as in Europe. In 2018, B-2A Spirit stealth bombers notably made their first-ever visit to Wake Island, albeit briefly, during a longer duration deployment to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. There had been some indications that the end of the Continuous Bomber Presence Mission on Guam was imminent in the past week or so already. On Apr. 14, PACAF posted a pair of B-52H pictures on the official Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) website, with the title “Last Continuous Bomber Presence Mission on Guam.” Sometime after that, the title was changed to “ Andersen remains ready ,” which was also used to describe the photos of the elephant walk on Apr. 13. A cached screenshot of the DVIDS entry from PACAF regarding the Continuous Bomber Presence Mission on Guam as of Apr. 14., DOD A screenshot of the same entry as it appeared at the time of writing., DOD On top of that, a tweet from U.S. Strategic Command’s official Twitter account on Apr. 16 said “whether they’re launched from Louisiana, Guam, or the U.K., long-range strategic bombers have and will remain a bedrock of our deterrence!” and included the hashtag “#DynamicForceEmployment.” It’s also worth noting that President Donald Trump had criticized the cost of operating bombers on Guam, especially as part of exercises over and around South Korea, thousands of miles to the north. “We fly these massive bombers in from Guam. And when I first started, a certain general said, ‘Oh, yes, sir, we fly them in from Guam. It’s right next door.’ Well, ‘right next door’ is seven hours away,” Trump said on Feb. 28, 2019 during a press conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, following an abortive summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “And then they come and they drop millions of dollars of bombs, and then they go back and — but we would spend — I mean, we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on those exercises, and I hated to see it. I thought it was unfair.” Still, it is hard to overstress how significant a development this is, despite STRATCOM’s view that it will not impact its ability to employ bombers to respond to contingencies in the region. The potential for major crises to erupt in the Pacific remains very real. For instance, there are indications that North Korea is continuing to work on expanding and improving its nuclear arsenal and associated delivery platforms . The regime in Pyongyang has been routinely conducting tests of new and improved conventional weapons for months now, as well. In addition to supporting the aforementioned exercises with South Korea, bombers launched from Guam have been a major component of show-of-force and deterrence operations aimed at North Korea in the past. A B-1B bomber emerges from the darkness to refuel during an unprecedented show of force mission off the coast of North Korea above the 38th parallel in 2017., USAF The COVID-19 pandemic has also inflamed tensions between the United States and China, which had already been simmering over a host of issues, including Beijing’s extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea , U.S.-Taiwan relations , U.S. government support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong , and long-standing trade and other economic disputes, among others. There have been a number of tit-for-tat engagements between U.S. and Chinese military forces, particularly in the South China Sea, in recent years, including a near-collision between a U.S. Navy destroyer and a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) destroyer in 2018 and incidents involving potentially dangerous jamming and lasing of American military aircraft in the region. Chinese security forces have also aggressively challenged other foreign military aircraft and civilian ships in the process of asserting its claims in the South China Sea. Just on Apr. 9, the Pentagon issued a statement criticizing Chinese authorities over an incident in which a China Coast Guard vessel rammed and sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat near the Paracel Islands, one of a number of hotly contested island chains in the South China Sea. B-52H bombers flying from Guam, among other U.S. military aircraft , have flown patrols in the South China Sea as part of so-called Freedom of Navigation Operations , or FONOPS, to challenge Chinese claims. The departure of the B-52Hs from Guam also comes as questions have been raised about the U.S. military’s ability to project power in the Pacific in light of the sidelining of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt due to a major COVID-19 outbreak among its crew, which has caused one fatality so far. That ship is now stuck pier side in Guam indefinitely, which has forced the Navy to pull a carrier from a deployment to the Middle East, where U.S. tensions are also high with Iran , and redirect to the Pacific. Sailors assigned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt leave the carrier, which is in port in Guam, on Apr. 10 as the Navy works to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among its crew., USN For its part, China recently sent one of its carriers, the Liaoning , on a mission that took it near both Japan and Taiwan. Two destroyers, a pair of frigates, and a supply ship accompanied Liaoning on the voyage, demonstrating the PLAN’s own increasing ability to conduct carrier operations. “We will maximize all opportunities to train alongside our allies and partners to build interoperability and bolster our collective ability to be operationally unpredictable,” Major Atanasoff, the STRATCOM spokesperson, added in her statement. “We continually reassess our overseas posture and adjust to meet the requirements of the Joint Force and combatant commanders as well as our treaty commitments.” The exact ramifications of the decision to end the Continuous Bomber Presence Mission remain to be seen, but it’s undeniable that the U.S. military’s force posture in the Pacific region has just undergone a major shift.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Here’s What It Really Costs To Own Or Charter A Private Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the ultimate symbols of luxury and affluence is private jet travel. From the dawn of the Learjet-era to today’s ultra-long-range large-cabin jets, the most wealthy people in the world enjoy the unparalleled freedom and privilege that private jets provide. For such an intriguing and vaunted domain, there are a lot of misconceptions about it and the finances required to play within it. With this in mind, we dive into what traveling on and even owning one of these flying ‘time machines’ really costs and why they are so popular. There are two common ways to travel by private jet. Those consist of FAA certified charter operators and private ownership. Fractional ownership companies such as Netjets exist, but they essentially function and offer flights like charter operations and must be certified to do so. In the economic downturn of 2008, many privately owned jet aircraft went away and charter operations, including fractional ownerships, moved up in prevalence. All FAA charter operations obtain a license or certificate under 14 CFR Federal Aviation Regulations part 135. If they do not have this certificate and do not comply with ongoing safety regulations and inspections, they cannot legally offer charter services to the general public. What this means is anyone can call a licensed charter operation, if they have sufficient funds, and request a flight. When they do, their safety is backstopped by a history of compliance with regulatory guidance, inspections, and flight crew training. Challenger 300. , Anton Bannikov/Wikicommons Charter operators are just like airlines, but you must pay for the entire airplane, like a rental. You cannot sell charters by the individual ticket or seat, hence the term ‘charter.’ If you’re not an owner and want to pay to have your family flown on vacation in a private jet, you’ll need to charter an entire aircraft of sufficient range and capacity to do so. We asked Advantage Aviation Charter in Hayward, California how much it would cost to transport five passengers on a weekend-long round trip from Northern California to Las Vegas and back in their light jet, a Cessna Citation CJ4. The total quote was $21,000, which itself is a significant amount of money, but still quite low for a jet charter, because it’s a short trip and the CJ4 is a small, economical jet. For comparison, that same family flying first-class round trip would run around 15 percent of the charter cost. A CJ4 would not be capable of flying to Hawaii and wouldn’t be commonly used for intercontinental operations. The lower maximum cruising speed of 451 knots makes it less desirable for long-distance flights, though fueling stops can get it across the United States. Atlantic Ocean crossings would potentially be possible via multiple refuelings on northern routes through Canada, Greenland, and Iceland, but that is not realistic in practice. Advantage Aviation has long-range options, as well. They operate a Cessna Citation X, which is a very high-performance long-range jet that was at one time the fastest private cabin jet in the world. With 13,000 pounds of thrust and a highly swept wing, the Citation X can cruise above Mach .90, which is 90 percent of the speed of sound. Its range of almost 4,000 miles makes it a solid performer and perennial favorite of flight crews. Filling up the tank on any private jet isn’t cheap. With an internal fuel capacity of 1,926 gallons, and at $6 per gallon, the X holds $11,556 of fuel when full. Consumption is 347 gallons, or $2,082 per hour. According to Advantage Aviation, a chartered round trip in a Cessna Citation X from the San Francisco Bay Area to Kauai and staying a week before returning would cost a customer $65,000. Netjets is the most famous fractional ownership company and operates, in part, under an FAA charter certificate. They have many options to choose from. For $1.3 million, you can buy five years of privileges chartering a near-new Embraer Phenom 300 private jet, which is similar in size and capability to the CJ4. After the $1.3 million buy-in, your contractual privileges give you the access to fly in it 100 hours a year for $524,000 annually. Included is a monthly management fee of $18,000. It works similar to every other charter operation, but you have rights to divest your $1.3 million dollar share at a rate appropriately depreciated for the age of the jet at the time of your sell-back. With respect to Advantage Aviation and Netjets, the charter costs listed were accurate for a brief period of time. Prices may migrate higher or lower, and substantially so. The cost of chartering can be quite high, as the operator must pay for a professional aircrew and their hotels and travel costs, if necessary, in addition to the cost of operating the jet. On top of that, the operator must increase the price to provide a profit margin that makes it worth their time complying with regulatory guidance and to keep their doors open. Further, most charter companies charge you for empty and reposition legs. It’s only fair that if you cause a jet to be moved, you pay. Repositioning the aircraft for free or flying it home after dropping you off would destroy any profit made. Nationwide companies like Netjets offer plans that don’t charge for reposition flights because they are large enough to sell the empty legs of your flights, or they can make it up in other ways. The acquisition and monthly fees that Netjets charges its customers negates not paying reposition flights or getting a lower hourly rate. Netjets has a fleet of 750 aircraft under its purview, making it a massive power player in the private air travel space. , Netjets Chartering is only cost effective for those customers and passengers who wouldn’t fly very often, or want the simplest method of getting around. With charter, you just schedule, pay, and go. The more cost-effective option for frequent private flyers is to own their jet. The more you fly, the more the large cost of purchasing a jet mitigates paying for a charter operation’s profit margins. How much does it cost? There are a wide range of entry costs, depending on the age and capability of the jet you purchase. Let’s outline ownership starting small. In recent decades, the VLJ (very light jet) became an entry-level category of the private jet marketplace. Made possible with small and economical engines, such as the Williams FJ series, VLJs are not as popular as they were predicted to be. This is greatly due to their slower speeds and limited load capacity. The Cirrus Vision SF50, the cheapest of the VLJs, has a single Williams FJ33 jet engine, cruises at 300 knots (over 150 knots less than the CJ4) and can seat seven, including the cockpit seats, in tight quarters. The entry price is competitive, around $2 million brand new. Owners expect to spend an average of $40,000 a year on maintenance and support costs. The SF50 holds 295 gallons and can reduce consumption to 47 gallons per hour if you’re willing to cruise at 242 knots, which is turboprop speed. With full tanks, the SF50 holds $1,770 of fuel at $6 per gallon. Altogether, with purchase financing payments, an SF50 owner can spend $400,000 a year. VLJs like the SF50 are targeted at owners who will fly the jet themselves and are largely not purchased by private flight departments that need on-demand, all-weather jet travel for business purposes. Light jets like the Cessna Citation CJ4 we quoted for a charter are very popular. The average market value for a lightly used CJ4 is currently around $6.5 million. Depending on the type of purchase and finance options, monthly payments of $20,000 to $100,000 are common. Maintenance inspections requirements cost an annual average of $55,000 over five years for a CJ4, but rise and fall depending on what inspections are due that year. Private jet owners often choose to participate in programs that involve a fixed hourly price for engine maintenance and inspections for the aircraft, instead of paying as they go, which run around $1,000 per flight hour on a CJ4. A busy private flight department operating a Citation CJ4 can easily eclipse $500,000 a year in direct operating costs with trips every few weeks. Operating costs would only include costs such as fuel, keeping a pilot on salary, and maintenance. Incidentally, CJ4s burn about 152 gallons per hour in cruise and holds 870 gallons. So, full tanks hold $5,220 of fuel at $6 per gallon. Operating costs factored here would not include the payments for the jet itself. All included, with a payment size of $60,000 a month, the cost of regularly flying a privately owned Citation CJ4 can exceed $1.2 million per year. CJ4., Cessna-Textron Older jets from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s come down greatly in acquisition cost, even into the low six-figure range, but are largely less economical to operate. There are many to choose from, but they aren’t fuel-efficient and lack the performance new jets possess. For instance, vintage Learjets burn more fuel at idle than they do in cruise flight at high altitudes. A 20-minute takeoff delay due to congested air traffic has the potential to eliminate fuel reserves necessary for safe flight. The FAA has mandated avionics updates, such as ADS-B, that can be quite costly on older aircraft. Exacerbating difficulties associated with older jets are a potential lack of parts availability and knowledgeable maintenance support, in addition to some not meeting noise abatement requirements. Earlier Learjets, like this Lear 24, were amazingly ahead of their time and beautiful flying machines, but they are highly inefficient and technologically obsolete by today’s standards., Tomás Del Coro/wikicommons When it comes to late-model aircraft, the sky’s the limit for the size and capability of jets and the cost of private jet travel, both literally and figuratively. The recent king of private jets is the ultra-long-range, large-cabin Gulfstream G650ER. Up to 19 passengers, not including the crew, can enjoy the G650ER’s intercontinental reach with its range of 8,600 miles. In April 2019, a G650ER completed a nonstop flight from Singapore to Tucson, Arizona. Incredible capability comes with an exorbitant price. Potential G650ER owners can plan on spending $71.5 million just on aircraft acquisition. Many millions more can be spent on customization. The ongoing requirements aren’t cheap either. The G650ER can hold 7,088 gallons of fuel and it gulps down 452 gallons per hour. Fuel prices depend on location, but at $6 a gallon, full tanks hold a spendy $42,500 worth of fuel. That’s right, the price equivalent of buying a loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee every time you fill-up the G650ER’s tanks. One private flight department we spoke to in Van Nuys, California spends $18.6 million a year on all costs involved with keeping and flying their G650ER. In rare circumstances, heads of state and others with extraordinarily deep pockets have converted full-sized airliners into private jets with bedroom suites, kitchens, theaters and luxury bathrooms. In the past, jumbo jets, including 747 s and A380s, have been converted. The prices of these jets and associated conversions can be $300 million and sometimes $500 million or more in specific cases. Back in 2015, AOPA (Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association) posted an article that aimed to estimate operating costs for various aircraft. In our case, it helps compare aircraft against each other in a general sense. AOPA gives the following explanation for what these numbers include: “These are variable costs and include fuel, maintenance (parts and labor), engine reserves, auxiliary power units if applicable, and miscellaneous expenses to include crew travel, catering and cabin supplies, landing and parking fees—all boiled down to a single number.” So, keep in mind that what you see here doesn’t include actual debt service on the aircraft itself. Hourly costs of operation: Cirrus Vision SF50:                         661.53 Embraer Phenom 100E:              1,151.84 Embraer Phenom 300:                 1,757.53 Cessna Citation CJ4:                   1,970.13 Bombardier Learjet 70:                2,166.11 Cessna Citation Sovereign:         2,699.38 Dassault Falcon 2000LXS:          3,089.71 Embraer Legacy 500:                   3,179.78 Bombardier Challenger 850         3,544.71 Embraer Legacy 600:                   3,739.73 Citation X+:                                  4,098.69 Gulfstream G550:                         4,731.05 Gulfstream G650:                         4,843.16 Gulfstream G650ER:                    4,847.91 Bombardier Global 6000:             5,149.70 Boeing BBJ 3:                              7,396.29 Airbus ACJ320:                             7,964.69 Boeing 747SP:                             19,944.07 Airbus A380:                                29,000.00 All operating costs we’ve listed are to be taken with a grain of salt. The cost varies significantly based on many factors. In both charter and private ownership, managers are always on the phone with service providers, negotiating the best rates possible. Maintenance and catering overbilling are common and must be painstakingly audited and researched. Therein lies a critical difference between paying for chartered jets and owning a jet. Charter companies only need to compete with each other. Savings they uncover rarely translate to the customer; instead they add profit margins. Companies and individuals that privately own and operate jets generally have Flight Department Managers or Chief Pilots who take a direct approach to cost mitigation, seeking the lowest wholesale cost on everything possible. Every cent they save stays in-house and benefits the owner. Just for comparison, here are some rough numbers of what it costs to charter an aircraft on an hourly basis, but keep in mind, these figures don’t include a huge number of potential add-ons and additional incurred costs for a charter flight, as we discussed before, nor repositioning or empty return legs. Stratosjets.com lists a range of per hour costs based on the size and capability of the airframe needed for the charter. They read as follows: Very light jet: $2,750-$3,400/hr Light jet: $3,750-$4,600/hr Mid-size jet: $4,400-$5,900/hr Super mid-size jet: $5,500-$7,000/hr Heavy jet: $7,600-$11,250/hr This is a middle ground estimation and a very loose one at that. Some charter outfits post somewhat lower or somewhat higher example rates , but at least this offers an idea of just what this type of convenience generally costs and how much it varies depending on the type of aircraft required or requested for the trip. AP Is the perceptively extreme cost of private jet travel worth it? For one, it depends on how much money you have to spend, how much you earn, and how valuable your time is. The advantages private jets provide are costly, but inarguable. The National Business Aviation Association published a study in 2010 showing that small and mid-sized companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth than those that use airlines. This may not tell the whole story, but if an individual or a business places extreme value on time management and direct relationships, a jet is likely seen as an essential tool. Why? For one, there’s almost no waiting in line. Almost everywhere, your pilots and flight department can arrange for a car service to accommodate plane-side passenger dropoff and pickup without parking woes, long walks through terminals, security lines, and waiting to board an airliner—that is if it even shows up on time. The time spent in airline terminals is time lost to someone who can otherwise spend the time working and making much more money than a jet costs to operate. Embraer Phenom 300. , Embraer Smaller airports without commercial air service are available to private jets. A city like Los Angeles has many small airports. Direct access to smaller cities in the Los Angeles basin with a private jet can save you from an hour-long drive in heavy traffic resulting from landing at LAX, Burbank, or John Wayne airports in an airliner, and that’s after you make your way out of the terminal. A modern jet with WIFI connectivity can not only pay for itself in time saved, it can function as a mobile office. It’s quite reasonable with 24-hour access to a private jet for a passenger to attend meetings and functions in several different cities and still be home the same evening, all the while staying productive in transit. Airborne WIFI subscription plans aren’t cheap, either, and many range in the thousands per month. Traditional supply chains and modern outsourced manufacturing alike often geographically separate the critical components of a business. Private flight departments usually work pilot schedules to keep a crew on call all the time. The ability to travel almost immediately is appealing to those who maintain long-distance business relationships. AP New business management tactics become available with a private jet on tap, as well. In the age of smartphones and internet communications, people can be quite bold and unreasonable over email. They are more polite with a phone call and can be even subdued when negotiating differences if you can arrive in their city and take them to lunch on the same day a problem arises. A private jet of any size is most often the only way to provide that flexibility. Airports with heavy private aviation traffic have FBOs (fixed base operators), which provide terminal services such as refueling, catering, rental cars, and more. Some FBOs handle hundreds of jet refuels per day. There are around 3,000 FBOs in the United States, comprising a multi-billion-dollar industry. FBOs make what is already largely seamless travel even smoother and provide a level of luxury and customer service that simply doesn’t exist in commercial aviation. Cessna-Textron To the average person, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a month and millions per year to travel on private jets seems downright outlandish. In that vein, so does having millions of dollars in liquid spendable money and hundreds of millions of dollars in personal assets. Few of us are so fortunate, but most often it’s companies with the resources necessary to acquire and operate a jet, not individuals, although stars and business tycoons usually are what people think about first when private air travel comes up. In the end, we’ve underlined the biggest downside to private jet aviation, and it’s inarguably the cost. Those that can afford it either appreciate the luxury or have found it a necessity for their personal lifestyle or business demands. The dollar figures may seem daunting and out of reach, but thousands of private jet flights take place around the world every day. An entire industry of charter operations, FBOs, aircraft manufacturers, and other service providers have developed around supporting private jet travel. So, if you have the financial resources, it’s all sitting right there ready for you.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Kazakh Air Defense Forces MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor crashed shortly after takeoff today after suffering an engine fire. The two crew members successfully ejected before the plane crashed and burned in a field. The MiG-31 had taken off from an airbase in the country’s eastern Karaganda region before the accident occurred, according to an official statement from the Kazakh Ministry of Defense. Bystanders below watched as the aircraft, clearly on fire, plummeted into the ground. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rRzTILBjqp4 “The accident occurred south of the airfield in Karaganda. After takeoff, one of the engines caught fire,” the Kazakh Ministry of Defense statement said . “After receiving an order to eject, military pilots directed the aircraft into a field, away from the settlement, making sure that nothing threatened the civilian population, and ejected. The pilots are alive.” The exact status of the two crewmembers, who were reportedly taken to a hospital after parachuting down to the ground, is unclear. An investigation into the incident is already underway. Kazakhstan is the only country besides Russia to fly the massive MiG-31, which it inherited after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The MiG-31, which evolved from the MiG-25 Foxbat, first flew in 1975 and entered Soviet service in 1981. The aircraft are capable of extremely high altitude flight and have a top speed of close to Mach 3. In Russian service, their large size and payload capacity has also led them to become a prime choice for modification into launch platforms for outsized missiles . A pair of Russian MiG-31s., MiG The size of the Kazakh Air Defense Forces’ original fleet of 50 aircraft, 40 of which were upgraded to the MiG-31BS standard, has steadily dwindled since then. As of the beginning of 2020, the country had 21 of the jets in inventory, according to FlightGlobal . Another one of Kazakhstan’s Foxhounds crashed in the Karaganda region in 2013 after experiencing a “ technical failure .” The pilot involved in that accident died, but the backseater survived. The fleet has now shrunk once again, but thankfully both of the pilots survived the crash. We will update this story as more information becomes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Air forces around the world will often give their aircraft specialized paint jobs to commemorate anniversaries and other notable occasions , but it’s far less common to see navies do the same thing with their ships. Recently, however, the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax class frigate HMCS Regina recently took part in a training exercise wearing an iconic blue, black, and gray paint job, commonly known as a “dazzle” scheme, a kind of warship camouflage that first appeared during World War I. At the end of March 2020, Regina , and her unique paint job, had joined HMCS Calgary , another Halifax class frigate, along with the Kingston class coastal defense vessel HMCS Brandon and two Orca class Patrol Craft Training (PCT) vessels, Cougar and Wolf , for Task Group Exercise 20-1 (TGEX 20-1) off the coast of Vancouver Island in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The training continued into the first week of April. TGEX 20-1 was part of Calgary ‘s Directed Sea Readiness Training (DSRT) in preparation for that particular ship’s upcoming deployment. Regina had first emerged in the dazzle scheme in October 2019 ahead of the U.S. Navy-led Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, a massive naval training event that takes place every two years and includes U.S. allies and partners from around the Pacific region. It reportedly took 272 gallons of paint and cost the Royal Canadian Navy $20,000 to give Regina the dazzle treatment. HMCS Regina , carrying her dazzle camouflage scheme, takes part in Task Group Exercise 20-1 in April 2020., Canadian Forces Canadian Forces All of the ships that participated in Task Group Exercise 20-1, including HMCS Calgary , at far left, and HMCS Regina , at far right. HMCS Brandon is at center, flanked by Cougar and Wolf ., Canadian Forces The frigate will wear the camouflage pattern until the end of 2020. The Royal Canadian Navy also painted up the Kingston class HMCS Moncton , which is homeported in Halifax on the other side of the country, in a similar scheme . The paint job on both ships is in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the end of the Battle of the Atlantic . This refers to the Allied fight to both enforce a naval blockade of Germany during World War II and secure critical maritime supply routes from North America to Europe. The battle officially ended with the surrender of the Nazi regime in May 1945. HMCS Moncton in her commemorative scheme., Canadian Forces In this context, the paint scheme has significant for both Regina and Moncton . The first Royal Canadian Navy ships to carry these names were both Flower class corvettes that fought in the Battle of the Atlantic. Moncton conducted convoy escort operations between 1942 and 1944, before being transferred to the Pacific Theater. Regina also protected allied merchant vessels making the cross from 1942 to 1944, when she was unfortunately sunk by the German U-boat U-667 off the coast of the United Kingdom. She succumbed to the seas in less than 30 seconds and 30 of her 85 crew members died. Despite the commemorative nature of the paint schemes, dazzle and other disruptive naval camouflage patterns date back to World War I. British artist Norman Wilkinson , primarily known for maritime paintings, is credited with inventing the dazzle concept, which consisted of angular patterns applied to a ship’s hull and superstructure intermittently. White and black were the most common colors, but some patterns included blue and gray, just like the commemorative ones that Regina and Moncton are wearing right now. The British aircraft carrier HMS Argus wearing a dazzle paint scheme in 1918., USN In 1917, Wilkinson, who was then a Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander, proposed his camouflage idea in response to Imperial Germany’s successful unrestricted submarine warfare against Allied shipping in the Atlantic. The idea was that that paint scheme would make it difficult for German submarine crews to effectively gauge the distance, heading, and speed of ships on the surface, making it more difficult for them to position themselves for an attack and increase the opportunities for friendly forces to the detect them. The same general principles applied, at least in theory, to surface engagements, especially at long ranges, given the relatively limited capability of optical sighting systems at the time. The British Army also experimented with similar disruptive schemes on motorized vehicles and its tanks, a then-new type of weapon that the service was first to introduce on the battlefield. A US Navy intelligence report from 1918 depicting the dazzle scheme on the British merchant ship SS Alban , which is similar in many respects to the ones that HMCS Regina and HMCS Moncton are wearing now., USN While dazzle is commonly used today as a catchall term for a number of disruptive naval camouflage schemes, at the time, it technically only refers to the patterns that came out of a special unit that the Admiralty in the United Kingdom had set up late in World War I with Wilkinson at its head. Between 1914 and 1915, the Royal Navy, at the direction of then-First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, had experimented with more fluid disruptive schemes employing contrasting colors and countershading , such as painting the tops and undersides of main gun barrels in dark and light colors, respectively. These schemes were intended to produce the same results as the later dazzle patterns. This earlier concept had originated with John Graham Kerr , a British biologist, who took his inspiration from natural camouflage in the animal kingdom. American naturalist and artist Abbott Handerson Thayer also promoted the idea of animal-inspired camouflage both in the United States, where he was rebuffed, and to Churchill. After Churchill left the role of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1915, the Royal Navy abandoned these patterns. Kerr unsuccessfully tried to win legally-binding credit for coming up with the idea for disruptive naval camouflage first after World War I ended. How effective the dazzle patterns actually were in combat remains a topic of debate. Data collected at the time indicated that the camouflage did make it slightly more difficult for enemy submarines to launch attacks, but also made the ships more visible, increasing the total number of attempted attacks. The Royal Navy continued to use of dazzle patterns, as well as more schemes with more fluid edges known formally as Admiralty Disruptive Pattern , during World War II. Flower class corvettes, such as the original Regina and Moncton , wore both types of paint jobs during the war, among others. The U.S. Navy and the German Navy also employed disruptive schemes. The Flower class HMCS Regina during World War II with her Admiralty Scheme camouflage., Canadian Department of National Defense After World War II ended, dazzle and similar paint schemes quickly fell into disuse. Improved optics and radars increasingly rendered the patterns obsolete. The camouflage that Regina and Moncton are presently wearing, which is based on a World War II design known as the Western Approaches Color Scheme, would offer no defense against warships equipped with modern radars , as well as, long-range infrared surveillance and targeting systems . The current HMCS Regina , at bottom, sails alongside the HMCS Calgary , the latter of which is carrying the Royal Canadian Navy’s standard gray paint scheme., Canadian Forces Still, the dazzle paint schemes are an interesting reminder of what naval combat looked like during the first half of the last century and a great way to commemorate the achievements and sacrifices the Royal Canadian Navy made to safeguard the trans-Atlantic convoys that played an essential role in supplies Allied forces in crushing the Axis war machine in Europe.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2020",Iran’s Military Makes Batshit Claim That This Stupid Contraption Detects Coronavirus,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran claims that it has developed a “smart detector” that can confirm the presence of the virus at distances of almost 330 feet in seconds without the need to draw blood or even interact with a potentially sick individual. Unfortunately for the country, which has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the miracle medical device is clearly a fake that shares key features with infamous fake bomb detectors. This is just another example of the regime in Tehran making bizarrely farcical assertions about its technological, as well as military, achievements that border on outright comedy. Major General Hossein Salami, head of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), unveiled the supposed COVID-19 detector during a televised presentation in Tehran on Apr. 15, 2020. The “inventor” of the device, who is a member of the Basij , a paramilitary militia under the IRGC that often leads the violent suppression of internal dissent, was also present to demonstrate how it “works.” This individual also demonstrated the system at a hospital in Tehran, an event that was filmed as an obvious propaganda stunt. “This is an amazing scientific technique that has been tested across various hospitals,” Salami said, claiming that the detector had demonstrated its ability to accurately detect the presence of COVID-19 around 80 percent of the time. “The technology could set the basis for the detection of all kinds of viruses.” The detector purportedly works by somehow generating a magnetic field via a handheld circular “dish” that isn’t connected to anything, according to the IRGC’s commander. An antenna on a handheld wand and linked to a battery pack carried on the hip then somehow picks up the virus. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UPTfIoBhRCI If this was true, which it certainly is not and has no basis in scientific reality, the detector would be a welcome addition to the toolkit for combating the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. Officially, Iran has had 76,389 confirmed cases of individuals contracting the virus since the beginning of the year, 4,777 of which have died. However, the United States and others, including members of the country’s own parliament , have questioned the accuracy of those figures, which officials may be keeping low to try to deflect from the poor initial response to the pandemic and the growing strain it is having on Iran’s medical system. Criticism of the regime’s handling of the crisis has been growing in the country. In addition to the COVID-19 detector, the head of the Iranian military’s ground forces, Brigadier General Kiomars Heidari, separately announced this week that “a mega project for sterilizing cities and open areas” was underway. He also said the country’s Army was working to make fixed and mobile military hospitals available to the general populace to respond to the pandemic and was working on projects to produce masks and disinfectants. Whatever steps the Iranian government is actually taking, the IRGC’s virus detector is completely bogus. The BBC ‘s Shayan Sardarizadeh, who specializes in uncovering actual fake news and disinformation, pointed out in a series of Tweets on Apr. 15 that detector’s wand component had a collapsible antenna, similar to the one you might see on a portable radio. This is a key feature in a number of fake bomb detectors that hucksters have sold and re-sold across the Middle East, as well as other areas of the world, for years. In fact, the one on the supposed COVID-19 detector looks as if it might have been directly taken off one of two specific fake bomb detectors, the GT200 from U.K.-based Global Technical Limited and the Alpha 6 , which British couple Joan and Sam Tree made in a garden shed behind their home. Both of these were widely exported to the Middle East, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin America in the 2000s. In 2013, Gary Bolton, Global Technical’s own, was convicted of fraud in the United Kingdom and sentenced to seven years in jail. That same year, Samuel Tree received his own three-year sentence , while his wife Joan received a suspended sentence. James McCormick, the founder of U.K.-based Advanced Tactical Security & Communications Limited, which had sold another fake bomb detector with a collapsible antenna, the ADE-651 , also ended up with a 10-year jail term that year. Despite them being outed as fakes, and numerous countries officially banning their use, these devices, and repurposed and repacked versions and derivatives thereof, continue to pop up regularly, especially in the Middle East. A 2016 report that the Spanish military’s Counter Improvised Explosive Devices Center of Excellence put together for NATO identified no less than eight different brandings of collapsible antenna style fake bomb detectors in some form of circulation around the world. Iran’s COVID-19 detector itself might have been ever so very slightly more believable if the country’s authorities hadn’t unveiled an “ electronic fuel detector ” to catch fuel smugglers three years ago that is clearly the exact same bogus setup. Beyond that, the BBC ‘s Sardarizadeh pointed out that the Basij member behind the “new” virus spotting device was the exact same person responsible for “inventing” the supposed fuel detector. These fake devices have typically been marked as being able to detect the presence of various “substances” beyond explosives, including narcotics, which has led some to previously make claims that they could spot various other illnesses. In 2014, Egyptian officials similarly claimed that they had adopted a no-touch medical system called C-Fast to detect HIV/AIDS, hepatitis-C, and other serious ailments, which turned out to be yet another bogus device using a wand with a collapsible antenna. When it comes to Iran, specifically, the COVID-19 detector is just one of a number of absurd claims the country’s authorities have made in recent years about technological achievements in both the military and civilian sectors. Just this year, Iran’s Minister of Information and Communications Technology Tweeted out a picture supposedly of a prototype spacesuit for future Iranian astronauts. Iran watchers online quickly determined that it was a repurposed children’s Halloween costume , available online for around $20. Last year, the IRGC put up a mural to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution that implied Iran had invented the Space Shuttle. This is in addition to other infamous military examples, such as the laughable Qaher F-313 “stealth fighter” mockup and the repeated claims that the Kharg , a modified oil tanker with a helipad, is actually an aircraft carrier . Hopefully, for the sake of Iran’s citizens, the IRGC’s pathetic COVID-19 detector will remain a failed propaganda ploy and there will be no actual attempts to employ it test for possible cases of this very real and dangerous virus.

Aaron Amick,"Updated on May 15, 2020",Modern Submarine Torpedo Attacks Are Nothing Like What You See In The Movies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Most modern submarine-launched torpedoes are dual-purpose, meaning they are able to sink a ship or submarine, but they have different characteristics and methods for achieving those goals. Single-purpose torpedoes have a very specific method of attack and can be difficult to evade. In this article, we will cover the capabilities of both kinds of submarine-launched torpedoes and how they actually work, which is very different than what you have probably seen in the movies. Modern submarine torpedoes come in two variants: thermal and electric. Thermal torpedoes use a fuel, such as OTTO Fuel II , which can be burned without an external oxygen source. A gas turbine or axial piston engine converts this fuel into torque that spins counter-rotating propellers, propelling the torpedo up to speeds in excess of 60 knots. Higher speeds can be achieved if Hydroxylammonium Perchlorate (HAP) is injected during fuel combustion. A HAP boost gives thermal torpedoes a speed advantage over electric torpedoes. Thermal torpedoes can have a much longer-range at higher-speeds than their electric counterparts. Liquid fuel stores more energy and can be burned more efficiently in modern gas turbines engines, giving these lethal weapons the engagement range and speed required to hit any target from outside detection range. Gas turbine engines have replaced older external combustion, axial piston-driven engines in some modern torpedoes. The higher RPM of a gas turbine engine coupled with sound silencing modifications to the torpedo chassis and exhaust have made thermal torpedoes as quiet as the submarines that launch them. It is likely that if a modern torpedo uses passive sonar for homing, a target will never know it’s being attacked until just before it explodes. The propulsion section of a Chinese Yu-6 Torpedo. Note the counter-rotating propellers and the wire hanging out of its central hub., Public Domain Electric torpedoes are more common because they are easier to make, maintain, and are less risky to handle. They also have some capabilities thermal torpedoes do not. These high-torque, permanent magnet electric motor torpedoes ramp up to speed in under a second. They go from sitting in a torpedo tube to 50 knots in a near-instant because they don’t have the mechanical lag and inertia thermal torpedoes must overcome during startup. Another big advantage of electric torpedoes is that they can be modular in design, such as Germany’s DM2A4 Sea Hake Mod 4 torpedo. The batteries are connected in series allowing each weapon to have 2, 3, or 4 batteries. More batteries give the weapon more range. Fewer batteries make the weapon much lighter and more agile, but at the cost of range. Both can maintain 50 knots and, like modern thermal torpedoes, are very quiet. Atlas Electronik High energy zinc-oxygen Batteries and some types of energy cells are also used in submarine torpedoes today. They provide much more sustained power than standard electric batteries. Specific capabilities of high energy batteries are closely guarded secrets, but Israeli contractor Electric Fuel Limited has been working with Germany to develop heavyweight torpedo batteries since 1995 . Submarine movies such as Crimson Tide and Hunter Killer use torpedo chase scenes for dramatic effect. The reality is that a torpedo maneuvering and hunting submarines that are frantically trying to evade is the least likely scenario in a modern submarine attack. As already noted, in a 21st Century torpedo attack, the target will likely never know it’s about to be destroyed. Modern submarine torpedoes have sound silencing built into their design and, unless they use their active sonar modes, they may not be detected until the moment before detonation. A common event observed in naval exercises is two submarines passing within a few hundred meters of each other, detecting each other at the same time, and racing to get a shot off before the other. The other type of engagement is when one sub detects the other sooner, and often at range, resulting in a first shot, first kill. So, the underwater prolonged dogfights that are such beloved set pieces of modern submarine thrillers are just not the reality. Actual underwater combat occurs silently with very little reaction time to fend off an impending attack. In addition, many modern torpedoes have a command wire or fiber optic cable that reels out from behind the torpedo and establishes a data link with the submarine’s fire control system. Before a torpedo is launched, it must know three things: What are the torpedo’s course and depth after launch? At what range will it enable a search for a target? What are the kill box boundaries? With command wire capabilities, the weapon can change its attack geometry or even shut down if directed by the fire control operator. Detected targets can be changed, depth and range limitations can be set, and countermeasures, such as decoys and jammers, can be ignored using the submarine’s sonar data instead of the torpedo’s lower-fidelity onboard sonar data. If the data link is lost, the weapon will follow its last given command and execute pre-programmed countermeasure defeating profiles, if necessary. Virginia class SSN firing a Mk48 Mod6 torpedo. , Raytheon After launch, the weapon will do a short dive below the submarine, so the submarine doesn’t run into the command wire, potentially tangling it around the submarine’s sail and propeller. The wire or fiber optic cable is fed from a dispenser that is either mounted in the torpedo tube or from the torpedo feeding out as it moves through the water. In some cases, there is wire fed from a dispenser and the torpedo simultaneously. This decreases the chance of wire stretch or a break. The submarine’s fire control system has given the weapon digital boundaries, or a “kill box.” These boundaries are designed to prevent the weapon from attacking the firing platform or any other target outside the designated area. These boundaries shape a three-dimensional cube of water space and can be very large or small as determined by the Weapons Officer before firing. The torpedo will run out on a predetermined course and depth to the kill box. During this transit, the weapon is measuring ambient background noise and getting to its search depth, unless otherwise directed. It can calculate how strong it will transmit its high-frequency active sonar without reverb, distortion, or saturating detections with background echos.  During the search, the torpedo will lower its speed and its sonar transmit power level to maximize detection capabilities. This is especially critical in complex, shallow water, noisy, and icy environments. BAE Systems’ Spearfish heavyweight torpedo in profile and in action during a SINKEX drill. , BAE Systems When the weapon reaches this kill box, it activates its own sensors and begins hunting for a target. If the data link between the submarine and the torpedo is maintained, the fire control operator can change the size and dimensions of the kill box at any time. They can also manually steer or shut down the weapon on command.  If the weapon ever leaves the kill box, it will inert its warhead, shut down its engine, and sink to the bottom of the ocean. A torpedo cannot be ‘command-detonated’ as seen in the movie Hunt for Red October . It is possible for the firing platform—the submarine that fired the torpedo—to enter the kill box during a torpedo attack. If not shut down, the torpedo would consider it a valid target. Situational awareness is key during a torpedo attack to prevent this. During wargame exercises, submarines have crossed into their own kill boxes while evading counter-fire torpedoes. MM2 (SS) Joe Hackett inspects the MK 48 ADCAP torpedo for proper alignment as it enters the torpedo tube during exercise RIMPAC ’98., National Archives Torpedoes have three basic target detection methods: passive sonar, active sonar, and wake homing: Passive sonar simply listens for specific target noises generated by an expected foe or it can also home in on the loudest noise source detected. There are thresholds that must be exceeded before homing logic is enabled, but the passive mode is the most effective mode to surprise the target as the weapon is nearly undetectable outside very close-range. Older torpedoes will physically turn their rudder side to side giving the torpedo path a snake-like approach. This increases the search area the torpedo can see at the cost of speed and range. Modern torpedoes can digitally beamform their sonars in wide search arcs. This eliminates the need for physical maneuvering for scanning and allows for a more efficient search because the weapon will not lose speed making repeated small turns. Active sonar simply emits a sonar energy pulse at a high frequency. The transmit power level is determined by the background noise it measured after launch. It will search its kill box in the most efficient means possible. During an active attack, it is likely the target will employ sonar maskers and jammers. Countermeasure logic will filter through these jamming techniques, although how this is done is still secret. Wake Homing is becoming more common on dual-purpose torpedoes today. Both 53cm and 65cm torpedoes can have wake homing logic, but the 65cm wake homing torpedoes are single purpose and specifically designed for this kind of attack. 65cm Wake homing torpedoes, like the Russian 65-76A , are large long-range torpedoes designed to search for a ship’s wake and follow it. 65cm torpedoes have enough fuel to travel in excess of 100 kilometers at 50 knots for just over an hour. This makes evasion a very time-consuming affair, allowing the attack submarine time to evade and re-engage. There are ways to actively defeat a wake homing torpedo, but a salvo of this kind of weapon is a carrier killer . Terminal Homing is the final stage of the torpedo attack. Once the torpedo has detected a valid target, it will transmit the target location, speed, depth, and course back to the submarine’s fire control system. This data will be compared with the fire control solution. Unless otherwise directed, the weapon will enter terminal homing. Terminal homing is an active sonar ping that retransmits on reception becoming more rapid as the range to target closes at maximum speed. The active sonar transmission cycle becomes shorter in interval as the range closes, similar to a doomsday clock countdown. The target is alerted to the attack, but there is nothing it can do to defeat the weapon at this point. The weapon is too close and moving too fast to allow time for a countermeasure to be effective. Combination fusing is the most common in today’s torpedoes. This combines proximity fusing, which is both magnetic and measured distance, and contact fusing which detonates on physical impact. It is best if the weapon detonates within a meter of the hull, but a contact detonation can have devastating effects against even the largest warships. Modern submarine torpedoes are highly capable and amazingly lethal machines. Cold War science and experience has been improved with 21st-century technology and engineering. Torpedoes like the BAE Systems Spearfish , Atlas Electronik SeaHake Mod 4 , Naval Group’s F21 , and Russia’s UGST -M are examples of how far the technology has come. A potent cocktail of high-speed, lethality, long-range, and low-detectability give the modern torpedo attack a significant advantage over other naval weapons.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 10, 2019",Boeing Is Being Paid $84 Million Just For Manuals For New Air Force One Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Everything aviation is expensive. It’s just a fact. Everything military aviation is really expensive. That’s also an unfortunate fact. Everything military aviation related to flying the President is absolutely absurdly expensive . Another inconvenient fact. Yet it’s hard to swallow the price tag on the contract Boeing was just awarded by the Air Force for manuals for two new VC-25B Air Force One jets it is currently converting from orphaned 747-8i airframes. That price tag? A cool $84,000,000. Yes. You read that correctly. $84,000,000 for modified manuals to an upgraded airframe, the basis of which is in commercial service around the globe. We wouldn’t be fair if we didn’t lay the groundwork for just how unique the VC-25Bs will be compared to their commercial cousins. The aircraft will be outfitted with the most advanced defense countermeasures system on earth. It will be hardened against electromagnetic pulses caused by detonating nuclear warheads. It will have the most advanced secure airborne communications system of its kind and it will be outfitted with a unique interior, filled not only with creature comforts, but also with the subsystems needed to cool and sustain the people and the missionized equipment it hosts onboard. These aircraft are also likely to have unique areas of the 747-8i’s flight envelope explored for specific maneuvers that will be operationally unique to them, such as abbreviated, steep takeoffs and landings, and procedures for maneuvering the aircraft if it were to come under attack . Finally, the manuals, or at least some of them, will be secret, so they have to be developed and printed under those conditions, which is never a cheap proposition. Even with all that in mind, we are still talking about $84,000,000 worth of flight manuals here for two jets derived from an existing sub-type, which itself is derived from a design that has been flying for roughly half a century, which the VC-25B’s predecessor, VC-25A , is based on. So, it isn’t exactly unfamiliar terrain we are talking about here. President Trump in front of one of two VC-25As that currently serve in the role of Air Force One. , AP The contract award announcement reads : The Boeing Co., Seattle, Washington, has been awarded an $84,000,000 firm-fixed-price contract modification (P00068) to previously awarded contract FA8625-16-C-6599 for VC-25B technical publications.  This contract modification is to modify commercial manuals, update with VC-25B-specific information and deliver integrated manuals for the VC-25B system.  This includes manuals developed by both Boeing and their subcontractors.  Work will be performed in Seattle, Washington, and is expected to be complete by Jan. 15, 2025.  Fiscal 2019 and 2020 research and development funds in the amount of $13,572,333 are being obligated at the time of award.  This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity. It is hard to really get one’s head around the fiscal scale of the Air Force One recapitalization program. the program’s total price tag, including things like new hangars and other ancillary items, comes in at $5.3B. The aircraft themselves will cost $4.7B, making them the most expensive planes ever made. This runs counter to the claims by President Trump that he personally slashed the cost of the jets. You can read more about this cost breakdown here . The entire program has become a hot topic during Trump’s first term in office, starting from before he was even inaugurated . You can actually see the briefing he was originally given on the program in this past War Zone exclusive . Later on, the cost became just one facet of the controversy. Trump’s move to change the aircraft’s historic livery with one he saw more fitting caused arguably even a bigger stir. Other elements of the program, including the fact that these new and highly expensive airframes won’t have aerial refueling capability like their predecessors, have also raised some eyebrows. VC-25B Air Force One in its new Trump specified livery. , DoD As for the cost of the manuals, they seem almost unimaginably expensive, but the reality is that the documentation that supports military systems is anything but cheap. For instance, structural repair manuals for the P-8 Poseidon cost the Navy $30M. A technical manual for the Husky mine detection vehicle cost nearly $14M. Still, $84M is a major chunk of change for documentation of anything, even the most expensive airplanes ever built. In the end, it’s just safe to say that every facet of moving the President around has become mind-blowingly expensive. Hat tip to Marcus Weisgerber for the heads up on the contract announcement!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released video and pictures of Iranian speedboat-type craft harassing its ships, including the expeditionary sea base USS Lewis B. Puller , as well as vessels from the U.S. Coast Guard, in the Persian Gulf. Approximately 11 of the watercraft, belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, swarmed the group of vessels, which were training with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters at the time. The incident took place on Apr. 15, 2020 in international waters, according to a statement from U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, or NAVCENT. In addition to Puller , the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton , the Cyclone class patrol craft USS Firebolt and USS Sirocco , and the Island class patrol cutters USCGC Wrangell and USCGC Maui were also on the scene at the time. “The IRGCN [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy] vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds, including multiple crossings of the Puller with a 50 yard closest point of approach (CPA) and within 10 yards of Maui ‘s bow,” according to NACVENT’s statement. “The U.S. crews issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio, five short blasts from the ships’ horns and long-range acoustic noise maker devices, but received no response from the IRGCN.” Iranian speedboats circling around the USS Lewis B. Puller on Apr. 15, 2020., USN USN USN USN One of the US Coast Guard’s Island class cutters, possibly the USCGC Maui , encircled by Iranian speedboats., USN USN USN An Iranian speedboat circles around the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton ., USN USN USN “After approximately one hour, the IRGCN vessels responded to the bridge-to-bridge radio queries, then maneuvered away from the U.S. ships and opened distance between them,” the statement continued. “The IRGCN’s dangerous and provocative actions increased the risk of miscalculation and collision, were not in accordance with the internationally recognized Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) ‘rules of the road’ or internationally recognized maritime customs, and were not in accordance with the obligation under international law to act with due regard for the safety of other vessels in the area.” It’s unclear if this image just has a processing error or if the foreground was redacted for some reason., USN USN USN USN As the Navy notes, in addition to the simple danger of collisions with the Iranian boats as they went speeding around the American vessels, the provocative maneuvers raised the risk of dangerous miscalculations as they are what one might expect to see in a swarming boat attack. In December 2019, Iranian media claimed to have successfully challenged the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships from her strike group as they passed through the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz. The Navy subsequently confirmed to The War Zone that a large number of its boats had sailed near the ships during the transit, but said that this was “within normal behavior patterns for Iran.” The reason why Army Apaches train to operate from ships like Puller , in the first place, is, in part, to be able to respond to exactly these kinds of attacks. You can read more about this Army-Navy training, which has been going on since March, in this recent War Zone piece . In March, an Air Force AC-130W Stinger II gunship also took part in a training exercise with Navy ships and aircraft in the Persian Gulf, again specifically to work on tactics, techniques, and procedures to respond to small boat attacks. Air Force A-10 Warthog attack aircraft have regularly trained in the past to perform similar maritime missions and, last year, the War Zone first reported on photos showing that service’s F-15E Strike Eagles carrying cluster munitions, an ideal weapon for engaging boat swarms, while on patrol over the Persian Gulf. The threat of Iranian small boat attacks, or the IRGC using those craft to conduct hostile boardings, is very real. There were unconfirmed reports that the IRGC had briefly seized the Hong Kong-flagged tanker SC Taipei in the Gulf of Oman just yesterday . Armed men reportedly board that ship and directed it to move to an area close to the Iranian coast, before releasing it later in the day. At the time of writing, no group has claimed responsibility for the incident and there is no official word from the owners or operators of the SC Taipei , or international maritime organizations, as to who carried out the boarding operation. In July 2019, the IRGC notably seized control of the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero in response to the United Kingdom detaining one of Iranian supertanker. This was just one of a number of ships Iran seized last year . The U.S. government has also blamed the regime in Tehran for a string of attacks on commercial oil tankers. Iran has a long history of harassing U.S. military vessels, specifically, in the Persian Gulf, as well, but reported incidents had notably dropped off in recent years. Since tensions first spiked between the United States and Iran in May 2019, however, there has been an increase in various forms of Iranian provocations throughout the region, including in the Gulf of Oman, as well. This included the IRGC’s shootdown of a Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk drone over the Gulf of Oman last June, which was followed by U.S. Marines aboard the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxe r bringing down an Iranian drone in the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz the following month. This is not to mention a host of incidents on land throughout the Middle East over the past 18 months that the United States blames Iran or its regional proxies. This includes unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile strikes on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure in September 2019 and the equally unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at U.S. forces in Iraq in January 2020. The latter was in retaliation for the U.S. government’s decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad that same month. Iranian proxies in Iraq continue to launch their own rocket attacks, which have been a regular occurrence in Iraq for months, provoking American counterattacks . It’s unclear what has necessarily provoked this latest incident between U.S. and Iranian forces, but it comes as the United States has continued its campaign of maximum pressure against the regime in Tehran. This includes crippling sanctions, the impacts of which have been even more pronounced in recent months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This virus has hit Iran particularly hard and the country has experienced trouble securing medical and other aid due to U.S. and international sanctions. The pandemic has also reportedly increased criticism of the regime within Iran and experts have warned that this could drive authorities in Tehran to seek drastic ways to distract from a domestic situation. Whatever the case, the incident clearly shows that tensions, as well as the risk of conflict, between the United States and Iran remain high, even amidst the pandemic.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 22, 2020",Russia Releases Terrifying Video Of Superjet Airliner Drifting To A Stop In A Ball Of Flames,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New footage has emerged of the harrowing crash landing of a Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner last year, which resulted in the deaths of 41 people on board and left 10 more injured. The video was part of the materials that the committee responsible for investigating the accident collected and forwarded to state prosecutors. Those officials have now formally charged Aeroflot pilot Denis Evdokimov with criminal negligence leading to the fatalities and the destruction of the aircraft. The accident occurred on May 9, 2019, at Russia’s Sheremetyevo airport, which is situated just outside Moscow and is the primary airport serving the country’s capital. The Superjet 100, operating at the time as Aeroflot Flight 1492, suffered a lightning strike shortly after taking off, which caused an electrical failure. Denis Evdokimov and his co-pilot Maxim Kuznetsov then made the decision to return to Sheremetyevo and make an emergency landing. The Superjet 100 bounced during the landing attempt and came down hard again, causing the landing gear to collapse. The aircraft then went skidding down the edge of the runway, damaging the wings, after which a fire erupted as fuel spilled from the wing tanks. The entire rear section of the aircraft ultimately burned away, making it a total loss. Video and pictures had emerged of the accident at the time, but the new footage offers by far the most detailed and terrifying look at the tragedy to date. In the new video, which appears to have been shot from a fixed camera inside the airport, Flight 1492 slides into a view and comes to a stop, already engulfed in flames. Some 17 seconds after the aircraft comes to rest, the flight crew opens the right front main cabin door and deploys an emergency slide. Around 13 seconds after that, they deploy the slide on the opposite side of the plane. A total of 37 passengers and crew escaped unscathed, including the 10 who were injured. Two airport crash trucks then arrive and begin dousing the plane in firefighting foam as people continue to evacuate the plane. The video very notably edits out the moment, seen in the video below, at which Kuznetsov, the co-pilot, emerged from a cockpit window and then jumped to safety. He then climbed up one of the emergency slides to get back into the aircraft to help save the remaining people onboard. There have been conflicting reports about whether Evdokimov, the pilot, was also helping people inside at the time or was in need of saving himself. The investigators, who first filed their charges in October 2019, accuse Evdokimov of neglecting to follow established flight rules and procedures, resulting in him bringing the aircraft in at too steep an angle and causing the crash. Reports at the time indicated that the aircraft’s pitch fluctuated significantly before the landing attempt. The pilot could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. Evdokimov’s legal team denies the charges and says that the electrical failure made the Superjet 100 difficult to control and that emergency personnel on the ground were slow to respond. Russian investigators claim they found no evidence of any aircraft malfunction and have rejected criticism of first responders, as well as air traffic controllers, at Sheremetyevo. The committee also looked into the possibility of poor maintenance and weather as contributing factors, but say they did not play a role, either. A picture of the remains of Aeroflot Flight 1492 after the crash., Russian Investigative Committee Russian Investigative Committee Last year, Aeroflot publicly denied that Evdokimov had violated company procedures in the setting of flaps and deployment of spoilers during the landing attempt. The company has also already agreed to pay compensation to both the surviving passengers and the families of those who died. It’s worth noting that the edit in the new video makes it impossible to determine the exact time between when the aircraft came to a stop and when the crash trucks first arrived on the scene. The video does further confirm that some passengers escaped with their luggage, which may have slowed down the evacuation process. Airlines around the world advise passengers to leave their bags behind in an emergency for this exact reason. It’s also worth noting that a Yakutia Airlines Superjet 100 had also gone skidding off the runway after its landing gear collapsed while landing at Yakutsk Airport in Oct. 10, 2018. The entire crew and all 87 passengers survived that accident, which also left the plane beyond repair. Ice on the runway was later blamed as a contributing factor . However, in June 2019, Vladislav Filev, one of the owners of S7, Russia’s second-biggest airline group and head of the Aerospace Subcommittee of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, publicly questioned the Super 100’s safety, specifically pointing to the two landing gear collapses and position of the aircraft’s wing fuel tanks. “There are rumors that the [Yakutia] investigation found a fuel leakage [due to collapsed gear],” Filev said at the time . At the time of writing, the findings of any investigation into the Yakutsk crash do not appear to have been made public. The Superjet 100, which made its first flight in 2008, has suffered four crashes, in total, including the one at Sheremetyevo and the one in Yakutsk. In 2012, one of the airliners struck Mount Salak in Indonesia during a demonstration flight and the following year another one, carrying an experimental registration, accidentally made a gear-up landing at Keflavík Airport in Iceland. Pilot error was determined to be the primary factor in both of those other two crashes. Russia has heavily promoted the Superjet 100, the first clean-sheet airliner developed in the country after the fall of the Soviet Union, as an alternative to comparable western types. To date, Sukhoi has made more than 170 of the aircraft, which are now in service with 17 different airlines and government organizations in Russia and other countries. At least one Russian airline, RusLine, canceled its order for Superjet 100s after the Sheremetyevo crash. More details and claims about the fiery accident at Sheremetyevo last year are likely to continue to emerge as Evdokimov case progresses through the Russian legal system.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 31, 2020","The Pentagon’s Plan To Build A Secret Super Command Bunker 3,500 Feet Under Washington D.C.","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust the topic of “ continuity of government ,” plans in place to ensure critical elements of the U.S. government can keep functioning in the midst of an extreme crisis, back into the general public consciousness. It has also sparked renewed interest in the hardened, underground facilities where those personnel would work, such as the U.S. military’s “underground Pentagon” at Raven Rock, which you can read about more in this past War Zone feature . Had the U.S. government made different decisions during the Cold War, some of these teams might be sheltering inside a massive, very deeply buried bunker unlike any on earth, intended to shrug off direct impacts from nuclear bombs with huge yields of hundreds of megatons. In January 1962, Charles Hitch, then the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), sent a memorandum regarding a proposed Deep Underground Command Center (DUCC) to then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The plan was to construct “a ‘superhard’ command post easily accessible to the NCA [National Command Authority] and designed for minimum dislocation or interruption of official routines,” according to an official U.S. military historical review of command and control architecture from 1960 to 1977. The National Command Authority refers to the highest possible source of orders for American forces, the only mechanism by which a nuclear strike can be ordered, which consists of the President and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the approved deputies that would take their place if either of them were to be killed or otherwise incapacitated. “The center could include an office where people, such as yourself, could conveniently spend a day every week or two to conduct business almost as usual and be in a position to assume National Command in the event of a no-warning attack on Washington,” Hitch wrote to McNamara. It’s not entirely clear where the DUCC proposal first originated. A 1975 study of the evolution of U.S. strategic command, control, and early warning capabilities that the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA) think tank had conducted for the Department of Defense, said it made “no attempt … to track the origins and development of the idea.” IDA’s researchers did note they had located a document that personnel within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)’s Programming Office had prepared ahead of Hitch’s memo to McNamara. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara at Fort Bragg in North Carolina in 1961., White House IDA had also found consistencies in the design parameters between the DUCC and a U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) proposal for a Deep Underground Support Center (DUSC). SAC had also explored the DUSC concept in 1962, the year after it began building the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station bunker complex under the mountain of the same name, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . The U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) had also considered building extremely hardened Super Combat Centers in the late 1950s to house ground-controlled interception systems, known as the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE), which you can read about more in-depth in this previous War Zone piece . NORAD had canceled those plans in 1960. Whatever the actual source of the DUCC plan was, it is clear that the driving factor was the increasing capabilities of Soviet nuclear weapons, especially with regards to their yields. The Soviet Union had tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1953, years earlier than U.S. intelligence agencies had expected and raising concerns about the vulnerability of existing alternate command and control centers. Repeated hits in the same general area from nuclear weapons with yields in the hundreds of megatons range, or the simultaneous detonation of barrages of smaller weapons producing equivalent total yields, not to mention from potential bunker-buster designs able to penetrate dozens of feet down into the earth first, could pose a danger to hardened structures buried even hundreds of feet underground. McNamara and other proponents also pointed out that this made other above-ground strategic command and control nodes extremely vulnerable, as well. In 1961, the U.S. military had already begun to implement the National Mission Command System (NMCS), which included two bunkers, a hardened National Military Command Center at the Pentagon and an Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC). The ANMCC would be an upgrade to the existing Alternate Joint Communications Center (AJCC), a facility technically part of Fort Ritchie in Maryland, but which was housed inside the Raven Rock Mountain Complex (RRMC), also referred to as Site R, across the border with Pennsylvania under the Appalachian Mountains near Blue Ridge Summit. The Department of Defense had finished building Raven Rock in 1953. A satellite image of what can be seen of Raven Rock Mountain Complex from the air. Two entrances to the underground bunker complex are visible along the upper left portion of the snaking road., Google Earth In the 1950s and the early 1960s, the U.S. government had built numerous other bunker complexes in addition to Raven Rock for continuity of government purposes, including the aforementioned Cheyenne Mountain facility, as well as the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. The White House and the Presidential retreat at Camp David both have underground bunkers and, until 1992, there was a bunker complex situated near the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia intended to house Congress. However, none of these were specifically associated with the NMCS infrastructure. The NMCS wasn’t limited to hardened underground facilities, either. It also included plans for a National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) and the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (NECPA). The first NEACP aircraft were modified KC-135B aerial refueling tankers with expanded communication suites and were in service by 1963. These aircraft, which were eventually redesignated as EC-135Js, were similar, in concept, to SAC’s EC-135A and EC-135C Looking Glass airborne command posts, which entered service around the same time. In 1962, the U.S. Navy had begun deploying smaller EC-130 Take Charge and Move Out ( TACAMO ) aircraft to serve as command posts to communicate with its ballistic missile submarines, in addition to land-based long-range communications sites, but these were not considered to be part of the high-level NMCS infrastructure. One of the EC-135J aircraft, now on display at the Pima Air and Space Museum in Arizona., Pima Air and Space Museum The Navy did contribute ships for the NECPA fleet. The service heavily modified the Oregon City class heavy cruiser USS Northampton and the Saipan class light aircraft carrier USS Wright to serve as strategic command ships, which entered service in 1962 and 1963, respectively. These two vessels had then-state-of-the-art communications suites and The Washington Post once described Northampton specifically as a “ floating White House ,” where the President and their closet advisors could operate from for protracted periods of time. You will be able to read all about these ships in an upcoming War Zone feature. The USS Northampton , at left, and the USS Wright , at right, in their National Emergency Command Post Afloat configurations., USN “Studies indicate that the fixed facilities of this complex [the NMCS] and their communications could be eliminated with reasonably high probability by a small number (6-10) of 10 megaton weapons, resulting in only the aircraft and the ships surviving,” according to a draft memorandum from McNamara’s office meant for then-President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 7, 1963. “The aircraft, operating on ground alert at Andrews [Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.], would require 10 to 15 minutes to become airborne and another 10 minutes to fly beyond the lethal range of a 50 MT weapon if airburst over Andrews. The ship is 30 to 60 minutes flying time from Washington. Both times are in excess of the upper limit of expected tactical warning.” A portion of the 1963 pitch for the DUCC from the Office of the Secretary of Defense., DOD It’s also important to remember that this memorandum came just over a year after the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, where the United States and the Soviet Union had gotten worrying close to an actual nuclear exchange. This had served to highlight the concerns about the vulnerabilities within existing continuity of government plans that had prompted the DUCC proposal, to begin with. In contrast to the existing and planned components of the NMSC, the DUCC concept envisioned a bunker complex situated around 3,500 feet, or two-thirds of a mile, underground. Experts had judged this to be the necessary depth to survive multiple hits from nuclear weapons in the 100 to 200 megaton range bursting on the surface or from weapons with yields up to 100 megatons capable of penetrating between 70 and 100 feet down into the ground first. SAC’s DUSC proposal had also called for a command and control center buried 3,500 feet below ground in order to withstand a 100 megaton weapon detonating on the surface anywhere within 0.5 nautical miles from the spot above ground directly above the center of the facility. It’s worth noting that the most powerful nuclear weapon ever built, the Soviet Union’s Tsar Bomba, of which it only ever built one , had a yield of 50 megatons. However, it’s clear that senior U.S. officials, such as McNamara, feared that this weapon, which the Soviets tested in 1961, was a prelude to the widespread use of such high-yield designs. The 1963 memorandum does not say where exactly the DUCC would be located, but, plans from McNamara’s office showed it was to have been buried under the Potomac River, which lies roughly halfway between the Pentagon and the White House, according to Raven Rock : The U.S. Government’s Secret Plan To Save Itself While The Rest Of Us Die . In something out of a James Bond movie, key personnel from the Pentagon, as well as the White House and State Department, would be able to enter it by way of elevators and an underground rapid transit system. The elevators would have discreet entrances, allowing designated individuals to make a break for the bunker undetected, straight from their offices. The elevators and transit system would allow personnel to get into the tunnel networks thousands of feet below within 10 minutes and into the actual DUCC itself within 15 minutes. A map showing the locations of, left to right, the Pentagon, the State Department’s headquarters, and the White House. The DUCC would have been located underground somewhere between these buildings underneath the Potomac River., Google Maps “It would have the potential of reducing significantly the problems of transition from peace to war,” McNamara wrote of the DUCC plan. “The very existence of a DUCC would also contribute in a major way to the broad objective of deterrence of enemy attack by making a survivable control posture credible and by creating the impression of a strong will to fight.” The DUCC would also be self-sufficient, with individuals inside being able to live there for at least 30 days after a massive nuclear strike. The design would be scalable, with an initial “austere size” of 10,000 square feet capable of supporting 50 individuals and the ability to expand that to “moderate” dimensions of 100,000 square feet to accommodate 300 personnel. SAC’s DUSC plan had called for a 40,000-square-foot complex capable of supporting 213 people for a similar amount of time. “The DUCC proposal was controversial and raised many questions, including the technical-engineering feasibility and costs, the elements of the NMCS that it might displace, and the command authorities who might be included in it (the JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] were among those scheduled to be included if it ever came to pass),” according to IDA’s 1975 study. In 1963, McNamara’s office had estimated that the “austere” DUCC would cost $110 million, almost $928 million in 2020 dollars, between the 1965 and 1969 Fiscal Years, almost $760 million of which would be for construction alone. The cost of the full 300-person bunker complex was pegged at $310 million, or around $2.6 billion in 2020 dollars. A breakdown of basic details about the “austere” and “moderate size” DUCC concepts, including cost, as of November 1963., DOD A more detailed breakdown of the costs associated with the “austere” DUCC plan., DOD Beyond that, “order-of-magnitude estimates of 5,000-10,000 psi [pounds per square inch of pressure] hardening against 100-megaton weapons, for example, were based on theoretical calculations and were received in some quarters as speculations,” IDA’s researchers noted. “Even if the basic DUCC capsule could be built to survive direct hits, questions of communications coupling and lifeline logistics remained formidable.” Even if the DUCC bunker itself was feasible, there were questions about whether associated communications infrastructure could ever be robust enough to ensure that it would function as intended in the aftermath of a massive Soviet nuclear strike. While the complex itself might be able to survive repeated hits from weapons with yields of hundreds of megatons, it would still need some sort of links to the outside world. Its depth would preclude direct wireless communications to other command and control nodes and force it to rely on cable networks to at least reach transmitters on the surface, or at least close to it. Extremely low-frequency communications arrays, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , which are themselves largely buried underground, might have provided a more hardened option, and remain in service in the United States and elsewhere for this very reason. Unfortunately, they have extremely limited bandwidth, inherently preventing them from sending any sort of complex message. It’s not entirely clear how it happened exactly, but the DUCCs proposal did not come to fruition. Less than two weeks after the Office of the Secretary of Defense completed its final draft of the plan to send to the White House, Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy during a visit to Dallas, Texas. Under President Lyndon Johnson, McNamara, with support from National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy and the State Department, continued to plan for the bunker complex as part of planning for the Fiscal Year 1965 budget. However, the House Armed Services Committee refused to fund the Pentagon’s entire DUCC request for that fiscal cycle, according to the book Raven Rock . The more pressing needs of the Vietnam War were also a contributing factor. Before the end of 1965, Johnson finally shot the entire project down, according to Spurgeon Keeny, Jr, who served as the President’s Science Adviser under Dwight Eisenhower, as well as Kennedy and Johnson. He was also a member of the National Security Council during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Johnson’s “view of nuclear war was brought home to me by his reaction at the final meeting in 1965 on the military budget to an item listed as DUCCS. In response to his question as to what this was, he was told it stood for Deep Underground Command and Control Site, a facility that would be located several thousand feet underground, between the White House and the Pentagon, designed to survive a ground burst of a 20-megaton bomb and sustain the president and key advisers for several months until it would be safe to exit through tunnels emerging many miles outside Washington,” wrote in an article in the October 2006 edition of the Arms Control Association’s Arms Control Today magazine. “After a brief puzzled expression, Johnson let loose with a string of Johnsonian expletives making clear he thought this was the stupidest idea he had ever heard and that he had no intention of hiding in an expensive hole while the rest of Washington and probably the United States were burned to a crisp. That was the last I ever heard of DUCCS.” President Lyndon Johnson, at left, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, at right, during a cabinet meeting in 1968., National Archives Whether Keeny’s recollection was apocryphal or not, it is clear that the DUCC concept had already faced an at best lukewarm response from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the individual U.S. military services. SAC had given up on its own DUSC bunker plans by the end of 1963 and decided to proceed with an entirely airborne emergency command and control strategy centered on its EC-135 fleets instead. DUSC had run into its own cost problems, with estimates growing from $100 million to $200 million – just under $844 million to close to $1.7 billion in 2020 dollars – and the estimated date for when SAC could begin using the facility got pushed back from 1965 to 1969. “Economic considerations favored a construction site in a deep mine near Cripple Creek, Colo., but SAC found the location too remote from its main headquarters and operationally disadvantageous for continuity,” according to IDA’s 1975 review. The use of an abandoned mine shaft in the plan has since evoked references to the “mineshaft gap” scene from the famous Cold War dark comedy Dr. Strangelove , which came out in 1964. Still, without something like DUCC, concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. strategic command and control facilities persisted. There were proposals to use anti-ballistic missile systems to help guard existing command and control infrastructure. “Throughout the years prior to 1968, the option of seeking to protect national authorities and the NMCS by means of an active ABM defense system remained a hypothetical possibility,” according to IDA’s 1975 study. “Both the Nike-Zeus system of the late 1950s and the Nike-X system of the 1960s had been perennial JCS recommendations for deployment as active defense systems, justified primarily in terms of what McNamara called ‘damage limitation,’ i.e., protection of US population and industry. Protection of government and military command and control centers, when it was mentioned at all, was put forward as a distinctly secondary and presumably not decisive mission.” “It was not until the Safeguard program was advanced by the Nixon administration, based on active ABM defense of strategic offensive forces, that protection of command and control was made a high priority mission for ABM defense,” the report continued. Safeguard , which began in 1969, was aimed at providing a defensive shield for the Air Force’s Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fields . The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , which President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed in 1972, severely curtailed strategic ABM system deployment by both countries. It marked the beginning of the end for Safeguard, which ceased operations in 1976, less than a year after it had first entered service. The fixed Missile Site Radar (MSR), at right, at the Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex, the only facility that was completed before the program’s termination. An underground command and control bunker sat underneath the radar and the above-ground portions of its powerplant, which ensured self-sufficient operation, are seen at the left., Library of Congress The NMCS had begun to go through its own changes in the 1970s, as well. In 1970, the Navy decommissioned both USS Northampton and USS Wright , bringing the NECPA mission to an end. In the early 1970s, the Air Force began the process of replacing the three EC-135J National Emergency Airborne Command Post aircraft with three more capable Boeing 747-based E-4A Advanced Airborne Command Post planes. With all this in mind, the topic of a new DUCC project came up against at least once in the late 1970s as part of a report from the Defense Communications Agency on requirements for the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) in the post-1985 timeframe. “A deeply buried command and control center for the National Military Command System (NMCS) is an attractive option, based on an evaluation of performance, survivability, and cost,” a 1978 separate report from the Defense Nuclear Agency explained, citing the WWMCCS study. The Defense Nuclear Agency’s report had to do with testing of various types of structures, including tunnels and boreholes for armored communications cables, under laboratory conditions ahead an underground test of a W87 warhead , known as shot Diablo Hawk, which was part of Operation Cresset . Diablo Hawk’s primary goal was to observe the effects of the W87, with its yield of approximately 300 kilotons, in a tunnel, which also offered a good opportunity to test the effects of a large nuclear explosion on structural features that would be found on a deeply buried hardened facility. The W87 was the warhead employed on the LGM-118A Peacemaker ICBM , before its retirement, and remains in use on the LGM-30G Minuteman III . A description of the DUCC communication link concept that informed the testing around Diablo Hawk., DNA While testing around Diablo Hawk provided valuable data for a new DUCC project, there is no indication that the U.S. military ever pursued building one. The improving accuracy of Soviet, and now Russian, nuclear-armed missiles has only made the idea of developing a bunker able to withstand repeated hits during a nuclear exchange more difficult, if not impossible. The vast majority of what is known about the U.S. military’s strategic command and control infrastructure remains largely unchanged in its basic principles from how it operated in the 1960s. With the exception of the Greenbrier resort, all of the other bunker complexes mentioned in this story remain active . Raven Rock and Cheyenne Mountain have also received notable upgrades to their capabilities over the years. There are a number of other hardened facilities available to support continuity of government operations, as well, spread out on the East Coast of the United States. In addition, airborne command and control centers remain at the core of how the National Command Authority would communicate with the elements of the U.S. nuclear triad during a major crisis. In the 1980s, the E-4As were upgraded into E-4B National Airborne Operations Centers and a fourth plane was added to the fleet. All four of these aircraft remain in service today. In the late 1980s, the E-6A Hermes, later renamed the E-6A Mercury, also took over the TACAMO role from the Navy’s previous EC-130-based platforms. In the 1990s, the Mercury fleet was upgraded into the E-6B configuration and supplanted the Air Force’s EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft, as well. The Air Force is now working on acquiring a replacement for the E-4Bs , which could also supplant other airborne command post and VVIP aircraft, such as the E-6Bs and C-32A Air Force Twos , respectively. Still, even though the idea of building a super-hardened DUCC remains as ambitious today as it did in the 1960s, it’s fascinating to think about how the United States almost built what might have been the best-protected underground base more than a half a mile underneath the Washington, D.C. area.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 7, 2020",Watch Boeing’s F-15QA For Qatar Make A Spectacular “Viking Takeoff” On Its First Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has conducted the first flight of the advanced F-15QA fighter jet for the Qatar Emiri Air Force. Chief Test Pilot Matt Giese started the flight test off in spectacular fashion with a so-called “Viking takeoff,” which involves climbing at an extremely high angle at full afterburner to rapidly gain altitude. On Apr. 14, 2020, the Chicago-headquartered planemaker announced the first flight of the F-15QA variant – the “QA” standing for “Qatar Advanced” – which took place around Lambert International Airport in St. Louis, Missouri. Boeing says the aircraft demonstrated its agility with both the Viking takeoff and other maneuvers, some of which involved pulling up to 9 Gs, over the course of the 90-minute test. “This successful first flight is an important step in providing the QEAF [Qatar Emiri Air Force] an aircraft with best-in-class range and payload,” Prat Kumar, a Boeing Vice President and the company’s F-15 program manager, said in a statement. “The advanced F-15QA not only offers game-changing capabilities, but is also built using advanced manufacturing processes which make the jet more efficient to manufacture. In the field, the F-15 costs half the cost per flight hour of similar fighter aircraft and delivers far more payload at far greater ranges. That’s success for the warfighter.” Qatar signed a contract to buy 36 F-15QAs, via the U.S. military’s Foreign Military Sales program, in 2017. At the time, Bloomberg said the total price tag for the fighter jets, along with associated equipment and support services, was around $12 billion. In its press release regarding the first flight, Boeing said it had received $6.2 billion via a U.S. Department of Defense contract, but did not say if this was the total value of the sale. Derived from the F-15SA, or “Saudi Advanced,” variant for Saudi Arabia, Boeing is billing the F-15QA as the most advanced production version of its F-15 Eagle series to date. The QAs have a number of features already found on the SA, including an integrated AN/AAS-42 Tiger Eyes infrared search and track (IRST) system, and two additional underwing pylons. Those extra pylons notably allow the jets to carry up to 16 AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) at once. Boeing also says the F-15QAs will have fly-by-wire flight capability, a robust digital electronic warfare suite, and the “world’s fastest mission computer,”  which are also found on the SAs. Instead of the Raytheon AN/APG-63(V)3 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar on the Saudi variants, the F-15QAs will have the AN/APG-82(V)1 , another Raytheon AESA that U.S. Air Force already uses on its F-15E Strike Eagles and Israel also picked as an upgrade for its F-15Is. This radar is part of a proposed “ Japanese Super Interceptor ” upgrade package for Japan’s F-15Js. However, the Qatar Advanced jets have unique features, as well. This includes a completely redesigned glass cockpit with a new heads up display from BAE systems. This is in addition to the single, large, customizable flat-screen displays that replace earlier arrays of multiple multi-function displays and older “steam gauge” instrument readouts in both the front and rear cockpits. You can read more about these cockpit updates and the improved capabilities they offer in this previous War Zone piece . The F-15QAs also feature a new structural design for the wing, a major improvement that makes it stronger without compromising its aerodynamics. Boeing has also proposed this wing as a life-extension upgrade for existing F-15 operators. “We are very proud of this accomplishment and looking forward with great excitement to the continued successes of this program,” Qatari Colonel Ahmed Al Mansoori, who is in charge of the F-15 program for the QEAF, said in a statement. “This successful first flight is an important milestone that brings our squadrons one step closer to flying this incredible aircraft over the skies of Qatar.” The QAEF plans to replace its aging French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets with the new advanced F-15s. Beyond that. the acquisition remains geopolitically significant for Qatar, which remains locked in a serious political dispute with a number of other countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The announcement that the U.S. had approved the sale of the jets to the Qatari government came just months after the spat first erupted in 2017. The Qatari contract is also important for Boeing and its F-15 production line and the design improvements on the F-15QA, as well as the F-15SA, will help inform the development of the new F-15EX variant for the U.S. Air Force. You can read more about the F-15EX and its origins in these past War Zone stories . At the moment, though, Boeing looks to be making good progress on the F-15QA, deliveries of which to Qatar are scheduled to start either later this year or early next year.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Our account and its accompanying gallery of private pilot Gabriel Zeifman’s somewhat astonishing flight through the usually highly restricted Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), which includes shadowy bases like Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport , and the Nevada Test Site , where hundreds of nuclear weapons were tested , drew fascination from readers all over the globe. Now Gabriel has shared additional images of his adventures over the NTTR that are pretty spectacular in their own right and they include the best photos I have seen of a very popular location in UFO lore, Papoose Lake. Located just to the southwest of Area 51, this is the place where Bob Lazar claims of having reversed engineered flying saucers in the 1980s while working inside a camouflaged facility called S-4 that was built into the side of a mountain. No, I don’t believe Bob’s story, but I do think that it is one of the most entertaining tales ever told and it has continued to capture imaginations for decades . I wasn’t thinking of Bob Lazar or “S-4” when I wrote my story on Gabriel’s flying adventure, but after I published it, I was swarmed with emails and direct messages asking if he had any pictures of Papoose Lake. Aside from satellite images, no direct photos of the area in question are known to exist, that is until now. The most impressive part of his route through the NTTR was the turn to the west, just south of the infamous impenetrable “box” of airspace that surrounds the clandestine flight test facility located at Groom Lake. This part of his flight took him directly over Papoose Lake and the hill that Lazar famously claimed had camouflaged hangar doors built into the side of it to hide from 1980s imaging satellite technology. Although Gabriel didn’t take any pictures of this area on the flight we discussed in our previous article, he did on a previous excursion with a less capable camera. Groom Lake and Area 51 to the north, and Papoose Lake to the south., Google Earth For purposes of continuity, we have laid out a selection of Gabriel’s images in order of how his flight progressed around and through the NTTR. Beyond Lazar’s supposed UFO reverse-engineering lair, there is plenty more to see, including another shadowy base that is located near the Department Of Energy’s Yucca Lake facility. That drone test base has a big new hangar facility. We also see the various targets in different range areas spread throughout the NTTR’s central and southwestern reaches, one of which is quite elaborate. We will start off our journey near Lida Junction, Nevada, where a lakebed has a huge humorous inscription drawn in it for those flying over to read. Then, just like last time, Gabriel enters the normally closed airspace—you can read all about how private light planes occasionally get totally legal access to it in our previous piece—just to the north of Tonopah Test Range Airport. You have already seen the amazing photos he took on his latest journey through the area of this base—the historic home of the F-117 , America’s secret MiG squadron , the RQ-170 , and who knows what else . He then drops down into the central range areas from there, circumventing Area 51 and crossing over Papoose Lake, and heading into the southern reaches of the huge complex. With all that said, here we go: Whoever drew this massive “UFO” and arrow on this dry lakebed northeast of Lida Junction, Nevada, right on the western edge of the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), clearly wanted flyers by to know “the truth was out there”: Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman The Tonopah Test Range Airport: Gabriel Zeifman A broad view of the Tonopah Test Range (TTR).

Unsurprisingly, nothing appears to be there, just as satellite images show. There isn’t even an access road and, as you can see, the lakebed is flooded, which is a fairly common occurrence, making traversing it in a car or bus problematic. Regardless, it is a fun little pop-culture element to the story and for many, it will add to the evidence that Lazar’s story is a fake, albeit remarkably elaborate tale, and for the believers, it will probably do the opposite, somehow. Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel Zeifman Lazar did play a huge part in turning Area 51 into a household name, for better or worse, and he did seem to know a lot about the base itself—the one that actually exists—for the pre-internet era. He has even made claims about seeing a high-speed exotic aircraft on the base while transiting to the remote UFO shop at S-4. Here is his drawing of that craft: Bob’s drawing of what he thought was a methane-powered high-speed aircraft at Area 51. He claims the craft was ridiculously loud and had huge shutter-like square exhausts. , Bob Lazar via Jeremy Corbell Although some of the details Bob mentioned about the base and its operations proved to be accurate, that doesn’t mean he worked on alien craft at some comic-book-like hideout facility built into the side of a mountain at Papoose Lake. The NTTR is a huge place, with big stakeholders like the Department of Energy and the Air Force operating an endless list of facilities out there, as you can see in these pictures. As such, it employs all the same types of people you would need for similar unsecured areas, including electricians, security personnel, janitors, cooks, engineers, computer techs, construction workers, and so on. So yes, you can work out there without reverse engineering UFOs or test-flying secret stealth aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy sailor assigned to the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt has died of complications related to the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. The ship is presently docked in Guam and has been experiencing a major outbreak of the virus, has been at the center of a political firestorm after its former commanding sent an unprecedented letter to his superiors begging to get the bulk of the crew into quarantined lodging ashore to “prevent tragic outcomes.” Captain Brett Crozier was relieved of command after the letter leaked to the press, ostensibly over a breach of protocol, which then off a whirlwind chain of events that led to the resignation of Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly last week. The Office of the Navy Chief of Information, the service’s top public affairs office, announced the death on Apr. 13, but did not release the individual’s name, rank, or role on the Theodore Roosevelt , pending notification of next of kin. The Navy confirmed that the sailor who died was the same one that had been rushed to a hospital and put into an intensive care unit (ICU) on Apr. 9 after they were found unresponsive while in quarantine at Naval Base Guam during a routine medical check. “The Sailor tested positive for COVID-19 [on] March 30, was removed from the ship and placed in an isolation house on Naval Base Guam with four other USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) Sailors,” according to the Navy statement . “Like other Sailors in isolation, he received medical checks twice daily from Navy medical teams.” The Roosevelt has been in Guam since Mar. 27, after a number of sailors tested positive for COVID-19. At the time of writing, the Navy has now tested 92 percent of the more than 4,000 personnel assigned to the ship, with a total 585 confirmed cases of the virus, so far. Captain Crozier is reportedly among those who have contracted the virus. The outbreak among the crew of the carrier also represents the majority of the Navy’s known cases, which, as of Apr. 10, stood at 741 . It also represents a significant portion of the total 2,567 confirmed cases among uniformed U.S. military personnel and is greater than that of any of the other services’ total cases. JUST IN – Total DoD cases of COVID-19 up to 4,528 with news of a sailor's death on USS Theodore Roosevelt today • Military cases: 2,567 (+172) • Civilian cases: 597 • Dependent cases: 491 • Contractor cases 270 (+27) 15 deaths across DoD so far with 3 since Friday's update. — Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) April 13, 2020 The @USNavy reports it has 999 active #coronavirus cases. Far more than any other service, on the same day it has to report its first active duty death, a sailor who served on @TheRealCVN71 and was admitted to the ICU on #Guam . RIP. Total DOD: More than 2,500 across the services. pic.twitter.com/7WcLN8KXYL — Tara Copp (@TaraCopp) April 13, 2020 Another 3,724 of the Roosevelt ‘s crew have tested negative, but it is worth noting that a number of individuals on the carrier initially tested negative before testing positive. The Navy has moved a total of 3,967 sailors from the ship to lodging on Guam, including hotels and spare rooms. All of those individuals are undergoing a 14-day quarantine process. In his letter, dated Mar. 30, the same day the individual who died tested positive for COVID-19, Captain Crozier proposed moving 90 percent of his crew ashore, leaving just 10 percent to continue performing critical functions, such as operating and maintaining the carrier’s two nuclear reactors, and providing security. Doctors on the ship warned that more than 50 sailors could die if drastic steps weren’t taken, given the virtual impossibility for the crew to practice social distancing and other techniques to mitigate the spread of the virus while working and living in such close quarters. This reality, which applies to all naval vessels , including submarines , broadly, is something The War Zone had highlighted as a major issue when the Roosevelt first arrived in Guam. The USS Theordore Roosevelt during a previous port visit to Guam, USN “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” Crozier had written. “If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset – our Sailors.” The Navy balked at Captain Crozier’s proposal and accused him of being alarmist. This was despite the fact that the outbreak reportedly started among personnel in charge of running Roosevelt’s nuclear reactors, presenting a serious risk to the ship’s ability to operate at all, according to a recent report from The New York Times . The Times also reported that Rear Admiral Stuart Baker, the commanding officer of the entire Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group, had argued with Crozier beforehand and said less severe measures could prevent the COVID-19 cases from getting out of hand. Baker later told then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Modly he had not been aware of the captain’s letter in advance. Modly relieved Crozier of command on Apr. 2 officially over sending his letter, which contained granular information about the state of the ship, to a large number of recipients in an unclassified format, increasing the likelihood it would be leaked to the press. On Apr. 3, Admiral Robert Burke, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the service’s second-highest-ranking uniformed officer, also reportedly called the Roosevelt ‘s senior medical officer and said they had “failed as a leader,” according to The Times . Formal investigations continue into Crozier’s conduct and the “command climate” among ships and other units assigned to the Navy’s Pacific Fleet. A medic from 3rd Medical Battalion, 3rd Marine Logistics Group prepared an ICU bed in a building being converted into a temporary hospital on Guam to recieve potential paritents from the USS THeordore Roosevelt on Apr. 5, 2020,, USMC The then-Acting Secretary of the Navy, together with other senior Navy officials subsequently flew to Guam. Modly then gave his now infamous speech on the ship, in which he chastised Crozier, the crew, and the media, setting off a chain of events that would end with his resignation . There are now calls to reinstate Crozier’s command . The Navy, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, is still struggling with how to balance its continuing operational demands with the implementation of social distancing and other mitigating strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within its ranks. USNI News was first to report last week that the Navy had issued more rigid guidelines for how to monitor for possible cases, when to test, how to isolate, and other steps personnel should take to keep ships and facilities clean, as well as a framework for how to respond to outbreaks among personnel in various stages of the readiness cycle, in the wake of the Theodore Roosevelt situation. It remains to be seen whether Crozier will resume his previous role as the carrier’s commanding officer or what the trajectory of his career may have now. Hopefully, the steps that the Navy is taking now will limit any further fatalities among the Roosevelt ‘s crew. We will continue to update this story are more information becomes available.

We have gotten short glimpses of the F-22 Raptor’s jaw-dropping air show demonstration from inside the cockpit before, but now we get to see every one of its heart-pounding setpiece maneuvers from this unique perspective. With a new pilot, Major Joshua “Cabo” Gunderson , at its helm for the 2020 season, the F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team was set for a big year on the air show circuit—that is before the COVID-19 nightmare struck the globe. With air shows canceled for months out, the team is still practicing, but there are no crowds to share the F-22’s incredible capabilities with. Well, at least in person. Seeing that now is as good a time as ever to keep folks engaged with “Raptor Nation” as they social distance their spring away at home, the team put out the video below. It finally gives us that cockpit video of each maneuver we have been waiting for. Check it out for yourself and make sure to keep an eye on the jet’s massive and remarkably fast-fluttering computer-directed control surfaces as the Raptor is put through its paces: Even nearly two and a half decades after its first flight, the F-22A is still a modern marvel and the king of the air-to-air combat domain . Supermanueverability, via two-dimensional thrust vectoring and those massive control surfaces tied to a fly-by-wire computer system, is one of the many features that have allowed the stealthy superfighter to retain its air superiority crown. This new video gives us yet another way to appreciate that extreme agility. We can only hope that the back half of the 2020 air show season won’t end in cancellation due to COVID-19. Check out the team’s schedule and at least make some contingency plans to go see them in action in your neck of the woods, you will not be disappointed.

For the last 30 years, Don Kirlin has been flying for the airlines, working on real estate deals, setting up the world’s biggest skydiving meets, and building a private air force the likes of which even he has a hard time believing is possible. Just last month, The War Zone was among the first to report that his company would be purchasing multiple squadrons worth of surplus Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18 Hornets to be used in the contractor adversary air support role here in the United States. In that role, they would primarily fly against U.S. military fighter pilots, replicating aerial threats from potential enemy nations. So basically, they are bad guys for hire , but strictly for training and development work. Now, not only do we have all the details on that purchase, which is even more impressive than it initially seemed, but we talked at length with the entrepreneur owner of Air USA , located in Quincy, Illinois, about his company’s past and what is turning into a remarkable, if not downright historic, future. Don Kirlin imported his first foreign military jet, and L-39 Albatross, in 1994, at a time when doing so was an extremely complex and convoluted affair full of pitfalls and unknowns. Since then, he has repeated the process dozens of times over and was the first owner of a private MiG-29 Fulcrum in the United States, among a long list of other exotic flying firsts. He now holds eight licenses with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), allowing him to own military machine guns and cannons, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition to fire through them. Don Kirlin with members of his Air USA team., Air USA He was also one of the early pioneers of the then-fledgling, if not wholly experimental, adversary air support market. In the early 2000s, he joined forces with the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), which was blazing a trail with their contracts with the Navy to supply fast jet targets and electronic warfare pod toting adversaries that mimic everything from enemy cruise missiles to fighters for Navy and Marine fighter aircraft and Navy surface combatants to train against. During those early years, Air USA worked as a subcontractor for ATAC, flying the vast majority of the contracted subsonic adversary support flight hours. So, Kirlin and his company’s experience in what is now an exploding adversary support marketplace dates back to its very genesis. Prior to the Hornet purchase, Kirlin’s most outlandish import was not just one, but four MiG-29 Fulcrums. He was the first private owner of one of these jets in the United States. , Air USA Fast forward to today and Kirlin now owns an impressive fleet of ex-military aircraft that perform a wide number of roles for the Defense Department, from training Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), the modern designation for Forward Air Controllers on the ground, to saturating the sensor systems of America’s most advanced tactical fighters with aggressor adversaries in the air. With the individual contracts that will underpin the Air Force’s gargantuan adversary air support tender about to doled out, Air USA’s operation has to grow in capacity and complexity in order to even attempt to meet demand. Enter the most spectacular private aircraft purchase of all time—Air USA’s acquisition of all of the Royal Australian Air Force’s remaining F/A-18A/B Hornets. Canada had bought 25 prior to this deal going through. The jets Air USA is slated to receive, 46 in total, of which 36 are flying today, will be replaced by the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter within the RAAF’s ranks and thus will be totally retired from service by the end of 2021. Aussie F/A-18A/B Hornets and their replacements, F-35As. , © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Although the terms of the deal have not been disclosed, the purchase does include all of the RAAF’s F/A-18 spare parts inventory and test equipment, valued at over a billion dollars alone, according to Kirlin. Those parts will be incredibly valuable as Air USA is planning on putting every single airframe it receives back into service—not just the 36 aircraft that are flyable today, but the other 10 that are not, as well. Those jets just need inspections and are not parted out or grounded for any other reasons. This will allow Air USA to operate at least three fully outfitted squadrons of the 4th generation fighters at all times, which Kirlin hopes will be forward deployed to key bases around the United States where they will primarily help give fleet pilots, testers, and tactics developers, a run for their money in the air-to-air combat arena. © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence These are not Hornets in some dated configuration, either. The RAAF spent a lot of money keeping its legacy Hornet fleet relevant until replacements arrived. One of the most important capabilities the jets come with is the bolt-on Elta EL-L/8222 (license-built in the U.S. under the L3Harris Advanced Capability Pod name) electronic warfare pod. These Israeli-designed pods are pretty much the world standard in modular self-protection jamming systems and are used on the Pentagon’s own aggressor fleet, as well as by various nations around the globe on frontline aircraft. You can learn just how powerful this system is, being able to turn even highly antiquated aircraft into formidable and deadly aerial threats, especially when paired with unique tactics, in this past piece of ours. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IflKPVVBG1M All of Air USA’s secondhand Hornets feature the AN/APG-73 radar —the same one that is found on the F/A-18C/D and early F/A-18E/F Super Hornets—that differs from the less capable AN/APG-65 radar the A/B Hornet was originally equipped with. The AN/APG-73 remains a very capable radar set and is largely superior to anything else on the adversary market at this time. Kirlin also informs us that the radar and electronic warfare pod are integrated in such a way that the aircraft can simultaneously jam and engage (jam and shoot) enemy targets, which he doesn’t believe exists anywhere else on the adversary market and is a critical capability when it comes to mimicking more advanced foreign fighter threats. AN/APG-73 Radar in the nose of an F/A-18 Hornet. , Raytheon The jets also come with their Northrop Grumman AN/AAQ-28 LITENING advanced targeting pods, which are hugely capable in the air-to-ground targeting and non-traditional reconnaissance realm, as well as for positively identifying aircraft visually at long ranges. You can read all about this function and its value in this past piece of ours . In addition, the Hornets come with 68 Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS), which offers helmet-mounted display capability that drastically increases a pilot’s situational awareness and high-off-boresight targeting for close-range air-to-air missiles. This will make it easier for these aggressor jets to simulate foreign capabilities of a similar nature.

Nothing is being removed, even the jet’s Link 16 data-link system and its internal M61 20mm Vulcan cannon are staying put. As for the condition of the surplus Hornet fleet, Kirlin says they are in incredible shape and show little signs of corrosion—likely a result of their often hot and dry operating environment down under as opposed to the salty conditions aboard aircraft carriers that U.S. Navy Hornets have had to endure.

Kirlin says that since the aircraft have never trapped (landed) aboard or launched off a carrier, which causes extreme stress on the airframes, they should be able to operate continuously through 2035 and possibly even beyond. © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The first aircraft will be heading in Air USA’s direction soon. For transport, the jets have their outer wings and horizontal stabilizers removed, but that’s all the dismantling needed. They will be shipped via ocean freighter and it will only take about 60 days from arrival to get them in the air. The rest of the 36 flyable airframes will be flown in batches across the Pacific with the help of a tanker and will be ready for operations shortly after they arrive in the United States. The last 10 that are grounded due to lack of inspections will come over last. As for what the jets will look like once they lose their RAAF roundels and become Air USA jets, Air USA’s owner wasn’t entirely sure, but he does like the paint on one of his MiG-29s, which could be replicated on at least some of the Hornets. He also mentioned that a jet-black Hornet would be fun to have, just for the heck of it. One of the company’s two MiG-29UBs in a blue, gray, and teal camouflage pattern., Air USA Kirlin says that he looked at all the aircraft his competitors have bought, especially the Mirage F-1s from Spain and France and Atlas Cheetahs from South Africa that his competitors ATAC and Draken USA have snapped up , and passed on them. He actually showed me the approved ATF forms for importing these jets dated years ago as proof of his claim. Three primary reasons were behind his decisions. The first was concern that they simply weren’t the right plane for the job—he wanted something more advanced. Second, that working with certain foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would be a major hassle. Finally, he is a firm believer in buying flyers, not aircraft that have been mothballed for years, if at all possible. With this in mind, the Hornets offered Kirlin a ready to go advanced ‘air force in a box’ that wouldn’t be a huge hassle to regenerate once they reached the United States. They would also have great support from a domestic OEM—Boeing—and support and maintenance could be outsourced to firms that are already doing so for some Marine and Navy Hornet operations. Kirlin after checking out South Africa’s Atlus Cheetahs. , Air USA The balance between cost and capabilities is a huge factor in the adversary air support marketplace. Does having the most advanced private tactical aircraft on hand for hire mean they will be too costly for the Pentagon’s tastes? This has turned out to be the case in at least one limited contract that the Navy recently awarded, but Kirlin doesn’t think so overall. He says his team did a deep market evaluation and cost analysis on what ‘legacy’ Hornets cost to operate, including using the Navy’s own historic numbers provided by the General Accounting Office, as well as looking at what the competition has to offer, and the results were very positive. But for Air USA, the strategy isn’t really about simply having the best and most capable jet on the ramp, it is all about offering the customer a big menu of choices and allowing them to tailor their aircraft selection based on their needs, not on what is being offered alone. This is where Air USA’s growing diverse fleet of aircraft comes in to play. Right now, the company’s budding air force includes 10 Hawks, four L-39ZAs, and two L-39s. The Hawk jet trainers, which originally came from South Korean stocks, are deceptively capable aircraft. Like all of the Hawk family, they are quick and nimble, as well as reliable and efficient, but they now also pack one hell of a sensor and electronic warfare capability. The jets have been upgraded with Elta’s ELM-2052 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar . In fact, they are the only private adversary aircraft equipped with an AESA radar set at this time. Air USA The ELM-2052 is a modular design of Israeli origin that can fit within the tight confines of smaller tactical fighter aircraft radomes, but it is known to be remarkably effective and gives fleet pilots something unique to train against in the adversary air-to-air environment. The jets are also wired to handle the EL-L/8222 electronic warfare pods, like their soon to be Hornet stablemates. Combined with their small size, they are a remarkably formidable and highly dissimilar adversary aircraft. ELM-2052 AESA radar and EL-L/8222 electronic warfare equipped Hawk., Air USA The L-39ZA, which is a combat-capable derivative of the L-39 Albatross trainer, and the L-39s themselves, have lower performance than the Hawk, but they are very efficient and still can lug different types of countermeasure pods, cannons, and other stores. Air USA has even equipped some of them with advanced electro-optical and infrared sensor turrets. Air USA had Dornier Alpha Jets that fell into a category somewhere between the Hawks and the L-39s, but those aircraft were sold to the Nigerian Air Force, which was in urgent need of the type. Air USA Air USA L59 equipped with a towed target on the ramp in Okinawa. The target unspools behind the aircraft on 22,000 feet of cable. It is used for live fire training and testing, in this case of the Navy’s major surface combatants’ 5-inch deck guns and 20mm Phalanx CIWS. , Air USA In addition to the Aussie Hornet purchase, Air USA also acquired five hand-picked PC-9 turboprop trainers from the RAAF. These aircraft will primarily be used to fulfill the growing demand for cost-effective Joint Terminal Attack Controller training. You can read all about this mission and the contracts being tendered to supply it in this recent piece of ours . RAAF Pilatus PC-9s., © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Basically, JTACs need to get time “on the mic” with real aircraft overhead, in both day and nighttime conditions, to get accustomed to organizing the three-dimensional airspace overhead in relation to the battlespace on the ground, and effectively, safely, and efficiently call in airstrikes on enemy targets. This is an incredibly complex and high-stakes job, but using high-performance fighters in the Pentagon’s inventory that cost at least $20,000 an hour to train with is horribly cost-ineffective. As such, being able to provide far less expensive assets via the contractor marketplace for some of this training has become a major priority. One of Air USA’s L-39ZAs equipped with an advanced EO/IR turret for Joint Terminal Attack Controller training. , Air USA This is not only where the PC-9s come in, but also the fleet of 17 highly modified Cessna T337 Turbo Skymasters that Air USA just acquired from Airscan Inc. These aircraft were totally reworked for overhead surveillance and counter-insurgency missions in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. They come equipped with the hugely capable MX-15 infrared/electro-optical sensor turret and an operator’s station in the back. The Cessnas, which have a pair of reciprocating turbocharged IO-360 engines found on normal light planes, are extremely efficient compared to their turbine-powered competitors and feature video downlink, encrypted communications, and night vision goggle compatible cockpits, among other modifications. They are also certified under the FAA’s Standard category, not the Experimental category, even with all their modifications, which has a multitude of benefits. Airscan Inc. T337 Turbo Skymaster., DTOM/Wikicommons Air USA’s idea here is to provide the lowest possible cost for JTAC training while still having an aircraft that has all the bells and whistles needed to accomplish the mission. Don Kirlin says that from his firm’s perspective, for a lot of JTAC training, the customer just wants the most “time on the mic” for their JTACs as possible. Delivering a very low-cost option, one with extremely high endurance, to accomplish just that is the impetus behind acquiring the highly unique fleet of suped-up and battle-proven Turbo Skymasters. Kirlin also states that the company has acquired 10 F-5E Tiger IIs that will slot in between the Hawk and the Hornet in the aggressor role. These jets will be totally refurbished and will get a comprehensive upgrade very similar, if not nearly identical, to the one Tactical Air, another adversary air support purveyor, has developed for its large fleet of F-5s. You can read all about Tactical Air and its highly customized F-5ATs in this recent piece of ours. Don Kirlin and some of his Air USA team on a repositioning flight in the Western Pacific. Kirlin hopes to fit their F-5s with Infrared Search and Track Systems (IRSTs) , which will be a huge force multiplier for other aggressors flying alongside them and a real threat to stealthy “blue air” jets, like the F-35, F-22, and B-2. Leveraging a similar open architecture avionics upgrade that Tactical Air pioneered with its F-5ATs will allow far easier integration of an IRST on the F-5 than on other aircraft in the Air USA fleet. The company also owns a quartet of MiG-29 Fulcrums that Kirlin imported. These jets are basically in factory new condition. They each have roughly just 100 hours on them now, which is basically nothing. The two single-seat models are more parts donors than flying aircraft, with the pair of two-seat MiG-29UBs being airworthy. Although some may wonder why these jets are not used for adversary support roles, they simply are not in demand for a number of reasons. They are not specifically equipped for the mission, do not have a radar, and are not the most efficient flying machines available for the task by a long shot. They have done some missile work with Raytheon air-to-air missile system development in the past, and could be pushed into service if a customer really wanted them, but when you have fully upgraded Hornets in your fleet, who needs a dated MiG-29? With such a varied inventory of aircraft, Air USA’s unique business aimed at the ballooning contractor tactical air services market can be summed up by the following: give the customer a huge range of options to tailor to their budget and training requirements. In other words, this is not a one size fits all air force for hire. Quite the opposite. For instance, for basic air-to-air missions, like radar intercept training, maybe a PC-9 or L-39 is fine. For other more dynamic fighter training, maybe a Hawk or F-5 will do. For the most advanced air-to-air training, the Hornet will be available. The customer only has to pay for what they really need. The same can be said for JTAC training. For basic training scenarios, a T337H gives a tremendous amount of capability for the dollar and for “dry CAS” where weapons are not employed, but for more advanced scenarios where weapons are released, PC-9s, or even L-39s or Hawks, would be the aircraft for the job. Air USA’s Hawks came with 30mm ADEN cannon pods, which are fully functional and are used in close air support exercises. Kirlin told us he has 42,000 training rounds 74,000 high-explosive rounds for the cannons., Air USA So, it’s all about choice. This business mantra is something Don Kirlin learned by putting on the world’s largest skydiving festival, the World Freefall Convention. When I say large, I mean large . Kirlin tells us that during a past iteration of the event, 5,400 skydivers made 70,000 jumps in just 10 days . Many of those skydivers were sick of the same old jump ships, they wanted a variety of exotic platforms to choose from to enhance their experience. Over 17 years of putting on the event, Kirlin ended up bringing in everything from World War II bombers to a high-flying 727 to help quelch attendees’ demands. By offering so many creative possibilities, he found that the customer really appreciates options and wants to be able to pay for exactly what they need or desire, nothing more and nothing less. This emphasis on customer choice is now being ported over to the adversary air support market via his eclectic fleet of tactical aircraft for hire. With choice and platform diversity also comes some really exciting opportunities to layer-in different capabilities on a single adversary mission, which can provide more challenging scenarios for trainees. For instance, pairing the Hawk with the Hornet, the Hawk can share its AESA radar targeting information with the Hornet and vice-versa. Throw in an F-5 with an IRST and even the stealthiest opponents will be prone to detection from Air USA’s aggressor formation. Layering in other aircraft, like L-39s acting as cruise missiles and more, will help really rachet up the complexity that ‘blue air’ forces will have to confront, and all of these capabilities can come from one business relationship. An impressive lineup of electronic warfare toting Air USA Albatrosses. , Air USA With frontline fighter aircraft becoming increasingly capable, especially in terms of the sensors they carry, being able to challenge them has become far more difficult and often requires a mix of high-performance opposing fighters, as well as saturating them with other , less complex aerial targets. Having a turn-key air force for hire with a huge range of capabilities and performance levels available, makes this easier to accomplish in an efficient and integrated manner and without the Air Force, Navy, or Marines having to task their own overtaxed fleets with the mission. Also, contracting out these services already is more cost-effective than having the military perform them, but with tailorable forces like Kirlin’s, the cost should only go down, not up. Don Kirlin is truly living what would have been a far-fetched dream not too long ago. He is a man with his own fourth-generation fighter-equipped air force, one larger and more capable than what many entire nations possess. With the introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet into the adversary air support marketplace, especially the number Air USA is bringing to the fight, it could very well be a game-changer, but it also presents risks. Taking on a supercarrier’s worth of modern strike fighters is a hugely expensive proposition. It is also one that is not without its own physical and liability risks. There will be a lot of pressure on Air USA to not only pay its bills, which will be monumentally huge, but also to operate these extremely high-performance jets in a safe and reliable manner. From what I can tell Don Kirlin seems raring to take these challenges head-on and to get himself strapped into the Hornet’s ejection seat and taking one up for a spin—he is type rated and flies every plane he owns. The Hornet will be no different. Call it a perk of the job for the man who now owns the world’s most advanced private air force. © Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence UPDATE: Don Kirlin has provided a couple of additional notes regarding the purchase: 1) No Australian software is provided in the sale and other restricted items will not be supplied. 2) The aircraft are sold as is where is and not warranted nor guaranteed.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s first big-deck amphibious assault ship, a huge vessel that was built in a miraculously short amount of time, caught fire on Saturday, April 11th, 2020. Photos and video showing the ship billowing large clouds of black smoke hit Chinese social media earlier in the day. The warship, which is the first of the new Type 075 class, was resting alongside the pier at its birthplace, Hudong–Zhonghua Shipbuilding in Shanghai, when the blaze broke out. You can and should read all about the Type 075 and why it is a major accomplishment for the rapidly expanding People’s Liberation Army Navy in this past piece of ours. It is unclear how much damage has been done to the amphibious assault ship at this time, although it appears the fire emanated from, or at least involved, its well deck. A well deck is a floodable garage-like space that is used on amphibious assault ships for launching and recovering ship-to-shore transport boats and hovercraft, as well as amphibious fighting vehicles. The second ship in the Type 075 class is wrapping up construction in the drydocks next to where the first is tied up. Some speculate that it could be launched very soon. As such, the fire couldn’t have come at a worse time and it could end up being an embarrassing setback for one of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s banner shipbuilding programs, but just how big of a setback is still yet to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 14, 2020","CIA Tracked Down A Nazi, Scoured Museums To Build An Aircraft Siren To Scare The Hell Out Of People","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a decade after the end of World War II, the Central Intelligence Agency initiated a project to develop an air-driven siren that it could readily attach to a small aircraft for psychological warfare operations . The inspiration for this device, dubbed the Jericho Horn, was a similar system the Nazis had employed on the legendary Ju-87 Stuka dive bomber. In the end, the CIA tracked down the designer of that siren and scoured museums in the United States for information about the Stuka before building its own prototypes. An unknown CIA officer appears to have first made a handwritten request for “a siren or screamer type noisemaker for psychological warfare” for use on an aircraft on May 8, 1958, kicking off what was also referred to as the “Screamer Project.” The exact reason why the Agency wanted this device is unclear, but “the device is to be used in conjunction with a current high priority Agency project,” according to another report, requesting to initiate “Task S,”  dated Sept. 5, 1958. Other records say that the requirement originated with the CIA’s Far East Division. These and other documents related to the Jericho Horn effort are now declassified, with significant redactions, and available online via the CIA Records Search Tool, or CREST. The handwritten document says that the CIA wanted the horn to be able to work with a P-51 Mustang propeller-engine fighter. The Agency wanted it to be able to be sufficiently disconcerting with the aircraft flying at speeds between 280 and 300 miles per hour and at an altitude of just 300 feet. A portion of the May 1958 handwritten CIA request for the “siren or screamer.”, CIA This proposed combination is not necessarily surprising. In the first few decades after its creation in 1947, the Agency regularly used a wide array of surplus World War II-era aircraft for covert operations around the world. During the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954, a mercenary-piloted P-47 Thunderbolt notably bombed the city of Chiquimula, some 65 miles east of Guatemala City, as part of associated psychological warfare effort to demoralize and confuse regime forces. The problem was that the CIA appears to have had no idea about how to go about building such a thing. “Dan says it can be done, but if program is to be a fresh start considerable time & money are involved,” the initial handwritten request explained. There is no hint as to who this “Dan” might have been. Quite reasonably, the CIA’s first thought was to see if the Air Force had a Ju-87 so personnel could examine the design of the original siren. The Stuka had two mounts, one on each of the fairings covering both of its fixed main landing gear struts, for what the Germans themselves had called Jericho Trompetes , or Jericho Trumpets. Both this and the CIA’s name for their device are references to the Old Testament story , also found in the Hebrew Bible, of the Israelites, under the command of Joshua, blowing rams’ horns to bring down the walls of the city of Jericho. A contemporary picture of a Jericho Trumpet installed on a Ju-87 Stuka dive bomber., Public Domain Another Stuka with the Jericho Trumpets installed., Public Domain The Agency found that the Air Technical Intelligence Center did at one point have a Stuka, but had gotten rid of it and it was unclear where it had gone. “May now be in air museum or Army archives,” the officers writing up the Jericho Horn request noted. CIA personnel also visited the Smithsonian Institution believing that it might have a complete Jericho Trumpet in its collection, but not on public display. As it turned out, the Smithsonian did not have one of the sirens and Paul Garber, then the Assistant Director of the Institutions Aeronautics Section told them to check with the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois, which, to this day, has a Ju-87 on display. Garber was also the first head of the National Air Museum, the predecessor to today’s National Air and Space Museum. The handwritten report does not say what happened when CIA officials went to Chicago, but they would have been disappointed again. The aircraft there, which is a Ju-87R-2/Trop variant, is missing its landing gear fairings. The “Trop” in the designation refers to the aircraft’s tropical operations kit, which the German had developed for flying in hot and sandy environments, such as North Africa. The Ju-87R-2/Trop on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago., Daderot via Wikimedia Trying to find Ju-87 with a working example of an original Jericho Trumpet would have been something of a wild goose chase. Junkers delivered more than 5,000 Stukas of all variants delivered to the Luftwaffe between 1936 and 1944, but the Nazis continued to send the increasingly obsolete aircraft into combat right until the very end of World War II. Today, just as it was when the CIA began their Jericho Horn project in 1958, there are just two effectively complete Ju-87s on display anywhere in the world, the one in Chicago and another at the Royal Air Force Museum in the United Kingdom. Various groups have or have had plans to restore other examples and there are a small number of partial aircraft in other museums, as well. Given the difficulty of finding an original Jericho Trumpet, the CIA eventually went in a completely different direction. Starting in 1946, the U.S. government had initiated a secret program, known as Operation Paperclip , to relocate German scientists, engineers, and other technical specialists to the United States in order for them to work for the U.S. government and to keep them from doing the same for the Soviet Union. The Agency identified Henning Von Girke, who had designed the original Jericho Trumpet, among the “Paperclips” working at the Air Force’s Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Von Girke subsequently provided design notes and technical details regarding his siren. A handwritten note regarding the location of Henning Von Girke from the CIA’s May 1958 request for the Jericho Horn., CIA Not everyone was thrilled with the Jericho Horn plan. In a meeting on May 12, 1958, another individual the CIA consulted, who’s name is redacted in the handwritten document, pointed out that the Ju-87’s iconic whine while diving actually came from its structural design and that the Germans themselves had only made limited use of the Jericho Trumpets, despite them being a popular point in any discussion about the Stuka. The trumpets added drag and slowed down the already sluggish dive bombers and alerted defenders that they were coming, all of which made the aircraft vulnerable. This person also pointed out that the Navy had hired the Chrysler Corporation’s Dynamic Laboratory to develop a similar siren during World War II and that they had succeeded in crafting a superior design to German Jericho Trumpet. Unfortunately, testing on a Grumman F6F Hellcat propeller-engine fighter showed that the device made the plane dangerously unstable. The Navy subsequently abandoned the effort, deciding that further development would not “be of significant value.” The individual also told CIA officials that they were “very doubtful [the] whistle will be of value.” A handwritten note about the siren that Chrysler developed for the US Navy, including a basic drawing of its design., CIA The CIA decided to continue with the project and in late 1958 had initiated a contract with an unknown company, the name of which is redacted in the declassified documents, to build four prototype Jericho Horns. The Agency initially estimated the cost of the project would be just $6,572 and that it would take three months to compete. By the end of October 1958, the contractor working for CIA had built an experimental device with an air-driven whistle and begun putting it through testing in a laboratory enviornment. These tests showed that the device could generate a whistling sound up to 150 decibels loud. Measuring sound is difficult as it dissipates the further a person is from the source and how much an individual hears, to begin with, is highly variable. However, 130 to 140 decibels is typically considered the threshold for pain for most people. The CIA reported the potential to increase the siren’s output to between 170 to 180 decibels “by electronic means.” Despite the initial projections, work on the siren continued at least into early 1959. The first series of flight tests involving a twin-engine Beechcraft AT-11 light aircraft carrying one of the Jericho Horns. It took place in January 1959. A US Army Air Forces AT-11., Bill Larkins via Wikimedia The version employed in these tests had an adjustable “iris” for the whistle that would alter the air flow and change the sound output. Controls in the cockpit allowed the pilot to make these changes in flight. Despite the results of the ground testing, in six passes at 300 feet and at speeds of between 220 and 245 miles per hour, the AT-11-mounted siren only produced a maximum sound output of 108 decibels, about as loud as a chainsaw. “In the present state this whistle can not be considered as a harassment item. It does however attract attention,” a CIA report on the flight tests said. “Upon hearing the whistle for the first time, and completely unaware that any such device was being tested, a charter pilot, who flew the undersigned to the test site, was of the opinion that either the oil or fuel pump of the test aircraft was failing. He expressed concern for fear the test aircraft might crash due to motor failure. Although this unbiased witness was concerned about the noise, he was not frightened to any degree.” Details about the January 1959 flight tests, including the discussion of the disappointing amount of noise the siren produced., CIA Another series of flight tests, utilizing a smaller Cessna Model 180 , took place in March 1958 involving two different modified versions of the siren design with equally disappointing results. “At present the ‘Jericho Horn’ does not satisfy this requirement [for a psychological warfare device], and it is doubtful that continued effort will achieve this end,” a report dated Mar. 31, 1958, declared. The CIA’s engineering division subsequently asked the Far East Division if there was any possible use to be had from the siren as a means of covertly identifying friendly aircraft flying above. Agency aircraft regularly conducted supply drops and other missions to support proxy forces or agent teams in hostile territory. Signaling to those planes could often be difficult and there was always an inherent risk of compromising personnel on the ground. A portion of the CIA Engineer Division’s March 1959 message asking about other possible uses for the Jericho Horns., CIA “If this whistle cannot serve any useful purpose as a psychological identification device, it is our recommendation that this project be dropped,” a Mar. 31, 1958 letter from the CIA’s engineering division said. “Two prototype whistles have been fabricated under this program and any recommendations as to their disposal would be appreciated.” It’s not clear what ultimately happened to the two prototype Jericho Horns. Interest in psychological warfare systems, including devices to generate annoying or painfully loud noises, never went away. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force experimented with an air-droppable device called the “ Screeming Meemie ,” with equally lackluster results. Aircraft and helicopters did carry speaker arrays to broadcast propaganda messages and obnoxious noises during that conflict. The inside of a US Air Force “Screeming Meemie” psychological warfare system. , USAF via FOIA The U.S. military famously blasted rock music at the Apostolic Nunciature, the Vatican’s embassy, in Panama City in December 1989, after the country’s autocratic ruler Manuel Noriega fled there following the U.S. invasion of the country. American forces took Noriega into custody after 10 days of negotiations and auditory harassment. American law enforcement and military personnel employed similar tactics during the 1993 siege of the Branch Davian cult compound in Waco, Texas. This incident ended in a raid and the deaths of 76 individuals inside, including a number of children, and the U.S. government’s handling of the situation remains extremely controversial to this day. Auditory psychological warfare definitely remains a part of U.S. military operations, with personnel on the ground using speakers or long-range acoustic hailing devices , or LRADs, to broadcast confusing, distressing, or otherwise harassing messages and noises. The War Zone was first to report that American troops had played an audio recording described simply as “crying,” among others, during the campaign to eject ISIS terrorists from the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2016. LRADs, in particular, have seen increasingly widespread use on the ground and at sea , and even aerial applications, typically mounted on helicopters , in the past couple of decades . Law enforcement agencies, as well as military forces, around the world have adopted them . The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Crops also routinely use combat jets to conduct shows for force , relying in part on the psychological effect of the loud noise of those aircraft flying overhead at relatively low levels and high speeds, to ward off hostile or potentially hostile forces . The Air Force has employed other, larger fast-flying aircraft, including B-1B bombers and SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, in this role in the past, as well. The sonic booms from the SR-71s, which were capable of flying at speeds more than three times the speed of sound, had a notable psychological effect on the countries the aircraft flew over, including Cuba , North Korea , and Libya. In 1990, in the lead up to the first Gulf War, Ben Rich, the head of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, specifically proposed reactivating a number of Blackbirds for operations over Iraq to both collect intelligence and “to sonic-boom the bastards .” The Air Force had retired these aircraft the previous year and passed on this pitch. It did return a number of these aircraft to service starting in 1995, before retiring the type for good in 1998. Various branches of the U.S. military are now pursuing new technologies, including propaganda “leaflets” that can play recorded messages and balls of superheated plasma that can “talk,” that could expand the psychological warfare capabilities available to American troops. These developments could also benefit the U.S. Intelligence Community if agencies such as the CIA aren’t already pursuing their own efforts along similar lines. However, it seems unlikely that the idea of attaching an air-driven siren to an aircraft to create loud and obnoxious noises while it flies at extremely low altitudes will ever make a comeback based on the CIA’s experience, as well as that of the Nazis themselves.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Boeing 707 airliner that once served as a VVIP aircraft for Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and his family has recently flown for the first time in almost seven years and is now reportedly in the process of being converted to an aerial refueling tanker. Private air refueling contractor Omega Air owns the aircraft and its return to the skies comes as the U.S. Air Force moves ever closer to hiring contractors to provide these services on a broad scale amid ongoing difficulties with its new Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tankers . Romanian aviation enthusiast site Boarding Pass was first to report that the 707, which carries the U.S. civil registration number N707GF, had left Brunswick Golden Isles Airport in Georgia, where it had been in storage, and was heading to San Antonio, Texas. The aircraft still has the overall white with blue cheatline livery, as well as Romanian national flag on the tail, that it did before Omega Air acquired it. The large “ROMANIA” titles that it previously had on either side of the forward fuselage have been removed. Omega Air already has two KC-707 tankers configured with probe-and-drogue style aerial refueling systems. It also has a probe-and-drogue configured McDonnell Douglas KDC-10 in service and acquired another one of these aircraft with a boom-type refueling system last year. The latter aircraft is the first boom-equipped tanker to join a private contractor’s fleet. The War Zone has already reached out to the company for more details about what it has planned now for N707GF. Turning N707GF into a tanker would add an interesting new chapter to the plane’s already intriguing history. Starting in 1974, Romania, then under the control of totalitarian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and a member of the Soviet Union’s Warsaw Pact alliance, acquired a total of four Boeing 707s for its national airline TAROM. One of these was the jet that Omega Air now owns, which previously carried the Romanian registration code YR-ABB. Though firmly within the Soviet Union’s orbit, Ceaușescu had broken with officials in Moscow on a number of occasions before and after buying the 707s, notably including continuing to have diplomatic relations with Israel after the Six Day War in 1967 and refusing to contribute forces for the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. When it came to civil aviation, in the 1970s, Romania also entered into a deal with the British Aircraft Corporation in the United Kingdom to buy and then license produce a number of BAC-111 airliners , also for TAROM, which otherwise operated only Soviet-made designs. One of TAROM’s BAC-111s in the 1970s., RuthAS via Wikimedia In 1976, TAROM has set aside two of the four 707s specifically to fly Ceaușescu, as well as his family and members of his inner circle, around, including on state visits. The interiors of these aircraft were also upgraded to match their VVIP role, and the Romanian dictator’s luxurious tastes , and were “fitted out like the U.S. President’s Air Force One,” according to one 1990 article . The TAROM titles on the jets were replaced by “Republica Socialista Romania” on the sides of the fuselage and the Romanian national flag took the place of the airline’s logo on the tail. The red-and-white TAROM livery of the day remained otherwise unchanged. The exact internal configuration is unclear, and it is isn’t possible that the planes had the kind of advanced communications and other capabilities of the U.S. Air Force’s 707-based VC-137 Air Force Ones that were in service at the time, but the American jets may well have influenced the modifications, at least to some degree. President Richard Nixon made one of the VC-137s available to the Romanian dictator during a two-day tour of the United States in 1970. YR-ABB in Hamburg, Germany for maintenance in 1987. , Perry Hoppe via Wikimedia As the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact began to collapse in the late 1980s, Romania began to experience political upheaval of its own. In December 1989, a popular revolution led to the ouster and execution of Ceaușescu and his wife Elena and a transition to democratic rule. In the immediate aftermath, YR-ABB found its way into the fleet of LAR , another Romanian state-owned airliner that the country had established in 1975 specifically to serve tourist destinations and operate charters. It was reportedly leased to an airline in Suriname between 1991 and 1992 and then again to Pakistan’s Aero Asia International for three months in 1995. Another Romanian BAC-111 in LAR livery in the 1970s., RuthAS via Wikimedia LAR ceased operations in 1997 after which the former VVIP 707 joined Romavia’s fleet. The Romanian Ministry of Defense had established Romavia , the country’s first post-revolution state-owned airline, in 1990. As part of Romavia, YR-ABB served again as the official plane of the Romanian President. Sources differ on exactly when the plane stopped serving in this role, but it had been retired by 2010. Two years later, Omega Air acquired it for approximately two million Euros, or around $2.6 million at the exchange rate at the time. The plane has not flown since 2013, the year that it arrived at Brunswick Golden Isles Airport. It’s not clear why Omega Air might be looking to covert the aircraft into a tanker now, but the U.S. Air Force’s Air Mobility Command, in cooperation with U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), has been increasingly more engaged with private contractors in recent months about hiring them to provide aerial refueling support across the U.S. military. The Air Force’s existing KC-135R Stratotanker and KC-10A Extender tankers are configured with booms, which is the primary aerial refueling system that service employs. However, the KC-135R can be configured with a drogue on its boom and drogue pods under its wings, while the KC-10A has a retractable drogue in its tail. This allows them to refuel U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as those belonging to foreign allies and partners, that use the probe-and-drogue refueling method, which they do regularly during combat and non-combat missions. In December 2019, AMC hosted an industry day event at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois to discuss various requirements and available capabilities. A total of 14 companies, including Omega Air, were present at that gathering. The Air Force and TRANSCOM have been refining possible contractor air fueling requirements for some time and continues to do so. At present, it is interesting private companies being able to provide up to around 25,000 flight hours of non-combat aerial refueling support a year. This would include refueling aircraft during training exercises, test and evaluation activities, non-combat transits, and the delivery of aircraft under the Foreign Military Sales program. USAF The Air Force is most interested in hiring companies that can provide tankers capable of being configured for both probe-and-drogue and boom-type refueling operations, as necessary. However, Omega Air’s drogue-equipped tankers could still meet Air Force requirements to support non-Air Force aircraft. You can see the full draft performance requirements, as of December 2019, below. USAF Persisting issues with the Air Force’s new KC-46As, which the service says it will not use for routine aerial refueling operations in combat or otherwise until significant fixes are made to the design, have been a major driving factor in the push toward hiring private contractors. The Pegasus also has a retractable drogue in the rear of the aircraft and is slated to be certified to carry drogue pods operationally this year. A KC-46A refuels a US Navy F/A-18 Hornet using an underwing drogue pod during a test., Boeing Just last month, the Air Force revealed that the Pegasus’ fuel system leaks excessively. This is the latest major deficiency with the aircraft, which already has serious issues associated with its refueling boom and the complex Remote Vision System (RVS) that boom operators employ to see what is happening at the rear of the aircraft while connecting with receiving aircraft. On April 2, Boeing and the Air Force finally reached an agreement that the company would develop and deliver a completely redesigned RVS 2.0 and refit it to the dozens of existing aircraft the service already has at its own cost. The KC-46A contract is firm, fixed price, which already led Boeing to have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars of its own money on various fixes and modifications to the design. “RVS 2.0 will include 4K color cameras with proper viewing geometry, operator stations with larger screens, a laser ranger for refueling aircraft distance measurement and boom assistance augmented reality,” according to an Air Force statement . “With the help of scientists and engineers from both enterprises, the Air Force will lead design reviews and approve specifications to drive the partnership toward initial fielding in 2023.” A view of the current boom operator workstations on the KC-46A., USAF In the meantime, the Air Force will have to continue relying on its existing and aging fleets of KC-135R and KC-10A tankers to refuel both its own aircraft and those belonging to the Navy and Marine Corps. The difficulties with the KC-46A has also forced the service to backtrack on plans to retire some of those older aircraft in the coming year. Private contractors could also help fill gaps in aerial refueling capacity, and do so in a cost-effective manner, especially for non-combat missions, freeing up KC-135Rs and KC-10As for more demanding missions. This is something the War Zone has explored in depth in the past . Omega Air has already been supporting Navy training and test and evaluation activities for years now, too. AMC says that it could potentially begin soliciting bids for a private aerial refueling contract by June. Whether the Air Force intends to keep to that schedule, or if it even remains tenable given various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic , is unclear. If the Air Force, or another service, does proceed with a major contract aerial refueling deal, or if the Navy continues its relationship with Omega Air, American or allied military aircraft may eventually find themselves taking on fuel from was once the personal jet of a Romanian dictator.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2020",France’s Only Aircraft Carrier Heads Home Due To COVID-19 Scare On Board,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. France’s only aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle , is heading home amid concerns that around 40 sailors on board may have contracted the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. This comes a day after news broke that at least two members of the crew of the U.S. Navy’s first-in-class USS Nimitz aircraft carrier had tested positive for the virus. All of this follows a whirlwind chain of events surrounding a major outbreak of the disease on board the Nimitz class USS Theodore Roosevelt that began last month and came to head yesterday with the resignation of the Acting Secretary of the Navy. The French Ministry of the Armed Forces first announced that Charles de Gaulle was on its way back to its homeport at Toulon Naval Base in the southern part of the country along the Mediterranean Sea on Apr. 8, 2020. The carrier, which has a total crew complement of around 2,000 personnel, had first departed on its latest deployment into the Atlantic, which the French Navy had dubbed Mission Foch , in January. The ship was originally scheduled to return home on Apr. 23. “On board the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle currently deployed in the Atlantic as part of the Mission Foch, around forty sailors are today under close medical observation,” the French Ministry of the Armed Forces said in an official statement . “They are showing symptoms consistent with possible COVID-19 infection. These first symptoms have appeared recently.” The French military has dispatched a screening team with specialized equipment to the carrier, which is sailing in the Mediterranean now, to begin testing members of the crew. The official statement also says individuals who are showing symptoms of the virus have been placed in isolation, but does not elaborate on the exact nature of their confinement. They have received masks and medical personnel are checking on their condition twice a day. Charles de Gaulle does have robust medical facilities with a dedicated containment suite, as well as a sickbay with a dozen beds. A 20-person medical team, which includes doctors, surgeons, and nurses, staffs these facilities on board the ship. Thankfully, so far, the sailors who may have contracted COVID-19 are exhibiting mild symptoms. Other sailors on the carrier are cleaning common areas twice daily and the size and frequency of official meetings have been scaled back. Limits have been set on the number of sailors to gather in certain spaces at once, as well. As the War Zone noted last month , warships, where hundreds or even thousands of personnel work and live in very close quarters, present an especially worrisome potential breeding ground for COVID-19, which has proven to be readily transmissible, in general. It’s not clear where Charles de Gaulle ‘s crew may have first been exposed to the virus. However, on Mar. 25, the Belgian Ministry of Defense disclosed that at least one sailor on its Karel Doorman class frigate Leopold I had tested positive for COVID-19. The Leopold I , which is now back in its homeport of Zeebrugge, had sailed for a time as part of Charles de Gaulle ‘s carrier strike group and its crew had engaged with their French counterparts. It is also possible that the Belgian sailor contracted the virus from a member of the French carrier’s crew. At the time of writing, France has had more than 82,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and has seen more than 10,000 people die due to the virus or complications from it. The Belgian Navy’s Karel Doorman class frigate Leopold I ., Ein Dahmer via Wikimedia It’s also unclear what impacts the situation may have on the readiness of the Charles de Gaulle , which is also the flagship of the French Navy. As noted, the carrier was already scheduled to return from Mission Foch this month. Regardless, the experience of the USS Theodore Roosevelt shows just how serious a danger COVID-19 potentially presents to navies , and military forces , in general, around the world. There are at least 173 confirmed cases among the crew of Roosevelt , which arrived in Guam on Mar. 26 after a small number of sailors tested positive for the virus and is now there indefinitely. The ship’s commanding officer, Captain Brett Crozier, sent a letter days later pleading to get the bulk of the sailors off the carrier and into lodging ashore to prevent the further spread of the virus and the risk of fatalities. Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly subsequently relieved Crozier of his command, ostensibly over a procedural issue, triggering a political firestorm that Modly had inflamed by giving a widely criticized speech on the carrier defending his actions. Modly’s resigned yesterday . On Apr. 7, Politico first reported that a sailor assigned to the USS Nimitz had tested positive, raising new concerns about the spread of the virus within the Navy and its impact on the service’s ability to project power in response to other crises that might emerge. Nimitz , which is homeported in Bremerton, Washington, has been working up to its own deployment. The USS Nimitz sails past Seattle, Washington in February. , USN Sailors assigned to the Nimitz class carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Ronald Reagan , which are undergoing maintenance in Washington State and Japan, respectively, have also tested positive for COVID-19. Of the Navy’s West Coast-based carriers, only the USS Abraham Lincoln , which returned to its homeport in San Diego, California in January following a record-setting deployment to the Middle East, does not have any crew members with the virus. The sidelining of Theodore Roosevelt had already forced the service to shift one of the two other carriers it had conducting operations in the Middle East to the Pacific region . Other Navy ships, including the hospital ship USNS Comfort , which is in New York City helping with COVID-19 response efforts there, have reported cases among their crews. It is clear that the Navy, as well as the other branches of the U.S. military, are having difficulties balancing being prepared to respond to contingencies with taking steps necessary to limit the risk of potential outbreaks of the virus among their personnel. The U.S. Navy is clearly not alone in this struggle, with reported COVID-19 cases emerging on Russian and Dutch submarines last month, in addition to the potential cases on France’s Charles de Gaulle and the confirmed case among the crew of Belgium’s Leopold I . It is still a worrisome trend and the virus continues to present an increasingly more serious threat to naval operation and general military readiness worldwide.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2020",Behold Boeing’s Loyal Wingman Drone It Is Building For The Royal Australian Air Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has revealed it has made new progress with the first prototype of its new loyal wingman drone for the Royal Australian Air Force. Recently, for the first time, the unmanned aircraft, which is still in an incomplete state, sat unsupported on its own landing gear and had its main electrical power system turned on. The Chicago-headquartered planemaker announced the new milestone on Apr. 8, 2020. The company had only revealed that it had completed the bulk of the work on the drone’s fuselage on Feb. 10, 2020. Boeing’s Australia division, based in Brisbane, is leading the project, also known as the Airpower Teaming System (ATS), which it first unveiled publicly in February 2019. You can read more about the program and its implications in this past War Zone piece . “We’re continuing at pace toward our goal of flying later this year, so that we can show our customer and the world what unmanned capability like this can do,” Dr. Shane Arnott, Boeing’s Airpower Teaming System program director, said in a statement . “The strong contributions from our industry team are powering our progress.” Boeing’s industry team consists of 16 different firms, including BAE Systems Australia, RUAG Australia, Ferra Engineering, and AME Systems. Those four companies have supplied flight control systems and navigation equipment, the landing gear system, precision machined components and sub-assemblies, and wiring looms, respectively, according to Boeing . A picture of the fuselage for Boeing’s loyal wingman drone for Australia under construction in February 2020., Boeing Boeing says it has been integrating and testing various systems on the drone as construction proceeded to help speed up development. The company’s Australian division also conducted at least one flight test of certain systems using surrogate subscale, jet-powered, unmanned test aircraft in November 2019. The full-size loyal wingman drones will be approximately 38 feet long, will be powered by a bizjet-class jet engine, and have a range of around 2,000 nautical miles. The Royal Australian Air Force plans to network them together with various manned platforms, including its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , as well as its EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control platforms, and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes. It’s worth pointing out that all of these aircraft except the F-35As are also Boeing products. The Airpower Teaming System could offer a game-changing boost in capability for the Royal Australian Air Force at a relatively low cost. The War Zone has highlighted the potential capabilities these drones might provide in the past, writing : “For Australia, this could offer a major boost in capability at a relatively low cost and without the time and expense required to train traditional pilots. Tethered to manned aircraft via datalink, the ATS drones could provide the attritable pilots of manned aircraft with a more comprehensive picture of the battlespace around them and help them detect threats faster in order to avoid or neutralize them. Combined with the drone’s stealthy design, this could be particularly valuable for helping to further reduce the risks to higher cost assets, such as the F-35, when penetrating deep into heavily defended areas.” “The modular nature of the design also supports the goal of the rapid integration of new capabilities and payloads with minimal cost and effort. As time goes on, armed versions of the ATS unmanned aircraft could help increase the magazine capacity, sensor diversity, and more of a mixed manned-unmanned force, or even just operate as autonomous swarms.” “Really, this is a low-risk way for the RAAF to explore semi-autonomous concept of operations, in general. ATS may turn out to have limited potential, but it is extremely cost-effective and could serve as a valuable stepping stone to future unmanned developments.” Other countries around the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom , are also looking at loyal wingmen type drones. The U.S. Air Force is already in the process of experimenting with these concepts of operation using Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie and has initiated a separate program called Skyborg to develop an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” that could autonomously operate such a drone. In March, the service said it could begin buying larger numbers of “attritable” drones soon to support the Skyborg project. The US Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie drone., USAF On Apr. 1, the U.K. Royal Air Force also reactivated No. 216 Squadron as part of its own swarming drone effort . Unfortunately, given the COVID-19 pandemic, this unit will have minimal personnel and only conduct limited activities in the immediate future, according to Jane’s 360 . When it comes to Boeing’s Airpower Teaming System effort in Australia, the company seems well on its way to conducting the first flight of its exciting new loyal wingman drone, which is scheduled to occur later this year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 7, 2019",Air Force Wants To Use External Pylons To Arm The B-1B Bomber With 31 Hypersonic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A top U.S. Air Force officer has detailed plans to add the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, as well as the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept , both of which are hypersonic missiles, to the B-1B Bone bomber’s arsenal. He also curiously talked about the potential for these aircraft to carry a conventionally-armed version of the future Long Range Stand Off stealthy cruise missile, something Congress effectively canceled last year . U.S. Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all of America’s bomber fleets, gave an update on future B-1B loadouts in a recent interview with Air Force Magazine . Last year, the service highlighted work to expand the bomber’s ability to carry hypersonic weapons and other new stores, both internally and externally. This all also comes amid already controversial plans to retire 17 of its 60 remaining Bones in the 2021 Fiscal Year and has severely scaled back the activities of the fleet as a whole, prohibiting crews from flying at low altitudes and restricting total annual flight hours, which you can read about more in this past War Zone exclusive . “My goal would be to bring on at least a squadron’s worth of airplanes modified with external pylons on the B-1, to carry the ARRW [Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon] hypersonic cruise missile,” General Ray told Air Force Magazine . He added that the service had contemplated several options for integrating the AGM-183A onto the bombers, “but we believe the easiest, fastest, and probably most effective in the short term will be to go with the external pylons.” At present, B-1 squadron typically has 18 aircraft, according to Air Force Magazine . Ray appears to have misspoken in describing ARRW, which is pronounced “arrow,” as a “cruise missile.” The AGM-183A has an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle as its warhead. The weapon’s rocket booster lofts that vehicle to an appropriate speed and altitude, after which it then glides down along a level trajectory within the Earth’s atmosphere to its target. The weapon’s high speed and unpredictable flight path make it difficult for opponents to detect and track , which makes it hard to move critical assets out of the target area, if at all possible, or otherwise take shelter before the strike hits, or even attempt an intercept . An artist’s conception of an AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon in flight as its nose cone seperates, revealing the unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle warhead., Lockheed Martin Rockwell had designed the Bones to carry external stores on up to eight external hardpoints. The Air Force had also developed special pylons that would have allowed the bombers to carry two nuclear-tipped AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM) on each one. Following the end of the Cold War, the B-1Bs lost their nuclear mission and, as a result, the external pylons fell into disuse. Today, the bombers use just one of the hardpoints to carry the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). Photos of a B-1B bomber during testing with six external pylons fitted., USAF It’s not clear what other modifications or upgrades the B-1Bs might need to be able to physically carry the AGM-183As or how many of these missiles the bombers might be able to carry at once. While we don’t know how much the ARRW weighs, we do know that a B-52H Stratofortress bomber carried a prototype during a test last year using one of its heavyweight underwing pylons , which are rated to carry stores in the 5,000 pound class or lighter. The AGM-86B weighs around 3,200 pounds and the B-1B’s original pylons were each supposed to carry two of them at once. It’s also worth noting that the Air Force’s is looking to halt work on the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) program in its latest budget proposal for the 2021 Fiscal Year in favor of the AGM-183A, specifically because the latter is smaller. The HCSW missile, which the service planned to designate AGM-182A Hacksaw, has a different hypersonic boost-glide vehicle warhead, which is a common design also found on ground and submarine-launched weapons that the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy are working on , respectively. The relevant portions of a request made in January 2019 to designate the HCSW missile as the AGM-182A Hacksaw., USAF via FOIA “The reason we went with ARRW was not that HCSW was bad, but ARRW is smaller,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, explained in March 2020 . “We can carry twice as many on the B-52, and it’s possible it could be on the F-15[E Strike Eagle] … It’s in the class to be able to fit on the centerline.” General Ray did tell Air Force Magazine that some of the B-1s will need significant structural work,” but it’s unclear if this is directly related to plans to integrate the AGM-183A. The bombers have been flown hard in recent years and their airframes have seen greater than expected wear and tear as a result, which is part of the reason for the halt to low-altitude flight operations, which put additional physical stress on the aircraft. The Air Force is also looking at the B-1B as a potential platform to carry the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been leading the development of this powered hypersonic cruise missile, though the Air Force Research Laboratory has also been involved. Air Force Magazine says that the Bones, using external pylons and common rotary launchers in their internal bomb bays, could potentially carry a mix of up to 31 hypersonic missiles in total. An artist’s coneption of a derivative of HAWC that Lockheed Martin has proposed to the US Navy., Joseph Trevithick Interestingly, General Ray also raised the possibility of adding a conventionally-armed variant of the Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) stealthy cruise missile, which is presently in development, to the B-1B’s arsenal in the future. “Right now, we’re not asking for that, based on the prioritization of the nuclear piece, … but there’s things that could change in the future,” he told Air Force Magazine . This is curious because Congress specifically eliminated its requirement for a conventional version of the LRSO in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2019. The law’s language did not expressly prohibit the Air Force from pursuing this capability on its own, but removed an immediate legal demand for the service to do so. Ray said that there could be a demand for this weapon based on a desire for “an even longer-ranged cruise missile with conventional capability” and because the AGM-86 series is “aging out on us.” However, the Air Force has already retired the conventional AGM-86C/D variants and has initiated the development of an “extreme range” variant of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile cruise missile, also known as the AGM-158D or JASSM-XR. The exact range capability the Air Force is seeking from JASSM-XR is unknown, but it is said to be in excess of 1,000 miles , which would already give it a substantially greater range than the AGM-86C/D. In addition, the service is hoping to have this missile, which will leverage existing work on the JASSM, including the AGM-158B JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) version, out of development by 2023, with the first examples hopefully entering service relatively soon thereafter. The nuclear-armed LSRO is not supposed to reach initial operational capability until at least 2030. Air Force personnel prepare to load an AGM-158 JASSM onto a B-1B bomber., USAF It’s possible that Ray’s comments may be informed in some way by his knowledge of what the Air Force, as well as other services, might be doing in the classified realm. The LRSO program itself has been shrouded in secrecy and there are few hard details about the weapon’s overall design or capabilities. In March, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein alluded to the development of at least one classified air-launched anti-ship munition, as well. He told senators at a hearing that the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, or LRASM, which is a derivative of the JASSM, was the only such weapon he could discuss in an unclassified setting. The Air Force has already integrated LRASM onto the B-1B. Regardless, General Ray’s comments do make clear that the Air Force is still very interested in expanding the B-1B’s arsenal and what roles and missions the fleet might be able to perform in the backend of the aircraft’s career. The head of Air Force Global Strike Command noted that integrating new weapons onto the Bones could also help ease the test and evaluation burden on the B-52 fleet, which are presently set to be the primary platform for testing any new hypersonic missiles, as well as other advanced air-launched munitions, in addition to employing them operationally. The new capabilities look set to help the remaining B-1Bs remain relevant to Air Force operations for years to come. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Private Aggressors Stress Test The Air Defenses On The Navy’s Newest Aircraft Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. F-21 Kfir and Mk 58 Hawker Hunter aircraft from the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , or ATAC, recently helped the U.S. Navy stress test the air defense systems on its newest carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford . ATAC is well known for providing those same aircraft as “red air” aggressors for aerial combat training exercises, but a huge portion of its work is actually flying against Navy ships, simulating incoming cruise missiles and hostile aircraft. You can read all about the company’s operations and what its aircraft do in this piece that ran in Air Combat Magazine by our own Tyler Rogoway. On Apr. 6, 2020, the Navy revealed that the tests of Ford ‘s air defenses had taken place, but did not say when specifically they had occurred. The carrier is presently conducting carrier qualifications in the Atlantic Ocean as part of its ongoing post-delivery test and trials, which have run into a number of hurdles since the service formally commissioned the ship in 2017 . The sea-based developmental test, also known as SBDT 6B, was the first time the Ford ‘s fully integrated combat system had faced actual mock aerial adversaries, in the form of ATACs F-21s and Hunters. One of ATAC’s F-21s makes a pass by the USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN A flight of four of ATAC’s Hawker Hunters approach the Ford ., USN USN USN The multi-part event including testing of the carrier’s Dual Band Radar (DBR) integrated with the ship’s two RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) launchers and its pair of RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launchers, the latter of which are optimized for close-in defense. Simulated weapons were used to conduct mock engagements of the aircraft. A sailor loads a device that simulates the launch of a RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) into one of Ford ‘s two launchers for this close-in defense weapon during the air defense systems test., USN USN The DBR has been one of the major sources of problems for the Ford class in the past, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . As it stands now, only Ford and the future USS John F. Kennedy will be equipped with this radar system. The second two ships in the class, the future USS Enterprise and USS Doris Miller , will have a variant of Raytheon’s Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR). The Navy is now no longer sure it will even pursue the Ford class beyond these four ships . Earlier land-based testing of the DBR had shown the system had trouble tracking threats and cueing defensive systems to engage them and was regularly confused by background “clutter” that led it to display false information to operators. It even had difficulties accurately displaying the position of objects of interest. While the F-21s , Israeli offshoots of 1960s-era French-made Mirage fighter jets, and the Hunters , late model variants of a British design that first flew in 1954, are not particularly modern aircraft, they would still give testers a valuable opportunity to see how Ford ‘s radar and other air defense systems performed against actual mock threats over the open ocean. Flying representative threat profiles and carrying radar emitters and electronic warfare pods, the Hunters and F-21s can simulate various subsonic and supersonic threats, respectively, including subsonic anti-ship cruise missiles. By using the contractor-owned and operated jets, the Navy also doesn’t have to provide its own combat jets for these kinds of tests, which would pull pilots and planes away from other tasks and cost substantially more. “SBDT is a stepping stone towards Ford ’s Combat Systems Ship Qualification Trial (CSSQT), and follow-on operational tests by the Navy,” U.S. Navy Commander William Buell, the officer in charge of the carrier’s Combat Direction Center, which manages all of the ship’s defensive systems, said following the testing. “Our SBDT operations ran very smoothly, which is a good indicator of future success on CSSQT.” A view inside the USS Gerald R. Ford ‘s Combat Direction Center during the air defense systems test., USN USN With an eye toward the future combat systems trial, the testing also included a “risk reduction scenario” to prepare for a future test event that involves a Beechcraft AQM-37 Jayhawk “high diving missile.” The AQM-37 is an air-launched supersonic target missile that is capable of simulating supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles. A Jayhawk launch will be part of Ford ‘s CSSQT. Ahead of the SBDT 6B, Ford had also certified various integrated combat systems including its Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon (ATCRB), Identification of Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogator, and its Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) networking systems. The ATCRB and IFF work together to positively identify friendly and hostile aircraft, as well as surface contacts, and to provide for general air traffic control of the airspace around the carrier during operations. The CEC systems, which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone piece , provides a powerful set of data links so the carrier can rapidly exchange targeting and other information with other Navy assets, including other surface ships and aircraft. “We use an [IFF] interrogator system to challenge aircraft transponders for identification,” U.S Navy Operations Specialist 2nd Class Juannietagrace Okeli explained after the test. “The interrogator, cooperative engagement capability, and the Ships Self-Defense Systems (SSDS) work together to provide us the combat identification.” “It was encouraging to see the results of our collective labor pay off and prove the warfighting capability of the class,” U.S. Navy Fire Controlman 2nd Class Sam Lantinga, said following the recent SBDT test. “Without these self-defense systems, Gerald R. Ford wouldn’t be able to deliver lethal effects to our nation’s adversaries.” Beyond the ESSM and RAM launchers, Ford also has three Mk 15 Phalanxes . These are gun-based close-in weapon systems (CIWS), each one of which is armed with a 20mm Vulcan cannon. The ship also has an extensive electronic warfare suite and systems to launch anti-missile countermeasures . Protecting against air and missile threats has always been critical for major Navy capital ships, especially for aircraft carriers . These defensive capabilities have only become more vital as potential “great power” adversaries, such as Russia and China, increasingly field advanced anti-ship weapons, including long-range anti-ship cruise missiles and air and surface-launched anti-ship ballistic missiles. Hypersonic threats are also a growing concern. In addition, smaller nations, and potentially even non-state actors, are increasingly employing more advanced anti-ship weapons that could be employed in the anti-ship role. While certainly less capable than those in service or in development in Russia or China, subsonic cruise missiles and short-range ballistic missiles still present challenges for a defender, especially when used en masse. America’s adversaries could improve the effectiveness of these weapons by combining them with other assets such as small submarines , naval mining , suicide drones , and manned and unmanned suicide boats . https://youtube.com/watch?v=VniuX8whzCU Ford has unfortunately been beset by a host of persistent problems, including issues with its Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), and Advanced Weapons Elevators (AWE), its powerplant , in addition to the aforementioned difficulties with its radar system. among others. Most recently, the Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, revealed that the carrier’s toilets clog regularly and the associated sewage system needs regularly flushing at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. By every indication, the Ford is still far away from becoming capable of conducting actual combat operations, despite the Navy’s best efforts. However, ensuring that its air and missile defenses work as intended is an important step in that direction.

The hulking Milano Bridge , a 1,200-foot-long container ship, had a huge fail yesterday when it was attempting to dock, or at least seemed to be doing so, in Busan, South Korea. The ship approached a pier with the help of a pair of tugboats, but they couldn’t stop the impending calamity. Milano Bridge was seen coming in hot before making a hard turn away from the dock at the last moment, which wasn’t soon enough to keep its huge stern from careening into the towering cranes on the dock, one of which collapsed as if it was made of tin, with its structure falling across the ship’s aft deck area. The other cranes were knocked off their bases, too. Reports say and positioning information states that the ship also impacted another docked further down the pier, the Seaspan Ganges , as well.Â Make sure you have your sound turned up for the first video, it’s nuts!Â https://youtube.com/watch?v=y3RxSTdzNCY You can see some images of the aftermath here .Â Thankfully, nobody was killed in the incident, with a crane operator ending up with a broken ankle after escaping the impact and collapse.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 6, 2020",Navy Secretary Resigns Amid Political Firestorm Over Firing Of Carrier Captain (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly has reportedly resigned a day after a transcript and audio emerged of a speech he gave onboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt this past weekend. Modly had already prompted a political firestorm by firing the commanding officer of the ship, Brett Crozier, ostensibly over a breach of protocol in relation to a letter that officer had sent pleading to get the bulk of his crew off the carrier to help stem a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus onboard. Various outlets have reported that Modly had submitted his resignation on Apr. 7, 2020, which Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is now said to have accepted. Yesterday, President Donald Trump had also said he would get involved in the debacle, which began when Crozier’s letter first leaked to the press on Mar. 31. There has been no official statement yet from either the Navy or the Department of Defense regarding the resignation. Modly technically remains Deputy Secretary of the Navy, having assumed his acting position following the convoluted departure of his predecessor, Richard Spencer, under equally controversial circumstances. CNN has reported that Undersecretary of the Army, James McPherson, will take over as Acting Secretary of the Navy. The Trump Administration has already nominated Kenneth Braithwaite , previously U.S. Ambassador to Norway, to become the next Secretary of the Navy. “Let me be clear, I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naive nor stupid,” Modly said late on Apr. 6, in a public apology that reportedly came at the direction of Esper . “I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.” In his speech onboard Theodore Roosevelt, Modly had suggested that Crozier was either too “naive” or “stupid” to command an aircraft carrier and, if he wasn’t, that he might be guilty of actual criminal misconduct. The Acting Secretary of the Navy also lambasted the media and chastised the crew for their very public display of support for their former captain, who reportedly has now contracted COVID-19 himself, as he left the ship after being relieved. Modly was reportedly on the carrier for just 30 minutes, 15 minutes of which he spent giving his speech. He did not tour the vessel and took no questions from the crew, despite personnel having pre-screened some queries for him to respond to. Yesterday, the Acting Secretary of the Navy had also initially said he unequivocally stood by those remarks. The Navy’s top civilian also made a post defending his decision to fire Captain Crozier on the official Navy website in direct response to a critical op-ed that Tweed Roosevelt, the great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s namesake, had published in The New York Times on Apr. 3. The Navy has since pulled that piece from its website, but archived copies remain widely available online, including at The War Zone . As of Apr. 7, 173 members of Theodore Roosevelt’s crew have tested positive for COVID-19. Thankfully none of them have yet had to be hospitalized. The Navy says it has now tested 61 percent of the crew and moved approximately 2,000 sailors into lodging ashore. Crozier had called for just 10 percent of the carrier’s total crew complement of more than 4,000 personnel to remain on board to help prevent the virus from spreading among them. At the time of writing, the Navy has also not responded to queries from The War Zone about whether the Acting Secretary of the Navy is in any form of quarantine following his visit to the carrier or if he has been tested for COVID-19 following his return to Washington, D.C. The Pentagon has already instituted a number of social distancing and other mitigating measures to help keep the virus from spreading within the Pentagon itself, especially to Secretary of Defense Esper or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley. There has already been a growing chorus of calls, including from prominent members of Congress and retired senior military officers, calling for Modly to resign. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, has called for him to step down, as has Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington State and the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Secretary of Defense Esper has also faced increasing criticism amid the growing debacle. The entire situation appears to have compromised the impartiality of investigations the Navy had been running into Crozier’s actual conduct and the “command climate” of Navy units assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Above all else, this bizarre episode has only underscored what appears to be a growing lack of trust between the rank-and-file and the Navy’s leadership. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 4:50pm EST: Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has now released a statement confirming that he accepted Acting Secretary of the Navy Modly’s resignation and the Undersecretary of the Army Jim McPherson, who actually a former Navy officer, will take up the role of Acting Secretary of the Navy. Esper says he also instructed the Navy’s senior leadership to put the “health, safety, and welfare of USS Theodore Roosevelt ‘s crew first” and “getting the Roosevelt back to sea” second. USNI News has also obtained a copy of Modly’s resignation letter. UPDATE: 6:00pm EST: In one of his last acts as Acting Secretary of the Navy, Modly has addressed the situation in his last Vector , which had been a series of memorandums he had issued once a week to the entire service. In it, he takes responsibility for what he describes as a loss of “situational awareness” in his remarks on board the Theodore Roosevelt . The full text of SECNAV Vector 19 is as follows: “Before I start I want you all to know that I never, ever thought Vector 19 would be my final vector to you. I actually thought it was going to be around Vector 9! That being said, I am incredibly honored to have ever had the chance to have written even Vector 1.” “This past week has been what I have been talking to you about all along—what we can best predict about the future is that it will be unpredictable. No doubt you have all monitored the events this week which placed our Navy in the spotlight in a negative way—largely due to my poor use of words yesterday on the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (TR). You are justified in being angry with me about that. There is no excuse, but perhaps a glimpse of understanding, and hopefully empathy.” “I have been monitoring the crew of the TR and all of ships with coronavirus (COVID-19) cases closely. I have personally spoken with the Commanding Officer (CO) of every ship and installation in which we have such cases. When I walked on the quarterdeck of the TR I lost situational awareness and decided to speak with them as if I was their commander, or their shipmate, rather than their Secretary. They deserved better, and I hope that over the passage of time that they will understand the words themselves rather than the manner in which they were delivered. But what’s done is done. I can’t take it back, and frankly I don’t know if I walked back up that quarterdeck today if I wouldn’t have the same level of emotions that drove my delivery yesterday.” “The crew deserved a lot more empathy and a lot less lecturing—I lost sight of that at the time and I am deeply sorry for some of the words and for how they were spread across the media landscape like a wildfire. I had hoped to transmit a message of love, and duty, and mission, and courage in the face of adversity. Those words are in there, but they are now lost, because of me, and I will regret that for the rest of my life. But, I am not a football head coach, or a master chief, or even the ship’s own CO, I am the Secretary of the Navy and you, and they, should expect more out of me. I own it. “I realize that I have consistently told each and every one of you “Don’t Ever, Ever Give Up the Ship.” That is why it is very important for me to communicate to you why I have submitted my resignation today. We all have to understand what our ship is. I love the Navy and Marine Corps. I love our country, and I love you. You are all on my one big ship. But the ramifications of mistakes, even simple ones, when someone is charged with protecting a ship that large and that important can be fatal. It is not just missiles that can take us down, words can do it too, if we aren’t careful with how and when we use them.” “My lack of situational awareness due to my emotions of the moment did the exact same thing to MY ship, as I would hold you accountable for as you lead yours. I brought incoming fire onto our team and I am convinced that the fire will continue unrelentingly until the target is gone. I know what I have to do save the ship. I have always tried to do the right thing for all of you. Always. I never cared about the title, I cared about the relationships. I trust you all know that and that you know how terribly sad I am right now that I disappointed you by not keeping our ship out of harm’s way. It’s my fault. I own it.” “Now on to the vector:” “In the classic hard rock satire “rock-umentary” movie called “This is Spinal Tap,” there is a scene in which the lead guitarist, Nigel Tufnil, played by Christopher Guest, is explaining how their band is able to take their sound to the next level. He shows the interviewer, played by Rob Reiner, the Spinal Tap amplifiers and explains that instead of going to volume level 10 like all other traditional hard rock amplifiers, Spinal Tap’s amplifiers have an extra level of volume—volume level 11. The interviewer says, “well instead of having 11 why don’t you make each individual level just a little louder than the traditional amplifier—so you know make the 1 a little louder, the 2 a little louder, the 3 a little louder, etc., up to 10?” Nigel looks at him with the apparent inability to grasp the concept of doing something different than the way he has always done it. He pauses, dumbfounded, and simply says, “But, these go to 11.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o” “Does this sound like a familiar story to you? How many times in your Navy or Marine Corps career have you thought about, or even suggested, a different, better way of doing things and the response has been, “Well, that’s not how we do it?” I guarantee that this has happened to you more than once. If not, you must not be in the Department of the Navy and you should not be on the distribution list for this email!” “Don’t worry, this happens everywhere. People and organizations are resistant to change. Change is uncomfortable. The important point is that phrases like “this is how we do it in the Navy” or “this is how we do it in the Marine Corps” can be dual-edged swords. There is great value in stability, in tradition, in order, in a consistent way of doing things that we must respect and appreciate. But when it stifles the characteristics of agility that I have spoken to you about before (velocity, visibility, adaptability, innovation, collaboration, trust, humility, and skepticism), those same “this is how we do it” phrases can erode a team’s ability to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment – like the one that we are in.” “I want to focus on one of these characteristics specifically this week: visibility. Visibility is all about communications up, and perhaps more importantly, down the chain of command. Visibility is also about knowing when and how to appropriately consult and communicate laterally across the organization. For our Navy and Marine Corps team, it must never be about sharing operationally sensitive information for the world to see about your ship, your unit, your acquisition program, your team, your concerns about readiness, your personal views about your command, etc. “In my previous line of work with a big consulting firm, we prided ourselves for being a learning organization. We had training and learning requirements that put us through a variety of different legal, moral, operational, customer, ethical, and leadership challenges. As each challenge was presented, and possible answers discussed, invariably the first thing that was cited that we should do was to “consult.” This did not mean go out and sell a consulting project to a client, rather it meant “consult” with others across the organization, up and down, to seek the best solution to specific problems. It was amazing to me how empowering this was. How much I could learn if I put myself out there to seek it without fear of retribution or resentment.” “In 2010, with that same firm, I was leading a project team in Baghdad assisting U.S. forces with the economic development mission in the country. Out of the blue, in the spring of 2010, my DoD client asked us to split the team and send half to Afghanistan to help the Ministry of Mines develop an official tendering process for its minerals industry. This is a process nation’s use to sell national mineral rights to mining companies. No one on that team had any experience in mining, but the request was urgent. We “consulted.” I reached out broadly to my partners in the US firm, who connected me to our US mining practice leader, who then connected us to our global mining practice leader in London, who then connected us to the most experienced team in the world, with respect to tendering in lesser developed countries. Within days we had the most experienced team in the world engaged in Afghanistan. “Consulting” works. It empowers teams. It is a force multiplier. “In the military culture we must sustain the sanctity of the chain of command. But in the information age in which we all live, that sanctity is only useful to our mission if we use that chain for frequent communications up and down, even if this means skipping steps down if you are the highest responsible person at the top of that chain. The world is moving too fast to do otherwise.” “The events of the last several weeks with respect to my decision to relieve the CO of the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT indicate to me that we have some work to do in this regard, so you must pick up the mantle and fix this. No person should ever be afraid of bringing up issues of concern to their immediate superiors through an established and well understood path that respects both the chain of command and our own individual duty to fulfill our oaths. And, no commander should ever resent or discourage anyone senior in their chain of command from reaching down to gain better situational awareness from the people closest to the problem. That being said, there is a proper, courteous, and respectful way to do this that we must adhere to, especially during times of crisis.” “I know we can do this, it just takes a willingness to recognize it is important. And the next time someone says to you “that’s not the way we do it”, think to yourself, “these go to 11”, smile politely, and then apply yourself even harder to seek a better way.” “I love you all. Know that every second of every minute of every hour of every day of my time leading you has been an honor and a privilege, and I grateful for your friendship, mentorship, and willingness to listen and act on my behalf.” “You know what to do. Take the helm. It’s your ship now. Don’t ever, ever, ever give it up. And forever, Beat Army!” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Around The Globe Indo-Pacific News & Features"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2020","Militants Fire RPG At C-130 Then An MQ-9 Reaper Crew Promptly Locates, Tracks, And Kills Them","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released video that includes a unique clip that an MQ-9 Reaper captured of militants firing a rocket-propelled grenade at a C-130 Hercules airlifter that was performing an air drop of cargo at relatively low altitude. In the full video, the drone’s pilot and sensor operator, who later struck those hostile forces, also offer an interesting behind-the-scenes look at how the unmanned aircraft perform these kinds of armed overwatch missions. The Air Force’s 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, one of the service’s premier drone units, posted the video on YouTube on Apr. 6, 2020. The pilot, 1st Lieutenant Russel, and the sensor operator, Airman First Class Ashley, both assigned to the 20th Attack Squadron , which itself is assigned to the 432nd, but is based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, describe the event. Their last names are not given for operational security reasons, though Russel’s callsign, Turret, is visible on his nametag. No information is given about the date or location of the armed overwatch mission, which could have taken place over any number of countries where the U.S. military is presently engaged overseas. “Most of the time we’re just watching,” 1st Lieutenant Russel said. “We’re collecting information on enemies and just making sure our friendlies are safe and sometimes that involves us providing armed overwatch, which is our capability to strike enemies.” “So, that day, we’re flying a normal eight-hour shift and then comes the end of the shift is when it all went down,” Ashley said. Their MQ-9 was asked to provide overwatch for the C-130’s drop for “severely undersupplied” U.S. forces at a remote outpost. In the video, shot from the infrared camera in the drone’s nose-mounted sensor turret, the C-130 can be seen flying below and the cargo can be seen parachuting down behind it when a bright ball of light goes flying across the screen. Watch a C-130H conduct a nighttime aerial resupply mission in Afghanistan in the video below. “We immediately see from the bottom right corner of our screen a projectile come … towards the C-130,” Russel said. “The sensor immediately slewed to the right corner of origin.” “We have screeners who work with us – they are constantly watching our feed – that helped us confirm that that’s where it was shot from,” Ashley added. Thankfully, the RPG missed the Hercules and the cargo plane. In the video, the airlifter visibly banks to the right, but it’s unclear if that is an evasive maneuver or not. The MQ-9 video feed then picks up a group of individuals leaving a building near the point of origin of the RPG launch. “They all left the building with large weapons,” Russel said. An MQ-9 assigned to the 432nd Wing flies a training mission over the Nevada Test and Training Range., USAF “We know at that point that these are bad guys, they just shot at U.S. forces, so we know something’s about to happen. We know we need to watch these guys,” he continued. “I’m calling the Joint Terminal Attack Controller , or JTAC. I was like ‘hey, this is so-and-so in my MQ-9, we’re supporting this C-130 that did an airdrop, I just saw an RPG shoot across the screen. And his voice immediately changed.” “He pulled up our feed, started watching it, gave us a game plan nine-line,” Ashley said. “Where he’s [the JTAC} at, he’s talking to his commander, but we are only talking to the JTAC.” A “nine-line” refers to the brief that JTACs give to aircraft orbiting above, manned or unmanned, ahead of a close air support strike . It includes a host of relevant information, including the target and its location, the desired direction of attack to avoid hitting friendly forces or innocent bystanders, and more, in a digestible format. Being able to communicate these details rapidly and accurately is critical in these cases, where wasted seconds or miscommunication could have disastrous results . When Ashley says that the JTAC on the ground pulled up the MQ-9’s feed, she means this literally, too. For over a decade and a half, starting with fielding of the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver ( ROVER ) system, the U.S. military as a whole has made major progress in developing capabilities that allow personnel on the ground to connect directly with aircraft above and see what they see what the crew sees through their electro-optical and infrared sensors. This helps speed up the process of positively identify targets during a close air support scenario, makes it easier to avoid hitting friendlies or causing collateral damage, and just improves all around situational awareness for forces on the ground and in the air. “We found the bad guys on the ground, tracked them for a little bit, and ended up prosecuting” a strike on those militants, Ashley said. The time from the RPG went flying toward the C-130 to when MQ-9 engaged the hostile forces was 34 minutes. The entire incident is a prime example of the kind of armed overwatch and persistent surveillance missions that Air Force MQ-9s, as well as their now-retired MQ-1 Predator predecessors, have been providing for years now, though almost exclusively in permissive environments , around the world. These are missions that U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagles also now regularly perform . “You’re hands-on, in the fight, saving our boots on the ground. This is no joke,” Ashley said in the video. “If you want to make a difference to the actual fight that’s out there, this is it.” But the video also comes at a time when the MQ-9 may be entering the back half of its career, as the U.S. military’s focus shifts to preparing for high-end conflicts that will demand more advanced and less vulnerable platforms. In its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, the Air Force announced its intention to stop buying Reapers earlier than expected, which could have a number of major implications, including for the drone’s manufacturer General Atomics , which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Of course, the demand for aircraft, manned and unmanned, to conduct armed overwatch missions to help protect U.S. forces, as well as their allies and partners, isn’t going away. For the foreseeable future, the Reapers will continue to provide this invaluable service for American troops around the world.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 14, 2020",Pilot Takes Amazing Images Of Area 51 And Tonopah Air Base While Skirting Restricted Airspace,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. They are America’s most secretive airbases, Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport, located deep in the massive Nevada Test and Training Range that covers a large portion of southern Nevada. Although there are distant vantage points on the ground that allow views into these highly secure installations, aerial images of them taken close enough to make out any details are rare to nonexistent. Regardless, some may be surprised to hear that private planes do legally fly along the borders and even into some of the ranges that make up the NTTR, offering a one of a kind aerial tour of a land that the government would like you to forget. One such aerial adventure was recently flown by private pilot Gabriel Zeifman in his little Cessna 150. He brought his camera along with him and the results are stunning. Flying very near and even across some of the restricted areas within the NTTR is not unheard of. If the timing is right and the ranges are not in use (referred to as being “cold”), air traffic control can allow routing through the area. A handful of small civilian airports ring the NTTR and planes can’t fly into them without at least passing very near the restricted operating areas that host everything from massive aerial warfare exercises like Red Flag to various test and tactics development sorties . It’s also worth noting that the Russians are allowed to get even closer than any civilian pilot can. Map of the NTTR. Area 51’s airspace, also known as “The Box,” is 4808A. , USAF After spotting Zeifman’s amazing images after he posted them on Reddit, The War Zone reached out to the adventurous flyer. He described his flight into the NTTR and interest in the area to us as such: I’ve had an interest in all the military airspace out this way for a while and figured I had to go check it out. The first time I ventured into the Nellis Ranges was on a flight from Tonopah to Rachel via R4807A where I went down to the edge of that side of 4808A [also known as “The Box”] and got some good views of Groom [Area 51] from the north. After departing Rachel, I was given permission to enter R4806W enroute to Henderson and proceeded to fly the perimeter of The Box and R4808N basically to Yucca Lake. I only had my cell phone camera at the time, so I waited to come back with a good camera. I tried with a friend recently, but that only yielded one decent picture because the weather was less than ideal, so we were quite a bit lower than I had preferred, but we did get to fly through much of R4806W. This last weekend, I was unable to get permission to fly into any of the restricted areas, so I took the opportunity to get some great pictures of TNX [Tonopah Test Range Airport] as I skirted the perimeter. I don’t have any kind of special authorization in these airspaces, they’re just random transits that I’ve been given enroute to other places when the airspace is cold. The plane is just a standard Cessna 150. Asides from seeing the legendary Groom Lake, it’s been quite neat to see the other parts of the ranges including all the targets and infrastructure. Gabriel flying with Groom Lake in the distance. , Gabriel Zeifman Gabriel after landing on El Mirage dry lake bed in Southern California. , Gabriel Zeifman Yes, his Cessna 150 has nose art and here Gabriel seems to be modeling some of his own!, Gabriel Zeifman The two main aviation attractions in the NTTR are historic, to say the least. Area 51 really doesn’t need any introduction . Fabled aircraft like the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes were born there, as were game-changing test aircraft like Have Blue and Tacit Blue , not to mention more modern types, such as the modified Stealth Black Hawks that were used in the Bin Laden raid , and who knows what else. Tonopah Test Range Airport once housed America’s secret MiG adversary squadron , as well as the F-117 Nighthawk force while it remained shrouded in secrecy . In more recent times, it was the early home to the RQ-170 Sentinel spy drone and the base remains a major reservoir for Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) programs , such as housing foreign-made radars and missile launchers , that are used for testing and training purposes. It also still hosts the remnants of the F-117 force and is the most likely locale to bed down any budding new semi-operational clandestine aircraft force. So, these are the installations where aviation’s crown jewels are developed and kept, some of which we may never know existed. You can see the results of Zeifman’s Tonopah Test Range Airport and Area 51 aerial tour in the amazingly detailed images below. He even caught a new development at “Dreamland” during his adventure: Tonopah Test Range Airport, Gabriel Zeifman An amazing shot looking south. Note the runway construction and displaced threshold we have mentioned in the past, as well as the ongoing revitalization of the “Janet Airlines” terminal at the very south end of the base. While the terminal area is under construction, a temporary terminal area appears to have been relocated near the center of the closest blocks, or ‘canyons,” of hangars.

So there you have it, Tonopah Test Range Airport and Area 51 like you have never seen it before. We have to stress that this was not some rogue flight. Private aircraft remain under the watchful eye and direction of air traffic control as they pass through the area. As these images show, when the conditions are right, a private pilot can get pretty close to these famed installations without breaking any rules, putting anyone in danger, or causing a hugely expensive distraction for the Air Force. If some idiot pilot were to disobey orders or step into restricted airspace, they would regret it greatly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 1, 2020",Trump Now Says He Is Going To Intervene In Aircraft Carrier Captain Firing Fiasco (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump now says he will look into the circumstances surrounding the firing of U.S. Navy Captain Brett Crozier, saying he doesn’t believe the officer’s career should be at risk for “having a bad day.” The service booted Crozier from his job as commanding officer of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, which is presently experiencing a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, after he sent an impassioned letter asking to get the bulk of his crew off the ship to stem the disease’s spread. Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly has come under increasing fire for that decision after a transcript and audio recording of a speech he gave on the carrier this weekend, in which he disparaged Crozier, the media, and the crew, emerged earlier today . The Navy relieved Crozier from his command on Apr. 2, two days after he sent the letter, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The service’s official reason for doing so is that senior leaders lost faith in the captain’s ability to command because of his poor judgment in disseminating the letter to multiple recipients via unclassified channels, which Modley claims would have made it likely that it would leak to the press. Modly also says the letter contained details about Theodore Roosevelt’s readiness and the situation on board the ship that could have been of use to America’s adversaries, primarily China. “I haven’t heard it [Modly’s speech] exactly, I haven’t heard – I heard they had a statement that was made and if that were the statement it’s a strong statement,” Trump said said at the daily press conference regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. “I must tell you I’ve heard very good things about the gentleman, both gentlemen, by the way, I will say this, about both gentlemen, and I may look into it only from the standpoint that something should be resolved, ’cause I’m hearing good things about both people.” “If two good people and they’re arguing and I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments. I’m good at settling these arguments. So, I may look into it in great detail and I’ll be able to figure it out very fast,” Trump continued. “His [Captain Crozier’s] career prior to that was very good, so I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on, because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day.” A composite image of Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly, at right, and Captain Brett Crozier, at left., USN/DOD Crozier saw an unprecedented outpouring of support from his crew after being relieved from command. The captain has also received accolades from numerous politicians and retired military officers for prioritizing the welfare of his crew. Trump had previously been especially critical of Crozier and his letter, siding with Modly’s decision to fire the captain. The President’s position now seems to be evolving in the face of growing outrage surrounding the Acting Secretary of the Navy’s speech onboard Theodore Roosevelt over the weekend. You can read a full transcript of and listen to an audio recording of Modly’s remarks here . However, Trump remained critical of Crozier’s decision to send the letter. “Letters should not have been sent to many people, unclassified, that was a mistake,” the President said. “It’s a mistake that shouldn’t have been made, because it’s unfair to the families of the people on the ship because they get nervous and it shows weakness and there’s nothing weak about us now,” he added. “We don’t want to have letter-writing campaigns where the fake news finds a letter or gets a leak.” This, in some ways, reflects Modly’s remarks on the Theodore Roosevelt . Trump called the parts of the speech he had seen or heard, or heard about, “rough,” as well as “strong.” “It was betrayal [what Crozier did]. And I can tell you one other thing: because he did that he put it in the public’s forum and it’s now become a big controversy in Washington. D.C. and across the country. About a martyr CO [commanding officer] who wasn’t getting the help he needed therefore had to go through the Chain of Command, a chain of command which includes the media,” Modly had told the carrier’s crew over the weekend. “The media has an agenda and the agenda that they have depends on which side of the political aisle they sit and I’m sorry that’s the way the country is now but it’s the truth and so they use it to divide us and use it to embarrass the Navy. They use it to embarrass you.” “I understand you love the guy [Captain Crozier],” the Acting Secretary of the Navy had added. “It’s good that you love him. But you’re not required to love him.” On Apr. 5, Modly had also told The Washington Post’ s David Ignatius that he had specifically made his decision to fire Crozier, and do so quickly, at least in part, to try to ensure that President Donald Trump would not insert himself into the process. Trump was a driving force in the ouster of Modly’s immediate predecessor, Richard Spencer, last year over the treatment of controversial SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who the Navy had acquitted of war crimes and who the President had pardoned of a remaining charge of “wrongfully pos[ing] for an unofficial picture with a human casualty.” “I didn’t want that to happen again,” Modly explained to Ignatius. “I didn’t want to get into a decision where the president would feel that he had to intervene because the Navy couldn’t be decisive… If I were president, and I saw a commanding officer of a ship exercising such poor judgment, I would be asking why the leadership of the Navy wasn’t taking action itself.” A preliminary Navy investigation into Crozier’s actions and the “command climate” across units assigned to its Pacific Fleet was supposed to go to the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Mike Gilday, today, but that review has gotten delayed. Gilday has now approved an extension. “This extension will allow additional time to gather facts and refine the inquiry’s recommendations,” the Navy said in a statement to USNI News . “The inquiry remains in progress and is expected to be completed soon. It will take additional time for the inquiry’s recommendations to be reviewed and endorsed by Adm. Gilday.” In the meantime, it looks increasingly like Trump is set to get more deeply involved in the Navy’s latest debacle. UPDATE: 8:05pm EST: Modly has now also issued a rebuttal defending his decision to fire Captain Crozier in response to an op-ed that Tweed Roosevelt, the great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s namesake, had published in The New York Times on Apr. 3. The Acting Secretary of the Navy’s response is as follows: “I have the utmost respect for Mr. Roosevelt and his family’s immense heritage of service to the nation. In the case of Captain Crozier, however, he is wrong. I suspect he has no other motive than to defend a courageous man, a man in the arena, but he simply does not have access to the relevant facts that led to the captain’s dismissal.” “Capt. Crozier’s emotional letter on official Navy letterhead, addressed to no one in particular, was attached to an email which he distributed broadly to multiple addressees. It began “My Fellow Naval Aviators.” It included, and intentionally excluded, various people from his direct chain of command.” “In the body of the email to which his letter was attached Captain Crozier wrote, “I fully realize that I bear responsibility for not demanding more decisive action the moment we pulled in (to Guam), but right now my only priority is the continued well-being of the crew and embarked staff.” While this may have been his self-assessment, I know that no one in his chain of command, up to and including me, who felt that Captain Crozier bore any responsibility for not demanding more decisive action at that time.” “The facts are that Capt. Crozier’s direct chain of command, up to the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, had been communication with him well before (and after) he sent the email. So had my office. I asked my Chief of Staff to call him just after the ship pulled into Guam.  He did so twice, and Capt. Crozier expressed no alarm to him at all.  Bottom line, the public disclosure of Capt. Crozier’s letter had no impact on the flow of support to the ship. None. The crew of the ship was already being tested as rapidly as possible, isolated as necessary, and moved off the ship to quarantine. That was all happening to the greatest extent possible while still providing for the safety of the ship and all those still aboard.” “Capt. Crozier did tell us that he was impatient with the pace of moving Sailors off the ship. We were ALL impatient with the pace. Securing 4,000 individual rooms suitable for isolation on Guam in the middle of a pandemic-forced shutdown is not a simple task. That being said, in less than a week, thanks in large part to the Government of Guam and the support of the rest of the Pacific Fleet, we have secured nearly 3,700. That plan was in action well prior to Capt. Crozier writing his letter, and it continues to be executed today.” “What the public release of his letter did do, however, was unnecessarily create a public panic, when what was called for was calm. In my view, this is one of the main areas where Captain Crozier “bears responsibility.” It was his lapse of judgment in a moment of adversity that led to my loss of confidence in him.” “I don’t doubt Captain Crozier’s love for his crew. But in my view, he did serious harm to his Sailors and the rest of our Navy when he created an atmosphere of crisis, while it was his primary duty to be a steady hand on a stormy sea. He did not send his dire warning on classified networks, or place any markings to suggest the information was classified, sensitive, or for official use only. While this may sound mundane to the average citizen, it is unacceptable behavior for the commanding officer of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, and it should never be tolerated. As a civilian leader responsible to the American public for their safety and security, as well as that of every Sailor and Marine serving and standing the watch, I will not.” “Sensitive information about the material condition of our biggest and most powerful warship made its way out into the public arena, in the hands of our adversaries. So did statements about political decisions outside the purview of the military. It was my determination that the Navy could not afford to wait to see if this lapse of judgement was just an aberration, or even the Captain’s new normal in the midst of a challenge. The stakes of our national security are simply much too high for that.” “After all, Mr. Roosevelt, Captain Crozier was the Commanding Officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and I am relatively certain your great grandfather would have demanded much more under pressure. I certainly do, and we all must.” UPDATE: 9:15pm EST: The Navy has issued a statement from Acting Secretary of the Navy Modly apologizing for his comments to the crew of the Theodore Roosevelt and stating clearly that “I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naïve nor stupid.” This comes hours after Modly had said categorically that he stood by his remarks . An internal Navy public affairs guidance instructing any sailor that had recorded Modly’s remarks and posted them online to take them down immediately has also leaked out to the press. It also advises against “bashing a senior leader online.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Carriers Navies Nimitz Class Sea U.S. Navy USS Theordore Roosevelt (CVN-71)"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",New Details Emerge About Snap Deployment Of B-52s To Diego Garcia During Iran Crisis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Six U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortresses that deployed to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean earlier this year flew marathon sorties to drop bombs in Afghanistan, more than 2,500 miles away. The Pentagon had sent the bombers to remote air base ostensibly to have them in position to respond to potential Iranian aggression in the Middle East, while also keeping them safely out of the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles . Reports first emerged that the B-52s were headed to Diego Garcia on Jan. 6, 2020, and satellite imagery that The War Zone exclusively obtained from Planet Labs confirmed that the first two bombers arrived at the base two days later. All six aircraft were assigned to the 20th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The deployment formally ended on Mar. 31, according to the Air Force, though it is unclear if all of the bombers have actually departed Diego Garcia. “Shortly after our arrival at Diego Garcia, our mission supporting CENTCOM’s [U.S. Central Command’s] regional security objectives focused on the fight in Afghanistan while maintaining a response to Iranian aggression,” U.S. Air Force Major Johnathan Radtke, the 20th’s director of operations, said in a statement regarding the deployment. “The B-52’s role as a long-range strike platform was proven daily, supporting operations and combatant commands. In terms of capability, no other asset brings an equal weapons load or reliability.” “The time from official notification to our first jets departing from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, was 26 hours, making it one of the fastest-ever B-52 deployments,” he added. A cloudy satellite image of Diego Garcia dated Feb. 14, 2020, showing all six B-52s at the base., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The Air Force says the six aircraft flew “more than” 1,300 flight hours of combat operations across over 90 sorties. It’s not clear how many of those were over Afghanistan and how many of them might have been patrols elsewhere in the Middle East, including over the Persian Gulf. On Feb. 15, a B-52 flew an unusual mission over Somalia , as well. The Air Force never said where that bomber launched from, but the most likely base was Diego Garcia. Without knowing exactly how many flight hours or total sorties the 20th’s B-52s flew, it’s impossible to determine a hard average time for each one of those missions. However, 1,300 hours across 90 sorties comes to just short of 14 and a half hours per sortie. It’s an approximately 2,900-mile-long straight shot from Diego Garcia to Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, including flight time over the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Pakistan. An over-water flightpath from Diego Garcia to the middle of the Persian Gulf would be about as long. A composite showing the general location of Diego Garco in the Indian Ocean, the entire island, and the air base, as well as a historical shot of B-52 bombers there., Google Earth/USAF A map showing the shortest distance between Diego Garcia, to the South, and Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, showing the extreme distances involved in flying strikes against targets in that country from the Indian Ocean base., Google Maps It would take a Stratofortress around 11 hours to complete the round trip to Eastern Afghanistan at a typical cruising speed of around 525 miles per hour. This, of course, doesn’t include the additional time the bombers would have spent loitering over the battlefield and conducting their strikes. We don’t know where the B-52s flew their strikes, but fighting in that part of the country, particularly between U.S. forces and ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan, has been particularly heavy in recent months amid a shaky peace process going on between the U.S. government and the Taliban. This also isn’t the first time B-52s have flown strikes in Afghanistan from Diego Garcia. The bombers flew these extremely long sorties for years after the start of U.S. combat operation in that country in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. A now dated photo of B-52s at Diego Garcia., DOD It’s an extremely inefficient concept of operations. “We had to plan so disruptions in the supply chain wouldn’t affect operations,” the 20th’s Radtke said. The Air Force also says that the deployment presented communications challenges. This is why, years ago now, the Air Force had shifted to routinely basing B-52s, as well as other bombers, at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is much closer to Afghanistan, as well as Iraq. The service also deployed Stratofortresses to Al Udeid last year with the express purpose of deterring Iran. It also experimented with a short-notice deployment of B-1B Bone bombers to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. military re-established a presence in 2019. However, Al Udeid is well within the range of Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal . Unprecedented cruise missile and suicide drone strikes on oil-related infrastructure in Saudi Arabia also demonstrated that Iran, either directly or via its regional proxies, could strike at targets on the other side of the Persian Gulf with other weapons, as well. The decision to deploy the B-52s Diego Garcia in January seemed especially prudent after Iran launched an equally unprecedented ballistic missile barrage aimed U.S. forces in neighboring Iraq on Jan. 7, the day after the first bombers left for the Indian Ocean. Those strikes were in retaliation for the U.S. government’s decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Quds Forces, in Baghdad on Jan. 3. In the face of these and other attacks, President Donald Trump and his Administration have repeatedly decided not to strike at targets on Iranian soil, despite threats to do so, though the U.S. military has targeted Iranian proxies in Iraq. So, it’s not entirely surprising that the Air Force would exploit the long-range capabilities of the B-52s in Diego Garcia to conduct operations over Afghanistan from Diego Garcia to meet other operational demands in Afghanistan while also ensuring some portion of the bomber force was available to respond to a crisis relating to Iran. The deployment also simply highlighted the immense value that Diego Garcia provides to the U.S. military on a strategic level. Beyond the air base on the island, it also serves as a staging location for one of Military Sealift Command’s two Prepositioning Ship Squadrons . These are small fleets of cargo ships that are pre-loaded with tons of military equipment and munitions and are on call to respond relatively quickly to emerging crises. Facilities on the remote island also support space-monitoring and top-secret missions . Now, at least for the meantime, the B-52’s time at Diego Garcia has come to an end again. It remains to be seen if Stratofortresses, or other bombers, start making more routine trips to the Indian Ocean outpost as tensions with Iran still remain high and amid the ever-present potential for other crises to emerge in the Middle East, East African , and Pacific regions.

As we reported at the time , the Pentagon planned to send six of the bombers there as a contingency for a potential conflict with Iran. They have slowly trickled in over the days and weeks that followed the original deployment announcement and they have remained there since. The images below were taken yesterday, Feb. 14, 2020, showing the bombers on the sprawling apron at Diego Garcia. Note that six were seen in one image and four in the other. This is common as some of the bombers will execute long-range sorties in the region or even transit to and from the U.S. to augment or replace ones that are already on the island.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The regional sorties can be for training or operational needs. Somalia remains a highly complex country that continues to experience deep instability. Piracy, while less of a concern than it was a decade ago, continues to be an issue. The B-52H carries a Sniper electro-optical and infrared pod that is primarily used for targeting, but it also can and is also used for what is called non-traditional information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (NTISR) gathering. Having the B-52s scan the littorals off Somalia for potential nefarious activities, such as smuggling or piracy, and/or gathering intelligence on targeted sites is all within the bomber’s wheelhouse. In fact, the Air Force’s B-1Bs and B-52Hs are known to do exactly this over the Carribean in support of counter-drug smuggling operations. You can read all about this unique application of America’s hardest-hitting airpower in this past piece of ours . In 2017, President Donald Trump’s Administration also designated the southern part of the country, in which Koyama Island is situated, as an “ area of active hostilities .” This led to a significant expansion in U.S. military activities aimed at Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda’s franchise in Somalia, including a particularly notable spike in airstrikes against members of the terrorist group. So, it is also possible that this sortie was a signal meant for Al Shabaab. On Jan. 5, 2020, the group launched a brazen attack on an airstrip that U.S. military personnel and contractors use in neighboring Kenya, known as Manda Bay, as well as another forward operating location nearby, known as Camp Simba. The terrorists killed one U.S. military servicemember and two American contractors and destroying a mix of six fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. A picture Al Shabaab released during the attack on Manda Bay in January 2020, showing one of the aircraft that was damaged., Al Shabaab That attack had come just over three months after Al Shabaab launched a raid on another major U.S. forward operating base at Baledogle in Somalia, which did not result in any fatalities or significant damage, according to U.S. Africa Command. That incident prompted subsequent American airstrikes against the terrorist group. Koyama Island is situated around 85 miles northeast of the Kenyan border and some 25 miles southwest of Kismayo, the largest city in Somalia’s semi-independent Jubaland region.

We call on the Federal Government and all Member States to work constructively together to fight our common enemy al-Shabaab.” Townsend’s trip to Jubaland had immediately followed a visit to Kenya, including the airstrip at Manda Bay, which is located some 60 miles from the border with Somalia. In January, testifying before Congress, the AFRICOM chief admitted that the defenses at the sites in Kenya were lacking and that he was concerned about the potential for another attack. A member of the US Army provides security during the delivery of additional supplies to Manda Bay, Kenya on Feb. 5, 2020., USAF Following the attacks Kenya, the U.S. military immediately deployment elements of a contingency response force, known as the East Africa Response Force, based in Djibouti, to reinforce security there. Additional physical defenses are also under construction now . “We weren’t as prepared, and we’re digging in to find out why that is the case,” Townsend told lawmakers. “Al Shabaab has shown their reach, and the danger that they pose, and I think that we need to take that seriously.” US Army troops build a defensive position at Manda Bay in January 2020 following the Al Shabaab attack., USAF A B-52 sortie would also make clear to Al Shabaab how serious the United States is taking the situation. It could also have conducted some training with U.S. forces and their local partners, which would also better enable the bombers to be employed over the country during a crisis. It’s also worth noting that this isn’t the first time Air Force B-52s have conducted ostensible training missions around the African continent that clearly demonstrated the ability of those aircraft to respond to regional contingencies. In 2016, as part of an exercise known as Just Hammer , one of the bombers flew a mock mission from RAF Fairford that took it off the coast of North Africa.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 7, 2020","Navy Secretary Slams Captain Of COVID-19 Stricken Carrier, Media In Surprise Visit To Ship (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly made a surprise visit to the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , which is presently docked in Guam amid a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus on board, this weekend and gave a terse speech regarding the firing of the ship’s former commanding officer Captain Brett Crozier. Last week, a letter from Crozier, in which he pleaded with his superiors to allow the bulk of the crew to leave the ship to stem the spread of the virus, leaked to the press, which subsequently led to Modly relieving him of his command. Videos emerged afterward of the carrier’s crew giving the captain, who has now reportedly contracted the virus himself, a hero’s sendoff . Reuters was first to report that Modly had flown out to Guam to visit the carrier and make the speech, in which Modly reportedly suggested Crozier’s actions had been “stupid.” Â Vice Adm. Bill Merz, the commanding officer of the U.S. 7th Fleet, a top Navy headquarters in Japan that oversees operations in the Western Pacific, also visited the ship . The Navy’s top civilian official said that the captain may have been either “too naive or too stupid” to run the ship because of his decision to send the letter in an unclassified format to a large number of recipients, which made it easier to leak to the press, according to the transcript now circulating online .Â Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly, DOD The Navy’s official justification for relieving Crozier was a loss of confidence in his ability to command as a result of the letter, which Modly has said was unnecessarily alarmist, and over how it was disseminated, allowing granular details about Theodore Roosevelt ‘s readiness to become publicly known, including to America’s adversaries. The service has not directly accused the captain of publicly releasing the letter himself. “If he didn’t think, in my opinion, that this information wasn’t going to get out into the public, in this day and information age that we live in, then he was either too naive or too stupid to be a commanding officer of a ship like this,” Modly said, according to the transcript, that a member of Theodore Roosevelt ‘s crew reportedly made from a recording of the speech, which was carried over the ship’s intercom system. “The alternative is that he did this on purpose. And that’s a serious violation of the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice], which you are all familiar with.” Modly did not elaborate on what parts of the UCMJ, the U.S. military’s internal justice system, Crozier might have violated through his actions. It is a serious accusation that implies what the captain did may not only warrant on-judicial disciplinary action, but also criminal charges. Captain Brett Crozier, seen earlier in the USS Theodore Roosevelt ‘s most recent deployment, before COVID-19 outbreak sidelined the carrier in Guam, addresses the crew., USN The Acting Secretary of the Navy also slammed the media and chastised the crew for its display of support for Crozier as he left the ship after being relieved. “It was betrayal [what Crozier did]. And I can tell you one other thing: because he did that he put it in the public’s forum and it’s now become a big controversy in Washington. D.C. and across the country. About a martyr CO [commanding officer] who wasn’t getting the help he needed therefore had to go through the Chain of Command, a chain of command which includes the media,” Modly said according to the transcript. “The media has an agenda and the agenda that they have depends on which side of the political aisle they sit and I’m sorry that’s the way the country is now but it’s the truth and so they use it to divide us and use it to embarrass the Navy. They use it to embarrass you.” “So think about that when you cheer the man off the ship who exposed you to that,” Modly added, after talking about the burden the letter had also put on authorities Guam’s territorial authorities. “I understand you love the guy. It’s good that you love him. But you’re not required to love him.” You can read the full purported transcript below: via Reddit via Reddit via Reddit via Reddit Crozier had sent his letter on Mar. 30, 2020, in which he proposed moving 90 percent of the carrier’s crew of more than 4,000 personnel off the ship and into quarantine ashore to help stem the spread of the virus. “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s former captain wrote. “If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset â€“ our Sailors.” There have been a number of other reports suggesting that the U.S. military response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been uneven. There is clearly an ongoing debate across the services about how to balance maintaining readiness to respond to potential crises with taking steps to protect personnel from the virus. After Crozier’s letter became public, Modly said the captain had mischaracterized the situation on the ship in his missive, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , and that things were not as serious as he made them out to be. The Acting Secretary of the Navy has also accused the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s former commanding officer of not expressing his concerns to him directly when offered the chance in the days before the letter went out.Â As of Apr. 5, the Navy said it had tested approximately 50 percent of the Theodore Roosevelt’s crew and that there were 155 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Crozier himself has now reportedly contracted the virus , as well. Navy personnel prepare a convoy of vehicles to transfer personnel from the USS Theodore Roosvelt, seen in the background, to facilities ashore in Guam for quarantine., USN It’s unclear how many more sailors may be displaying symptoms. There is also substantial evidence that individuals infected with the virus may be asymptomatic for weeks, but still may be able to transmit it to others. In addition, Crozier’s letter specifically noted that a number of individuals who initially tested negative later tested positive, underscoring who rapidly the coronavirus can spread among groups working and living in close quarters, such as on a warship. This is an issue that The War Zone explored in detail after the first reports of COVID-19 cases aboard Theodore Roosevel t emerged in March.Â The Navy’s plan was to have moved approximately 2,700 personnel off the carrier and into hotels or other facilities on Guam for quarantine by Apr. 3. The service failed to meet that goal. There is also no indication that there are plans to follow through with Crozier’s proposal to leave just 10 percent of the crew on the ship to perform essential functions, including operating and maintaining the carrier’s two nuclear reactors and providing security. Whether Acting Secretary Modly was right to relieve Crozier of his command so quickly or not, and do so amid the ongoing outbreak onboard the ship before completing a formal investigation into his actions, his decision has prompted a massive backlash , including among former military officials and politicians. Just days ago, Modly told The Washington Post’ s David Ignatius that his decision was, at least in part, driven by a fear that President Donald Trump would insert himself into the process, making it even more politicized. Modly’s immediate predecessor, Richard Spencer, had gotten pushed out in a convoluted series of events that followed Trump’s controversial decision to pardon Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who had been accused of war crimes. “I didnâ€™t want that to happen again,” Modly explained to Ignatius. “I didnâ€™t want to get into a decision where the president would feel that he had to intervene because the Navy couldnâ€™t be decisive… If I were president, and I saw a commanding officer of a ship exercising such poor judgment, I would be asking why the leadership of the Navy wasnâ€™t taking action itself.” Trump has publicly expressed his support for Modly’s decision. Other politicians have already called for investigations and hearings into the Navy’s decision. For its part, the service says it is investigating Crozier’s conduct and well as the “ command climate ” across units assigned to its Pacific Fleet. If nothing else, the Acting Secretary of the Navy’s speech on board the Theodore Roosevelt looks set to further inflame and politicize the debacle as the service continues to try to fight the COVID-19 outbreak among the carrier’s crew and get the ship back to an operational state. We will update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 1:05pm EST: Audio has now emerged of the speech being broadcast aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt . Sailors on the ship can be heard reacting negatively to Modly’s comments. Go to about 1:55 to hear sailors yell ""WHAT THE F-"" when Modly calls Crozier stupid. This audio is even more brutal than the transcript. Who in his team thought this would go over well? https://t.co/9LQAQcam4h — Aaron Mehta (@AaronMehta) April 6, 2020 Listen to the entire speech for yourself here. Â The Navy has issued an official response, stating that the transcript is not official and that Modly’s remarks were “intended to be private,” but not explicitly denying the transcript’s content or that of the audio that is now available online. Just in: Navy official pushes back on leak of Acting SecNav Modly remarks criticizing fired Capt. Crozier as ""too stupid or too naive"" to lead: â€œThere is no official transcript of the Secretaryâ€™s remarks to the crew of USS Theodore Roosevelt."" Remarks intended to be private. — Jack Detsch (@JackDetsch) April 6, 2020 UPDATE: 1:40pm EST: Acting Secretary of the Navy Modly has issued his own statement regarding the speech, which he says he stands behind. It’s hard to see Modly’s speech, and the idea that he expected it to remain “private,” as hypocritical given what he has said about Crozier’s letter and its contents. UPDATE: 2:30pm EST: The Navy has released the latest details about the COVID-19 cases among Theodore Roosevelt ‘s crew. The service says it has now tested 61 percent of the crew and that there are 173 confirmed cases, none of which have so far required hospitalization. In addition, 1,999 members of the crew are now in lodging ashore.Â Just in:  As of today, 61% of the USS Theodore Roosevelt crew have been tested for COVID-19, with 173 positive cases so far.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 11, 2019",Is This Base Handover Ceremony In Iraq Happening At A Low Budget Shakespeare Festival? (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Child’s pizza parlor and arcade? High school drama department set? Medieval Times liquidation sale? I have no fucking clue, but for some reason, this is the backdrop for the official sign over of a huge coalition base in Iraq’s Anbar Province to Iraqi Security Forces. The Iraqi Ministry of Defense posted the clip on its official Twitter account today, showing a fairly straightforward formal turnover of the massive Al Habbaniyah Air Base—better known by its Saddam-era name, Al Taqaddum Air Base—that had been under the control of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR). This is another step in America’s now accelerated drawdown of forces in the war-torn country. But what’s so weird is the choice of backdrop for the handover ceremony, which looks like some low-budget European castle set complete with turrets, starry-sky backdrop, and twinkling Christmas lights. It’s random and tacky. Really, really random and tacky. It is unexplained what the heck this thing is or why it exists, let alone why, of all places, they chose to do the signing ceremony there. There even is also a very casual dress code for the landmark event, with one dude wearing a t-shirt that reads “HOME” and another in a pastel polo. Here is the complete statement about the handover from CJTF-OIR: SOUTHWEST ASIA – Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) conducted a ceremony with Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to transfer the Coalition area of Al Taqaddum Air Base (TQ), Iraq, April 4, 2020. Due to Iraqi Security Forces’ success in the campaign against Daesh, the Coalition is adjusting its positioning in Iraq. These military movements are long-planned in coordination with the Government of Iraq. These pre-planned base transfers are not related to recent attacks against Iraqi bases hosting Coalition troops, or the ongoing COVID-19 situation in Iraq. “The transfer of Taqaddum (Habbaniya) air base is another step forward in the ongoing partnership between Iraqi Security Forces and the anti-ISIS international military Coalition,” said Brig. Gen. Vincent Barker, CJTF-OIR director of sustainment. “Over the last month we have transferred four bases to full ISF control. This wouldn’t be possible without the ISF’s proven capability to bring the fight to ISIS. The Coalition will continue to support our partners against the evils of Daesh.” Since 2015, TQ has hosted U.S. and other Coalition forces who trained Iraqi Security Forces and acted as advisors in the Iraqi operations center in support of the fight against ISIS. TQ was primarily operated by U.S. Marines but also hosted Italian, Canadian, and Spanish forces. In early 2016, Coalition advisors supported the Iraqi Army in its recapture of Ramadi and Fallujah from ISIS control. CJTF-OIR will relocate and consolidate personnel and equipment from several Iraqi bases throughout 2020. The ISF increasingly conducts independent operations in the fight against Daesh and the defense of their homeland including the 2020 “Heroes of Iraq” and 2019’s “Will of Victory” campaigns. CJTF-OIR remains in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq and continues anti-ISIS advising. Currently, training operations are temporarily paused due to COVID-19 precautions. The Coalition will operate from fewer locations, but remains committed to supporting our partners in their fight against Daesh. Coalition troops will depart TQ after the completion of equipment transfers to the ISF, in the coming days. DoD Although CJTF-OIR says that this base transfer was long-planned, an accelerated drawdown of forces and the move to relocate those still in the country to more defensible positions comes after a spate of nefarious Iranian-backed proxy forces activity, some of which has turned deadly , in recent weeks. Patriot air defense batteries have finally arrived to guard key coalition operating bases that remain in the country as top U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump , have warned of a potential pending offensive by Iranian proxies against U.S. and coalition forces in the region. Some have found this puzzling as Iran is reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and even Iranian proxies in Iraq have said they will not attack coalition forces if they continue to drawdown. There have also been reports that the United States has been at least exploring plans for a massive offensive against Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. Regardless, I have no clue what exactly is going on with this wacky backdrop, or the dude in the ‘HOME’ t-shirt, but it is pretty damn bizarre and funny looking. I guess it’s just another one of the pile of peculiar head-scratchers that have come out of the last 17 years of a near-continuous American military presence in Iraq. UPDATE: A reader who has been deployed to the base gave us a great background on this wacky thing: The ‘winter fortress’, as we called it, covered an entire wall in the dining hall. For context, it was allegedly in the contract with Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) that they do something elaborate for every holiday—desserts, decorations, etc. As most of the KBR contractors are from Eastern Europe of SE Asia, most of the decorations reflected their best guess on what western countries would have as decorations for said holidays and therefore usually had a gaudy and bizarre flair. Rumor had it that a few years back, KBR had a monetary surplus from what they were supposed to provide by way of food and decorations, and so, during one Christmas, they used it to construct the winter fortress. Apparently they were very proud of this endeavor, as the fortress stood resolute, in its ten feet of plywood glory, towering over us as we ate in the chow hall, during all seasons and many holidays, a monument to government waste and absurdity.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though Top Gun: Maverick’s release has been delayed to next December due to the COVID-19 nightmare we are all living through, the promotions team behind the film is still trickling out some behind the scenes footage to keep people’s interest in the film. The most intriguing part of the second trailer that was released was a shot of a fictional hypersonic test jet literally blowing the roof off a guard shack during its departure, with Ed Harris looking on. You can read more about that trailer and the shot in question in this past piece of ours . Now, we get to see a bit more about how they captured that sequence, including using a Blue Angels F/A-18 Hornet to test and prepare for the shot. As we originally stated, the scene was filmed at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and the guard shack shown is a set-piece designed for the movie. It is almost comical in its placement for those familiar with aviation as it sits right at the edge of the runway overrun. In the newly released video, you can see one of the Blue Angels’ jets, smoke on, doing a high-speed pass over the shack and the production crew at very low level, which results in concussive shock and a big swirling storm of smoke and dust. Check it out for yourself: https://www.instagram.com/p/B-im3s0p8Bk Here is the trailer version. The scene in question is the dramatic bumper at the end at 2:10 runtime: We also got another quick glimpse of the Blue Angel flyby in a previous behind the scenes extended video that was released. It is most likely that the shot shown in the trailer had the hypersonic jet superimposed over a Hornet to capture the effect. Add in a bit more movie magic and it gets even more dramatic via the lifting of the guard shack roof. Youtube Screengrab The Navy’s level of participation in the film was extreme, much like the first , but we still don’t know all the details in regards to just how much flight time went into making the sequel. Considering production included hauling an F-14 Tomcat back onto a supercarrier and shooting scenes of it tangled up in the carrier’s crash barrier , the seagoing service clearly went the extra mile. You can learn a bit about what camera ships were used and how the air-to-air sequences were captured in this past piece of ours. Extending the release date of the film, the second major extension since Top Gun: Maverick started production, may not be such a bad thing. It should give the production team extra time to polish what has to be a ridiculously intricate film to edit and dub.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our report on the absolutely bizarre incident in which the Venezuelan patrol vessel ANBV Naiguatá (GC-23) fired on and smashed into the cruise ship RCGS Resolute off the Isla La Tortuga in the Caribbean Sea, we now have video of the incident. The patrol ship ended up sinking itself after smashing into the Resolute . Apparently, the Venezuelan Navy crew were unaware that the cruise ship has a reinforced hull that allows it to venture into partially frozen waters—a feature that also makes it a poor target for battering another ship into. You can and should read all about this strange ordeal and the equally odd geopolitical connections behind it in this past piece of ours . The video, which the Venezuelan Navy released and is heavily edited, shows a Venezuelan seaman firing an AK-47 at the ship and then the two ships impacting, with the patrol boat quickly taking on water. The incident occurred in the early hours of March 30th, 2020, and the cruise ship, which was supposedly undergoing repairs at the time, was clearly making little if any speed through relatively calm waters. The exact circumstances that led to the incident remain murky. Resolute ‘s operator, Columbia Cruise Services, has already released a statement accusing the Venezuelan Navy of attempting to illegally seize the ship in international waters. Then, when the cruise ship’s captain refused to divert to a Venezuela port, Naiguatá attempted to physically block it from leaving the area, which apparently resulted in the collision, according to the company. All 44 crewmen aboard the patrol vessel were rescued after the ship sunk. The Venezuelan Navy says Naiguatá was conducting a maritime traffic control operation at the time and claims it was the Resolute that deliberately turned into its patrol boat. However, if the Venezuelan ship had been the one that turned into the path of the cruise ship the positioning could have largely been the same. The Resolute is significantly larger and less maneuverable than the Naiguatá , as well. The official video notably does not show the full sequence of events. A graphic showing the Venezuelan government’s version of events with regards to the collision. , Government of Venezuela In addition, there does not appear to be a readily available explanation from Venezuelan authorities of why the offshore patrol vessel had approached the cruise liner in the first place, let alone fired on it. Resolute had stopped in international waters off the coast of Venezuela so the crew could make repairs, according to Columbia Cruise Services. After the incident, she sailed on, as planned, to her destination, Willemstad, Curaçao Satellite imagery shows an oil slick, in international waters, in the area of the altercation, which could have been from the sinking Naiguatá . The oil also could have moved further out to sea since the collision. Venezuelan officials have said that they cannot rule out that Resolute was “was transporting mercenaries to attack military bases in Venezuela,” but it is unclear if this was why they had sortied out the Naiguatá to investigate the cruise ship in the first place. The Resolute was sailing from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Willemstad at the time and was officially carrying no passengers. The ship had been in Buenos Aires since November 2019 after it was blocked from leaving due to an apparent legal dispute over unpaid debts between One Ocean Expeditions, a Canadian cruise operator, and another company. As noted, the Germany-based Columbia Cruise Services was operating the ship at the time of the incident off Venezuela. Resolute is also flagged in Portugal, where authorities are in the midst of their own dispute with the Venezuelan government, which is tied to that country’s serious ongoing internal political crisis. Once again, you can read more about these geopolitical issues surrounding the event in the War Zone ‘s initial report on this story. ANBV Naiguatá. , LUIS GARCÍA CURADO VIA WIKIMEDIA Whatever the case, it still appears that the Venezuelan sailors sorely underestimated the stoutness of the relatively unassuming cruise ship’s hardened bow and paid for that miscalculation with their own vessel.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last month, The War Zone highlighted how the first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS America has been flying a huge flag adorned with the symbol found on Marvel Comics’ Captain America ‘s iconic shield. The crew of the ship is clearly leaning into the theme more and more, and recently unveiled a new custom paint job on one of the tow tractors personnel use to move aircraft around the flight deck that also features the famous superhero. Sailors from America ‘s Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department revealed the specially painted tractor in a small ceremony on Mar. 27, 2020, with the ship’s commanding officer, Captain Luke Frost, in attendance. Frost was given the chance to sign a plaque to go onto the small vehicle. Beyond the tractor and the Captain America flag, the ship already features other American flag-themed art, such as on its Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile launchers and island superstructure, which you can read about more in our previous piece . The tractor’s right-side panel shows Captain America with his shield crouching on the flight deck in front of an F-35B Joint Strike Fighter . In a way, ‘Cap almost looks like an Aircraft Launch and Recovery Officer about to signal to the jet’s pilot to take off. There is also what looks to be a CH-53E Sea Stallion flying in the background. The top of the vehicle is painted like a flight deck, with “USS America” written in the middle and the number six at the front. America has a six on its actual flight deck that reflects its hull number, LHA-6. The word “Whiskey” is also written at the back, but it’s not immediately clear what this is in reference to.

Its immediate successor was a Kitty Hawk class aircraft carrier, which the Navy sunk in 2005 in an unprecedented test after its retirement. The name, obviously, carries immensely important meaning and symbolism in of itself. So, it’s perhaps not surprising that the crew has adopted Captain America, perhaps the most patriotic superhero in American comics canon, and one with a military background, as a mascot of sorts. The first Captain America character, Steve Rogers, emerged right at the beginning of World War II and the early issues of the comic were heavily focused on ‘Cap’s adventures fighting the Axis Powers. The cover of the very first issue of the comic famously featured him punching Hitler in the face. A view from USS America’s flight deck with the Captain America flag flying high., USN Jack Kirby and Joe Simon actually created the character shortly before the United States officially entered World War II. Simon later said that he had specifically crafted Captain America as both an anti-Nazi symbol, as well as one opposed to isolationists in the United States who argued for not getting involved in growing global conflict. Captain America, and his circular shield with its American flag motif, which he first used in the third issue of the comics, has continued to be a part of Marvel’s superhero roster ever since. At times other characters have taken up the hero’s mantle in Rogers’ place. The Steve Rogers version of Captain America, however, has very much returned to the public consciousness in recent years thanks to the movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cover of Captain America Comics #1, at left, and a poster for the movie Captain America: The First Avenger , at right., Timely/Marvel Comics/Marvel Studios The crew of USS America is certainly continuing to use Captain America and the well-known symbols associated with his character to express their own pride in their ship and their country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",Fogbank Is Mysterious Material Used In Nukes That’s So Secret Nobody Can Say What It Is,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To this day, details about the weapons in America’s nuclear arsenal, especially regarding their warheads , remain some of the most secretive, while still publically known, elements America’s nuclear weapons enterprise. There is no better single example of this than a material that the U.S. Department of Energy has used to build thermonuclear warheads, also known as hydrogen bombs, that is so secret that no one knows exactly what it does or exactly what it’s made of, and that is only ever referred to publicly by a codename , Fogbank. Fogbank first gained relatively widespread public attention between 2007 and 2008 as it emerged that the material was at the root of technical delays in the life extension program for the W76 warhead . The W76 series is employed on Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles, also known as Trident D5s , in service with both the U.S. Navy and U.K. Royal Navy . The National Nuclear Security Administration delivered the last life-extended W76-1 warheads in 2018. “There is a material that we currently use and it’s in a facility that we built … at Y-12,” then-NNSA director Thomas D’Agostino told members of the House of Representatives in 2007, referring to the Y-12 National Security Complex , a nuclear weapons production facility located near the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. “It’s a very complicated material that – call it the Fogbank. That’s not classified, but it’s a material that’s very important to, you know, our [W76] life extension activity.” “There’s another material in the [W76] – it’s called interstage material, also known as Fogbank, but the chemical details, of course, are classified,” then-NNSA director Tom D’Agostino told senators later that year. NNSA director Thomas D’Agostino in 2009., CTBTO D’Agostino’s description of Fogbank as an “interstage material” has led experts to largely conclude that it sits between the primary and secondary stages of a two-stage thermonuclear weapon. When the first stage, which is a normal fission reaction, goes off, the interstage material would turn into superheated plasma and then trigger a fusion reaction in the second stage. Experts also believe that Fogbank is an aerogel , a category of ultralight gels in which the traditionally liquid component is instead a gas. Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on missiles and nuclear weapons at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, posted in 2008 that the codename Fogbank might be derived from nicknames for aerogels, such as “frozen smoke” and “San Franciso fog.” In that same post on the Arms Control Wonk blog , he laid out a number of other known and highly likely details about the material and its production. A clay brick, weighing 2.5 kilograms, sits on top of a block of aerogel weighing just 2 grams., NASA Lewis noted that, in 2007, NNSA’s D’Agostino had also told legislators that Fogbank’s production included purifying the material in a process that “uses a cleaning agent that is extremely flammable.” In a talk that same year at the Woodrow Wilson Center, the NNSA director had also “another material that requires a special solvent to be cleaned” and identified the solvent as “ACN,” the abbreviation for acetonitrile , which is commonly used in aerogel production. “That solvent is very volatile,” D’Agostino said at the time. “It’s very dangerous. It’s explosive.” A 2007 NNSA briefing slide on a program known as the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), which sought to develop a new warhead design to replace various existing types, further points to Fogbank’s potential aerogel composition. Congress de-funded the RRW effort in 2008 and President Barack Obama formally canceled it the following year. The NNSA briefing slide from 2007 that offers various details about the interstage and other design features of the then-still-in-development Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW)., NNSA The NNSA slide specifically noted a desire to replace an “expensive ‘specialty’ material” in the interstage section. This would also have resulted in “eliminating [the] need for unique facilities.” Y-12 had closed down a top-secret and specialized site known as Facility 9404-11, which was used to produce Fogbank, following the completion of the final W76 warhead in 1989. The complex established what it called a “Purification Facility” in its place. “It [the Purification Facility] reprocesses a material that we’re taking out of weapons so that we can reuse it in refurbished weapons. That’s probably all I can say,” Dennis Ruddy, who served for a time as President and General Manager of BWXT Y-12, the division of the Babcock & Wilcox Company that operated Y-12 under contract to the U.S. government between 2000 and 2014 , once said . “The material is classified. Its composition is classified. Its use in the weapon is classified, and the process itself is classified.” The Middlebury Institute’s Jeffery Lewis noted in 2008 that it was public knowledge that the Purification Facility at Y-12 worked with ACN. “On three separate occasions in March 2006, workers evacuated the Purification Facility after alarms went off.  According to DOE [Department of Energy] documents, the Purification Facility is alarmed to monitor for acetonitrile (ACN) levels,” he explained. There was also an ACN spill the forced the evacuation of the Purification Facility in December 2014, which thankfully caused no injuries. It took months to get the facility back up and running. An alert about another potential accident in March 2015 turned out to be a false alarm. The Purification Facility, also known as Facility 9225-3, at Y-12., Y-12 In 2009, an article had also appeared in an issue of Nuclear Weapons Journal , an official publication of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), which disclosed that the decision to re-start manufacturing Fogbank came in 2000 and confirmed that this decision was linked directly to the W76-1 warhead project. It also explained that in the intervening years, NNSA had lost virtually all of its institutional knowledge base regarding Fogbank and how to make it. “Most personnel involved with the original production process were no longer available,” the article said. As such, NNSA personnel had reconstructed the production process from historical records. In addition, “a new facility had to be constructed, one that met modern health and safety requirements.” That facility is very likely the Purification Facility at Y-12. In a bizarre twist, the new production facility and reverse-engineered production process yielded a version of Fogbank that was of a higher purity than it had been in the past, according to the article. The problem, however, was that for Fogbank to work as intended in existing warhead designs, that previous level of impurity was actually essential. NNSA had to revise the process to ensure the final product was just as impure . Extremely rudimentary diagrams showing the production process the NNSA initially developed to produce Fogbank in the 2000s, above, and the revised “impure” process, below., LANL NNSA only succeeded in recertifying the production process in 2008, the better part of a decade after first deciding to restart Fogbank production. The production of life-extended W76-1 warheads began that same year. It’s not clear how many U.S. nuclear warhead types, past and present, used Fogbank. Jeffery Lewis’ has posited that the W78 and W80, used on the U.S. Air Force’s LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), respectively, might have it based on when NNSA designed and produced those warheads. Fogbank, or at the least the story of re-booting its production, has come up more recently amid the broad U.S. efforts to modernize America’s nuclear arsenal in recent years. This has included the fielding of a controversial low-yield variant of the W76, which entered service on some U.S. Navy’s Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles earlier this year, and the development of a new warhead, the W93 , for those same missiles. The official program logo for the W76-2 low-yield variant., NNSA Work on the W93, in particular, has raised concerns about whether the Department of Energy, which oversees warhead construction, has adequate facilities and other resources to avoid potentially serious delays in the production of large numbers of new nuclear weapons. In March 2020, Allison B. Bawden, a Director on the Natural Resources and Environment team at the Government Accountability Office highlighted the past difficulties with the production of Fogbank in relation to the production of new nuclear weapons. “Future weapon programs will require newly produced explosives, including some that NNSA has not produced at scale since 1993,” Bawden said during a hearing on Capitol Hill. “As we reported in March 2009, NNSA had to delay first production of the W76-1 from September 2007 to September 2008 when it encountered problems restarting production of a key material, known as Fogbank. NNSA is working to reconstitute its high explosives capabilities, as we reported in June 2019.” You can read more about the production of specialized high explosives for nuclear weapons in this past War Zone piece . The exact origins of the W93 design are unclear. Senior Department of Energy and U.S. military officials have shied away from calling it all-new, but it is certainly set to the be the first new warhead design to enter U.S. military service since the introduction of the W88 for the Trident II in 1989. A non-official diagram showing the general arrangement and features of the W88 warhead., Dan Stober and Ian Hoffman via Wikimedia The W93 is based on “previously nuclear-tested designs, it’s not going to require any nuclear testing,” a senior defense official had told reporters in February. However, U.S. Navy Admiral Charles Richard, head of U.S. Strategic Command, told legislators that same month that the W93 itself “hasn’t been designed yet.” The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program had raised similar questions. NNSA had picked Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to build the initial production version of the RRW, leading to speculation that it might be derived from LLNL’s W89 . Work on the W89, which was intended to arm the Air Force’s air-launched AGM-131A Short Range Attack Missile II (SRAM II) and the Navy’s RUM/UUM-125A Sea Lance anti-submarine missile, officially ended in 1991. Neither the SRAM II nor the Sea Lance entered service, either. A W89 warhead., DOE It is possible that the W93 project will now leverage work from the RRW program, regardless of the latter’s origins. If the W93 does follow on from that earlier effort, there is also a distinct possibility that it will not use Fogbank in its interstage section. Whatever happens, Fogbank will continue to be a prime example of both the complexity surrounding the construction of nuclear warheads, as well as the immense secrecy surrounding America’s nuclear weapon enterprise.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After sending a seemingly desperate letter regarding the safety of the thousands of sailors under his command, Captain Brett Crozier of the COVID-19 plagued supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt was relieved of his command by the Acting Secretary of Navy. You can and should read all about this controversial move in this in-depth article of ours . Now, as the embattled commanding officer disembarked his ship, which is presently docked at the Navy pier on the island of Guam, the crew gathered to support their seemingly beloved leader with thundering cheers and chants. Watch the videos of Crozier’s hero’s departure from the carrier below: The firing has led to strong opinions on social media and beyond about whether doing so was justified under the bizarre circumstances the ship’s crew is in. I find it far too early to judge one way or another based on the limited information we have been given. There seems to be a massive disconnect between what the Acting Secretary of Navy has stated about the events leading up to the firing and the reality on the ship itself as described by Crozier in his letter. You can see the Secretary’s full statement and question and answer session regarding the issue in the video below: We still haven’t heard anything from the admiral that commands the Carrier Strike Group itself, who has also been present on the Theodore Roosevelt throughout the ordeal, or from others in the chain of command who were dealing directly with these events. Acting Secretary Modly almost makes it sound like the captain cracked under pressure or had some sort of breakdown in writing the letter, but it sure doesn’t seem like the crew agrees with the Navy’s assessment of the situation. Was the captain locked out by his chain of command, prompting him to write the letter? And if so, why? The bottom line here is that there is likely far more to this story than what we have been told, including what type of individuals were actually addressed in the email he sent that shouldn’t have been—the act the Navy claims led to the leaking of the letter and was such a severe lapse in judgment that it required his removal from command. It could turn out that the Navy was fully justified in firing the captain, but as it sits now, the exact circumstances surrounding the issue remain murky, at best. In the meantime, the removal of the captain certainly doesn’t appear to be a welcome development for the crew of the beleaguered ship. Quite the opposite, actually.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020","Navy Sacks Carrier Captain, Pulls Another Carrier Off Station Over COVID-19 Concerns (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has relieved Captain Brett Crozier , the commanding officer of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , which is presently in Guam amid a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus among its crew. Crozier wrote a damning letter to his superiors over the response to the outbreak, pleading to get the bulk of the sailors off the ship to avoid “ tragic outcomes .” The Acting Secretary of the Navy says the officer did not take adequate precautions to prevent the letter, which it also says included overly detailed information about his ship’s readiness, from leaking to the press. Reuters was first to report that Crozier was in danger of losing his job over the letter, suggesting that the Navy believed that the captain had leaked the letter. The Navy has now said this was not the case. Acting Secretary of Defense Thomas Modly told reporters later in the day that the officer had sent his missive through unclassified channels and between 20 and 30 different individuals had received a copy. The Pentagon had announced earlier this week that it would be releasing less granular information about COVID-19 cases across the U.S. military due to operational security concerns. “I’m not trying to suggest he leaked information,” Modly said. “What I will say, is that he sent it out pretty broadly and he didn’t take care that it couldn’t be leaked.” During a press conference on Apr. 1, Modly had previously said that Crozier was not in danger of punishment for having sent the letter, but that he could face disciplinary action if it was found that he was involved in leaking it to the press. The San Francisco Chronicle , which broke the initial story earlier this week, had noted that Crozier is a native of Santa Rosa, situated some 50 miles northwest of San Francisco. It also said an officer on board the Theodore Roosevelt had confirmed the letter’s authenticity. The Acting Secretary of the Navy accused him of not sufficiently communicating the seriousness of the situation prior to sending his letter, as well, but also disputed Crozier’s level of concern. Modly said the letter “misrepresented the facts,” created an undue panic among families, and offered a dangerous and inaccurate signal to America’s adversaries about the service’s readiness. U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, said he agreed with Modly’s viewpoint. Gilday had also said at the Apr. 1 press conference, where he said that that he felt there had been a “breakdown in communication” with Crozier. “We are not looking to shoot the messenger here, we want to get this right,” he had also said at that time. The r USS Theodore Roosevelt during a previous port visit to Guam., USN So far, the Navy says it has removed 1,000 sailors from the Theodore Roosevelt and is looking to get another 2,700 individuals ashore in the near future. The ship reportedly has a crew complement at present of more than 4,000 sailors and it is unclear if the service intends to follow through with Crozier’s proposal to ultimately leave just 10 percent of those individuals onboard to perform critical tasks, such as maintaining the carrier’s two nuclear reactors and providing security. You can read more about the letter and its contents in this past War Zone piece . As of Apr. 1, the Navy said that 93 sailors from the Theodore Roosevelt were confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 and another 86 were displaying symptoms. The service also said that it had tested 24 percent of the ship’s crew, with 593 negative results, and that it could test up 200 sailors every day. Crozier’s letter notwithstanding, it had become increasingly apparent that the carrier would be sidelined for the foreseeable future, despite the Navy’s repeated insistence that the ship could deploy, if necessary. Crozier had indicated in his letter that this attitude would lead to a situation where “we go to war with the force we have and fight sick. We never achieve a COVID-free TR [ Theodore Roosevelt ]. There will be losses to the virus.” “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” Crozier had added. “If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset – our Sailors.” “While we are not at war in a traditional sense, neither are we truly at peace.” Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said on Apr. 2, in a clear retort, while announcing Crozier’s relief. The Theodore Roosevelt ‘s predicament increasingly looks to have upended carrier activities around the world. There are reports now that one of the two carriers present in the Middle East, the USS Harry S. Truman and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower , will be diverted to the Pacific . This has raised concerns that there could be a fight brewing for carriers between different U.S. regional commands. The only other carrier forward deployed in the Pacific region is the USS Ronald Reagan , which is undergoing maintenance in Japan. Some of its sailors have also contracted COVID-19, raising concerns about its crew’s readiness. The War Zone had warned last week that the spread of the virus onboard Roosevelt could be a canary in the coal mine type incident for the Navy. The Pentagon had only just recently arranged for the deployment of two carriers in the Middle East for the first time in years, ostensibly to deter Iran and its proxies from launching attacks on U.S. forces in the region. “Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq,” President Donald Trump had also cryptically Tweeted out on Apr. 1. “If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!” Of course, there had also been a clear sense that Modly, in particular, had been extremely embarrassed by the letter and upset on various levels at its assertions.  “Several sources say that the decision was not made in Hawaii [where U.S. Pacific Fleet is headquartered. This is all D.C.,” USNI News reporter Sam LaGrone wrote on Twitter. The full fallout from the Theodore Roosevelt ‘s COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the sacking of Captain Crozier, remains to be seen. U.S. Congressman Seth Moulton, a Massachusett’s Democrat and a retired Marine, took to Twitter implying that he would have serious questions for the Navy’s top leadership over the situation and its handling thereof. “I learned on my first day in the Marines that having the courage to speak truth to power is grounds for respect not grounds for relief,” Moulton Tweeted out. “This is far from the first time in the last several years that Congress is going to have a lot of questions for Navy leadership – on leadership.” On Mar. 19, 2020, Moulton had also sent a letter to the top officers of all of the branches of the U.S. military, including the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the head of the National Guard Bureau asking for information about what had been done to prepare their forces for the COVID-19 pandemic. His office says that he has not yet received any responses. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 6:50pm EST: More members of Congress have issued scathing statements in response to the Navy’s decision to relieve Crozier. Here is the full statement from the House Armed Services Committee leadership: “House Armed Services Committee leadership – including Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Subcommittee Chairs Joe Courtney (D-CT), John Garamendi (D-CA), and Jackie Speier (D-CA) – today issued the following statement after Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly announced that Captain Brett E. Crozier will be relieved of his post as commanding officer of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier that has been grappling with the spread of COVID-19 cases among its Sailors:” “While Captain Crozier clearly went outside the chain of command, his dismissal at this critical moment – as the Sailors aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt are confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic – is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet’s readiness.” “The COVID pandemic presents a set of new challenges and there is much we still do not know. Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately. However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.” “Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. What’s more, we are very concerned about the chilling effect this dismissal will have on commanders throughout the Department of Defense. Dismissing a commanding officer for speaking out on issues critical to the safety of those under their command discourages others from raising similar concerns.” “We are also concerned about the lack of guidance from Department of Defense leadership. Secretary Esper continues to say that commanders and non-commissioned officers should be calling the shots, forcing them to make decisions on matters outside of their expertise while under immense pressure.” “As the crew continues to grapple with this health crisis, the Navy should be focused first and foremost on the safety of our service members. Once they are secured, there will be ample time to identify what went wrong and who is to blame.” Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has also taken to Twitter to decry Crozier’s firing. Just yesterday, Warner had sent his own letter to Acting Secretary Modly asking for information about what the Navy was doing to protect its personnel from the COVID-19 pandemic broadly and in response to the situation on board the Theodore Roosevelt specifically. UPDATE: 8:50pm EST: The Navy has released a full transcript of Acting Secretary Modly’s Apr. 2 remarks regarding his decision to relieve Captain Crozier. It is as follows: “Good afternoon. Thank you again for your diligence and courage in keeping the American people informed as we all deal with the profound ramifications, and rapid developments, associated with this crisis.” “I am here today to inform you that today at my direction, the Commanding Officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt , Captain Crozier, was relieved of command by the Carrier Strike Group Commander, Rear Admiral Stuart Baker.” “The Executive Officer, Captain Dan Keeler, has assumed command temporarily until such time as Rear Admiral Select Carlos Sardiello arrives in Guam to assume command. Rear Admiral Select Sardiello is the former commanding officer of the Theodore Roosevelt so he is extremely well-acquainted with the ship, many members of its crew and the operations and capabilities of the ship itself. He is the best person in the Navy right now to take command under these circumstances.” “As Secretary of the Navy, I could not be more proud of our men and women serving as part of the Navy and Marine Corps team. I can assure you that no one cares more than I do about their safety and welfare. I myself have a son in uniform, who is currently serving right now on active duty in Korea—one of the first nations in the world to have a significant spike in Coronavirus cases. I understand, both as a parent and a veteran, how critical our support lines are for the health and well-being of our people, especially now in the midst of a global pandemic.” “But there is a larger strategic context, one full of national security imperatives, of which all our commanders must all be aware today. While we may not be at war in a traditional sense, neither are we truly at peace. Authoritarian regimes are on the rise. Many nations are reaching, in many ways, to reduce our capacity to accomplish our national goals. This is actively happening every day. It has been a long time since the Navy and Marine Corps team has faced this broad array of capable global strategic challengers. A more agile and resilient mentality is necessary, up and down the chain of command.” “Perhaps more so than in the recent past, we require commanders with the judgment, maturity, and leadership composure under pressure to understand the ramifications of their actions within that larger dynamic strategic context. We all understand and cherish our responsibilities, and frankly our love, for all of our people in uniform, but to allow those emotions to color our judgment when communicating the current operational picture can, at best, create unnecessary confusion, and at worst, provide an incomplete picture of American combat readiness to our adversaries.” “When the Commanding Officer of the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT decided to write his letter of 30 March 2020 that outlined his concerns for his crew in the midst of a COVID-19 outbreak, the Department of the Navy had already mobilized significant resources for days in response to his previous requests. On the same date marked on his letter, my Chief of Staff had called the CO directly, at my request, to ensure he had all the resources necessary for the health and safety of his crew.” “The CO told my Chief of Staff that he was receiving those resources, and was fully aware of the Navy’s response, only asking that the he wished the crew could be evacuated faster. My Chief of Staff ensured that the CO knew that he had an open line to me to use at any time. He even called the CO again a day later to follow up. At no time did the CO relay the various levels of alarm that I, along with the rest of the world, learned from his letter when it was published two days later.” “Once I read the letter, I immediately called the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Gilday, and the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, ADM Aquilino. ADM Gilday had just read the letter that morning as well, and ADM Aquilino had it the day before. We had a teleconference within minutes of my reading of that article, including the Commander, SEVENTH Fleet, VADM William Merz, ADM Aquilino, ADM Gilday, the Department of the Navy’s Surgeon General, RADM Bruce Gillingham, and others. That evening, we held another teleconference with the entire chain of command.” “The next day, I spoke with the CO of the THEODORE ROOSEVELT myself, and this morning, I have spoken to the TR’s Carrier Strike Group Commander, RDML Stuart Baker. RDML Baker did not know about the letter before it was sent to him via email by the CO. It is important to understand that the Strike Group Commander, the CO’s immediate boss, is embarked on the Theodore Roosevelt, right down the passageway from him. The letter was sent over non- secure, unclassified email even though that ship possesses some of the most sophisticated communications and encryption equipment in the Fleet.” “It was sent outside the chain of command, at the same time the rest of the Navy was fully responding. Worse, the Captain’s actions made his Sailors, their families, and many in the public believe that his letter was the only reason help from our larger Navy family was forthcoming, which was hardly the case.” “Command is a sacred trust that must be continually earned, both from the Sailors and Marines one leads, and from the institution which grants that special, honored privilege.” “As I learned more about the events of the past week on board USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN-71), including my personal conversations with the Strike Group Commander, Commander, SEVENTH Fleet, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, the Chief of Naval Operations, and CAPT Crozier himself, I could reach no other conclusion than that Captain Crozier had allowed the complexity of his challenge with COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally, when acting professionally was what was needed most. We do, and we should, expect more from the Commanding Officers of our aircraft carriers.” “I did not come to this decision lightly. I have no doubt in my mind that Captain Crozier did what he thought was in the best interests of the safety and well-being of his crew. Unfortunately, it did the opposite. It unnecessarily raised alarms with the families of our Sailors and Marines with no plan to address those concerns. It raised concerns about the operational capabilities and operational security of the ship that could have emboldened our adversaries to seek advantage, and it undermined the chain of command who had been moving and adjusting as rapidly as possible to get him the help he needed.” “For these reasons, I lost confidence in his ability to lead that warship as it continues to fight through this virus, get the crew healthy, so that it can continue to meet its national security requirements. In my judgement relieving him of command was in the best interests of the United States Navy and the nation in this time when the nation needs the Navy to be strong and confident in the face of adversity. The responsibility for this decision rests with me. I expect no congratulations for it, and it gives me no pleasure in making it. CAPT Crozier is an honorable man, who despite this uncharacteristic lapse of judgment, has dedicated himself throughout a lifetime of incredible service to our nation.” “Pursuant to this action, and with my full support, the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gilday has directed the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert Burke, to conduct an investigation into the circumstances and climate of the entire Pacific Fleet to help determine what may have contributed to this breakdown in the chain of command. We must ensure we can count on the right judgment, professionalism, composure, and leadership from our Commanding Officers everywhere on our Navy and Marine Corps team, but especially in the Western Pacific. I have no indication that there is a broader problem in this regard, but we have obligation to calmly and evenly investigate that nonetheless.” “To our Commanding Officers, it would be a mistake to view this decision as somehow not supportive of your duty to report problems, request help, protect your crews, and challenge assumptions as you see fit.” “This decision is not one of retribution. It is about confidence. It is not an indictment of character, but rather of judgement. While I do take issue with the validity of some of the points in Captain Crozier’s letter, he was absolutely correct in raising them.” “It was the way in which he did this, by not working through and with his Strike Group Commander to develop a strategy to resolve the problems he raised, by not sending the letter to and through his chain of command, by not protecting the sensitive nature of the information contained within the letter appropriately, and lastly by not reaching out to me directly to voice is concerns, after that avenue had been provided to him through my team, that was unacceptable.” “Let me be clear, you all have a duty to be transparent with your respective chains of command, even if you fear they might disagree with you. This duty requires courage, but it also requires respect for that chain of command, and for the sensitivity of the information you decide to share and the manner you choose to share it.” “Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to send a message to the crew of the Theodore Roosevelt and their families back here at home. I am entirely convinced that your Commanding Officer loves you, and that he had you at the center of his heart and mind in every decision that he has made. I also know that you have great affection, and love, for him as well.

It’s important because you are the TR, you are the Big Stick, and what happens onboard the TR matters far beyond the physical limits of your hull.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 24, 2020",Here’s The Military’s Plan To Provide More Than Just Body Bags As COVID-19 Deaths Mount,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Department of Defense is working to provide up 100,000 body bags to the Federal Emergency Management Agency as part of the whole-of-government response efforts to the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. officials have warned that the novel coronavirus could kill as many as 240,000 Americans even with various mitigation strategies in place. If that comes to pass, the U.S. military may find itself called upon to perform a host of other so-called mortuary affairs tasks and related activities. Bloomberg was first to report on the impending transfer of the body bags, which the U.S. military technically refers to as human remains pouches, to FEMA on Apr. 1, 2020. The Pentagon has now confirmed this and says it is looking at various sources to meet the request for 100,000 bags, including sending some immediately from the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA) own stockpile of 50,000 pouches. “The Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency have a longstanding arrangement with FEMA to procure key commodities from DLA’s industrial partners during crisis response operations,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement on Apr. 2. “DLA is currently responding to FEMA’s prudent planning efforts for 100,000 pouches to address mortuary contingencies on behalf of state health agencies.” FEMA is already sending 85 refrigerated trailers to New York City to serve as temporary morgues. That city has become a major epicenter of COVID-19 cases in the United States. As of April 1, the city reported having 45,000 confirmed cases and that more than 1,300 people there had died. A New York City police officer, at right, and an employee of the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner stand in front of a refrigerated trailer parked on East 30th Street on Mar. 25, 2020., Albin Lohr-Jones/Sipa USA via AP Images This is a significant number of the more than 200,000 known COVID-19 cases in the United States as a whole, as well as the more than 5,000 deaths across the country, so far. Of course, it is important to remember that there have been significant issues in expanding testing for new cases in the United States and individuals can remain asymptotic for weeks after contracting the virus, meaning the overall number of infections, at least, is undoubtedly higher than is known. On Mar. 31, 2020, members of the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force warned that the final death toll could be between 100,000 and 240,000, and that the virus might eventually sicken millions more. “We really believe and hope every day that we can do a lot better than that, because that’s not assuming 100 percent of every American does everything they are supposed to be doing – but I think that’s possible,” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said , referring to mitigating strategies such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders. With this in mind, FEMA’s request to the Department of Defense for body bags certainly sounds, as Lieutenant Colonel Andrews put it, prudent. In addition, beyond just the broad established relationships between the two organizations, this kind of support a key element of the U.S. military’s pandemic response planning. Mississippi, Georgia and Florida Air Guard Mortuary Affairs Airmen load bodybags with simulated remains from a “derailed train” and a “collapsed hotel” into a refrrigderated truck during a training exercise., Georgia National Guard The 2009 edition of U.S. Northern Command’s (NORTHCOM) Concept Plan (CONPLAN) 3551, then titled “Concept Plan to Synchronize DOD Pandemic Influenza Planning,” says that “civilian mortuary affairs operations will require augmentation,” is a key assumption. It also warns that “competing demands for low-density units (e.g., medical, mortuary) will decrease the range of options.” Some of the working assumptions for planning purposes found in the 2009 edition of CONPLAN 3551. Note that some, including those dealing with the maintenance of civil order and law enforcement issues, have been redacted entirely., NORTHCOM Developed amidst the 2009 swine flu pandemic, CONPLAN 3551 heavily based all of its core assumptions about how a pandemic might impact the United States on the 1918 influenza pandemic. It also specifically identified concerns about another strain of flu, H5N1, more commonly known as Bird Flu. CONPLAN 3551 has been updated at least once since then, in 2013. On Feb. 12, 2020, Military Times reported that the Pentagon had quietly directed NORTHCOM to begin implementing at least portions of the plan, which is now titled the “Department of Defense Global Campaign Plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases.” How the 2009 edition of CONPLAN 3551 views the “enemy” that is pandemic influenza (PI)., NORTHCOM The 2009 version plan outlines a theoretical pandemic influenza scenario that commanders would use to plan how to deploy and distribute their resources. “PI [pandemic influenza] in the United States will result in 30 % (approximately ninety million) of the population becoming ill, 50 % of those ill seeking treatment, three % (approximately three million) of those infected being hospitalized, and a case fatality rate of two % (approximately two million) of those infected over the course of the pandemic,” it says is the working assumption. So far, the U.S. government is not expecting COVID-19 to result in this level of infections and fatalities. However, there is already evidence of medical personnel, including both EMTs and hospital staff, along with other first responders finding themselves ever closer to being overwhelmed by the growing number of cases. Military medical and support units, especially elements of the National Guard, have already begun deploying in a number of states to assist in the COVID-19 response efforts. The U.S. Navy has also notably deployed its two hospital ships, the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy , to New York City and Los Angles, California, respectively. As times goes on, mortuary affairs units may find themselves called upon to “support fatality management assistance in the collection of antemortem information and DNA samples in order to ensure proper identification of remains, and advise personnel and families as needed regarding the process,” according to the 2009 edition of CONPLAN 3591. This plan covers how NORTHCOM and its assigned units, specifically, would respond to a pandemic, whereas CONPLAN 3551 touches on the roles and responsibilities of the entire U.S. military. A section on mortuary affairs roles and responsibilities from CONPLAN 3591. JEFAC stands for Joint Emergency Family Assistance Center, which would provide various types of assistance to the families of victims of a pandemic., NORTHCOM “At the national level, the Department of Health and Human Services has [the] responsibility to coordinate civilian fatality management with local, state, and tribal authorities,” CONPLAN 3591 adds. “DOD mortuary affairs personnel may be tasked to assist government agencies.” The plan also notes the extreme mental stress that individuals working on the front lines of any pandemic are likely to experience, as well as the need for both respectful and safe handling of remains, which may still be contagious. These are issues that have already begun to emerge in the response to the OCVID-19 pandemic. Another section of mortuary affairs roles and responsibilities from the 2009 edition of CONPLAN 3591., NORTHCOM “During such [mortuary] operations, military chaplains are present to provide pastoral care to DOD personnel,” CONPLAN 3591 says. “They may assist in mitigating stress as part of a multidisciplinary stress management process such as critical incident stress management or equivalent.” “Deaths resulting from PI may cause extraordinary circumstances regarding disposition of remains,” it continues. “Chaplains must be prepared to address religious and pastoral implications of temporary interment, disinterment, and mass burial.” Hopefully, the measures that the U.S. federal government, along with state and local authorities across the country, are implementing will help significantly lower the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in the end. If the situation does become more serious, the U.S. military is a position to help manage the remains with both honor and dignity.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",Navy Could Still Punish Captain Behind Letter Begging To Get Sailors Off COVID-19 Plagued Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Acting Secretary of the U.S. Navy has said the service could punish whoever leaked a damning letter from the commanding officer of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt regarding the response to a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus on his ship. This would include the author of that letter, Captain Brett Crozier, if it turns out he was involved in distributing his missive to the press. Crozier’s letter, which is dated Mar. 30, 2020, first emerged publicly yesterday after the San Franciso Chronicle obtained a copy. It decried the Navy’s approach to handling the growing number of COVID-19 cases on board the Theodore Roosevelt and proposed moving 90 percent of the more than 4,000 crew members ashore to stem the virus’ spread. The carrier is presently docked in Guam , where it arrived on Mar. 26 after a number of sailors tested positive for the novel coronavirus. As of Apr. 1, 2020, the Navy said that 93 of the Theodore Roosevelt sailors have contracted the virus, 86 of which are exhibiting symptoms. The service also said that it had tested 24 percent of the ship’s crew, with 593 negative results. This conflicts with San Franciso Chronicle ‘s story , which said there were reportedly between 150 and 200 confirmed cases. It’s also important to note that there is significant evidence that individuals who have contracted COVID-19 can transmit it to others even while asymptomatic. Crozier, in his letter, had pointed out that seven of the first 33 sailors on the ship confirmed to have contracted the virus had initially tested negative. The USS Theodore Roosevelt during a previous port visit to Guam., USN “Let me emphasize that this is exactly what we want our commanding officers and our medical teams to do,” Acting Secretary of the U.S. Navy Thomas Modly, told reporters on Apr. 1, referring to Crozier’s decision to write his letter. “The fact that he [Crozier] wrote the letter up to his chain of command to express his concerns would absolutely not result in any type of retaliation.” “We are not looking to shoot the messenger here, we want to get this right,” U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, said at the same press conference. He added that he felt there had been possible “breakdown in communications” between Crozier and his superiors. However, it seems clear that the Navy’s top leadership, as well as other senior U.S. military officials, is extremely embarrassed by the letter and is equally unhappy that it has become public. “I don’t know who leaked the letter to the media,” Modly said. “That would be something that would violate the principles of good order and discipline, if he [Crozier] were responsible for that. But I don’t know that.” The general consensus is that Crozier felt he had to write the letter at all in order best safeguard his crew, even at the cost of his career in the Navy. It’s also impossible to know how the service might have responded if it did not become public. There is certainly some evidence that senior Navy and other top U.S. military officials had not been taking the situation as seriously as they should have. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper baffling told CBS ‘ “Evening News” late yesterday that he had not yet even read Crozier’s letter , despite it being a major national news story all day. “We are not at war, and therefore cannot allow a single Sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic unnecessarily,” Crozier had written. “Decisive action is required now in order to … prevent tragic outcomes.” The Navy now says it has removed 1,000 sailors from the carrier and is trying to make arrangements to pull another 2,700 members of the crew off the ship and move them into quarantined accommodations, including hotels, ashore. There are more than 4,000 personnel assigned to the ship at present, meaning this plan could still leave more sailors onboard than the 10 percent Crozier had advocated for in his letter. “Taking all of the crew off of the ship does not make them safer,” Acting Secretary of the U.S. Navy Thomas Modly told reporters on Apr. 1, saying that there was a certain number of sailors necessary to maintain critical systems, including the carrier’s two nuclear reactors, provide security, and perform other essential functions. Crozier’s letter does not dispute this, but makes clear that the captain felt that just 10 percent of his crew could manage these tasks. Modly and Gilday have both repeatedly insisted that the carrier is ready to deploy in response to a crisis, if necessary. Crozier’s letter does not specifically argue that the ship is not capable of conducting operations in its present state, but it does say that a strategy to “maximize warfighting readiness and capacity as quickly as possible” means, unquestionably, “we go to war with the force we have and fight sick. We never achieve a COVID-free TR [ Theodore Roosevelt ]. There will be losses to the virus.” Crozier’s letter presented a clear and stark contrast between the strategy he said the Navy was pursuing (a) and the one he was advocating for instead (b)., via San Francisco Chronicle. Crozier also made clear that he felt that his crew was being exposed to unnecessary risks in a peacetime environment. “Keeping over 4,000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care,” he wrote. “It’s disappointing to have him say that,” Modly said about those particular comments. “I know that’s not the truth.” Whatever the case, Crozier has succeeded in getting a pledge from the Navy to move the bulk of his crew ashore and into quarantine off the ship. What may happen to the captain himself, now and in the future, in terms of both disciplinary action and career prospects, very much remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 4, 2020",This Venezuelan Patrol Ship Sunk Itself After Ramming A Cruise Liner With A Reinforced Hull,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what sounds like it could be an April Fools joke, a Venezuelan Navy offshore patrol vessel recently sank after ramming a cruise liner in the Caribbean Sea. The cruise ship, which had no passengers on board at the time and has a reinforced hull to sail through ice-filled waters, suffered only minimal damage in what the operating company, Columbia Cruise Services, has called an “act of aggression … in international waters.” The incident occurred in the early hours of Mar. 30, 2020, but Columbia Cruise Services only released an official statement on Apr. 1. The company, which is headquartered in Germany, said the RCGS Resolute was drifting just over 13 miles off the coast of Isla La Tortuga, a Venezuelan island situated some 60 miles off the country’s northern coast, when ANBV Naiguatá , also known by its hull number GC-23, approached it. The Venezuelan Navy ship ordered the cruise ship to follow it to Puerto Moreno on Isla De Margarita, located to the east, accusing it of violating the country’s territorial waters. “When the event occurred, the cruise vessel RCGS Resolute has already been drifting for one day off the coast of the island to conduct some routine engine maintenance on its idle voyage to its destination, Willemstad/Curaçao,” the statement from Columbia Cruise Services says. “Shortly after mid-night, the cruise vessel was approached by an armed Venezuelan navy vessel, which via radio questioning [sic] the intentions of the RCGS Resolute ’s presence.” The 403-foot-long Resolute , which is flagged in Portugal, reportedly had a gross tonnage of around 8,445 tons at the time. The ship was laid down in September 1990 and completed in June 1991. Intended for Antarctic cruises, it has a reinforced ice-capable hull. The RCGS Resolute in Scotland in 2019 sailing as part of the One Ocean cruise line., Rab Lawrence via Wikimedia The Naiguatá , which is just over 262 feet long, is a Guaicamacuto class offshore patrol vessel and displaces around 1,720 tons with a full load. Naiguatá is the third ship in the class and entered service in 2011. Spanish shipbuilder Navantia designed and built all of the Guaicamacuto class ships and had been working on a fourth one, named Comandante Eterno Hugo Chávez , which translates to Eternal Commander Hugo Chavez. The shipbuilding firm halted work on this last ship, which was named after the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, after Venezuela descended into a major, and still ongoing, political crisis in January 2019. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8Qy6IIMh7eo “While the Master was in contact with the head office [in Germany], gun shots were fired and, shortly thereafter, the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135° and purposely collided with the RCGS Resolute ,” the statement continued. “The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship’s head towards Venezuelan territorial waters.” Columbia Cruise Services does not say what kind of gun was fired or if it did any damage to the Resolute . The Naiguatá has a 76mm main gun in a turret forward of the main superstructure, as well as a pair of 20mm cannons and two .50 caliber machine guns. The crew would also have access to various small arms. Whatever the case, the steel-hulled patrol ship suffered severe damage from repeatedly ramming the cruise ship, began to take on water, and ultimately sank. Columbia Cruise Services says Resolute remained in the area until it was clear its services were not required to help in the rescue of the 44 crew members. It then continued on, as planned, to the Port of Willemstad in Curaçao. Venezuelan authorities have disputed this version of events, claiming Resolute “in a cowardly and criminal manner fled collision site and didn’t try to rescue the crew of sinking ship.” Venezuelan Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino also described the cruise ship’s actions as an “act of imperial aggression” and “piracy.” The exact circumstances that led to the incident remain murky. If the Resolute was drifting as the crew performed work on board, it may well have found its way into Venezuelan national waters, as the country’s authorities allege. It’s hard to see how an inadvertent crossing of the boundary would have been enough cause to board and seize the ship under established norms. Even if the cruise liner had deliberately sailed within 12 miles of Isla La Tortuga, it very likely would have been legally entitled to do so under the right of innocent passage , unless Venezuelan officials believe the ship of conducting some other prohibited activity. A map showing the approximate location of where the incident occurred on Mar. 30 off the coast of Isla La Tortuga., Google Maps Of course, this would not be the first time a country has seized , or attempted to seize , a commercial ship to exert its own pressure on its international opponents. Iran infamously took control of a British-flagged oil tanker in July 2019 in part in an effort to get the United Kingdom to release an Iranian supertanker it had impounded. Venezuela’s dictatorial current President, Nicolas Maduro , has been locked in a major political dispute with opposition groups since January 2019. The country had already been in the grips of a serious economic crisis for years. However, Maduro remains in power despite international pressure, especially from the United States , pushing him to leave office and allow for a transition to a new government. On Mar. 26, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against the Venezuelan President, as well as 13 other officials and other individuals in that country, on drug trafficking charges. The U.S. State Department subsequently announced a $15 million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro. The incident involving the Resolute may be linked to Portugal, where the Resolute is flagged, the government of which is in the midst of its own set of disputes with Venezuela. Despite acknowledging that Maduro is the de facto head of state , the Iberian country has recognized his principal opponent, Juan Guaido , as the country’s legitimate leader. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro., AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos In February 2020, Venezuela accused Guaido, along with his uncle, of flying from Portugal on that country’s flag carrier TAP while carrying explosives in their luggage. It later accused TAP of conspiring with both men to smuggling the explosives into Venezuela. Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva responded to these allegations by saying they “ made no sense .” Venezuela responded by barring TAP from flying to Venezuela for 90 days. It also accuses Portuguese banks of holding a “large part of Venezuela’s stolen money,” referring to frozen assets belonging to the Venezuelan government. This crisis has become somewhat moot as the COVID-19 pandemic has swept across the world, including both Portugal and Venezuela, which has led to a massive drop in global air travel. Regardless of the exact circumstances, the Venezuelan Navy’s attempt to seize the cruise ship has certainly backfired in the immediate term. The Resolute is safely in port and the country has now lost a third of its Guaicamacuto class patrol ship fleet. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Patrol Boats Sea"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 24, 2020",The Navy’s New Aircraft Carrier Has A Revolutionary Video System That Sees Everywhere All The Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our recent profile on the unique wrap-around windowed enclosure, known as the Island Camera Room, found on American aircraft carriers, we have confirmation that the new Ford Class supercarriers feature a far more technologically advanced system—one that requires no windows or even a camera operator at all. The old system, which evolved over many decades, had a camera operator inside the windowed room that filmed all the launches and recovered aboard the ship. The camera was connected to a closed-circuit video network system and much like a television studio camera, it could only look in one direction at a time. Although the technology largely stayed the same from the early 1980s on, its video products, along with other fixed cameras around the ship’s deck, were fed into ever more advanced central interfaces that dispersed the feeds to television monitors throughout the ship. This total system was dubbed the Integrated Launch and Recovery Television Surveillance (ILARTS) system. The Ford class supercarrier, with its smaller island superstructure, has totally eliminated the Island Camera Room and has replaced it with a distributed aperture remote video system. Called Digital ILARTS, this system does what the old manned camera couldn’t, it stares in every direction at all times. A 2019 budget document discusses the need for the new system, stating: The Integrated Launch and Recovery Television Surveillance System (ILARTS) is based on both functional and technical obsolete 1980’s technology that is no longer supportable by industry, therefore requiring replacement and qualification of a Digital ILARTS System to meet both operational and safety requirements for Aircraft Carrier aviation operations. USN The island-mounted cameras on Digital ILARTS system are housed in a pair of enclosures that look a lot like an outside propane heater or street light. Beyond being able to see everywhere at once, day or night, the Digital ILARTS is far more advanced than its predecessor. Materials from the Navy’s Aircraft Launch And Recovery Equipment Office offer a look at the system itself and an idea of what it actually sees and how it sees it. It reads: The Integrated Launch and Recovery Television Surveillance (ILARTS) system is essential to supporting the mission of the aircraft carrier, allowing for constant monitoring of operations on the flight deck. Via monitors, personnel in the ready rooms, flight deck control and combat information center spaces are able to view recoveries, launches, and aircraft movements, enabling a rapid response in emergencies as well as a recorded archive that can be used to investigate a mishap or debrief pilots. With the first Ford -class ship, the future USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), relocation of her island and elimination of the island camera booth prompted the ALRE Team to develop a new approach for meeting requirements. Team Lead Joe Delorenzo and CVN-78 ILARTS System Engineer Ralph Smith led the effort, working with the Small Business Innovation Research program and a contractor. The team redesigned the console to fit within the condensed space and developed and implemented new cameras that can be controlled remotely from the ILARTS control room one level below the flight deck. A special panoramic camera, comprised of eight individual views, stitches those images together seamlessly to provide a real-time view of the entire flight deck, day or night. Other elements of the ILARTS system, including the high-speed, pan-tilt-zoom camera and software in the control room, give the controller the capability of digital zoom, allowing them to zero in on a specific spot on the flight deck, such as a hook point during an arrestment, or whatever activity the console operators and deck handlers want to get a closer look at. Smith and Delorenzo explained that by going to this new design utilizing an integrated camera system, overall situational awareness on the flight deck and surrounding air space is significantly improved, and much of the manual work required of Sailors is eliminated. The Nimitz -class configuration, with a Sailor manning the island camera booth, means that a spotter is often needed to keep an eye on everything else if the controller is focused primarily on, say, a launch on one side of the ship. On the Ford -class carrier, the full flight deck is continually in view via monitors requiring less need to manually track down aircraft on the deck. The new ILARTS equipment has been installed and the team anticipates system turnover to the Carrier and Field Service Unit (CAFSU) representatives aboard CVN-78, as well as additional work to verify the system’s technical manual this summer. ILARTS is one of many ALRE systems critical to carrier operations that will be vetted during Flight Deck Certification, but there is always an eye toward further innovation. “Our engineers are perpetually looking into the newest camera technologies, always looking to improve the equipment and enable the Sailor to do their jobs safely and efficiently,” said Delorenzo. “When it comes to ILARTS – with better cameras comes better vision,” he said. USN USN If everything works as advertised, this will be a massive upgrade over the old system and will be a huge boon for anyone looking to monitor, dissect, or review deck operations. It also goes with a growing trend of putting distributed aperture camera systems aboard seagoing vessels to drastically enhance situational awareness and tactical effectiveness. Although Ford’s catapults, arresting gear , radar , powerplant , and munitions elevators get all the attention —for better or worse—the new supercarrier is also a packing a technological revolution of the video kind. It will be interesting seeing some products of this new system as the troubled carrier slowly teethes its way toward and operational state.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s new hulking Expeditionary Sea Bases , also referred to as Afloat Forward Staging Bases, are amazingly versatile motherships that can rapidly set up shop in the most troubled of neighborhoods. Their big flight-decks can be used by any helicopter in the Pentagon’s inventory. Although their primary mission is to support lumbering MH-53E Sea Dragon mine-hunting helicopters, they also regularly play host to submarine hunting and utility helicopters, and even attack choppers. Case in point, late last March, U.S. Army AH-64E Apache Guardians flew out to USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3) in the Arabian Gulf to work on clearing the waters of enemy small boat swarms with the help of other assets forward-deployed to the region. The Apaches, which are increasingly capable of maritime operations , and busting small boats moving at high-speed through the water, day or night, in particular, were deployed aboard the Lewis B. Puller for Joint Naval and Air Integration Operations last month. Not only can the attack helicopters protect the expeditionary sea base from attack, they can also use her as a mothership to range out in any direction to provide intelligence gathering, as well as the ability to engage vessels and groups of vessels that are deemed a threat. This can be a highly integrated mission set, where a variety of weapons and surveillance systems from different services and nations are brought to bear cooperatively in order to keep waterways clear and to garner a steady stream of high-quality intelligence on maritime activities in the region. The giant “Chesty” Puller with an Apache and Black Hawk variant onboard. , USN A Navy release on the operation stated the following: The operations, which are designed to enhance the capabilities of U.S. forces to respond to surface threats, have involved Puller performing as a landing base platform for the Apaches, while Cyclone class Patrol Coastal (PC) ships select simulated targets for them to engage. The guided-missile destroyer USS Paul Hamilton (DDG 60) also participated in the joint operations. “The integration of U.S. Army air weapons teams with other joint fires into the maritime environment greatly enhances our ability to expand reconnaissance and attack capability,” said Capt. Peter Mirisola, Commander, Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 50/Commander, Combined Task Force (CTF) 55. “The Apaches, in coordination with our surface ships, allow us to hold an adversary at high risk at extended ranges. Combined with other joint fires, these aircraft significantly increase the precision lethality of our joint maritime forces.” … “Working with USARCENT forces represents another key capability in our ongoing integration of naval and air assets across our joint and coalition force to ensure maritime superiority,” said Vice Adm. Jim Malloy, commander, USNAVCENT/U.S. 5th Fleet. “This kind of cross-domain integration allows us to maintain highly lethal and effective defensive capabilities, regardless of what platforms are operating in theater.” Last month, an AC-130 Gunship and a number of other assets, including Cyclone class patrol ships, also took part in a similar exercise in the Persian Gulf. The Cyclone class USS Monsoon (PC-4) in the Arabian Gulf. , US Navy Pushing Apaches to Navy sea bases is nothing new. The practice has gone on for years. The progenitor to the purpose-built sea bases the Navy has today, the converted amphibious transport dock USS Ponce , regularly hosted the attack choppers over its years of operation in the region. The helicopters could fly out and extend their range and loiter time, and if need be, rearm, by using the sea base as a forward arming and refueling point (FARP). They could also better integrate with their Navy and Marine Corps colleagues by forward-deploying to where these types of maritime operations are actually underway. USS Ponce , Apaches overhead, before its retirement in 2017., USN Forward-deploying traditionally land-based Army helicopters to naval assets, especially sea bases, dates back to the Tanker Wars of the 1980s. First special operations AH/MH-6 Little Birds were deployed to the barges that were converted into sea bases. Then OH-58D Kiowa Warriors, with their then state-of-the-art optics, took over the task of countering mining operations and other nefarious Iranian acts in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz.

The truth is that they have been enhanced with some basic defenses, mainly Marines and sailors with machineguns and high-powered optics usually used for TOW anti-tank missiles, to help defend the inner sanctums around them. Now that their original USNS designation has been dropped for a USS designation , these ships could receive far more potent modular and roll-on weapons in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A quarter-century after the last OV-10 Broncos left U.S. military service – not counting experiments and a brief field test in Iraq involving a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ variants on loan from NASA – U.S. Air Force Forward Air Controllers, now dubbed Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTACs) , may find themselves working with these light attack planes again soon during training programs and exercises. Blue Air Training, a private contractor that has already secured a deal to provide such a service, recently announced that it was in the process of acquiring seven Broncos. The Las Vegas, Nevada-headquartered contractor first revealed its Bronco plans on Mar. 27, 2020. The company, which also operates out of Pensacola, Florida, said the aircraft would be a mixture of OV-10D+ and OV-10G variants, but did not say how many of each it was buying. Blue Air Training was one of seven different companies to get an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract in October 2019 as part of a massive multi-billion dollar Air Force effort to acquire contractor-operated aircraft to support both air-to-air and air-to-ground training requirements at bases across the United States. “As a career A-10 Pilot, I’ve always had a tremendous respect and appreciation for the OV-10 Bronco,” James “Chef” Barlow, Blue Air Training’s Founder and CEO, said in a statement . “For those very reasons the seven OV-10D+ and OV-10G Broncos we are adding to the Blue Air Close Air Support fleet are undeniably the best JTAC [Joint Terminal Air Controller] training platform in the air, anywhere.” Under its contractor air support mega-contract, the Air Force wants companies to fly approximately 10,000 flight hours during routine JTAC training and exercises, in total, annually across nine different U.S. Army bases. It’s not clear yet what portion of this requirement Blue Air Training will fulfill and whether its Broncos will be the only planes involved. The company also has a fleet of Cold War-era BAC Jet Provost and Strikemaster light jets, as well as Romanian-made IAR-823 propeller-driven light trainers and A-90 Raider light turboprop aircraft. The A-90s are modified ex-Finnish Air Force L90 turboprop trainers. According to our friends at Scramble.nl , the company also recently bought a half dozen ex-Royal Australian Air Force PC-9 turboprop trainers. All of these aircraft are suitable for training personnel on the ground, such as JTACs, to call in airstrikes and otherwise coordinate with aerial assets. Some of Blue Air Training’s other aircraft, including BAC Jet Provost and Strikemaster light jets and A-90 Raider turboprops., Blue Air Training The twin-engine Broncos will certainly offer greater performance over the single-engine IAR-823s and have greater endurance and stores carrying capabilities than the A-90s and PC-9s. The OV-10D+s and OV-10Gs also have the benefit of having been designed from the start as a light attack aircraft, with two pylons for stores on each of a pair of sponsons attached to the center of the fuselage, as well as a centerline station and two underwing hardpoints. The aircraft also has provisions for a sensor turret under the nose and Blue Air Training says its fleet will have forward-looking infrared (FLIR) capability and Link16 data links , which are in widespread use across the U.S. military, as well as other military forces around the world. The Bronco also has a unique rear compartment capable of holding equipment, personnel, or even being employed for small airdrops, which the company could take advantage of in the future. It’s not entirely clear where the seven aircraft are coming from. An OV-10D+, known by its old U.S. Navy Bureau Number (BuNo) 155493, and an OV-10G, also referred to by its BuNo, 155409, are among the Broncos that Blue Air Training is buying, according to Warbird News . The Navy first acquired 155493 as an OV-10A in 1968 and it was among the fleet assigned to the service’s famous Light Attack Squadron Four (VAL-4), also known as the “ Black Ponies ,” during the Vietnam War. It was later transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps, where it was later converted into the OV-10D configuration with its distinctly longer nose, as well as uprated engines and other improvements. All of the Marine OV-10Ds were further upgraded into D+s in the 1990s with strengthed wings, updated wiring, and other improvements as part of a service-life extension program. The Marine Corps, which was the last U.S. military service to fly the Bronco on a widespread basis, retired the last of its examples in 1995. The Air Force sent its remaining OV-10s to the bone yard four years earlier. The U.S. State Department’s Air Wing, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story , eventually acquired 155493, among other OV-10s, and had Marsh Aviation put it through another upgrade and modification program to turn it into an herbicide sprayer aircraft to support counter-narcotics operations. Beyond the spray equipment, the most visible change was the addition of four-blade propellers to the plane’s two engines. After its service in the War on Drugs, the Mangic Foundation subsequently acquired the aircraft for its OV-10 Squadron project , which is focused on preserving the history of the Bronco and honoring the pilots that flew them. The OV-10 Squadron announced that it had restored 155493 back to flying condition in July 2019. OV-10D+, BuNo 155493, after its restoration to flying condition., OV-10 Squadron The Marines also flew 155409, which again started life as an OV-10A and left service as an OV-10D+. The State Department acquired this aircraft for spray operations, as well, and had Marsh Aviation upgrade to the even more capable OV-10G standard . This aircraft eventually made its way to the Valiant Air Command , Inc. Warbird Museum in Florida. A picture of OV-10G, BuNo 155409, that Blue Air Training posted on its social media pages., Blue Air Training The Mangic Foundation had acquired a total of seven Bronco airframes for restoration as part of its OV-10 Squadron project, so it is possible that Blue Air Training’s other five aircraft are coming from this source, as well. North American Rockwell only ever built 360 Broncos of all variants, in total, and only a limited number of them still in military or civilian hands, in any condition , worldwide. In 2018, the U.S. Air Force made plans to send NASA’s two OV-10As and its pair of OV-10G+s to the Phillippines, which is the last military operator of the type anywhere in the world, though it’s unclear if that transfer ultimately occurred. NASA has long been the last U.S. government Bronco operator. Its OV-10G+s had also notably been part of a U.S. military program, led by U.S. Special Operations Command, known as Combat Dragon II, that explored light attack aircraft tactics, techniques, and procedures between 2012 and 2015, culminating with an actual combat field test in Iraq. You can read more about that deployment and the Combat Dragon II program in these past War Zone pieces . One of the two OV-10G+ aircraft that took part in the Combat Dragon II program. , Nick Thomas Regardless of the source of the Broncos, the services and capabilities that Blue Air Training can offer will significantly increase with the acquisition of the OV-10s and it will also give those aircraft a new lease on life. Air Force JTACs, and potentially combat controllers from other U.S. services and U.S. Special Operations Command , look set to be working with these aircraft again, at least during training, in the near term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 2, 2020",“Sailors Do Not Need To Die”: Captain Of COVID-19 Plagued Carrier Pleads To Bring Crew Ashore (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The captain of the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , which is in port in Guam and experiencing a major outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, has sent an unprecedented letter to the service’s headquarters. In it, the officer implores his superiors to allow him to move the bulk of his crew to facilities ashore to stem the spread of the virus to “prevent tragic outcomes.” The San Francisco Chronicle was first to report on the letter from U.S. Navy Captain Brett Crozier, which it obtained and that it says a senior officer on the carrier confirmed as authentic, on Mar. 31, 2020. The Theodore Roosevelt had been operating in the Western Pacific, but sailed to Guam after three sailors tested positive for COVID-19 and arrived there on Mar. 26. The Chronicle has reported that between 150a nd 200 members of the carrier’s crew have now contracted the virus. The War Zone had already warned last week that the situation developing on board the carrier could be a canary in the coal mine type event for the Navy. “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” Crozier wrote. “If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset – our Sailors.” “Decisive action is required now in order to comply with CDC and [Navy] guidance and prevent tragic outcomes,” he added. USS Theodore Roosevelt sails in the Phillipine Sea earlier in March 2020., USN The core issue at present, as Crozier describes it, is that the Navy has not authorized him to move the bulk of the carrier’s approximately 4,000-member crew ashore. The service has moved only a small portion of the sailors known to have COVID-19 to medical facilities on Guam for treatment. However, COVID-19 has demonstrated both its ability to spread extremely rapidly and to remain dormant for weeks before infected individuals begin presenting symptoms. There is also compelling evidence that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus. With this in mind, it’s very important to note that Crozier pointed out that seven of the first 33 of Roosevelt ‘s sailors to test positive had received negative test results just one to three days earlier. The entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt is technically undergoing a two-week quarantine period and is supposed to be practicing social distancing per CDC and Navy guidelines, a key element of which is staying six feet or more away from other individuals whenever possible, in the meantime. “Due to a warship’s inherent limitations of space, we are not doing this,” Crozier explained. “The spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating.” Berthing for sailors onboard USS Theordore Roosevelt following upgrades in 2010., USN This is an issue that The War Zone highlighted previously . Personnel on the Navy’s carriers, as well as its other ships and submarines, work and live in extremely close quarters, significantly increasing the risk of spreading any disease, let alone one as demonstrably transmissible as COVID-19. In his letter, Crozier asks for permission to move most of his crew to actual appropriate quarantine accommodations on shore. A skeleton crew, approximately 10 percent, would continue to look after the ship, especially the operation of its two nuclear reactors, as well as provide security and perform other basic functions. Crozier’s letter seems to reflect a rapidly expanding debate, and an increasingly serious one, within the U.S. military about how to balance maintaining readiness to respond to crises around the world with keeping personnel as safe as possible from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pentagon has already ordered the withholding of certain granular information about cases within its ranks that it feels could compromise operational security, though it has pledged to continue disclosing the overall total number of personnel confirmed to have the virus. “We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region,” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said last week . Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had also said that the carrier remained “operationally capable if called upon to do so.” This desire to keep operating as normally as possible certainly seems to have informed the Navy’s decision to have Theodore Roosevelt make a scheduled and historic port visit in Da Nang, Vietnam earlier this month. The country only had a small number of confirmed cases at the time and there were none in Da Nang, which reportedly influenced that risk assessment . The Navy is still unclear where the initial infections occurred. The USS Theodore Roosevelt arrives in Da Nang harbor on Mar. 5, 2020., USN Crozier seems to be extremely concerned that if the Navy does not take certain steps now to prevent the spread of the virus among members of Theodore Roosevelt ‘s crew, the carrier’s ability to perform its mission could be severely impacted, whether the service likes it or not. “The current plan in execution on TR [ Theodore Roosevelt ] will not achieve virus eradication on any timeline,” the ship’s captain said bluntly. “TR’s best-case results, given the current environment, are likely to be much worse.” The Navy has said it can only test 200 of the carrier’s sailors every day, but that it may move more to facilities on shore as time goes on, according to CNN . The service also insists that at least some portion of the crew needs to remain on the ship to support various essential functions, something that, as noted, Crozier did not dispute in his letter. However, the captain did decry what he felt was an over-focus on testing, rather than other steps to protect the crew from the virus. “Testing has no direct influence on the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It merely confirms the presence of the virus,” he wrote. “Due to the close quarters required on a warship and the current number of positive cases, every single Sailor, regardless of rank, on board the TR must be considered “close contact.” The USS Theodore Roosevelt in port in Guam during an earlier visit to the island., USN There’s certainly an argument to be made that the U.S. military, as a whole, needs to remain prepared to perform a variety of key missions. Various commands are taking different measures, some of them extreme , to ensure that they can continue to conduct vital missions as the pandemic accelerates. There have also been concerns about whether bringing COVID-19 cases ashore in Guam might lead to the spread of the virus across the island. “We’re fucked,” one servicemember said according to a report from The Daily Beast last week. Unfortunately, the situation aboard the Theodore Roosevelt is unlikely to be unique if the Navy and the rest of the U.S. military do not take more proactive steps to prevent outbreaks and curtail the ones that do occur. Sailors assigned to the USS Ronald Reagan , another Nimitz class carrier forward deployed in Japan, have also contracted COVID-19 . Virus outbreaks have also now emerged on Russian and Dutch submarines , underscoring the risks that the virus presents to navies, in general. The USS Ronald Reagan in Japan., USN The virus is very clearly continuing to spread throughout the U.S. military, as a whole, too. A New Jersey Army National Guardsman became the first uniformed U.S. military service member to die from complications from COVID-19 on Mar. 30. There are more than 1,000 confirmed cases within the Department of Defense, including civilians and contractors. “This will require a political solution, but it is the right thing to do,” Crozier wrote to his superiors. “We are not at war, and therefore cannot allow a single Sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic unnecessarily.” The Theodore Roosevelt is rapidly becoming an important test case for how the Navy, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decisions senior leaders make now, especially with Crozier’s passionate plea of a letter now being public, are likely to inform broader approaches to tackling the virus going forward. Update : The Navy now says it is evacuating a large portion of USS Theodore Roosevelt’s crew so that the ship can be disinfected. Defense One reported the following: “The key is to make sure that we can get a set of crew members that can man all those critical functions on the ship, make sure they’re clean, get them back on, clean the ship, and get the other crew members off,” Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said in a Tuesday interview with CNN. “And that’s the process we’re going through. It’s very methodical. We’re absolutely accelerating it as we go.” We will see just how effective this operation proves to be. Evacuating the crew sounds good, but to where? How will they be safely separated until they all can be done? We will continue to update you on this story as more information comes available. Update: Apparently, even after the captain of the Navy’s most powerful warship with thousands of sailors onboard went rogue and begged for help to save his crew in a letter, many hours after that letter went public, the Secretary of Defense still hadn’t even read it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 18, 2020",The Navy Tried To Retire Its Two Huge COVID-19 Fighting Hospital Ships Two Years Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s two massive hospital ships, the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy , are presently deployed to Los Angeles, California and New York City, New York, respectively. Both vessels are helping to ease the burden on hospitals ashore that are treating growing numbers of patients with the COVID-19 novel coronavirus by providing critical medical attention to individuals with other, unrelated ailments. The ships have become an important symbol of the U.S. government’s response to the pandemic, which makes it all the more interesting to remember that the Navy pushed to retire them two years ago. Mercy began treating patients on Mar, 30, 2020, three days after arriving in the Port of Los Angeles. Comfort also arrived in New York Harbor on Mar. 30. The Navy had rushed to activate the ships earlier in March – Comfort was actually undergoing maintenance when the service first ordered the deployments – as COVID-19 cases continued to grow exponentially, especially in New York City, which has become a major epicenter for the pandemic in the United States. “The USNS Comfort arrives in New York City this morning with more than 1,100 medical personnel who are ready to provide safe, high-quality health care to non-COVID patients,” U.S. Navy Captain Patrick Amersbach, who is the top officer in charge of the hospital ship’s onboard medical facilities, said in a statement on Mar. 30. “Like her sister ship, USNS Mercy , which recently moored in Los Angeles, this great ship will support civil authorities by increasing medical capacity and collaboration for medical assistance.” The Navy first acquired the two hospital ships, which are both converted oil tankers, in 1986 and 1987. Each one is approximately 900 feet long and displaces around 69,360 tons with a full load. The U.S. Naval Institute noted that if you stood Comfort on her stern on the pier in New York Harbor, she’d be the thirteenth tallest building in the city. The ships have a typical crew complement of around 1,200 personnel, consisting of both uniformed members of the military and civilian mariners. Comfort presently has a crew of more than 1,200, drawn from 22 different naval commands, according to the Navy . The service does not appear to have released a similar breakdown of the personnel on board Mercy . The ships were designed primarily to handle combat casualties during expeditionary operations overseas and can accommodate up to 1,000 patients at a time, including 80 in an intensive care unit. Comfort and Mercy both have an array of other specialized medical facilities more commonly found in hospitals ashore, including a dozen operating suites, burn wards, a testing laboratory, MRI and x-ray equipment, a blood bank, and the ability to generate its own oxygen. You can read more about these ships in this past War Zone piece . Navy medical personel treat a patiant aboard USNS Mercy following the ship’s arrival in the Port of Los Angeles., USN Both of the hospital ships have demonstrated their ability to respond to humanitarian crises and natural disasters, and perform other less intensive non-combat missions, in the United States and abroad. Comfort notably also sailed to New York City to help in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Navy, as well as the Pentagon, has stressed that the hospital ships, with their wide-open treatment bays, are not properly configured to adequately treat patients with readily transmissible COVID-19 coronavirus. However, they have offered a valuable way to expand general medical capacity relatively quickly so facilities ashore can focus on patients who have contracted the virus. However, had the Navy gotten its way two years ago, one or both of these ships would not have been available now. In its budget proposal for the 2019 Fiscal Year, which the service released in the Spring of 2018, it proposed sending either Comfort or Mercy , or both , into mothballs. The Navy cited the high costs involved in operating and maintaining the pair of unique ships, as well as their age and new distributed concepts of operations , in announcing its decision. “The problem with those [hospital] ships is, there’s only two of them, and they’re big, and we’re moving to a more distributed maritime operations construct,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral William Merz, then Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Systems, told members of Congress in April 2018. “There’s no lack of commitment [to this medical capability]; matter of fact, we’re taking a broader look at the capabilities on whether or not they are aligned with the way we plan to fight our future battles.” This was hardly the first time the Navy had tried to retire Comfort and Mercy . “They’re wonderful ships, but they’re dinosaurs,” now-retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Cowan, then the Surgeon General of the United States Navy, said in 2004 . “They were designed in the ’70s, built in the ’80s, and frankly, they’re obsolete.” The San Clemente class oil tanker ex-SS Worth under conversion into the future USNS Mercy in 1985., DOD Members of Congress quickly pushed back against the Navy’s proposal in 2018, arguing both that the ships continued to provide valuable capabilities for military operations in the absence of a direct replacement. Lawmakers also argued that the vessels offered invaluable utility for humanitarian missions and a useful way to project so-called “soft power” to help advance American interests overseas. “We have an obligation to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, and also the civilians across this world… Because there will come a time when we need that [hospital ship capability] and we need to always be ready,” Representative Trent Kelly, a Mississippi Republican said in defense of the ships during a hearing in March 2018. He also highlighted Comfort ‘s deployment to both his state and Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Navy ultimately dropped its plans to retire the hospital ships without a direct replacement. Since then the service has been exploring a number of future options, including containerized medical facilities that it could deploy onboard various existing ships, including its Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) ships and its much smaller Spearhead class expeditionary fast transports. A model of a small hospital ship derived from the Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport design., Joseph Trevithick The  Common Hull Auxiliary Multi-Mission Platform ( CHAMP ) program, which sought to develop a fleet of auxiliary ships for various missions at a lower cost by using a common hullform, was also supposed to include a hospital ship variant. In December 2019, the White House’s Office of Budget and Management sent a memorandum to the Navy that, among other things, ordered it to effectively cancel its existing CHAMP plans and develop a lower-cost proposal. The Navy had expected to begin buying the first CHAMP ships in 2025, but those plans are now uncertain. It has certainly turned out to be a good decision not to retire the Comfort and the Mercy without any replacements in service. Representative Kelly’s comments about how there would come a time when we absolutely needed the ships to be ready has definitely come true. “We are ready and grateful to serve the needs of our nation,” the Comfort’s Captain Amersbach said yesterday. The nation is equally grateful, and lucky, that the hospital ships, among other military capabilities, are available to help combat the spread of COVID-19.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 1, 2020",The Air Force’s Troubled Boeing KC-46 Tankers Leak Fuel Excessively,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s seemingly perpetually troubled KC-46A Pegasus tanker has yet another major problem, its fuel system leaks excessively. This comes nearly a month after the U.S. Air Force made clear that it would not use its existing examples for aerial refueling, their core mission set, except in an absolute emergency . This was due to already serious existing issues, especially with the complex Remote Vision System that boom operators use to see what’s going on at the back of the aircraft while linking up with receiving aircraft. The Air Force announced that it had defined the KC-46A’s fuel system leaks as a so-called “Category I” deficiency on Mar. 30, 2020. Category I issues are problems that would prevent the aircraft from performing one or more primary missions. The service also said that it had first become aware of the leaking in July 2019 during a test, but had initially categorized it as a less severe issue. “The Air Force and Boeing are working together to determine the root cause and implement corrective actions,” according to an Air Force statement. “The KC-46 Program Office continues to monitor the entire KC-46 fleet and is enhancing acceptance testing of the fuel system to identify potential leaks at the factory where they can be repaired prior to delivery.” The Air Force took delivery of its first KC-46A in January 2019, years behind schedule . As of December, the service had received 30 of the tankers. Even before the announcement of the fuel system leaks, the Air Force had already publicly described a number of other Category I deficiencies with the existing aircraft, as well as those in production right now. This includes the aforementioned issues with the Remote Vision System (RVS), as well as the fact that it requires more force for the boom on the Pegasus to connect with a receiving aircraft than with previous Air Force tankers. Boeing is still working to fix these problems, but has resolved another Category I issue with the cargo locks on the cabin floor in the aircraft. A view of the boom operator work stations on the KC-46A., USAF “Boeing is contractually obligated to remedy this deficiency at no additional cost to the government,” the Air Force statement adds with regards to the fuel system leaking issue. The service signed a firm, fixed-price contract with Boeing for the KC-46, which has left the company on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fixes already. It’s not clear why it took eight months for the Air Force to upgrade the leaking issue, which it describes as excessive and for which it says there is no known root cause, to a Category I deficiency. The service has also not provided a timetable for when it might heave the issue resolved. Boeing told Defense News that it had fixed seven of 16 planes with the issue, despite the Air Force saying the root cause remained unexplained. “The KC-46 fuel system is equipped with redundant protection for fuel containment,” Boeing’s statment to Defense News further explained. “In some cases with this issue, aircraft maintenance crews are finding fuel between the primary and secondary fuel protection barriers within the system.” Of course, the Air Force had already said it will not use the KC-46A for aerial refueling missions on a day-to-day basis or in combat until Boeing completely overhauls the RVS system. At present, work on a fix for that problem isn’t expected to be finished until some time between 2023 and 2024 and it will take some amount of time afterward to update the dozens of existing aircraft. It is possible that the expanding COVID-19 pandemic may further delay fixes to all of the KC-46A’s outstanding issues. Boeing suspended production of new Pegasuses, as well as P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes, last week after a worker at one of the company’s plants in Washington State died from complications from the novel coronavirus. “Certain non-production work for all commercial derivative aircraft programs, including for the KC-46 remote vision system enhancements, will continue being done by employees working remotely,” Boeing told Defense News on Mar. 23. All of this is already driving the Air Force closer and closer to hiring private contractors to provide aerial refueling solutions. The service has already begun to walk back a plan to retire a number of existing tankers, which other senior U.S. military officials have warned could create a dangerous capability gap while the KC-46As remain largely incapable of performing their main mission set. No matter what happens, the fuel system leaks are just another black mark for the tanker program and another issue that Boeing will have to fix before the Air Force will be able to make any real use of them on aerial refueling missions.

Now, The War Zone can share previously unseen schematics and other details about the resulting stealthy flying-wing-shaped unmanned aircraft called the XRQ-72A, which Scaled Composites , a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman well known for producing advanced aircraft designs , developed. The War Zone obtained the information via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) supported the Great Horned Owl program , which the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) first disclosed in 2011. IARPA is one of the Intelligence Community’s top research and development arms and answers to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It’s not clear which intelligence agency or agencies may have had requirements that led to the Great Horned Owl effort, but the CIA has operated a variety of drones with a wide range of capabilities over the years to conduct various missions . “The Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) role for UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] is dependent upon the ability of the UAV to do its mission without the adversary being able to counter it. For many such ISR applications, the acoustic signature of the UAV alerts the adversary to the UAV’s presence and can interfere with the mission,” IARPA explained in a public notice regarding the Great Horned Owl effort in 2011. “Battery powered UAVs are very quiet but lack endurance and payload capability. Better, more efficient, quiet power sources and propulsion techniques are needed to build next generation UAVs for ISR mission applications.” The resulting XRQ-72A has a general planform reminiscent of other Northrop Grumman designs , including that of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. It also has some broad external visual similarities to flying wing unmanned aircraft that other companies have developed over the years, including designs from Lockheed Martin . A rendering of the XRQ-72A, along with various dimensional and other details., USAF via FOIA The drone has a 30-foot wingspan, is 11.2-feet long measured from the nose to the ends of the wingtips, and is four feet tall when including the vertical wingtip stabilizers, according to the schematics we obtained via FOIA. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works’ X-44A, which The War Zone was first to report on and which the Air Force did not publicly acknowledge until 2018, also has a wingspan of around 30 feet. The X-44A represented an important “ missing link ” in the chronology of that company’s advanced flying wing drone developments, including the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone. It’s not clear how heavy the XRQ-72A is, but another AFRL document we received said that the Great Horned Owl program’s requirements called for an air vehicle weighing between 300 to 400 pounds. The drone also appears to have at least some stealthy features, including its general shape and shrouded exhausts, and is made out of composite materials. Its most important feature, of course, is its hybrid propulsion system. A pair of fuel-powered generators inside the central fuselage produce the electricity that powers four ducted fan propulsors mounted on top of the aircraft’s flying-wing fuselage. This is in some ways visually reminiscent of the general configuration of the Boeing X-48 series of experimental unmanned blended wing body demonstrators, but those aircraft used small turbojet engines. An internal schematic and other more detailed views of the rendering of the XRQ-72A., USAF via FOIA The schematics also show the XRQ-72A equipped with a typical ball-type sensor turret, which could include various types of video cameras. IARPA made no specific mention of what sensors it might be interested in any Great Horned Owl demonstrator being able to carry in its original 2011 announcement. It’s not clear from the Air Force documents how the drone takes off or lands. There no landing gear present in the schematics, which could point to runway-independent operation using a catapult or rocket-assisted zero-length launch system . The Great Horned Owl program was initially focused simply on exploring technologies that could enable the development of a very quiet and efficient unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone. Hybrid propulsion concepts, which have been and continue to be of great interest to both military and commercial aviation communities, offer a potential path to significant improvements in fuel efficiency, reliability, and reduced acoustic signature over traditional aircraft propulsion concepts. AFRL is still experimenting with these ideas today, which you can read about in much greater detail in this past War Zone piece . The Great Horned Owl program logo., IARPA The XRQ-72A’s exact capabilities are unclear. AFRL said that it expected the drone to have a “low acoustic signature at a speed of 50 KEAS [Knots Equivalent Air Speed],” according to the documents we obtained via FOIA. IARPA’s stated goals in 2011 were a high-efficiency design that could be as quiet as 50 Phons at speeds up to 100 knots. A Phon is a unit of sound measurement equivalent to 1 decibel at a frequency of 1 kilohertz. Sound can be hard to measure. A typical conversation, where people are speaking without raised voices, or the hum of a dishwasher are typically described as being around 50 decibels loud , though that dissipates the further away you get from the source. A typical jet engine on a commercial airliner still registers around 130 decibels or more during takeoff, even at a distance of 100 feet. In 2012, IARPA did issue contracts to various companies to craft various ducted fan designs, as well as other propulsion system components as part of Phase 1 of the Great Horned Owl program. CRG and Xcelaero supplied hub-driven propulsors, while a firm called Theta Tech developed a hubless, or rim-driven design . As their name implies, hub-driven propulsors have a centrally mounted propeller inside the propulsor. A hubless design has fan blades mounted on the inside of a ring that rotates within the body of the propulsor. The schematic of the Northrop Grumman XRQ-72A shows hub-driven propulsors. A factsheet on various Great Horned Own Phase 1 requirements and developments., IARPA The exact timeline of the Great Horned Owl program, including whether or not it is still ongoing, is not entirely clear, either. When IARPA first announced the project publicly in 2011, it said it expected it to wrap up in June 2016. This schedule included plans for a second phase involving system integration and ground testing and a third phase with actual flight testing. At least one testbed drone emerged during that timeframe, called Talos . Oklahoma State University’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems program helped develop this unmanned aircraft, which first flew in 2013. Talos is a completely different design from Northrop Grumman’s XRQ-72A with a more traditional wing configuration and overall planform. However, AFRL only requested a formal designation for the Great Horned Owl drone in January 2017, according to the documents we received via the FOIA request. “It is planned that the GHO [Great Horned Owl] demonstrator would complete a series of flights at the Acoustic Research Complex operated by AFRL/RH [Airman Systems Directorate] on the White Sands Missile Range incorporating the hybrid power and propulsion system, and then be available for future demonstrations of additional technology and/or vehicle configurations,” the memorandum explained. What’s also interesting is that AFRL asked for an X-plane designation, which are typically applied only to purely experimental aircraft . One notable exception was the Bell X-16 , which was publicly described as a high-altitude testbed, but was, in fact, a competitor to the famous U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane. “The X-## Mission Design Series Assignment is very important at this time to highlight to the aerospace R&D community the importance of the development of hybrid power and propulsion for future USAF aircraft,” the memo noted. “While potential benefits to a broad range of future vehicles have been identified, such a dramatic change in the design paradigm is a slow process. The X-## designation for the GHO will dramatically improve awareness of the research and help preserve the technical achievements, increasing opportunity for technical transition of the experimental results and design philosophy to future USAF air vehicles.” A portion of the memo requesting an “X-##A” designation in the X-plane series for Northrop Grumman’s Great Horned Owl demonstrator., USAF via FOIA It’s not clear how the final XRQ-72A designation, which the Air Force approved in March 2017, came about. The “XRQ” prefix is very much not an X-plane designation and is more fitting for a prototype of a potentially operational platform. There numerous examples of experimental drones with “XQ” or just “X” prefixes, such as the Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie and the Lockheed Martin X-44A , as well as the still curious YQ-11 prototype designation for the General Atomics Predator C/Avenger , so this appears to have been a deliberate decision. A portion of the memo approving the XRQ-72A designation for the Great Horned Owl drone., USAF via FOIA The number 72 is also wildly out of sequence for either the X-plane category or the drone category in the U.S. military’s joint-service aircraft designation system. It is a number that has been informally applied on multiple occasions to advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft designs in the past, as a reference to being a spiritual successor to the iconic SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. In 2018, IARPA also initiated a follow-on project called Little Horned Owl , which had similar goals to Great Horned Owl, but called for a notably smaller overall design that would only have to carry a 10-pound payload. There was also a requirement for “innovative battery architecture to improve flight times for battery-only flight” and “runway independent operation (minimal ground support equipment).” The Little Horned Owl program logo., IARPA Regardless, as IARPA noted in 2011, there is a clear demand for the kind of technologies developed under the Great Horned Owl program. A drone with relatively long endurance and very quiet operation would enable persistent surveillance of targets of interest with a reduced likelihood of detection. This, of course, would hardly be the first time the U.S. Intelligence Community, or the U.S. military, has acquired or otherwise experimented with ultra-quiet aircraft for reconnaissance and covert operations. The CIA famously used a pair of Hughes 500P helicopters, also known as the “ Quiet Ones ,” to conduct a top-secret wire-tapping operation in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army also experimented with very-quiet manned surveillance aircraft, such as the YO-3A Quiet Star , during the Vietnam War. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Army, as well as the U.S. Air Force and the CIA, further pursued higher-flying manned surveillance aircraft with low acoustic signatures, most notably the RG-8A Condor powered glider, some of which later found their way into U.S. Coast Guard service. The Coast Guard went on to fly the unique RU-38A Twin Condor, as well. You can read more about these aircraft, and the Coast Guard’s attempts to develop a successor, in this past War Zone piece . When it comes to more modern quiet drones, The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been pursuing similar developments for U.S. military use. In 2006, Lockheed Martin also supplied a hand-launched, electrically-powered drone called Stalker to an unnamed customer, reportedly U.S. Special Operations Command, specifically to meet a requirement for a quieter unmanned aircraft that opponents would have a harder time detecting. More recently, the company developed a propeller-driven flying wing design, called Fury , which is visually similar to the RQ-170, albeit smaller, and that also has a reduced acoustic signature. The XRQ-72A represents a more advanced concept than smaller designs, such as the Stalker or the Fury, though. The Great Horned Owl program, as well as Little Horned Owl, also underscores how the U.S. Intelligence Community is driving unmanned aircraft developments themselves, including in the classified realm, independent of the U.S. military, though there is clear cooperation between them. The Department of Homeland Security had also expressed an interest in the outcome of the Great Horned Owl program to support the development of future unmanned aircraft for border surveillance . Much about the XRQ-72A still remains a mystery and The War Zone has already begun working to uncover more about this drone and the shadowy program that spawned it. The biggest question is whether the drone, or further improved design based on the work done under Great Horned Owl program, is silently roaming the skies today.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 2, 2020",This Is Israel’s Doomsday Bunker For Top Officials That Has Been Activated For COVID-19,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Isreal has activated its National Management Center (NMC), a continuity of government (COG) bunker that looks right out of a science fiction movie. The facility serves as an extremely hardened command and control site for top Israeli officials so that they can continue to run the country during a major crisis. The spinning-up of the National Management Center is a result of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country and the potential instability and strategic implications that could go along with the outbreak. As The War Zone recently noted the U.S. government has done the same, activating its Cheyenne Mountain underground complex and other hardened installations as the virus spreads through the U.S. population and the United States military. The NMC is somewhat unique in that its existence is not highly secretive and it definitely isn’t all that low profile in its appearance or location. Situated near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister’s Office, Supreme Court and other major governmental facilities in the National Quarter section of Jerusalem, the futuristic installation was built following the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw throngs of rockets rain down on northern Israel. It gives the nearby government the ability to quickly fall back to a highly secure installation that is also extremely well connected with the outside world, including with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).Â The unique double-fenced facility is located across from a prominent theater and looks just as much modern art museum as it does doomsday bunker. The site has a windowless futuristic-looking ground-level complex that includes multiple drive-in entrances and a circular turnaround, but is said to go very deep underground and is capable of sustaining hundreds of people over a prolonged period of time in its nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare hardened cavernous subterranean complex.Â ×”×‘×•× ×§×¨ ×©×œ ×‘×™×‘×™, ×‘×›× ×™×¡×” ×œ×‘×™×¨×”. pic.twitter.com/KC42qQZzLs — ×™×•×¡×™ ××œ×™×˜×•×‘ Yossi Elituv (@yoelituv) May 12, 2016 Hilo 1/ En JerusalÃ©n ha sido puesto en operaciones uno de los bunkers NQB destinados a alojar al gobierno por si fuese necesario en algÃºn momento aislarlo totalmente del mundo exterior, y desde hace un par de dÃ­as el Gabinete de Seguridad ya realiza allÃ­ sus reuniones. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± #Israel pic.twitter.com/SpmwHnD6pg — Israel Defensa ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± Gabriel Yerushalmi (@Defensa_Israel) March 28, 2020 This is what the facility is said to be like inside: Yedioth Ahronoth reported that 95% of the bunker is underground, and the only entrance is through elevators. The report goes on to cite that person as saying that the elevators give passengers â€œSci-Fiâ€ feel and that the bunker itself gives visitors the feeling it is â€œcompletely disconnected from the world. … The bunker was built to house an Israeli national crisis management center, and to serve as a place from which the Israeli government can safely govern Israel in a state of emergency. Although the underground complex was designed mainly to support crisis operations and to ensure continuity of government operations during such a crisis, it has also been used for extremely sensitive meetings in recent years: Israel’s Security Cabinet, a forum of senior ministers headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has begun holding its weekly meetings in a secure underground bunker in Jerusalem, Israeli media said on Tuesday. The facility, known as the “National Management Centre”, was first used by the Security Cabinet in 2011 to rehearse a national crisis scenario. It was carved out beneath the government complex in Jerusalem and includes living quarters as well as command facilities. … Meetings of the Council, hitherto mostly at the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem, are already generally held out of the public eye.” Cabinet ministers have told us that one of the main reasons for the move is Netanyahu’s wish to try even harder to prevent leaks and because of fears of spying attempts by hostile foreign parties,” Israel’s Channel 10 said. The group of 11 ministers has already held a small number of meetings at the facility, and three planned weekly sessions, the next of which is scheduled for Wednesday, will be held in the bunker, a media source said. The facility is being spun-up as part of a contingency plan for dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Israel’s Ynetnews writes : “This (bunker) is another tool for managing, controlling, oversight and trackingâ€ the coronavirus, said an official who requested anonymity. â€œWe understand that this crisis will accompany us for an extended period of time yet.” Of course, this doesn’t mean the Israeli government has gone into subterranean lockdown, but keeping a quarantined group of personnel, possibly including select officials, in such a facility with extreme command and control capabilities seems prudent in such an uncertain time. Political leaders and other government officials are just as susceptible to the disease as anyone else. Prime Minister Netanyahu is under quarantine right now after his aide came down with the disease. As such, keeping a handful of ministry deputies sequestered to fill in if their bosses should get sick makes some sense. The command center can also assist with monitoring the spread of the disease and coordinated response efforts.Â There is also the cold hard fact that few seem to want to discussâ€”when there are destabilizing and distracting factors, such as a global pandemic, adversaries could be motivated to act in an effort to take advantage of that instability. This is true for the United States and it’s true for Israel. These facilities exist to be prepared for such an occurrence and their very existence can help act as a deterrent against would-be bad actors.Â Regardless, such an exposed urban bunker like this is remarkably rare. American counterparts are largely of a deeply concealed nature, from existing under the White House lawn and under the Pentagon , to deep within mountains in the rural expanses to the north of Washington, D.C. With that in mind, it’s hard to think of a more Hollywood-ready bunker for a country’s elite as Israeli’s National Management Center, and we have no idea just how far it extends both vertically and horizontally under such the sprawling National Quarter. What is certain is that what we see of Israel’s elite doomsday bunker is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of eight KC-46A Pegasus tankers to Israel, which is in the process of selecting a replacement for its aging Boeing 707-based tankers. This comes as the U.S. Air Force has revealed that it is looking at new delays in developing critical fixes for its KC-46As and that there is still no clear schedule for when existing aircraft will actually receive those modifications. In the meantime, the service won’t be using the Pegasuses it has now for routine combat or non-combat aerial refueling missions, except in an emergency. The U.S. Military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the State Department had cleared Israel to buy the KC-46s, as well as other ancillary equipment, including spoofing-resistant GPS receivers and radios, and support services, on Mar. 3, 2020. The entire package has an estimated price tag of $2.4 billion. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the DSCA notice says. “This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives.” This announcement confirms many of the details in a report from IsraelDefense magazine in June 2019, which said that Israel had sent a formal Letter of Request about the potential purchase of two KC-46As with the option to buy six more afterward. A US Air Force KC-46A refuels an F-16C Viper fighter jet during a test., USAF Israel also reportedly inquired about whether it could take delivery of that first pair of aircraft from a lot the Air Force had already contracted Boeing to build. This would allow the Israeli Air Force to get those first two Pegasuses earlier than they would otherwise. The Israeli government has reportedly been in negotiations with Boeing about purchasing KC-46As to replace their fleet of nine 707-based tankers, also referred to as KC-707s, since at least 2018. Reports in Israeli media have said that the Chicago-headquartered aviation firm blocked plans for a competing offer from Israel Aerospace Industries’ Bedek Aviation Group to supply second-hand Boeing 767s converted into tankers. An Israeli Air Force KC-707., IAF Bedek has supplied 767-based tankers, also known as KC-767 Multi-Mission Tanker Transports (MMTT), to Brazil and Colombia in the past. You can read more about these issues in this past War Zone story . Airbus has also pitched a version of its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) equipped with a refueling boom as an alternative. At the time of writing, Israeli authorities still have yet to formally announce a decision. A boom-equipped Royal Australian Air Force KC-30A, a variant of Airbus’ A330 MRTT., RAAF American-Israeli ties may play a factor, given U.S. President Donald Trump’s own close relationship with embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who’s Likud party just won a major electoral victory after months of political turmoil in Israel. The Trump Administration has been heavily promoting increased arms sale to foreign allies and partners, in general. The DSCA notice itself suggests there could be benefits to the tanker deal for the U.S. military in any future conflict that sees it fighting alongside Israeli forces. “The proposed sale further supports the foreign policy and national security of the United States by allowing Israel to provide a redundant capability to U.S. assets within the region, potentially freeing U.S. assets for use elsewhere during times of war,” DSCA’s notice says. “Aerial refueling and strategic airlift are consistently cited as significant shortfalls for our allies. In addition, the sale improves Israel’s national security posture as a key U.S. ally.” This is interesting given that earlier today Chief of Staff of the Air Force General David Goldfein told members of Congress that his service was still working with Boeing to develop a path forward for fixing the KC-46A’s long-troubled Remote Vision System (RVS) and that he expected the revised system to be ready for fielding between 2023 and 2024. Last year, the estimate was that this work would be complete by either 2022 or 2023. “Right now we are in final negotiations with the company on the fix, so I’ve got to be a little careful about how much detail I go into,” he explained during the hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Mar. 3. “But I did have a follow-up conversation with the [Boeing] CEO [Dave Calhoun] and I told him that not only the quality of a serious hardware fix is important, but also time. Because the longer we wait to get that operational, the longer we’re having to extend KC-135s, KC-10s, and it just continues to add up.” Reports had emerged in January that the Air Force was not happy with Boeing’s proposals for fixing the RVS. At the same time, the service has said that it feels its relationship with the company has been on a more positive track since former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg resigned in December 2019 over a raft of issues, including the 737 MAX scandal. Calhoun took over as CEO in January. The issues with the RVS are well-established and have been known for some time now. You can read more about the specifics in these past War Zone pieces . The basic crux of the matter is that the system can’t be trusted to provide an accurate picture of what is going on at the rear of the plane to boom operators sitting in the main cabin of the KC-46A. This, in turn, increases the risks to the tanker and any receiving aircraft of serious accidents . Boom operators on the Air Force’s existing KC-135 and KC-10 tankers perform their task from a position at the back of aircraft where they directly observe what is going on. Boom operators sit at their workstations in the main cabin of a KC-46A., USAF Goldfein also said that there is still no firm schedule for when it will begin actually taking delivery of KC-46As with the RVS fixes or how long it might take to integrate them into the Pegasuses that Air Force has already accepted. As of December 2019, the service had received 30 of these tankers, the bulk of which are assigned to operational units. However, there are no plans to use them for aerial refueling missions until the improved vision system arrives. “If we go to a high-end contingency, we will put every KC-46 we have into the fight,” Goldfein said. “We won’t use it for day-to-day operations, but it will be made available for a contingency.” This was clearly meant to be reassuring, but is actually a pretty damning assessment of the aircraft’s utility in its present form. Goldfien is saying is that the Air Force would have to commit tankers to operations during a major conflict, potentially against a near-peer such as Russia or China, that it is not comfortable using for routine missions where the stakes are infinitely lower. This comes as the Air Force has proposed retiring 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in the 2021 Fiscal Year, a plan that increasingly appears dead on arrival in Congress. U.S. Army General Stephen Lyons, head of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), publicly decried this proposal during his own trip to Capitol Hill last week. A KC-10 refuels a KC-46 in the background as a KC-135 flies in the foreground., USAF Concerns about tanker capacity have been mounting for a while now , amid the persistent troubles with the KC-46A, and there is growing talk about seeking out other alternatives, such as contractor-operated tankers for non-combat missions. The Air Force has said that it could use the Pegasuses for cargo-carrying and medical evacuation missions in the interim. It’s not clear what all this might mean for any future Israeli KC-46As, or those destined for other foreign operators. Japan, the first and so far only confirmed customer beyond the U.S. Air Force, has orders for two Pegauses and Boeing says it will deliver the first one in 2021, years before the RVS fix is scheduled to be ready. It’s hard to see how KC-46As will be able to significantly improve the capabilities of any Air Force, including Israel’s, until Boeing can demonstrate that they can reliably perform their primary aerial refueling mission.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The entire crew of one of the Russian Navy’s eight Project 949A Oscar II class guided missile submarines is reportedly in quarantine over concerns they may have been exposed to the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. This underscores the very serious implications that the rapidly expanding pandemic is almost certain to have on the readiness of military forces around the world, including the U.S. military , as time goes on, something the War Zone has already explored in detail . B-port , an online Russian news outlet based in the northern port city of Murmansk, was first to report that the crew of the Oscar II class submarine Orel was in quarantine on Mar. 26, 2020. Russian Navy officials made this decision after learning that a civilian contractor who had visited the boat on official business had come into contact with another individual who tested positive for COVID-19. Orel is homeported at the Guba Bolshaya Lopatka submarine base, which is part of the larger Zapadnaya Litsa naval base, on the Kola Peninsula. The base is situated to the northwest of Murmansk, as well as Severomorsk, a closed city that serves as the headquarters for the Russian Navy’s entire Northern Fleet. It’s unclear how many Russian Navy personnel, as well as other individuals who work at Guba Bolshaya Lopatka, are in quarantine now, but a Project 949A submarine has a typical crew compliment of 110 . B-port also reported that personnel from a second, unnamed submarine and floating workshop moored close to Orel had been placed in insolation for fear that they may also have been exposed to COVID-19. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uKEPyiweA2o Orel is one of eight remaining Soviet-era Oscar II class submarines still in Russian Navy service, two of which are in the process of being upgraded to the improved Project 949AM standard . A ninth boat in the class, the Belgorod , is in the final stages of major conversion into a Project 09852 special projects submarine, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . A present, Orel is one of just three Oscar II s active with the Northern Fleet, the other two being the Voronezh and the Smolensk . The Tver , Omsk , and Tomsk are all assigned to the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet. The Oscar IIs, which began entering Soviet Navy service in the 1980s, still form the core of the Russian Navy’s guided-missile submarine force. They have a distinctive wide-bodied hullform with long compartments on either side between the boat’s inner and outer hulls. Each one of these two compartments contains launchers for 12 massive P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missiles, also known to NATO as the SS-N-19 Shipwreck. The boats also have four 533mm torpedo tubes that can fire both heavyweight torpedos and the unique RPK-6 Vodopad anti-submarine missile, or SS-N-16 Stallion, the latter of which you can read about more in this past War Zone story . A view of the Oscar II class submarine Smolensk showing off its particularly wide design., via Reddit The improved Project 949AM submarines will feature a new launch system that is capable of firing more modern missiles, including the P-800 Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missile and variants of the Kalibr land attack cruise missile. The new launchers will also reportedly be able to fire the shadowy 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile. For the moment, though, one-sixth of the Russian Navy’s Oscar II fleet is sidelined due to an invisible enemy, COVID-19, which raises questions about how the virus might impact the service’s future operations, across the board, in the coming weeks and months. If the virus were to spread to the crews of Russia’s ballistic missile submarines , it could severely limit the country’s second strike nuclear deterrent capabilities. The War Zone has already explored these issues with regards to the U.S. Navy and the same basic factors apply to Russia’s naval forces. Sailors on board ships and submarines work and live in very confined environments and COVID-19 has already demonstrated its ability to spread rapidly, in general. The U.S. Navy is already dealing with cases on a number of ships, most notably two Nimitz class aircraft carriers deployed in the Pacific region. This is likely to become an issue for navies around the globe. On Mar. 30, the Dutch Ministry of Defense announced that the country’s Walrus class attack submarine HNLMS Dolfijn , one of just four in service, was returning to port two weeks early after eight members of its crew tested positive for COVID-19. At least 15 sailors on the boat have displayed symptoms. The crew will be placed in quarantine after returning to the Netherlands. The Dutch Navy Walrus class attack submarine HNLMS Dolfijn. , DOD With regards to Russia’s military, Krasnaya Zvezda , the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, claimed on Mar. 30 that medical personnel had tested more than 3,700 individuals across the armed services for COVID-19, all of which had come back negative. However, its unclear how accurate this reporting is and, even if it is, the situation seems likely to change in the near future. Kremlin officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , had been downplaying concerns about the virus only to see a spike in confirmed cases across the country in the past week. Just in the past 24 hours , the Russian Coronavirus Response Center reported another 302 cases, bringing the nationwide total to 1,836. Moscow has now declared a total lockdown, but reports indicate that authorities may be having difficulty enforcing it . Russian President Vladimir Putin, in yellow protective gear, visits a hospital outside of Moscow designated to treat COVID-19 patients on Mar. 24, 2020., Alexei Druzhinin / Sputnik  via AP Whether the quarantining of Orel ‘s crew, as well as that of the second submarine and the personnel from the floating workship, at the Guba Bolshaya Lopatka submarine base, helps prevent an outbreak from occurring there remains to be seen. Whatever happens in the Murmansk region, COVID-19 is clearly becoming a larger threat to readiness of navies around the globe.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On September 11th, 2001, the unthinkable happened and the United States of America was attacked on its own soil. Much has been written about the events of 9/11 and the ensuing Global War On Terror, but as the years pass, more details and personal accounts are making their way into broader public knowledge. One of the least known events to fans of the SR-71 Blackbird and aviation aficionados everywhere is the Blackbird program’s brush with resurrection in the early 2000s. The original SR-71 program was officially terminated on the 22nd of November of 1989. A few flights occurred in 1990, including the coast-to-coast record-setting flight on the 6th of March to deliver Blackbird 61-7972 to the National Air & Space Museum in Washington DC. Proponents of the Blackbird believed a mistake had been made with its withdrawal from service and fought tooth and nail for its return. With enthusiasts around the world, and more importantly in Congress, the SR-71 was a hard program to kill. They prevailed and 100 million dollars were allocated by Congress in 1994 to return three SR-71s to Air Force service. However, the fight to end their service lives wasn’t over. In 1996 they were grounded again by Deputy Defense Secretary John White, but funding returned the same year. The program was ultimately canceled by President Clinton with a line-item veto in 1997. A Supreme Court ruling determined that the line-item veto was unconstitutional, but the funds were never issued. The final shut down of the United States Air Force SR-71 program occurred on Jun 30th, 1999 at DET 2, Edwards AFB. All remaining SR-71s were transferred to NASA . The final SR-71 flight was made by 61-7980 on October 9th of the same year at the Edwards AFB open house air show. Less than two years later and in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the 13th of September, 2001, the Pentagon asked if the SR-71 could be brought back. Not only was the answer yes, but the now-scattered Blackbird community could reconvene and provide intelligence products within 60 to 90 days at a cost of 45 million dollars for startup and one year of operations. The proposal went on to outline that year two costs would be reduced to 40 million dollars. The role for the SR-71 Blackbird in the Global War On Terror was purported by Major William Michael Zimmerman, SR-71 Reactivation Program Manager, to be wide-area mapping in addition to the ongoing strategic deterrent of making non-lethal shows of force in the form of sonic booms over or near enemy territory as directed by elected leaders and combatant commanders. USAF From the beginning of the program upstarts and shutdowns of the 1990s, five SR-71 Blackbirds were retained between NASA and the USAF, and all were based at Edwards AFB. Those included SR-71A 61-7968, which was prepped for a return to service, but kept in storage and not flown at all after February 12th, 1990. Ultimately, It was sent to the Virginia Aviation Museum in October 1999 and subsequently would have been unavailable for the 2001 proposed return. A total of four SR-71s were flown by the Air Force and NASA at different times as the program morphed in the 1990s. 61-7980 Stayed with NASA as #844 from 1990 on, 61-7967 was reactivated by the Air Force in 1995 from storage, and 61-7971 went to NASA as #832 in 1990, but was given back to the Air Force in 1995. The first built and last surviving of two SR-71B dual front cockpit trainer, 61-7956 , had stayed active at Edwards AFB supporting SR-71 flight training for both NASA (as #831) and Air Force aircrews. In early July 1999, all four flyable Blackbirds were transferred to NASA. SR-71B in full reheat for takeoff in from Edwards AFB in the 1990s. , NASA Three SR-71As remained available at Edwards AFB as of September 13th, 2001. Those included 61-7980 , 61-7971 , and 61-7967 . If the proposal to return SR-71 Blackbirds to service in the 2000s would have been pursued further, SR-71B 61-7956 more likely than not would have been pressed into duty for crew training and any combination of SR-71A tail numbers 61-7967, 61-7971 and 61-7980 would have been returned to the Air Force for operational missions. During the first reactivation of the SR-71 Blackbird in the mid-1990s, those five existing jets that had not been sent to museums were updated into relevance. The upgrades performed then would’ve carried them into the 2000s and enabled their integration into an Air Force that would have otherwise, in terms of technology and direction, moved on without them. To keep costs low, off the shelf parts were used to support this upgrade program. National Archives The best example of this upgrade effort was the inclusion of the L-52M datalink, which was listed as excess property by the U-2 program, but proved useful for Blackbirds after upgrading some of its components. The L-52M was engineered to access the same data interfaces as other in-use reconnaissance systems at the time. One benefit of this approach was the fact that intelligence analysts would not need to learn to interpret new data or learn new interfaces to do so. After the L-52M modifications, the SR-71’s intelligence products, namely those garnered from its Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS-2), now functioned like those of the other reconnaissance systems the analysts were familiar with and were now provided in near-real-time. Limited support from Air Force leadership and the perceived high cost of operation, which had been the bane of its existence for much of its later life, doomed the SR-71 Blackbird for a final time. Beyond the request to look into whether it could be brought back and the production of the subsequent proposal for doing so, the matter was not pursued any further. The reality was that the nature of airborne reconnaissance was deeply in flux at the time, which you can read about in detail here , here , and here , and spy satellites and the U-2s still in service could provide similar products as what the SR-71 could provide in many circumstances. The SR-71 Blackbird next to its U-2 Dragonlady progenitor, a plane that ended up surviving long after the SR-71 was retired. , National Archives The four remaining flyable SR-71 Blackbirds were disposed of by the end of 2003. 61-7980 stayed at Edwards AFB and was moved to a display near the Armstrong Flight Research Center in March of 2002. The other Blackbirds required shipping to their final resting places which necessitated their wings being sawed off by Worldwide Aircraft Recovery. The SR-71B trainer, 61-7956, lasted until March of 2003 at Edwards AFB when it was trucked to the Kalamazoo Air Zoo Museum in Michigan. 61-7971 was similarly sent to the Evergreen Aviation Museum in Mcminnville Oregon starting in 2002. In December of 2003 61-7967 was the last to leave Edwards AFB on its way to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana where it was placed on display at the 8th Air Force Museum. SR-71 61-7967 seen at Barksdale AFB. , National Archives The Blackbird community largely considers SR-71B 61-7956’s dismantling the conclusive end of the Blackbird program. With no trainer available to keep crews proficient, any hope of a return to service was lost. These events are well documented, but few people know that the Blackbirds actually had a chance at joining coalition efforts in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. No matter why it would have or didn’t come back that final time in 2001, it’s noteworthy that the Blackbird’s capabilities were still missed, at least to a limited degree, even in a new millennium it was never designed for.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 6, 2020","Now Both Aircraft Carriers In The Western Pacific Have COVID-19 Cases, Raising Readiness Concerns","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two sailors onboard the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan , which forward-deployed in Japan and presently pier-side there, have tested positive for the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. This comes just a day after the U.S. Navy announced it had quarantined the entire crew of another aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt , on their ship in port in Guam after a number of sailors contracted the virus. The War Zone had already warned that the Roosevelt ‘s predicament could be an ominous sign of what’s to come for the Navy. If Reagan is sidelined, as well, the service would have no carriers presently deployed in the Pacific region that can actually operate. Fox News was first to report the pair of COVID-19 cases among Reagan ‘s crew on Mar. 27, 2020. Fleet Activities Yokosuka, a U.S. Navy base in the city of the same name, where the carrier is presently moored, will reportedly be on lockdown at least through the weekend. It’s not clear yet what other steps the service may take, such as quarantining the entire ship. Though Japan was one of the first countries outside of China to report confirmed cases of COVID-19, the country has had success in limiting the spread of the virus. However, the Japanese capital Tokyo, some 40 miles north of Yokosuka, saw a spike in cases this week and authorities had already advised all residents to stay home this weekend to help prevent an “explosion” of new infections. Fleet Activities Yokosuka had also just reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case there on Mar. 26, which was also the first known instance of a U.S. service member being infected with the virus anywhere in Japan. However, the sailor in question had recently returned from the United States and the Navy believes that they may have contracted it while there. The service has not said what ship or other unit this individual is assigned to. The Pentagon has now instituted a 60-day halt to all troop movements to try to help contain the spread of the virus among its personnel worldwide. It’s unclear what impacts the COVID-19 cases may have on Reagan ‘s readiness. The ship is presently in port undergoing maintenance. It is, however, still a worrying development that could leave the Navy with no forward-deployed carriers in the Pacific region. Together, Roosevelt and Reagan also represent a fifth of the Navy’s Nimitz class ships, the Navy’s only truly operational supercarriers . With regards to Roosevelt , Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly stressed to reporters yesterday that the carrier was “operationally capable if called upon to do so.” If that were to change, two of the Navy’s other West Coast-based carriers, the USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Carl Vinson , are not immediately available for operations in the Pacific. Lincoln is in the post-deployment phase after spending a record amount of time in the Middle East earlier this year and Carl Vinson is in dry dock. A member of the Carl Vinson ‘s crew was also diagnosed with COVID-19 this week. The USS Nimitz , homeported at Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington, situated across the Puget Sound from Seattle, which has been experiencing a major outbreak of the virus, is still working up to its next deployment. The USS Theodore Roosevelt during an earlier port visit to Guam., USN Unfortunately, the virus has demonstrated its ability to spread extremely rapidly, especially in more confined environments where individuals interact closely on a regular basis, such as ships. The Navy is now testing all of the more than 5,000 sailors on Roosevelt to determine how many additional cases there might be. The total number of sailors from the carrier confirmed to have contracted the virus has already jumped from eight to 25 in the past 24 hours. There are now fears that the virus could spread further among personnel on Guam as individuals are brought ashore for treatment. “We’re fucked,” one servicemember reportedly told The Daily Beast in regards to the developing situation there. If the crews of both Roosevelt and Reagan find themselves incapacitated due to COVID-19, it could have major impacts on the near-term ability of the U.S. military to project power in the Pacific region during a crisis. This is something The War Zone has explored in-depth already and that you can read about more here . The U.S. military as a whole may be heading toward a concerning drop in readiness, too. The 1918 influenza pandemic had similarly significant impacts on the Navy, as well as the Marines and the rest of the U.S. armed forces. That virus killed more American service members than had died in the fighting in World War I. “I gave the fleet guidance and said, we have to do three things,” U.S. Admiral John Aquilino, head of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, told USNI News on Mar. 25. “The first is to ensure the health of our sailors and their families. The second is to ensure that we don’t spread this disease either to the homeland or to our allies and partners. And then the third is that we ensure we maintain our warfighting readiness.” U.S. Admiral John Aquilino, saluting, during a visit to the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Chafee in February., USN “We’re managing every event on a case-by-case basis,” he added. “We don’t comment on operational schedules, and we don’t put out information that might give any adversary an understanding of our readiness.” If the number of cases among Roosevelt ‘s and Reagan ‘s crews continues to grow exponentially, it may be hard not to acknowledge how serious the situation has become.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2020",COVID-19 Drives Command Teams Charged With Homeland Defense Into Cheyenne Mountain Bunker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Northern Command has dispersed essential command and control teams to multiple hardened locations, including the famous Cheyenne Mountain bunker complex in Colorado, as well as another unspecified site, and is keeping them in isolation. The command took these steps to help ensure these personnel can continue to watch around the clock for potential threats to the U.S. homeland as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand across the country and around the world, including within the U.S. military . U.S. Air Force General Terrence O’Shaughnessy, head of Northern Command (NORTHCOM), who also serves as the commanding officer of the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), detailed the changes during a virtual town hall on Facebook on Mar. 24, 2020. Under normal circumstances, the watch teams, which support both NORTHCOM and NORAD missions, would take shifts staffing a central command center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. “To ensure we can defend the homeland despite this pandemic, our command and control watch team here in the headquarters split into multiple shifts and portions of our watch team began working from Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station,” O’Shaughnessy explained. A portion of the watch team personnel remain in place at Peterson, as well. Cheyenne Mountain is a hardened command and control site, the bulk of which is located inside the mountain of same name, which is part of the Rocky Mountains’ Front Range and is situated just outside of Colorado Springs. Between 1965 and 2006, the complex served as NORAD’s primary command and control center. It was also home to U.S. Space Command between 1985 and 2002. It has also been a central feature in, or otherwise referred to, in a wide array of popular media , perhaps most famously being a key setting in the 1983 film WarGames . NORTHCOM and NORAD have continued to use Cheyenne Mountain for certain other functions since 2006, including monitoring for incoming ballistic missiles and tracking objects in space , and its facilities have received a number of upgrades over the past decade. In 2015, NORTHCOM and NORAD moved various communications functions from Peterson Air Force Base back into the complex over concerns about the potential threat of electromagnetic pulses , or EMPs. “Because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain’s built, it’s EMP-hardened,” U.S. Navy Admiral William Gortney, then-commander of NORTHCOM and NORAD said at the time. “So, there’s a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there. The complete complex is buried under 2,000 feet of solid granite and its individual facilities are contained within five acres of massive excavated tunnels tucked behind blast doors that weigh 25 tons. The U.S. government spent four years building the site, which it designed with the intention of it being able to survive a nuclear strike. One of Cheyenne Mountain’s 25-ton blast doors., AP “My primary concern was … are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I’m not at liberty to discuss who’s moving in there,” he added. NORTHCOM and NORAD only occupy approximately 30 percent of the complex’s physical space and personnel assigned to those commands make up just five percent of the day-to-day population within the facility under normal operating conditions, according to an official fact sheet . Cheyenne Mountain was also built to be self-sufficient for extended periods of time, with its own powerplant, heating and cooling systems, and water supply. These features make it ideal now for keeping NORTHCOM and NORAD’s watch teams isolated from the general population to reduce their chance of being exposed to the COVID-19 coronavirus. “Our dedicated professionals of the NORAD and NORTHCOM command and control watch have left their homes, said goodbye to their families, and are isolated from everyone to ensure they can stand the watch each and every day to defend our homeland,” General O’Shaughnessy said during the virtual town hall. “It’s certainly not optimal, but it is absolutely necessary and appropriate given the situation.” A US Army Stryker wheeled armored vehicle from the 4th Infantry Division positioned inside one of Cheyenne Mountain’s tunnels during an exercise., USAF O’Shaughnessy is definitely not wrong. COVID-19 has shown itself to be able to spread rapidly and without causing those who are infected to immediately show symptoms, increasing the chances that they’ll pass it on to others. Just this week, the Navy has seen cases appear among the crew of three of its Nimitz class supercarriers, which have raised serious concerns about the service’s ability to project power in the Pacific region. With this in mind, O’Shaughnessy that another portion of the watch teams had formed “a third team in an alternate location, as well.” The general did not specify where that third command and control watch team is situated. The Department of Defense does maintain an array of so-called “continuity” sites across the country specifically to help make sure that U.S. military personnel can carry out essential functions during any major contingency scenario, from a nuclear attack to a pandemic, such as the one the world is experiencing now. Many of these same facilities support broader “continuity of government” plans to provide secure space so other federal government entities, including the President of the United States, to keep on functioning through those same kinds of serious crises. You can read more about U.S. continuity of government planning in this past War Zone feature . A satellite image of Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, with the long snaking road that leads to its main entrance., Google Earth The rest of NORTHCOM’s headquarters at Peterson Air Force base have also adopted extreme so-called “social distancing” measures to reduce their interaction with each other and again limit the potential spread of the virus should it make its way onto the base. “Our personnel are operating in physical zones within the [headquarters] building and no one is crossing these pre-determined zones,” O’Shaughnessy said. Top U.S. military officials have adopted similar measures at the Pentagon and social distancing protocols are supposed to be in force across the services, though there is clear evidence that these policies have not been uniformly implemented. Steps are being made to enable personnel who can work remotely to be able to do so, but in doing so, a number of serious vulnerabilities to cyberattacks have also become apparent that now need to be mitigated. O’Shaughnessy said that NORTHCOM specifically had been in talks with Apple about developing solutions to both expand and improve opportunities for telework. He also pointed out that certain essential functions, such as those that watchstanders perform in command and control centers, simply cannot be done remotely. A view inside NORAD’s primary command center at Peterson Air Force Base. NORAD’s motto is “We Have The Watch.”, NORAD The Pentagon has actually taken steps to ensure that specialized continuity facilities such as Cheyenne Mountain are kept available for critical missions and do not get filled up with personnel from units that are simply looking for extra working space in order to meet social distancing guidelines. On Mar. 18, 2020, Derek Maurer, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Defense Continuity and Mission Assurance had issued a memorandum that specifically noted that U.S. military units were not authorized to use “DoD-level alternate sites … for purely social distancing purposes” and that “access [to those sites] requires special approval from the responsible command.” Maurer’s memo specifically mentioned another continuity site, the Raven Rock Mountain Complex (RRMC), also known simply as Site R, another huge underground city built under the Appalachian Mountains near Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. Situated near the presidential retreat at Camp David , Raven Rock, which began operations in the 1950s, has been described as an “underground Pentagon” and serves the primary backup location for senior Department of Defense personnel to operate from when necessary. Raven Rock, together with Cheyenne Mountain and the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center, another hardened complex situated in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, represent the core trio of known U.S. continuity of government sites. A portion of the Mount Weather complex also serves as a major command center for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is also involved in the COVID-19 response efforts . You can read more about Raven Rock and these other sites in this past War Zone piece . The portion of Maurer’s Email talking about continuity sites, such as Raven Rock., DOD The Pentagon restrictions on access to these sites are also necessary to prevent COVID-19 from penetrating into them, where it could rapidly spread and render the facilities non-functional until personnel could complete what would likely be a time consuming and costly decontamination effort.  “For other alternate sites, consider the impact of COVID-19 related decisions and ensure control measures are implemented to avoid site contamination,” Maurer’s memo said. It’s the same reason why NORTHCOM and NORAD’s watchstanders are now in isolation, even from other personnel at those commands. It’s not clear how long they will remain in that state in Cheyenne mountain and at the other, unnamed alternate site. Experts have warned that COVID-19 could continue to be a serious public health crisis in the United States, with major second-order impacts , for months, if not years , to come. “This is a marathon, not a sprint,” General O’Shaughnessy told those who took part in the virtual town hall, which included family members of personnel assigned to the command. Cheyenne Mountain and other hardened or isolated sites look set to be home to watch teams from NORTHCOM and NORAD for the foreseeable future to ensure they can continue performing their vital mission of monitoring the skies and space over North American and keeping a sharp lookout for other threats to the homeland.

Chris Harmer,"Updated on Dec 10, 2020",A Supercarrier Sidelined By COVID-19 Could Be The Canary In The Coal Mine For The Navy (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two days ago, three U.S. Navy sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) tested positive for COVID-19 . Yesterday an additional five sailors tested positive. This is the first time that the Navy has detected the virus aboard a warship at sea. While aircraft carriers have capable and well-equipped medical departments, complete with operating rooms and intensive care units, ships at sea are an extremely difficult environment in which to quarantine individuals who are infected. Accordingly, Roosevelt has suspended its deployment and is now in port in Guam. The entire ship will be placed in quarantine while its crew, literally all of the personnel aboard, will be tested for COVID-19. Quarantine In Guam Until yesterday, R oosevelt was operating in the Philippine Sea, northwest of Guam. While there is no good place for an entire aircraft carrier to go into quarantine, Guam is the best of several bad options. The vast majority of seaports in the world are collocated with highly concentrated populations. This is not the case in Guam. The population is concentrated on the central and northern plain of the island, while the Navy port and piers in Apra Harbor are located in the sparsely populated southern end of the island. As the picture below shows, Naval Base Guam is surrounded by open green space with no population density to speak of. USN Beyond that, there is a separate aircraft carrier pier that is even further isolated from the rest of the base, located at the end of a peninsula, with a single two-lane road leading down to it. If a ship is to be quarantined pier-side, Naval Base Guam is not just the closest location for Roosevelt, it also has the optimal configuration. How the quarantine will work in practice is yet to be determined. Roosevelt might not even stay pier-side. In order to achieve complete isolation, Navy leadership may decide to anchor the ship out in the middle of Apra Harbor. In this photo , you can see the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) at anchor with the carrier pier visible in the background. In this scenario, resupply of Roosevelt would probably take place via Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) from helicopters. By using only external loads hung in cargo slings , no person to person contact would occur between sailors onboard Roosevelt and Navy helicopter personnel operating out of Anderson Air Force Base, located just 20 miles to the north. Viral Outbreaks On Ships Are Extremely Hard To Contain While the economic implications of the COVID-19 outbreak are significant and highly visible, an outbreak of the virus aboard an aircraft carrier presents a fundamentally different challenge, with different implications, than an outbreak on land. Virtually any shipboard environment presents difficult conditions to contain a viral outbreak, but this is true more so on an aircraft carrier than on any other type of ship. When the carrier is deployed with its embarked air wing, there is over 5,000 personnel aboard. The only other type of ship that embarks a similar number of people is a cruise ship. Unlike cruise ships, which offer some personal space and the potential for quarantine as a protective measure against infection, sailors onboard aircraft carriers live in tightly confined spaces and eat in communal settings. Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Ernesto Santa Ana, assigned to Naval Medical Research Center, loads an ABI StepOne Plus RT-PCR machine with samples for complex surveillance testing for COVID-19 in Naval Medical Research Center’s mobile laboratory aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) March 19, 2020., USN As a practical matter, it is simply impossible to engage in any social distancing onboard an aircraft carrier. The potential for a few cases to spread out amongst the entire ship and air wing crew is extremely high. According to a study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the COVID-19 outbreak aboard the cruise liner Diamond Princess experienced a reproduction rate four times higher than on land in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak originated. Point being, even though the Navy has strict guidelines to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as norovirus , once any virus finds a human host onboard a ship, it’s extremely difficult to contain. This is one of the reasons the Navy is obsessive about cleanliness aboard ships. At the beginning of the article, we briefly mentioned that aircraft carriers have small, but well-equipped medical facilities onboard. The Navy’s fleet of amphibious assault ships is also similarly equipped. But for the most part, the purpose of the surgical suites or intensive care units onboard these large vessels is to stabilize casualties and keep them alive for further transport to shore-based hospitals with full trauma centers and all the medical equipment and supplies needed to treat patients in critical condition in a sustained manner. Isolating highly infectious persons is also something these facilities were not necessarily designed to handle. PACIFIC OCEAN (May 16, 2009) Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Edgar Nunez assists Capt. Kathleen O’Farrell during a surgery aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68). Nimitz and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 11 are conducting a Composite Training Unit Exercise off the coast of Southern California in preparation for a scheduled deployment to the western Pacific Ocean., USN In the case of COVID victims, many of those patients require intubation and ventilators to keep them alive. This treatment can last for several days, even weeks. Aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships simply aren’t manned or equipped to provide long term intensive care to patients with these types of symptoms. Smaller surface combatant vessels, including the Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Littoral Combat Ships , are only equipped with a basic single room medical dispensary and a few enlisted medical personnel. They do not have doctors onboard and would be challenged to provide any effective treatment to a patient suffering from advanced COVID-19 symptoms. Point being, the Navy’s only option in response to a sailor testing positive for COVID-19 onboard such a ship is to immediately evacuate that sailor and hope nobody else was infected. Keeping an infected sailor onboard for treatment is simply out of the question. Mass Vomiting And Diarrhea Lead To Sympathetic Vomiting Think about the last time you were sick – I mean really, really sick. Like food poisoning sick. You might have vomited several times. You might have experienced diarrhea for a period of time. But if you were sick at home, you probably had access to a private bathroom, shower, bath, and sink nearby with unlimited fresh water, soap, and toothpaste. Above all, you probably had at least a measure of privacy to wallow in your misery by yourself. Now think of experiencing those symptoms with hundreds of other people packed into tight quarters, sharing communal restroom and shower facilities. Imagine some of those people you are sharing facilities with are temporarily incapacitated and their aim, so to speak, is not state of the art and they can’t clean up after themselves. That’s what a tightly packed ship full of sailors who all get sick at once is like. I never knew there was such a thing as sympathetic vomiting until I, and the three fellow junior officers who lived with me in a four-man stateroom onboard USS George Washington (CVN-73) all got food poisoning from eating tainted chicken shawarmas purchased from a roadside vendor on the pier in Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates. If Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with its uber-luxurious archipelago of man-made islands just offshore are the tourist showcases of the Middle East, then Jebel Ali, the gritty industrial port facility located between those two opulent cities, is where the dirty work gets done. Amazingly, here is a picture from the National Archives showing this exact port call in December of 1997: National Archives In any case, my three roommates and I, living in the comparative luxury of a stateroom the size of a normal single bedroom, equipped with two bunk beds and an in-room sink, all pulled duty or alert the same day in port. By the time we were authorized to depart the ship, it was too late to grab a bus to make it all the way to Dubai for a decent meal, so we picked up some shawarmas from the roadside vendor on the pier. Most everyone reading this article who has been in the Middle East has experienced shawarma roulette, one way or another, and this time all four of us got hit. Once we were back on the ship that night, we all started feeling a little queasy. One of my roommates tried to sleep it off, failed, and as he attempted to depart the room and run to the communal restroom down the hall, he vomited. This is where the sympathetic vomiting comes in. While all four of us were on track to get sick, the one guy that puked first sort of catalyzed a collective response. I made it to the sink, but my other two roommates did not. Within 15 seconds or so, our room smelled horrible. We weren’t drunk or incapacitated, just sick, so we were able to clean up the tile floor, metal walls, and metal sink basin in about ten minutes. Fortunately, after this first session, subsequent physiological events were more manageable. Keep in mind, as junior officers, we had more spacious accommodations than the enlisted crew members, who are routinely assigned to common berthing areas with dozens of other sailors. Sailor berthing aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt following a 2010 upgrade. , USN Unlike food poisoning, COVID-19 victims don’t typically present with vomiting and diarrhea, but do suffer from inflamed airways. With that in mind, if one person on a ship has the virus, the chance of it spreading throughout the crew is very high. That’s why it is imperative for the Navy to get these infected sailors off of Roosevelt as soon as possible and quarantine the ship for the duration. I can only imagine the ship cleaning that is taking place right now, with industrial quantities of disinfectant. National Security Implications Are Significant While the health and safety of the crew onboard Roosevelt is of paramount importance, the risk to national security of losing a carrier on deployment to a viral outbreak is also significant. If enough members of any ship’s crew are diagnosed with a highly contagious or dangerous virus, the Navy will either delay or discontinue that ship’s operational schedule. This is what happened to the USS Dubuque (LPD-9) in 2009. After 50 members of that ship’s crew reported flu-like symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed that at least one crew member had tested positive for the H1N1 virus. Accordingly, the Navy canceled Dubuque’s participation in a scheduled exercise and delayed its deployment. If the COVID-19 outbreak is not contained onboard Roosevelt, the Navy will almost certainly have to suspend its deployment. If that happens, it might eventually anchor up off Okinawa to use the naval hospital there, or possibly stay in port in Guam or head to Hawaii, or even return all the way to its homeport of San Diego. What it won’t do is continue deployment with more and more crew members contracting the potentially lethal sickness. That could be very problematic for reasons other than the crew’s safety. USS Dubuque. , USN Aircraft carriers are the front line of America’s forward-deployed military presence. Combatant Commanders (COCOMS) crave the highly visible and potent presence that Carrier Strike Groups (CSG) bring to the table. CSGs can provide deterrence, build partner capacity through exercises with allied nations, and conduct kinetic strikes against targets on short notice. As an example of the utility of CSGs, US Central Command (CENTCOM) is currently operating two CSGs in the Middle East in order to demonstrate “combined joint capability and interoperability to plan and conduct multi-task force operations in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.” Reasonable people can differ on whether the aircraft carrier, with its massive cost basis and uncertain survivability against modern anti-ship ballistic missiles and other emerging threats, is still the best option for protecting American interests abroad. With that said, for the near future at least, the aircraft carrier still plays a central role in America’s national security strategy, and a COVID outbreak on a currently deployed aircraft carrier threatens to remove that forward-deployed part of America’s national security construct on short notice and leave a large and unfillable gap for a period of at least several months. The Theodore Roosevelt Strike Group underway. , USN Even with the high visibility role aircraft carriers play, there are other vessels that play a less obvious, but perhaps more critical role. The US Navy operates 14 Ohio Class ballistic missile submarines. Ballistic missile submarines are the most survivable element of the nuclear deterrence triad and are considered largely impervious to enemy detection. They represent a near-guaranteed, survivable element to retaliate against any enemy that might consider a nuclear attack against the United States. While the exact operational norms of the ballistic missile submarine fleet are highly classified, most analysts believe there are at least two and usually more Ohio class submarines on deployment at any one time. If a ballistic missile submarine currently on deterrence patrol or one preparing to deploy suffers an outbreak of COVID-19, the Navy would have to immediately deploy a submarine ahead of schedule to cover for the non-deployable crew. Beyond that, because these ballistic missile submarines operate in complete isolation from any other ships, far from shore, with essentially no physical contact with the outside world for months at a time, it would be almost impossible to get an infected sailor off the submarine for at least several days, probably longer, and even doing so would likely give up the submarine’s position. During that time, because of the extremely tight confines on these vessels, the entire crew would be at risk of infection. The human density aboard a submarine is extreme and weeks can go by without even an opportunity for fresh air. Considering the strategic nature of their operations, especially the nuclear-armed SSBNs, the stakes are very high when it comes to the possibility of an outbreak on board. Here a ceremony aboard USS Rhode Island is seen., USN The Navy can handle a few sailors here and their testing positive for COVID-19. But if a critical mass of a ships’ crews gets infected, or if a Navy homeport like San Diego or Norfolk experiences an outbreak, it could have a serious impact on the Navy’s ability to deploy. For any military unit, an outbreak of COVID-19 is a serious threat. The difference between land-based units and ships is, at sea, it is virtually impossible to isolate the infected individual. As a separate issue, smaller ships currently have no ability to test for COVID-19. Navy leadership is scrambling to figure out how to do that right now. Early testing, and then confinement, is the only possible way to contain an outbreak on a ship. With no testing available for smaller ships, it is possible that an outbreak would spread and infect the entire ship’s crew before even before any individual started experiencing symptoms. By that point, it would be too late to isolate any individual crew member that is infected. The Navy is always meticulous about personal hygiene and shipboard cleanliness, but these issues are now literally a matter of national security. Yet even doing everything possible in these regards may not save a ship from widescale infection due to COVID-19’s insidious nature. In many ways, the economic, social, and political instability that accompanies a global pandemic makes the world a more dangerous place. The loss of a single aircraft carrier to a COVID-19 outbreak reduces the American military presence that guarantees the international rules-based order that has reigned since the end of the Cold War. Sidelining multiple ships simultaneously due to a series of outbreaks is a far more perilous situation that is troublingly plausible at this point. Here’s hoping the sailors on Roosevelt and other Navy ships and submarines, standing the watch while their families face an uncertain fate at home, as well as the Navy as a whole, avoid that fate. UPDATE: 8:15AM PDT— 25 sailors from Theodore Roosevelt now test positive for COVID-19. The Navy is expecting many more and it may be so bad that they no longer disclose just how many of the ship’s crew have contracted the virus. According to the Daily Beast , a questionable setup is in place to care for the sick from the ship: One U.S. service member assigned to the working parties in Guam, who asked not to be named, told The Daily Beast that some troops are afraid they will contract the coronavirus from crew members arriving from the Roosevelt. The service member added, “We’re fucked.” … But in Guam on Wednesday, both Navy and Marine Corps service members set up roughly 140 military beds in a basketball gymnasium. To squeeze more troops into the gym, Navy medical professionals recommended measuring the six-foot distance per guidance from the CDC from the center of the bed rather than from the outer edges, meaning that the beds are actually three feet apart. The CDC also suggests avoiding mass gatherings as a part of its social distancing guidelines. The Pentagon has executed a 60 days freeze on all scheduled troop movements as a measure to help stop spreading the virus among its personnel. The measure will have major implications for the U.S. military’s force posture and readiness overseas. UPDATE: 10:25AM PDT— Now sailors on the forward-deployed supercarrier USS Ronald Reagan have come down with COVID-19 too, raising readiness concerns even more. Read our full story and update here.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2020","Nukes Drive Germany’s Plan To Replace Tornados With Typhoons, Super Hornets, and Growlers","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Germany is reportedly getting close to settling on split purchase of Eurofighter Typhoons and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers to replace its aging fleet of Panavia Tornado swing-wing combat jets. A key driving factor behind the compromise proposal is the need for the German Air Force to have an aircraft that could deliver American nuclear gravity bombs under a NATO agreement . It has become increasingly clear that the process for getting the Super Hornets certified to carry these weapons is significantly less complex than doing the same for the Typhoon. German media outlets first reported on the plan on Mar. 26, 2020, which German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has not yet formally approved. Under the proposal, Germany could purchase a total of up to 90 Typhoons and 30 F/A-18E/Fs and 15 EA-18Gs in the coming years. Of the 90 Typhoons, half would go toward replacing the Tornados while the other half would replace the oldest Eurofighters now in German service. At present, the German Air Force has around 93 Tornados and 141 Typhoons in inventory. Germany has been struggling through plans to replace the Tornados since at least 2017. What was then West Germany received the first of these jets in 1979. German officials want to begin acquiring replacement aircraft starting 2025 to ensure that there is no loss of capability when the last of the Tornados leave service in 2030. The availability rates of the Tornados have already plummeted in recent years . Germany reportedly withdrew the small number of jets it had deployed in Jordan to conduct unarmed reconnaissance missions in support of coalition operations against ISIS terrorists in Iraq, though it’s unclear if that was a result of the low readiness of the fleet overall. The German government had considered acquiring F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, but later decided that the Typhoon, which it already operates, was the preferred option . The issue then became about whether these aircraft would be able to fulfill Germany’s obligations under the NATO nuclear weapons sharing agreement. A pair of German Air Force Typhoons., Bundeswehr That deal means U.S. B61 nuclear gravity bombs are stored at Büchel Air Base in Germany, as well as bases in certain other NATO countries, and American authorities could release the bombs for use by German pilots in a crisis. The Tornado is certified to carry these weapons and tests have been conducted already to support the integration of the newest B61-12 variant onto those aircraft. Neither Typhoon nor Super Hornet is certified to carry any variant of the B61. The U.S. Navy removed nuclear weapons from its aircraft carriers in the 1990s, which led to the elimination of the requirement for the Super Hornet, an aircraft that first entered service in 2001, to carry these weapons. From top to bottom, an F/A-18E Super Hornet, an F/A-18F Super Hornet, and an EA-18G Growler., Boeing A spokesman for Airbus, one of the major parties in the Eurofighter consortium that builds these jets, told German business daily Handelsblatt that it could certify the Typhoon for the nuclear mission in the future. However, the German government’s position seems to be that Boeing can get the F/A-18E/F ready to carry B61s in a shorter amount of time. It took years for Typhoon to get a true multi-role capability and that did not involve the hurdles that would be present in getting the U.S. government to certify a non-American-made jet to carry American nuclear weapons. “We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [German’s] timeline,” Dan Gillian, the head of Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler programs, told The War Zone regarding this issue in 2019. The addition of Growlers to the plan would also offer a more direct replacement for the Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance variants , or ECRs, in Germany’s Tornado fleet. The Tornado ECRs are specifically configured to conduct suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) missions and have specialized systems to spot and locate enemy radars and other emitters. A German Air Force Tornado ECR in a NATO “ Tiger Meet ” paint scheme and carrying four AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles., Bundeswehr SEAD is one of the Growler’s missions sets, as well, but these aircraft offer far more robust electronic warfare capabilities, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , over the older Tornado ECRs. Beyond simply replacing the Tornado ECRs, an improved aerial electronic warfare capability was also seen as another requirement to support the nuclear mission. Growlers would be essential for protecting non-stealthy Super Hornets on nuclear, as well as conventional strikes missions, against a major adversary with a capable integrated air defense network, such as Russia. Existing and emerging air defense threats had been at the core of the argument that certain elements of the German military had made for buying stealthy F-35s. Growlers would also just be a major force multiplier for the entire German Air Force. In November 2019, Airbus did announce plans for a two-seat Typhoon ECR variant and Handelsblatt said that the decision about which aircraft to pick was “highly controversial.” The Growler has a significant advantage of being both in production and in service, both with the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, already. The Navy is also underwriting upgrades for the Growler, as well as the Super Hornet, and Germany could easily benefit from those developments with minimal, if any direct investment on its part. This is not the case when it comes to Typhoon, where the German government has a major stake in the program. An artist’s rendering of the two-seat Typhoon ECR variant, at left, as well as single-seat Typhoon configured for the SEAD mission., Eurofighter An infographic describing the features of the future Typhoon ECR variant., Airbus Germany, together with France and Spain, is still pushing ahead with plans to develop a new stealth fighter under the Future Air Combat System (FCAS) program. That project is also set to include the development of other supporting designs, including unmanned loyal wingmen drones , or what Airbus refers to as “ remote carriers .” A true unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) might also be among the associated projects. At present, the participating countries hope that the first examples of the manned aircraft component of the FCAS program will begin entering service in 2040. In the meantime, the split purchase of jets to replace the Tornado does offer a way for Germany to support the portions of its own domestic industrial base that are involved in the production of the Typhoon and acquire other key capabilities, such as nuclear-capable aircraft and new electronic warfare jets, relatively rapidly. There could also be drawbacks. While the German Air Force should have no real difficulty absorbing the additional Typhoons into its existing force structure, the F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs will be entirely new types of aircraft for the service to operate and maintain. A fleet of just 45 Super Hornets and Growlers, in total, is relatively small, which could make it even costlier to sustain over time. Germany’s government does still need to approve the proposed split purchase and it’s unclear when exactly that might happen. The German Air Force’s Tornados have been in desperate need of a replacement for years now already, so the country can ill afford to wait much longer to finalize a plan. Whatever the case, the days of those swing-wing jets in German service look increasingly numbered and seems ever more likely that the country will be flying a mix of Typhoons, Super Hornets, and Growlers in the years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 5, 2020",Check Out This Soviet Submarine Firing A Nuclear Ballistic Missile While Docked Pierside,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have been circulating online of a Soviet Delta III class nuclear ballistic missile submarine firing an R-29R submarine-launched ballistic missile during an exercise while still in port, a unique tactic that no other country appears to have ever employed. Last year, the Russian Navy reportedly conducted a similar test, but which involved a Yasen class guided-missile submarine conducting a pier-side launch of a Kalibr cruise missile , apparently for the first time ever. The date and exact circumstances of the particular exercise seen in the photos on social media are unclear. An article in Russia’s Izvestia newspaper in 2019 said that the Soviet Navy had first begun training ballistic missile submarine crews to carry out these pier-side launches in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This would fit broadly with the fact that a Delta III class submarine is seen in the pictures firing the R-29R missile . The Soviet Navy commissioned the first of the Delta IIIs, also known as Project 667BDR Kalmar class boats, in 1976.Â The last member of the 14-ship class entered Soviet Navy service in 1982. The posts online generally agree that the launch took place prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Today, just one of these submarines, the Razan , also known as K-44, remains in active service as a ballistic missile submarine. Another Delta III , the Orenburg , or BS-136, is also still sailing, but has been converted into a special projects submarine capable of serving as a mother ship for small spy submarines, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece .

This is in no small part because of their ability to operate submerged, often cruising slowly and quietly in remote areas, for weeks or months at a time.Â Why the Russians decided to train their boomer crews to also be prepared to have them launch their world-ending weapons without ever leaving port is not entirely clear. “The fleet does not always have the deployment time necessary for the ships to depart from the pier and proceed to the previously designated strike area,” Igor Kurdin, a retired Russian Navy submarine captain and head of the St. Petersburg Club of Submariners, a naval veterans organization , told Izvestia last year. The R-29R has a range of just under 4,040 miles, which would have allowed submarines armed with those missiles, such as the Delta III s, to hit anywhere in Europe, as well as portions of Alaska, Canada, and the northeastern United States, from naval bases in Russia’s northwestern corner. Ballistic missile submarines based in Russia’s Far East region would have been within range of Alaska, as well as, along with Hawaii and other targets in the Western Pacific, such as major American military bases on Guam . The Delta III class submarine Razan ., Russian Navy While the submarines would not be hidden in any way while in port, being able to fire their missiles while still moored at the pier would have made them a standing threat at all times. The Soviets could also have made use of the submarines without the need to find a full crew and otherwise provision them for long cruises, if necessary. The tactic would also have given the Soviets some added defense against a first strike or otherwise losing ballistic missile submarines in port before they could fire their missiles during the initial wave of strikes in a nuclear conflict. Submarine bases would have been high priority targets in either of those scenarios and, as the retired Russian Navy captain Kurdin noted, the boomers might not have been able to escape out to sea before incoming strikes hit. Being able to fire their missiles from their moorings would have allowed them to still attempt to launch retaliatory strikes before being destroyed. There are, of course, risks and drawbacks to doing this, as well, not least of which what could happen if the missile were to fail for some reason. The shock and blast from firing the missiles might also cause increased wear and tear, and even damage, to the submarine’s moorings. There is no indication that the U.S. Navy, or any other country that operates nuclear ballistic missile submarines, has ever experimented with or actively trained to employ this same tactic. It’s unclear whether the Russian Navy continued to train boomer crews to carry out these operations after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In March 2019, Izvestia did report that Russia’s sole Project 885 Yasen class guided-missile submarine, the Severodvinsk , had fired a Kalibr land-attack cruise missile while pier-side at the Nerpichya Naval Base, part of the larger Zapadnaya Litsa base, in Murmansk. This appeared to indicate a more recent revival of the tactic that was afforded by the fact that the Severodvinsk has a vertical launch capability. Other Russian submarines capable of firing Kalibrs do so by launching them via their torpedo tubes, something that cannot be readily done in port.Â https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE The 3M-14 variants of Kalibr, which can carry nuclear warheads, have a range between 930 and 1,500 miles, according to publicly available information . Russia is also reportedly working on a new, extended-range Kalibr-M that can hit targets over 2,800 miles away, at least.Â With a range of 1,500 miles, Severodvinsk , or any other submarine capable of vertically launching these variants of Kalibr, such as the improved Project 885M Yasen-M submarines now under construction, could strike targets across Scandanavia and in northern Europe, as well as Iceland , on short notice from bases in northeasternÂ Russia. Other improved cruise missiles, such as the shadowy hypersonic 3M22 Zircon , which is in development now, could further expand those capabilities. From what we know, however, Zircon has a significantly shorter range than Kalibr. Increased Russian submarine activity in the Atlantic has become a particular point of concern for the U.S. military, as well as its NATO allies, in recent years, which you can read about more in these past War Zone stories . The Kalibr cruise missile has also come up as representing an especially notable threat to America’s European allies and partners.Â “The Kalibr class cruise missile, for example, has been launched from coastal-defense systems, long-range aircraft, and submarines off the coast of Syria,” U.S. Navy Admiral James Foggo, head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and commander of NATO’s Allied Joint Force Command Naples, said in 2018 . “They’ve shown the capability to be able to reach pretty much all the capitals in Europe from any of the bodies of water that surround Europe.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=dkP1rRNFcsM Russia’s revival of the tactic of being able to fire missiles from submarines in port only increases the flexibility of Severodvinsk and other future guided-missile submarines with vertical launch system capabilities, even in times where there might be too few resources to actually put them out to sea. It offers the benefit of being able to make use of boats on short notice for long-range strikes and reducing the chance of a pre-emptive strike negating their retaliatory capability just as it did for the Soviet Navy’s boomers. If nothing else, it’s another example of interesting and unique naval tactics and capabilities that the Soviets developed during the Cold War and that continue to inform Russian Navy operations to this day.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the 2004 and 2005 time frame, the Global War On Terrorism was in full swing with a high ops tempo. The United States Air Force’s Air Combat Command made a routine out of keeping a bomber rotation at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and that’s how the author found his way there. B-1s, B-52s , and the occasional B-2 regularly made deployments there to stage for combat missions over Afghanistan. Actually a United States Naval Support Facility with a deep water port and runway capable of receiving the Space Shuttle, Diego Garcia is a part of the British Indian Ocean Territories comprising the greater Chagos Archipelago. Its extreme isolation has made it a hotbed for unsubstantiated accusations of classified and even nefarious activity. I never observed anything nefarious, but it was entertaining reading about how the tent I lived in was supposedly part of a CIA “black site” for terrorist detainees. If the Air Force’s rowdy flightline maintainers and their tent city could be considered detainees in the Global War On Terror, then an ounce of truth could be credited towards the metric ton of false information that could be found on the internet about the remote Indian Ocean outpost. The airfield on Diego Garcia in the mid-2000s. , Google Earth If nothing else, the 2004-2005 deployment was eventful. From the outset, we experienced a tsunami that spared the flightline and tent city, but caused damage to the eastern side of the atoll. Just like in Forrest Gump , we discovered that tropical storms can actually cause rain that seemingly comes sideways from every angle and even straight up from the ground. Mysterious Visitors During one week in 2005, we were advised that the Navy was conducting sensitive operations out of a large, red, dilapidated hangar at the Northern end of the airfield near the passenger terminal and base operations building. Air Force personnel were advised to stay away. For the entirety of the week, the hangar appeared unused and empty. One night during that week, the flightline was evacuated. The base was locked down and Air Force personnel were advised to stay inside and away from windows to protect an incoming classified aircraft. Everyone complied without protest or hesitation. There’s no quiet like the silence of a shutdown airfield on an atoll more than 2,000 miles away from the nearest sign of civilization. In the absence of takeoffs, landings, and idling F-101-GE-102 turbofans and auxiliary power units (APUs) on B-1 bombers, you begin to hear waves on the beach and wind in the trees through open windows. We anticipated hearing some sign of an arrival. The bark of high-pressure tires touching pavement, the clattering of segmented disc brake rotors, or the throb of those brakes being applied heavily as a large jet slowed itself after touching down. Maybe even an idling jet engine or humming turboprop propeller could have been harbingers of us soon being allowed back outside. B-1Bs and KC-10s on the ramp at Diego Garcia during the Global War On Terror. , DoD Around a half-hour came and went and we were cleared to get back to our wartime operations tempo. We never heard or saw a sign that anything happened at all. No sleek black spy plane parked by the Navy ramp and no activity by the mysterious hangar. As a lifelong fan of all things aviation and defense, a side of me positively hoped to catch a glimpse of some rare, glamorous jet. As with most things for active-duty military, all hope of glamour was swiftly replaced with the mundane and routine. Years later at my home station of Dyess Air Force Base , an operational readiness exercise was interrupted by a similar call from the command post. Evacuate the flightline and evacuate it now. An aircraft no one can lay eyes on was diverting to Dyess Air Force Base. Why? Because it is. Go inside and stay away from the windows. It may not be as isolated as Diego Garcia, but Dyess is to the West of Abilene, Texas. It’s situated just outside of town and the flightline lies in the country. On the rare occasions that the flightline has no running engines or APUs, it gets very quiet. Dyess AFB., Google Earth My curiosity was piqued, but it unfolded much in the way the Diego Garcia incident did and without incident. I personally didn’t hear or otherwise detect any sign of an arrival or departure. It must be noted that in nearly a decade at Dyess and to the best of my knowledge and memory, there was never a single hangar, ops building or section of the flightline deemed off-limits for a sensitive, let alone classified project. The Dyess flightline is like that of many Cold War B-52 bases. Long and straight, sitting parallel to a long runway suitable for heavyweight bomber takeoffs on their way to training, or potentially the Soviet Union. Nothing unusual was to be seen for miles in each direction upon our return to the flightline. What were these mystery aircraft? What’s hiding behind the military’s technological curtain is certainly fascinating to ponder. The War Zone has extensively documented what is publicly known about the United States Air Force and Navy’s pursuit of secretive unmanned aerial systems and other projects , such as the long-running goal of retaining a low observable special forces transport and the operations of the shadowy RQ-170 Sentinel . Still, I have no idea what aircraft paid me and my squadron mates a visit on those two occasions. By the time the SR-71 made it out of Area 51, it was a glittering jewel in our nation’s aerospace crown. That is just the type of aircraft a lifelong aviation fanatic hopes they’ve been privy to in any mysterious aircraft encounter. Though I remain hopeful for a public release one day that fits my timeframe and locations, as time passes it becomes exceedingly unlikely I will be so lucky. An SR-71 in a hangar at dusk. , Lockheed Martin Other military personnel share similar experiences that are seemingly brushes with black projects; some seemingly factual, but many bordering on myth, and in some cases, utter absurdity. In the complete and absolute vacuum of anything seen or heard on either occasion, personal to myself I can’t even speculate as to what happened or what the aircraft involved was. That much is agreed upon by those I shared the experiences with. Looking back, I’ve had to relegate those two experiences to the unknown with diminished expectations they will ever come back to me in a new light. What conclusion is to be drawn? One’s own military experiences become mundane in their day-to-day execution and every job has it’s annoyances, no matter how glamorous seeming they may be from the outside. Combat aircraft, for example, are notoriously high maintenance. Conceivably, somewhere out there is an F-22 Raptor pilot who is frustrated to taxi five minutes late because a nagging problem on startup required that he call maintenance. It’s those moments in which the greater privilege of being part of our nation’s legacy and heritage of aerial achievement and advanced technology is lost on the individual. The break in what becomes a mundane routine comes in experiences like the two I shared in this article. They serve as a powerful reminder that our nation has the most advanced fighting force ever seen in all of human history and that force appears to have some wondrous capabilities that lay tucked away out of sight. Some of which we may never truly understand. I am just glad I got to at least be in close proximity to such a thing, not one, but two times in my military career.

The U.S. Army has picked Bell’s Invictus and Sikorsky’s Raider X as the two prototype designs that will face off against each other under its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. The two helicopters represent the most mature of the proposals that the service received and also stand at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of relative complexity. The Army’s Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, which is managing FARA, announced that it had picked Bell and Sikorsky to proceed to the competitive prototype phase of the program on Mar. 25, 2020. The service is looking to fill a gap in its aviation capabilities left by the earlier retirement of its OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopters and it could ultimately replace nearly half of its AH-64 Apache attack helicopters with the winning FARA design. “The selection of the Bell 360 Invictus to continue in the FARA program builds on our decades-long legacy as an innovator in reconnaissance rotorcraft supporting the maneuver force,” Mitch Snyder, President and CEO of Bell, said in a statement. “Our team has applied innovative thinking with tested technology to give the Army a low-risk option to fulfill its requirements on an aggressive schedule.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=nsgE4hR7SeY https://youtube.com/watch?v=8V1svIM_DFw https://youtube.com/watch?v=kEZqRoKr0bs “We are honored the Army selected our game changing X2 Technology for Phase 2 of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Competitive Prototype (CP) program,” Andy Adams, Vice President of Future Vertical Lift at Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, said in a separate statement. “Through our mature S-97 RAIDER technology demonstrator, we continue to optimize our FARA solution, which will provide the Army with an integrated weapon system that combines speed, range, maneuverability, survivability and operational flexibility. This approach is driving down risk and will result in an aircraft solution that is capable of executing the Army’s joint all-domain operations.” Bell and Sikorsky beat out other offers from Boeing, a partnership between AVX Aircraft and L3 , and from another team that included Karem Aircraft , Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. Airbus Helicopters had considered entering the competition and the Army had disqualified a proposal from MD Helicopters . Bell’s Invictus is a conventional single-engine helicopter design and was the least complex of the entrants. The company focused heavily on a low-cost, low-risk development strategy that leveraged work it had done on earlier helicopters, particularly on its Model 525 Relentless , including that helicopter’s advanced fly-by-wire system . You can read more about Invictus in this past War Zone piece . An artist’s conception of Bell’s Invictus., Bell “To ensure the team stays on schedule and on budget, Bell is using a digital design-as-built process. The team is able to connect and collaborate in a real-time digital environment to ensure alignment among all trades to facilitate smoother manufacturing, improve sustainability characteristics, and mitigate schedule risks,” Bell’s statement added. “This process has been used and refined on Bell commercial projects, as well as during the recent U.S. Army Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator program that produced the Bell V-280 Valor .” Sikorsky’s offering is a compound helicopter design that features a co-axial main rotor and pusher prop in the rear. While it is more complex than Bell’s Invictus, the Raider X design is also fairly mature, being derived from the existing S-97 Raider , examples of which have been flying since 2015. The S-97 was based on technology from the X2 compound helicopter demonstrator, which first flew in 2008. Sikorsky had actually proposed the S-97 for the Army’s abortive Armed Aerial Scout program, another effort to replace the OH-58D, which the service canceled in 2013. The S-97 and Raider X also share technology with the SB>1 Defiant , which Sikorsky developed with Boeing under the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR-TD) program. You can read more about the S-97 and Defiant in this past War Zone story . Earlier this month, the Bell-Boeing team, as well as Sikorsky, received new contracts to continue work on their respective JMR-TD designs as a further lead-in risk-reduction effort to the separate Future Long Range Assault Aircraft ( FLRAA ) program. The Army is leading the FLRAA effort, which is primarily focused on finding a replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk . FARA stands to be particularly lucrative for the company that wins the competition. The Army expects to acquire hundreds of the new helicopters to take the place AH-64 Apaches presently serving in its attack reconnaissance squadrons At present, the Army hopes to have flying prototypes of both Invictus and Raider X ready to begin testing in the 2022 Fiscal Year. It then hopes to pick a winning design in the 2024 Fiscal Year. If all goes to plan, the head-to-head competition between Bell and Sikorsky, which starts now, stands to significantly change the composition of the Army’s armed helicopter fleets for years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has released a video montage with numerous clips of its pre-production Su-57s , including a previously unseen instance of one of the aircraft firing an air-to-air missile. At first glance, the clip appears to show the first known instance of the advanced combat jet firing a missile from one of its two small wing-root weapons bays , but upon closer examination, that may not be the case. The video, which has the fantastical title “Beyond the laws of physics: the Russian ASF [Aerospace Forces] pilots have fully mastered Su-57 fighters,” first appeared on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official YouTube channel on Mar. 24, 2020. This appears to have been in advance of the Day of Fighter Aviation of the Russian Air Force, which is Mar. 25. The video’s release also comes some four months after images emerged of what appeared to be a new compact Russian air-to-air missile, derived, at least in part, from the medium-range R-77-series. Its overall size and other design elements suggested it could potentially be intended to fit inside the Su-57’s wing root bays. You can read The War Zone ‘s full analysis of this missile here . So, it would certainly be interesting to finally see an Su-57 fire any missile from one of these bays, or even with these bays open at all. There has been no known imagery or video of the bays open since the aircraft was first shown to the public a decade ago. The missile launch clip begins at approximately 1:19 in the runtime of the video below: The Su-57 in the video fires what appears to be a short-range R-74/K-74-series . The weapon, including a portion of its body, is visible the entire time and there is no clearly discernable bay door seen. Not only is there no publicly available pictures of these wing root bays open, but there also isn’t any hard information about whether they are operational or how exactly they are supposed to work. A look underneath a pre-production Su-57 with the inboard external underwing pylons installed. The wing root bays are visible between those pylons and the aircraft’s engine intakes., Russian Ministry of Defense It is possible that a trapeze mechanism, similar broadly to the one the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 Raptors use to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles from their cheek bays, might extend the missile outward from the wing root bays into the slipstream. The problem here is that it has long appeared that the R-74/K-74 series of missiles, as well as earlier R-73 models, are simply too bulky to fit inside the Su-57’s wing root bays, something The War Zone has pointed out in the past. F-22’s side weapons bay with its launch rail carrying an AIM-9X extended. , USAF Fitting a trapeze mechanism, especially one able to extend the missile so far forward, into the bay could further reduce the available space inside the confines of the bay. There are reports that a low-profile version of the K-74, the K-74M2 , has been in development, with a particular eye toward internal carriage on the Su-57. However, the fin configuration of the missile in the video looks unchanged from existing models. Missiles on display at Russian defense firm Vympel NPO’s I. I. Toropov design facility in November 2019, including an R-74/K-74-series missile second from the top. What appears to be a new compact air-to-air missile design, which would be ideal for internal carriage, is seen at the top., Anton Novodereshkin/TASS The Su-57 may have some unique configuration inside the bays to recess the missile and its launch rail and then extend it for launch. There is no external evidence that it has bay doors that can close or partially close with the missile extended, similar to the novel design found on China’s J-20 . It is possible, albeit very unlikely, that the mechanisms to do this are not clearly visible or not yet fitted on the small Su-57 fleet. It is more likely that the Su-57 in question has its bay doors removed for this test. It could even be using some sort of test pylon in this particular case. This would make sense if the smaller form factor variant of the K-74 is not available yet for internal carriage and testing. Regardless, we know that the Russian Air Force is conducting various trials with their pre-production Su-57s and that it is exploring integrating new weapons and other systems onto these aircraft, especially with plans now to dramatically increase the size of the fleet and move the aircraft closer to a true operational capability. So far, the Russian Air Force has taken delivery of just over a dozen pre-production examples of these advanced combat jets since the type’s first flight in 2010. The Kremlin now has 76 of these jets on order, but the first serial production aircraft was destroyed in an accident in December 2019 in a major setback for the program. All said, although the video is intriguing, there’s no clear proof that we have gotten our first look at one of the jets firing a missile from one of those internal bays. We may be seeing a step being taken to realize that aspirational capability, but until we have more information or other angles of the test in question, we can’t say for certain if these bays are operational or even exactly what missile will end up being fired out of them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",CIA’s Predecessor To The SR-71 Blackbird Tested Electron Guns To Hide From Radars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Central Intelligence Agency initiated the Oxcart program , which led to Lockheed’s A-12 spy plane , the predecessor of the U.S. Air Force’s SR-71 Blackbird , specifically because of concerns that the iconic U-2 Dragon Lady was becoming too vulnerable to Soviet and other hostile air defenses. The aircraft’s primary advantages were in its ability to fly extremely high and fast, but it was apparent from the beginning of its development that those capabilities might not be enough to defend against existing and emerging threats at the time. As a result, the A-12 itself featured then-state-of-the-art stealthy shaping together with radar-evading structures that made heavy use of composites and that were coated in radar-absorbing materials. The CIA undertook further efforts to explore more novel means of reducing the radar cross-section of the planes, including the development of a cesium-laced fuel additive intended to shield its rear aspect from radar waves using a concept called “plasma stealth,” which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone feature . This same principle also led to the development of powerful electron guns that the A-12 could carry inside its fuselage to create similarly radar-absorbing fields in other directions, according to various declassified documents now available online via the CIA Records Search Tool, or CREST. The CIA’s search for a U-2 successor began in 1956 and in two years the Agency had determined the proposals from Lockheed and Convair represented the most viable designs. Stealthy features became the deciding factor. “On 28 August 1959, Mr. Bissell [Dr. Richard Bissell] told me to come east for the 19th time in this competition,” Clarence “Kelly” Johnson , the famous Lockheed engineer who for years ran the company’s Advanced Development Programs (ADP) division, or Skunk Works, explained in a previously classified 1968 official internal history of the A-12. “He told me that we had won the competition, subject to our proof of low radar cross-section between that period and 1 January 1960.” A scale model of an A-12, mounted upside down at Area 51 for tests of its radar cross-section circa 1959., CIA Bissell was the CIA’s Special Assistant for Planning and Coordination and was in charge of the Oxcart program. He had threatened to cancel the entire project if the competing companies couldn’t make significant progress in reducing the radar cross-sections of their designs. Ed Lovick, another Skunk Works engineer, who Johnson credits with coming up with the cesium fuel additive idea, says that development saved the A-12 in his own book, Radar Man : A Personal History of Stealth . The A-12’s engine nacelles and ducts also had chines on the outer edges and chined leading edges of the wings with saw-tooth-shaped baffles underneath the surface to further reduce the aircraft’s radar returns. Curved wing extensions on the leading edges and canted rear vertical stabilizers, as well as spiked cones covering the inlets for the two huge Pratt and Whitney J58 engines, also helped deflect incoming radar waves. A diagram showing some of the A-12’s “anti-radar” features., CIA Lockheed made good use of radar-absorbing composite materials in all of these areas, except for the spikes over the engine inlets. Literally on top of all of that was a layer of “iron paint,” also referred to as “iron ball paint” because of the small iron balls mixed in, which also helped reduce the aircraft’s radar signature. That paint’s special blend, which Lockheed also used on the later SR-71, reportedly cost $400 per quart in the 1960s. A description of radar cross-section reducing efforts Lockheed and the CIA had undertaken, including fuel additives and electron guns, according to Lockheed’s own 1968 internal history of the A-12., Lockheed In spite of all of this, the CIA’s fears about the potential vulnerability of manned reconnaissance aircraft persisted. The infamous Soviet shootdown of Gary Powers’ U-2 on May 1, 1960, further fuel those concerns and ended spy plane flights over that country. The introduction of new Soviet radars, particularly the P-14 Tall King , was also a major driving factor. The CIA, together with other U.S. Intelligence agencies and elements of the U.S. military, expended considerable effort in the 1950s and in the early 1960s, as the A-12 was still in development, gathering details about these radars through programs codenamed Melody and Palladium . Palladium involved a particularly complicated set of ruses to produce false radar returns and then observe the response from examples of these radars positioned in Cuba, allowing analysts to try to work out what radar operators were and weren’t seeing on their screens, and thus how the A-12’s own radar cross-section would fare against those sensors. “In April 1963 we were directed to rebuild the aircraft chines to change the optimum radar cross-section at S-band to favor better performance against the ‘Tall King,'” Johnson wrote in his 1968 history. “This was an expensive and (as it finally turned out to be) undesirable change.” A P-14 Tall King radar., ShinePhantom via Wikimedia Work on the cesium fuel additive, eventually known as A-50 , offered one possible method of reducing the radar cross-section of the rear aspect of the aircraft. This was already a problematic area in the radar-evading work because of the jet’s massive exhausts and the radar reflective plume from the J58s at full afterburner while flying at above Mach 3. At its most basic, the general concept of plasma stealth involves using some means to create a cloud of ionized particles, or plasma, which is capable of absorbs electromagnetic radiation, such as radar waves, so they can’t reflect back. Burning cesium in the super-heated exhaust stream would do just that at the back of the plane. The obvious problem was that the exhaust stream only pointed rearward. A-50 could not produce a similar ionized cloud toward the front aspect of the aircraft, which would be most exposed as the aircraft approached the target area at the beginning of its reconnaissance pass. This is also when the aircraft would be most vulnerable. One option the CIA considered, codenamed Emerald, was to install devices elsewhere in the aircraft that would create “a seeded plasma electric arc,” similar to the effect of adding cesium in the exhaust stream, but in other directions. Another idea, codenamed Kempster, was to install electron guns that would emit electrically-charged particles to produce a similar effect. A section of a 1963 status report on the Oxcart program mentioning both the Emerald and Kempster programs., CIA Westinghouse Research Laboratories, a division of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and General Electric subsequently got contracts to develop these electron guns. Westinghouse eventually took the lead in the Kempster program. The Kempster program sought devices that would be small enough to fit inside the chines on either side of the A-12 near the wing fairings, where they could help conceal the radar reflections from the engine inlet spikes. The goal was to have the electron guns project cones of radar-absorbing particles that would extend out approximately 300 inches, or 25 feet, from the chine, according to one 1964 report. Details about the proposed Kempster installation concept as of 1964., CIA Electron gun technology was already well established at the time and it was, and still is, used in an array of different commercial products, including televisions and monitors that use cathode ray tubes , and manufacturing processes . A typical electron gun design uses a hot cathode at one end of a container to create a stream of electrons that then pass by electrodes and anodes that focus them into a beam and accelerates them, respectively. The generation of the electron beam takes place in a vacuum region, which then creates the challenge of how to get it out into the ambient environment. One established method involves simply placing a medium, typically a sheet of some kind of metal foil, also known as a “window,” at one end that the electrons can pass through. A-12 ripping down the runway at Groom lake. , Public Domain Westinghouse used this method to create what it referred to as windowed and window tube designs. The problem with this method is that the metal strips energy from the beam as it passes through, potentially reducing its power, and cannot be too thick or it will block the beam entirely. Unfortunately, keeping the metal barrier sufficiently thin makes it fragile. This might not necessarily be a major problem in an industrial or similar setting, where workers might be more readily able to replace the window quickly. A system intended to work reliably on an aircraft flying more than three times the speed of sound is a completely different matter. The focus ultimately shifted from these windowed designs to another method that allows the beam to leave the gun through an open orifice at one end and uses vacuum pumps to remove gases, such as ambient air, from the internal sections. This type of pumped system is notably heavier and bulkier than a windowed design. Beyond the electron gun itself, the complete system also needs a substantial power source and cooling systems to prevent dangerous overheating. A very basic diagram showing the basic elements of a pumped electron gun, at left, and a windowed one, at right. The arrows how the path of the electron beam., University of South Carolina Getting a pumped device to work within the weight and space constraints of the chines, an area of the aircraft that would also experience serious physical strains and high temperatures when the aircraft was flying at Mach 3, presented challenges for Westinghouse. The company initially bought an industrial example straight from W. C. Heraeus in Hanau, West Germany and modified it for the Kempster program. This system worked well enough, but was far too big to fit inside the A-12’s chines. Flight testing of the Heraeus gun on one of the aircraft, known as Article 126, required its installation in the aircraft’s main payload bay, or Q bay, with the beam pointing straight down. Had this configuration become operational, it would have limited the space inside the bay for cameras or other equipment. A low-quality scan of the modified Heraeus gun configured to fit inside the A-12’s Q-bay., Westinghouse “In conclusion, the undersigned believes that, even if [redacted] is successful in [the] operation of its KEMPSTER A, there is little chance that it will ever be used operationally, because of the great weight, 250 lbs or more, per gun and potentially high-power requirements,” according to a 1963 CIA progress note on the program. The CIA also redacted the name of the author of that brief report. It is not entirely clear from the available CIA sources what systems were developed as part of the Kempster A phase and how they differ from those pursued as part of a second line of effort known as Kempster B. Portions of a 1963 CIA progress report on the Kempster program., CIA Regardless, after working with designs based on the Heraeus gun, Westinghouse subsequently developed its own compact pumped “C-Gun” design, which did fit -inside the chines. A basic control panel was installed in the cockpit to allow the pilot to turn the system on or off, or to set it to a cool down mode, as well as select whether to project the beams from the right, the left, or both electron guns. A diagram showing Westinghouse’s C-Gun electron gun design., Westinghouse Westinghouse At least two flight tests took place in 1964, with an A-12 known as Article 131 carrying the electron guns, according to CIA reports. “The KEMPSTER equipment shutters opened but power failure occurred,” according to a cable about a test flight on Dec. 11, 1964. The system worked as intended during another test flight six days later, according to another cable, but all further details are redacted. Westinghouse built at least four prototype C-Guns, enough to equip two aircraft at any one time, but there is no indication that these were ever employed operationally. A now-declassified internal CIA history of the U-2 and A-12 programs says “this project proved unsuccessful,” but offers no further details. One issue may have been that the electron guns produced x-ray radiation as a byproduct of their operation, both in flight and during pre-flight checkouts on the ground. With regards to the Heraeus gun, there were concerns that this could impact the film in the cameras in the Q-bay. This was, of course, a less pressing concern with regards to the chine-mounted C-guns, but there was still the matter of potentially dangerous x-ray exposure, especially to ground personnel during pre-flight checkouts. “Means were employed to assure safe conditions for all personnel concerned,” according to a 1965 Westinghouse report. As of October 1965, Westinghouse and General Electric were both still receiving funding from the CIA and National Reconnaissance Office for work on both Kempster A and Kempster B. The work on Kempster B was described at the time as a “theoretical study.” A discussion about Kempster funding in 1965., CIA The CIA’s U-2 and A-12 history, which the Agency first published in 1992, blames the U.S. Air Force’s unwillingness to share electronic countermeasures technology with the Oxcart program as the reason for developing Kempster in the first place. The Air Force feared that A-12 operations would give the Soviets too much opportunity to analyze the countermeasures, according to the CIA. The CIA did ultimately develop an electronic warfare package for the A-12 and that may well have sealed the fate of efforts to develop improved electron guns under Kempster B. It certainly appears to have offered sufficient protection, combined with the aircraft’s speed and high altitude flight profile, that the Agency also does not appear to have ever employed the A-50 cesium fuel additive operationally, either. The CIA did not even use A-50 during missions over North Vietnam in the 1960s where the threat of hostile fire was very real. On Oct. 30, 1967, CIA pilot Dennis Sullivan flew an A-12 on a mission over that country during which North Vietnamese air defenders fired at least six SA-2 Guideline surface to air missiles at his aircraft. Sullivan saw at least three of them detonate near him and contrails from the launches were also present in some of the pictures taken during the mission, according to an official CIA account of the sortie. The missiles came close enough to leave fragment lodged in the Oxcart’s fuselage. The CIA retired the A-12s in 1968. There’s no evidence that the Air Force made any use of the work the CIA did under the Kempster program to help protect its SR-71s, which had begun flying missions in 1966, either. Those aircraft also utilized an advanced electronic warfare countermeasures suite, in addition to a stealthy shape and radar-absorbing features developed from those on the A-12, as their primary means of protecting themselves from enemy air defenses. A contemporary comparison of the electronic countermeasures systems on the A-12 and the SR-71 from the mid-1960s. The A-12’s capabilities in this regard are entirely redacted. , CIA The basic concept of plasma stealth and using other particles to create radar wave-absorbing fields is said to have continued in both the United States in the Soviet Union for years after the Kempster program came to an end and the CIA retired the A-12s for good. As with the electron guns for the Oxcarts, information on most of these projects is limited. Most recently, the topic of plasma stealth did resurface in unconfirmed reports that the Russian 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile might use this principle , or something similar, to help conceal it from hostile radars. Without knowing the exact reason why the CIA deemed Kempster to be a failure, it’s hard to say whether or not electron guns could ever provide sufficiently useful radar-evading capabilities to outweigh their complexities compared to other stealth and electronic warfare technologies. Regardless, the project is definitely another interesting and little known piece of the A-12’s history, which ties directly into the story of the SR-71, much of which is still unknown .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 24, 2019",New Report On The Navy’s Troubled Ford Class Aircraft Carrier Is Literally The Shits,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As if the U.S. Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , hasn’t had enough troubles , a new report has revealed the toilets, and the sewage system that they feed into, are clogging on an “unexpected and frequent” basis. As a result and due to the overall system’s design, maintenance personnel now have to routinely flush the entire thing with an acid wash, a process that costs the service $400,000 each time. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, included these details in a report it published on Mar. 24, 2020. Bloomberg was first to report that GAO’s analysts had uncovered the toilet issue when exploring whether Navy shipbuilding programs take sufficient steps to head off issues that could lead to higher-than-expected sustainment costs for ships and submarines in the long run. The review examined six different classes of ships, including the Ford class. In total, the review found 150 problems that impacted all of the ships in a particular class, which had led the service to underestimate “sustainment costs by $130 billion.” The report added that it would take “$4.2 billion to correct just the 30 percent of these problems for which the Navy had data on estimated repair costs.” GAO only identified a few of the specific issues, including the toilet and sewage system problem on the Ford , which is apparently also set to be present on the next ship in the class, the future USS John F. Kennedy , also known by its hull number CVN-79. The repeated clogging stems from a decision to use an all-new system “similar to what is on a commercial aircraft, but increased in scale for a crew of over 4,000 people,” according to the report. The review indicates that the Navy has no plans to replace the toilets or sewage system on either of these carriers. It is unclear if there are any plans to do so on the third and fourth Ford class ships, the future USS Enterprise and USS Doris Miller , respectively. Toilets are certainly not something these carriers, which are basically floating cities that sail for months at a time, can do without. “The Navy has yet to determine how often and for how many ships [of the Ford class] this action will need to be repeated, making the full cost impact difficult to quantify,” GAO noted. “We generally did not include these types of ongoing costs in our calculation.” This is, of course, not the only time the U.S. military has spent an exorbitant amount on toilet-related issues. In 2018, the U.S. Air Force admitted to buying covers for the toilets on its huge C-5M Galaxy airlifters at a cost of $10,000 apiece . It now 3D prints them at a fraction of the cost. Back in the 1980s, there had been another infamous scandal involving revelations that the Pentagon had been overpaying for basic items , including spending $640 on individual toilet seats and paying $37 for single screws. A cover for a toilet on the C-5M Galaxy. Each one of these cost the US Air Force $10,000., USAF The GAO report also highlighted problems with stores elevators on the Ford , which will also presumably be present at least on the CVN-79, which is in the latter stages of construction now. These elevators, which sailors use to move provisions between decks, are too small to accommodate a pallet jack or forklift. “Thus, provisions cannot be loaded or unloaded with a pallet jack or a forklift and must be manually unpacked and stacked by hand on to the elevator. Unloading is further complicated, according to the ship’s crew, because the elevator doors are so small that the average sailor cannot stand up as they enter and exit the elevator,” GAO explained. “The fleet has mitigated a few of these problems, but a redesign of the elevator would be necessary to fit standard pallets and fully resolve the other problems.” Elevators seem to be a particular problem for Ford , which also has major outstanding issues with its Advanced Weapon Elevators, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Sailors use these to move weapons and other aircraft stores to and from the flight deck. Navy personnel gather around the deck hatch for one of Ford ‘s Advanced Weapon Elevators., USN Though the Navy officially took delivery of Ford in 2017 , the carrier has been beset by various problems, including with its new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), as well as with its propulsion system and radar. The ship is only expected to conduct its first operational cruise in 2024, six years behind schedule. The carrier only completed certification to support carrier qualifications this week and looks set to operate as a non-deployable training ship for at least the immediate future. The Navy has sought to spin this in a positive light by saying that it will be “the only carrier qualification asset regularly available on the East Coast.” This, of course, ignores that the reason for this has been a worrying combination of maintenance issues and operational demands on existing Nimitz class carriers, which includes the recent decision to station two of them in the Middle East at once due to a recent spike in tensions with Iran. After all this, the Navy is now set to conduct a study that could result in an end to the Ford class after just four ships and might lead to the purchase of smaller carriers . Hopefully, whatever design or designs come next, they’ll have a toilet system that doesn’t regularly threaten to literally shit all over its crew.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 6, 2020",Here Is What The Pentagon Is Not Answering About The Air Force And Recent UFO Encounters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the biggest questions regarding the U.S. Navy’s recent disclosures regarding strange encounters with supposedly unidentified flying craft is why are we only hearing about this highly concerning phenomenon from just one service? A fact that isn’t commonly understood is that it is not the Navy’s job to maintain sovereignty over America’s airspace, it is the U.S. Air Force’s. If strange and unidentified craft are being detected or seen, the Air Force has the mission to respond and investigate, not the Navy, and it can do so at a moment’s notice. So far, the Air Force has been totally mum on this issue, which is extremely bizarre considering the Navy’s own messaging surrounding it. With this in mind, last September, I reached out to the Air Force with a series of very pointed questions regarding what seems like a massive discrepancy in regards to the military branch’s ability to execute its homeland air defense mission. What seemed like a good start to finding answers to these key questions quickly turned into something of a nightmare that has made me lose all confidence in the Defense Department’s ability to address a subject, which they themselves have actively helped elevate within the public’s consciousness, in any meaningful manner. My initial inquiry to the Air Force resulted in a very positive experience. The folks at the Air Force headquarters’ press desk were not phased at all by the topic and seemed eager to look into it on our behalf. After discussing the issue with them directly on the phone, the questions I sent them were specifically written to move the ball forward on this critical aspect of the issue and, in doing so, getting the Air Force on the record about the issue overall in some manner. Ideally, this would have included some background as to the nature of these events from the service’s point of view, and especially in regards to its homeland air sovereignty mission, as well as information about whether its own aircrews were experiencing similar encounters. Here are the questions I fielded to them on September 19th, 2019: Here is what we are looking for on the ongoing UFO/UAP story with the Navy and the USAF’s position and comment on the issue: Have Air Force pilots encountered any similar unexplained phenomenon on radar, electro-optically, or visually? If so, what is the general frequency and magnitude of these events? Navy Super Hornet pilots out of NAS Oceana had constant encounters with these objects in 2014-2015, especially on radar. It got so bad that by early 2015 Oceana filed NOTAMs warning aviators about the phenomenon in the warning areas off Virginia. We have talked to the crews directly about this and are in the process of obtaining those NOTAMs and the paper trail leading to their posting. Langley’s F-22s, which have superior sensor capabilities in some respects to the Super Hornets, as well the base’s T-38 aggressors, are based right next-door and use the exact same warning areas for training daily. Did Langley aircrews experience the same phenomenon? If so, to what extent? What about other USAF assets that use the same airspace for training? The Navy changed its reporting practices and procedures for encounters with unexplained flying objects significantly due to the massive increase in incidents in recent years. Has the Air Force done the same? If not, why? Does it even have set procedures for these events? If so, what are they? Has the USAF experienced the same massive increase in incursions of UAPs over its bases and installations that the USN has? Does the Air Force have similar electro-optical and infrared video of UAPs similar to what the Navy has, or other data for that matter? Does the Air Force see this phenomenon as a national security threat? What is it doing to mitigate or better understand it? Thanks so much for your help on this. I think it’s critical to clear these details up, especially now that the Navy has admitted that the videos depicting these unexplained craft are indeed real and show objects it cannot identify. I quickly followed up with another question: The Navy is saying these things are constantly (as in many times a month or more) busting into controlled or even secured airspace. In 2015, they were out there for days off Virginia in the warning areas, even causing the base to post the NOTAMs due to near misses etc. The USAF is tasked with protecting this airspace. Has the USAF launched alerts and investigated these when the Navy (or maybe even the USAF) was calling them out? What was done in regards to homeland defense when these were in the warning areas so persistently? How did the USAF and its NORAD arm take this issue up during the 2014-2015 incidents and what does the Navy says has occurred constantly all over up through this very day? Once again, I have to stress that the Air Force has the homeland air sovereignty mission. Fighter aircraft sit on alert across the United States ready to scramble within a matter of minutes to intercept and investigate any unknown craft flying in or near the nation’s airspace. This includes what some may traditionally call UFOs. The War Zone has incredibly in-depth evidence of how such an action is taken with regards to the presence of transient unidentified flying objects, let alone ones that are persistently operating in restricted airspace, as was supposedly the case off the east coast of the United States in 2014 and 2015. Air Force units that fulfill the homeland air defense mission are spread across the country, but those equipped with the highest level of fighter aircraft capability are scattered around the continental United States’ maritime perimeter and are also based in Alaska and Hawaii. F-15C/Ds equipped with the most powerful fighter-optimized active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars in the world and carrying Sniper targeting pods for long-range visual target identification primarily fulfill the maritime border defense role in the lower 48 states, with F-22s in Hawaii and Alaska doing the same. F-16C/Ds, which are also now equipped with AESA radars , based at Andrews Air Force Base just outside of Washington D.C., keep watch over the Capital Region . Other F-16s from a handful of Air Force units that patrol the central U.S. can also help augment the country’s perimeter aerial security, but the alert mission is one that must be specifically trained for, with unique protocols and infrastructure requirements. It is resource-intensive and not cheap to execute, either. In other words, it is not something just any fighter squadron, especially a Navy one that has a very different mission focus, can just execute on the fly under normal circumstances. As such, my questions attempted to fill in a missing part of the Navy’s recent UFO-related accounts. If these flying craft were indeed being detected, how is it possible that the Air Force didn’t scramble to investigate them, and do so multiple times over the course of these events? If incursions over installations are ongoing, regardless of if they are drones or something far more fantastical, how isn’t the Air Force directly involved with investigating and mitigating these potential threats inside the airspace they are responsible for defending? This is not just a UFO issue, it comes down to America’s ability, or willingness, to defend its airspace from non-traditional threats. The threat to the homeland posed by cruise missiles is already palpable , but we are now in an era where lower-end and swarming drone warfare is becoming one of the most preeminent security issues of our time. It’s a threat that has recently manifested itself in spectacular ways that some of us have warned would occur for years . So, my questions are just as relevant to the core of our national security as they are to simply finding out new details about mysterious flying objects that seem to have risen to new heights in the public’s consciousness in recent years. After a promising start with the Air Force itself, I was told that the inquiries had been forwarded to the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s (OSD) public affairs arm. One public affairs officer, Susan Gough, would be handling the request. At first, this sounded very promising. The inquiry had been elevated to someone in a position that might be able to really add some unique context to the issue. Sadly, this ended up being anything but the case. Simply put, my experience with Susan Gough has been the worst I have had with any of the Defense Department’s public affairs personnel, ever. What has transpired, or more accurately what hasn’t transpired, over the last six months leaves me with no confidence or trust in this official representing the DoD on the issue. This is not personal in any way. She may be a wonderful person, but her behavior has been a clear example of everything the Pentagon’s media operations should not be and it certainly is not due to a lack of training or experience. Her resume is impressive and may even be concerning to some who are seeking some morsel of truth regarding this bizarre and historically tortured issue. My experience is not unique in any way. Others who are working this story have had similar experiences almost to a laughable degree. The reason why so many journalists are interacting with her at all on this issue is that she now holds the entire media/public affairs portfolio on UFOs within the DoD. Sometime shortly before I submitted my questions, the decision was made to funnel every request regarding this issue to her and her alone. The services no longer had control of their own messaging on the matter. Why this decision was made has not been made clear. I wrote and called Susan Gough for months after my initial inquiries were forwarded to her. No correspondence was answered and no comments were given—not a timeline for delivery or a simple “we cannot comment at this time” response to any of my inquiries. Nothing. In the meantime, prolific Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) filer and author John Greenwald over at the Blackvault.com had received a FOIA request that not only had my questions in it, but it also had the internal correspondence within the Air Force concerning answering at least a portion of my inquiries. John was nice enough to let me know he had received the documents and that he would work with me as to their release. Once again, the whole idea was to get something, anything on record in regards to the Air Force, America’s air sovereignty, and this issue. The last thing I wanted to do was publish a story about how the Defense Department won’t even acknowledge these questions. I have had absolutely the best experiences with DoD public affairs over many years. We work with them daily in what we do. The vast majority of those interactions are hugely productive. In fact, I have never had a negative relationship with a U.S. military public affairs officer, even on topics that were far from positive for the Department of Defense. Overall, they do excellent work and understand our requests and process them with total professionalism in a timely manner. I cannot overstate how important their job is and how well they usually do it. With this in mind, I dreaded having to take issue with the Department of Defense on their communications operations. But after nearly three months of getting no replies of any kind, I had to do something. It wasn’t until I sent a very frank letter on December 5th, 2019 that I received this answer from Ms. Gough. This was the first actual correspondence I had with her since my inquiry was made in September: Hello Tyler, My sincere apologies. It appears that your emails were being dumped into a junk/spam folder instead of my inbox, so I wasn’t seeing anything from you for a long time. Only just noticed because you are not the only one with a similar complaint. It was not intentional, I assure you, and I’m not quite sure how/why it happened; I get quite a few continuing queries about UAPs from multiple reporters, all with similar questions, so I know it’s not the subject. I’m sorry, I don’t recall getting a voicemail from you, but I was out of the office for health reasons several times in the last several months, and may have missed it. Anyway, I will look at your questions this morning, and will get back to you as soon as I can with answers. Regards, Sue I replied very positively, I was so glad we had a breakthrough and I wouldn’t have to write about how unresponsive the Department Of Defense’s representative on this matter was. Even if they weren’t willing to say much, we would actually have that on the record and I made Ms. Gough aware of the internal documents that had some answers to my questions that John Greenwald obtained. So, at least I could get some commentary on those, if nothing else. Above all else, a relationship could begin with the sole point of contact on this topic within the DoD. It’s a long game. I was happy to finally be working with Ms. Gough so that future clarifications could be had. I followed up quickly after her response asking if we could have this wrapped by the end of next week. Her reply stated as such: “Yes, we should be able to. Thank you very, very much for your patience and understanding!” Finally, I could slap a deadline on this and give John the heads up that there was progress. The reality ended up being the complete opposite. Ms. Gough never got back to me. What followed over the next four weeks was me reaching out looking for an update and getting nothing back. This was different though as her original excuses were clearly false because she just went back to doing the same thing even after her apology and acknowledgment of a timeline. By January 2nd, 2020, yet another month had gone by and it was clear that she had gone dark once again. This was my email to her: It’s the New Year and still nothing . I haven’t heard anything since we last touched base nearly a month ago when you said we could wrap it up the following week. Checked in multiple times. Nothing. I am holding off another outlet on this with their FOIAs that include the DoD’s correspondences with my name all over them, at this point, it is just embarrassing for me. I also find it odd that other outlets seem to have gotten responses and clarification follow-ups. In fact, some of them are people, not outlets. I really want a good relationship here, as I have with every single one of my DoD PA contacts, rain or shine. I hate writing emails like this, but this is ridiculous and insulting. It has been what? FOUR months? So what’s the next step? Do I have to file a formal complaint over this? Something is really broken here, especially when you have your own aviators claiming that craft are violating our airspace regularly and I can’t even get responses to specific questions, some of which were answered months ago in internal correspondences that the department released via FOIA long before I ever got them. In fact, I still don’t have them. Very disappointing and frankly, stunning. Tyler Rogoway No response. On January 7th, I sent another note, stating that I have done everything I can, given her every opportunity to respond, and that months had rolled by since my initial request and it was now weeks past our deadline. Finally, I got another response: Sorry Tyler, I’ve been out a lot, and just back today. Let me ping the people who owe me the info and see if they have it now. Clearly, she had something to share, as I had the Air Force’s internal emails in my hands for months via John Greenwald’s FOIA request. After that last glimmer of hope, the gaslighting operation was made clear. Once again, Susan Gough disappeared. By this time I was so exhausted with the issue and a ton of other long-lead projects had come due, so I set it aside. Really, I didn’t want to have to explain how terrible of an experience this was and how this DoD official evaded me for months. I thought, ‘maybe if I just gave it a little more time she would pop up again.’ That never happened. At the time of writing this, it has been six months since my original request. I can’t thank John enough for being so patient with me on this story. He understood my important working relationship with the DoD and how I wanted to give Ms. Gough every possible opportunity for a professional and positive outcome. I have no idea what the situation is behind the scenes with this topic at the DoD or what Gough’s directives or issues are in regard to it. Yet the fact that after the Pentagon’s own personnel have stated that constant intrusions into sensitive airspace have occurred by unidentified craft, they are not willing to even respond to questions about Air Force’s role in those events, the service that is responsible for defending that airspace, is damning. The DoD seems to have helped seed interest in this issue, but is now unwilling to offer any explanations or clarifications regarding it. That seems very peculiar if not downright suspicious. For a topic that has been so abused over the decades, this really is an abhorrent stance for the DoD to take and it negates any trust it may have developed on the topic in recent years. The most troubling part about this whole mess is that at least some of my inquiries actually got answers, ones the DoD shared with a FOIA requester, but not the actual reporter asking the questions. Once again, Gough had at least something to offer, but didn’t convey it after months of prodding. Greenwald’s FOIAs show that the Air Force’s public affairs officials actually did excellent work looking into at least some of my questions. They did not shy away from the topic and took it seriously, but with one unresponsive person having the authority to actually convey any of that information, it meant that in this case the results of their work were never released. Here’s what the Air Force found out in regards to Langely Air Force Base’s F-22 and T-38 aircrews seeing similar objects in the restricted warning areas off the eastern seaboard. You can see the whole exchange below: Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com It would seem by these emails that the F-22 and T-38 pilots from Langley were not having the same encounters as the Hornet pilots from nearby NAS Oceana. If this is indeed the case, it really puts the Navy encounters in a different light and it does match anecdotally with what we have gleaned through our own background investigation. So, if the Air Force tactical jet pilots were oblivious to the craft flying off the east coast, why? Certainly, technology isn’t an issue. Like the Super Hornet, the F-22 is also equipped with an AESA radar and, in some ways, it has far more capable sensors than the Super Hornet and possesses significantly higher performance. The Navy pilots’ UFO encounter stories have also matured a bit as time has gone by and explanations do exist that could explain their encounters off the East Coast that are far from out of this world , but this discrepancy really sets up a new set of circumstances that are even more puzzling than before. In addition, another short email string appears to shows that the Air Force has not followed the Navy’s move to change its policy surrounding how its personnel report encounters with unidentified aircraft and that the incidents that have occurred actually had to do with drones, not something more exotic. Theblackvault.com Theblackvault.com You can check out these documents for yourself over at The Black Vault. Once again, the disconnect between the Navy and the Air Force’s stance on this issue is puzzlingly stark, which is highly intriguing. We may take a deeper dive into some of these issues at another time, but for now, at least we have some record, albeit obtained indirectly, of the Air Force even looking into these recent encounters directly and even on a unit level. The question then becomes why weren’t we informed about the inquiry’s findings? Moreso, what about my other questions? Where did they end up? Could answers have been fielded to those questions, as well? Sadly we just don’t know. In fact, we don’t even have a ‘no comment at this time’ regarding this issue from the Pentagon’s spokesperson handling it. In the end, it is in the public’s interest to know how the media is being treated by the Department Of Defense on this issue after they themselves helped perpetuate it. Calling the situation disappointing and bizarre would be a huge understatement.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For many, aviation isn’t a hobby or a job, it’s a religion of sorts. There are so many aspects to the aviation community and it is filled with all types of people from all walks of life. A common fascination with flight unites them all. It’s really an incredible thing that can be hard to fully understand for those that have never been bitten by the aviation bug. Pilots are their own community within a community. Some fly gliders, some fly helicopters, some fly 747s, some fly light planes, and some fly high-performance fighters. Over the years, what I have found is that even those on the top of the aircraft performance heap have a huge interest, if not something of their own form of fasciation, with far more lowly aircraft, ones that can cost one-two hundredth the price to operate per hour as a pointy-nosed combat jet. It isn’t all that hard to understand why someone tasked with ripping through the skies in a $70,000,000 piece of exquisite weaponry would be interested in trolling around at a fraction of the speed in a well-used light plane that cost $25,000. It is a simpler and, in some ways, a freer variation of human flight that offers its own unique advantages, albeit with a bit less thrill. Jumping into a light plane to go grab a ‘$100 cheeseburger’ is far less intensive and much more relaxing than taking a flying national security asset out a mission. So, many fighter pilots seem just as interested in someone’s light plane as the opposite. It’s a unique and quirky little reality I have seen time and time again. This camaraderie and mutual interest and appreciation for all planes is beautifully exemplified in the video below. In it, a private pilot and YouTuber flying a 1972 Grumman AA-5 Traveler gets called out by air traffic control before landing to a pair of Marine F/A-18 Hornets from VMFA-112 “Cowboys” waiting to take off on a parallel runway. The tower refers jovially to the incoming light plane as a “tiny little Grumman.” The Grumman continues on final approach for a touch and go and the Hornets soon come into view taking position on the parallel runway prior to takeoff. One of the Hornet pilots responds “good looking tiny little Grumman though, I tell you what.” The Grumman pilot replies back “your’s is good lookin’ too, thank you very much!” The Traveler pilot then states to his onboard cameras “ok, we’re going to race some F/A-18s” just before he heads back into the air after his touch and go. As the Grumman climbs out, the Hornets blast by with their wings rocking. The pilot, watching the fighters giving him a salute as they haul past, states “that is so awesome.” Check out this great little moment for yourself: This is what aviation is all about. It was a little passing moment in time, but one that shows the unique bond that exists among all aviators and the appreciation pilots have for all of man’s flying creations. A big hat tip to Chad Colgan for sending this little gem over.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 29, 2021","Marines To Radically Remodel Force, Cutting Tanks, Howitzers In Favor Of Drones, Missiles","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has an ambitious 10-year transformation plan that could see the service eliminate its entire tank force , dramatically scale back howitzer batteries , and cut a significant number of aviation units in favor of land-based rocket artillery and stand-off missile launchers and unmanned aircraft . The proposal follows an already dramatic announcement from the Corps’ top officer last year about the need to move away from reliance on large traditional amphibious warfare ships, something The War Zone explored in depth. All of this is rooted in the prevailing view that Marines will have to fight in small groups and in a distributed fashion in any major conflict in the future, especially in the Pacific region, in order to remain relevant. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on the Marines plans for the radical shift on Mar. 23, 2020. The newspaper interviewed Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger about his proposal, which would fundamentally change the face of his service for years to come. “China, in terms of military capability, is the pacing threat,” Berger told the Journal . “If we did nothing, we would be passed.” “I have come to the conclusion that we need to contract the size of the Marine Corps to get quality,” he added. “The wargames do show that, absent significant change, the Marine Corps will not be in a position to be relevant” in a high-end conflict against a “peer competitor,” U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Eric Smith, head of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, also explained to the Journal . Berger had been head of this command, which is responsible for developing new and improved concepts of operations for the Corps, before becoming Commandant. Berger’s contraction is significant and wide-ranging. Over the next decade, he wants to shrink the entire size of the Corps from approximately 189,000 personnel to 170,000. To do this, he would get rid of a number of units, including all seven existing Marine tank companies, along with their M1 Abrams and support vehicles . Three bridging companies , necessary to get those heavy vehicles across waterways, would go get shuttered. Marine armored vehicles fleets would be limited to the service’s existing fleet of LAV-25 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles and its new Amphibious Combat Vehicles (ACV), another 8×8 wheeled design. The ACV will increasingly supplant the tracked Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAV) in the coming years. “We need an Army with lots of tanks,” Berger said. “We don’t need a Marine Corps with tanks.” The total number of 155mm howitzer batteries would also drop from 21 to just five. Three of the 24 infantry battalions are also set to get cut under the plan, though the Marines have talked about increasing the size of infantry squads, and by extension the remaining infantry units, at the same time. A Marine 155mm M777 howitzer in Norway during an exercise in March 2020., USMC The total number of Marine fighter attack squadrons , all of which are transitioning to variants of the F-35 , would remain at 18. However, the size of each of these squadrons will shrink from 16 aircraft to just 10, according to a separate report from USNI News . Three MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor squadrons, two light attack helicopter squadrons equipped with AH-1Z Vipers and UH-1Y Venoms , and three heavy helicopter squadrons are all set to get cut from the overall force structure. The latter of these units are equipped with CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters, which are set to get replaced by CH-53K King Stallions . Trimming those squadrons could impact the total number of CH-53Ks, which have had a long-troubled development , the Marines expect to buy in the end. Despite this contraction, Berger is planning to make additions, as well, including tripling the size of land-based rocket artillery and stand-off missile units from seven to 21. This would include M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems ( HIMARS ) launchers that the Marines want to be able to fire Naval Strike Missile anti-ship missiles in the future, in addition to 227mm guided artillery rockets and short-range quasi-ballistic missiles . The Corps is also planning to introduce land-based launchers able to fire the Tomahawk cruise missile . The Marines’ unmanned aircraft force would also double in size, from three to six squadrons. The service is very much in the process of defining exactly how it envisions the composition of these drone fleets. In its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, submitted as part of the larger U.S. Navy proposal, the Corps’ revealed that it was reassessing its Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary program, or MUX , as well as scaling back plans to acquire MQ-9 Reapers in the interim. The present plan includes exploring a “ system of systems ” that could including various smaller drones, as well as larger, land-based unmanned aircraft. The original MUX concept, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , had envisioned large Marine unmanned aircraft capable of performing various complex roles and intended to operate from large amphibious warships. The Marines would also add another squadron of KC-130J Hercules aerial refueling tankers, which can also serve as airlifters and gunships . These massive force structure changes are driven in part by budgetary concerns, as well as a new, over-arching operating concept the Marines have been experimenting with, on paper and during exercises , called Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO), for some years now. EABO is heavily center on an idea of an island-hopping blitzkrieg of sorts during a major conflict in the Pacific region where ground units could easily find themselves distributed across a front thousands of miles long separated by large expanses of water. An official Marine graphic from 2016 showing an early vision of what the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations concept might look like in practice., USMC Unlike the other U.S. military services, even the U.S. Army , the Marines do not expect to have the capacity to conduct large-scale stand-off operations and plan to fight almost exclusively inside “the weapons engagement zone” of a potential opponent, such as China, according to the Journal . China, in particular, has invested significant resources in the development and fielding of anti-access and area denial capabilities, including air, sea, and ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles , as well as medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, including air-launched ones , some of which carry hypersonic boost-glide vehicles or that may have anti-ship capabilities . Longer-range surface-to-air missiles and supporting sensors are also part of the picture. All of this forces large traditional amphibious warfare ships to operate further and further from actual objectives, limiting the ability of the Marine Corps in its present configuration to contribute in the minds of Berger and other senior service officials. Under the EABO concept, smaller elements of Marines would use air assaults and smaller ships , including unmanned surface vessels , to seize control of small islands and rapidly set up forward operating bases. Unmanned platforms, including drones, unmanned ships, and unmanned ground vehicles , including remotely-operated mobile artillery systems, would be important to giving these Marine units additional capabilities without the need for significant amounts of additional manpower. Missile units, especially with anti-ship missiles, would then be able to conduct strikes on hostile ships from this constellation of island outposts. Depending on the facilities available or that could be readily made available, they might also support forward manned or unmanned aviation operations . Targeting data from forward-deployed Marine units would also be passed back to other assets, including Navy ships and U.S. Air Force aircraft , which could then conduct their own stand-off attacks. To keep the enemy on edge and to prevent them from effectively counter-attacking, Marines would reposition from one outpost to another every 48 to 72 hours. Decoy movements, which could be physical or generated using electronic warfare systems , would further confuse the enemy. Constantly changing positions would also enable Marines to attack from different vectors , forcing an opponent to be constantly evaluating their own defenses and potentially spreading their forces thin to protect against all avenues of attack. “The Marine Corps will have three Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs) organized, trained, and equipped to accomplish sea denial and sea control within actively contested maritime spaces as part of a modernized III MEF [Marine Expeditionary Force],” U.S. Marine Corps Major Joshua Benson, a Marine Corps Combat Development Command spokesperson, separately told USNI News in a statement. “This Pacific posture will be augmented by three globally deployable Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) that possess both traditional and Expeditionary Advanced Base capabilities that can deploy with non-standard Amphibious Ready Groups .” In principle, the EABO concept certainly presents a number of potential benefits. There are also real questions about just how viable it would be in practice, especially from a logistical standpoint. In his interview with the Journal , General Berger highlighted how 3D printing in small field workshops could help manufacture on-demand replacement parts to support distributed operations. But you can’t 3D print fuel, water , ammunition, or food. Water is a resource that U.S. military units particularly take for granted and which is absolutely essential to any operation. The fuel demands for modern U.S. military units are also only increasing as more and more is required on a daily basis to power the generators that supply electricity for ground-based sensors, communications systems, living facilities, and more. There is work being done on alternate battlefield power concepts, including small nuclear reactors and hydrogen fuel cells , but these efforts are still in the very early stages of development. A look at how fuel distribution operations under the EABO concept might occur, including the use of unmanned surface vessels to tow floating “fuel pods” to intermediate distribution sites ., USMC The Marines have been looking at various distributed logistics concepts, including using unmanned ships and expendable supply drones , and even seaplanes , as ways to get critical supplies to forward units with limited risk. None of these proposals entirely eliminate supply chain disruption that could potentially have serious impacts on the ability of Marine units to operate under the EABO concept. A Marine Corps briefing slide from 2016 showing the potential capabilities seaplanes might offer to the EABO concept., USMC “Some of the capabilities we assume might pan out, will not pan out, and other technological things will come along that we have not even considered,” Berger told the Journal. He described his plan “as an aim point” and that the Corps would “monitor the threat all along as we go.” It certainly remains to be seen how much of the Commandant’s ambitious proposal comes to fruition. However, it is clear that the Marine Corps’ present senior leadership sees radical changes as essential to ensure that the force continues to be useful in future major wars, especially in the Pacific region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The M1150 ‘Shredder’ Assault Breacher Vehicle is one nasty looking weapon system. Designers leveraged the M1 Abrams main battle tank’s design and adapted it into one of the world’s most capable combat mine clearing vehicles. It is bristling with attachments and specialized gear required for its unique mission, making it look downright evil in its own right. This is especially true when seen wading into the surf during a beach landing. You can read all about the Shredder in this past piece of mine , but suffice it to say that between its plows, explosive line charges, and other modifications, the meaning of its whole existence is to get Marines from point A to point B without being devastated by mines. With that in mind, you can imagine how important the Shredder is to Marines trying to take an enemy beach and establish a beachhead. Getting the vehicle, which weighs more than 60 tons , from ship to shore is done by the Navy’s heaviest amphibious haulers, the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) and the Landing Craft Utility (LCU).

Practicing for just such a beach landing and, in particular, the command and control complexities surrounding them, is what is being seen in the photos, which were taken at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, as part of a recurring exercise dubbed Type Commander Amphibious Training (TCAT). Although the USMC is slowly pivoting away from focusing so heavily on large-scale beach landing operations, being able to push very heavy combat vehicles ashore from over-the-horizon remains a critical capability. Maybe the most important of which is getting Marines ashore the protection that the Shredder provides.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2020",Russia Uses These Crazy Antique Jet Engine-Equipped Trucks To Blast Away Chemical Agents,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection Troops, also known collectively by the acronym RKhB, are celebrating the 100th anniversary of their formation in 2018 and the country’s Ministry of Defense has recently released a video montage of these units in action to mark the occasion. Among the more unusual systems on display is a truck with a jet engine mounted in the back, called the TMS-65U, which crews can use to clean vehicles coated in chemical agents or create massive smokescreens to hide friendly movements on the battlefield. The RKhB traces its history to 1918 and the formation of chemical warfare units in what was then the fledgling Soviet Union. Today, these elements are focused largely on identifying nuclear, biological, and chemical hazards and decontaminating on friendly forces and impacted areas. They’re on hand to provide similar services after any terrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction or man-made or natural disasters involving similar threats. As is the case with chemical units in other modern militaries, including that those in the United States, they are responsible for the deployment of large smokescreens during major combat operations, as well. Historically, flamethrowers have also been the provenance of military chemical warfare elements and in Russia, the RKhB is still responsible for the TOS-1 self-propelled thermobaric artillery rocket system and the man-portable RPO-series of thermobaric rocket launchers. The Russians define both of these weapons as “flamethrowers,” despite them having virtually nothing in common with traditional weapons of that type. When it comes to washing down vehicles and personnel that might be covered in chemical agents, an issue you can read about in far more depth here , Russia has various options, including truck-mounted and individual spray systems that personnel can use to wipe away hazardous materials. They also have the Soviet-era TMS-65U . “TMS” in this case stands for “ teplovoi mashinii spetzialnoi ,” which literally translates as “special heat engine.” There’s probably no better way to describe the system, which consists of a Ural-375 6×6 4.5-ton truck with a modified Klimov VK-1 turbojet engine – first used in the MiG-15 fighter jet in 1947 – mounted inside a turret on the rear of the vehicle. The complete system feeds decontamination fluid into the exhaust to rapidly clean vehicles or structures. An operator in the turret can maneuver the jet engine left and right and up and down in order to best aim the blast at the intended object. A TMS-65U cleans another vehicle during a training exercise., Vitaly Kuzmin The entire process is far faster than personnel using hand-held hoses or brushes to scrub away potential chemical weapons. A common procedure involves setting up TMS-65Us along a path as a sort of impromptu battlefield car wash, quickly cleaning vehicles in turn as they pass through. It’s certainly a time-efficient system, but one has to wonder how much fuel is required to run the aging VK-1 for extended periods of time. The vehicle itself carries less than 240 gallons of jet fuel for the engine. The TMS-65U also has a secondary role as a smokescreen vehicle. Crews can fill the same tank that holds the decontamination solution with a smoke-creating liquid, such as fuel oil, instead. The hot exhaust gasses then turn this fluid into a thick white smoke that can obscure friendly forces, at least to the naked eye and certain visual sensors. Unless there are specialized additives, this would not be able to prevent hostile forces from observing those movements using infrared optics. A TMS-65U, at left, demonstrates its smokescreen capability as a Typhoon-U armored vehicle drives past., Vitaly Kuzmin But perhaps the most interesting thing about the vehicle is the continuing use of the VK-1. This jet engine is an absolutely antique design and is itself a derivative of the Rolls-Royce Nene, which first ran in 1944. In addition to the MiG-15, the Klimov engines also powered the MiG-17 fighter jet and the Il-28 light bomber . As the Soviet Union began to remove those aircraft from service, it found itself with a surplus of VK-1s and the production lines to continue making spare parts. The TMS-65s, and improved TMS-65Us, were just some of a slew of military and civilian vehicles , along with specialized railroad cars , that continued to employ the engine in non-traditional roles. Many of these other vehicles, such as ones that use their jet engines to rapidly clear snow from aircraft at airports or from railroad tracks, are or were still in operation until very recently – an impressive service life for an engine design more than seven decades old. The Russian military even has versions that use the VK-1’s exhaust to blast away potentially hazardous debris from airfields and the deck of its lone aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov . One of the VK-1 powered debris-clearing systems on board Kuznetsov in 2015., via @russiannavyblog Though uncommon, there are other examples of jets in use on the ground in novel roles around the world, including snow removal and fire-fighting . Few, though, recycle old engines to the degree the Soviets did with the TMS-65U and other vehicles. The Hungarians, however, did use the Klimov engine as a truck-mounted fire-fighting apparatus to choke off huge blazes, especially burning oil wells. Hungary also developed a larger system, called Big Wind , using modified World War II-era T-34 tank chassis equipped with a turret packing a pair of Tumansky turbojets taken from retired MiG-21 fighter jets . Both the VK-1-equipped trucks and the fire-fighting tanks went to Kuwait in 1991 to help put out oil field fires that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s forces had set as they fled the country in the face of a U.S.-led coalition. When it comes to the TMS-65U, there is no indication that Russia intends to replace these vehicles any time soon. They clearly have a firm role within the Russian military’s chemical warfare defense doctrine. But there may come a time when the Russians decide the VK-1s are finally too dated and inefficient to keep using in this and other ground-based roles.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Mar 17, 2020",America’s Air Traffic Control System Is Suffering Crippling Shutdowns Due To COVID-19,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the latest developments in regards to the effects the global pandemic known as COVID-19 is having on aviation was the shutting down of New York Center , referred to as ZNY. ZNY is an ARTCC (Air Route Traffic Control Center) and one of the most critical in the world. A ground stop order was issued for JFK, Laguardia, Philadelphia, Teterboro, Long Island Mcarthur, and Newark Liberty International Airports. It was subsequently lifted and air traffic has been rerouted. The closure was the result of a trainee at the center testing positive for COVID-19. This is only the latest of this week’s growing list of Air Traffic Control limitations and shutdowns. It’s unknown just how much more our country’s National Airway and Air Traffic Control Systems can take before a high-level shutdown becomes a potentiality or even necessary. Yesterday ZID, Indianapolis Center, which is another ARTCC, closed its eastern sectors after positive COVID-19 tests among its air traffic controllers. No air traffic services were provided above FL230, which is 23,000 feet. Traffic was subsequently routed around the area. A map showing the regions overseen by FAA’s Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC)., CFInotebook.net The first notable example of this type of event occurred on Tuesday of this week at Chicago Midway (KMDW)’s air traffic control tower. It went ‘ATC zero’ over three staff members testing positive for COVID-19. The facility was evacuated and the tower was closed. A recording advising pilots that Midway was evacuated and closed can be listened to here . Flights were diverted and ground stops were issued for flights headed to Midway or attempting to depart the airport. Eventually, the airport continued to function without prolonged ground stops as an uncontrolled airfield. Airline pilots reverted to announcing their intentions over a CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency) and managed their own landing, taxi, and takeoff deconflictions. In a bizarre turn of events, student pilots took advantage of the situation and began taking off and landing at MDW for fun. NBAA Email On Wednesday of this past week, the 18th of March, a similar situation unfolded at KLAS, McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Pilots also used a CTAF for communication after the tower closed for a COVID-19 related evacuation. You can listen to airliners departing and arriving via CTAF here . Pilots self-announce and keep one set of eyes outside at all times. Another recent Air Traffic Control tower closure at Salt Lake City International Airport was unrelated to COVID-19. Salt Lake City experienced a magnitude 5.7 earthquake, also on March 18. Reports from controllers claim the tower swayed up to 18 feet and needed to be evacuated. There is an elevated risk of incidents with reduced services, and it’s one that pilots are trained to handle and mitigate. After all, pilots spend a lot of time self-announcing and separating themselves at uncontrolled airports, but it is not a common practice for airliners at highly trafficked international airports. We suspect this may be the tip of the iceberg. Some employers are waiting until someone has symptoms to send them home or have them tested. The WHO and CDC have established that the COVID-19 Virus can spread through asymptomatic individuals who often believe they are perfectly healthy. This complicates mitigating the risk of spreading the disease among groups of people that have to work in close proximity to one another and in enclosed spaces, such as air traffic controllers. The primary concern for these eventualities relates to delays caused by ATC facility closures and the health of air traffic controllers and ultimately all air transportation workers and passengers. Further, facility closures and reduced services bring us one step at a time closer to greater delays, cancellations, and closures, up to and including the possibility of a complete stoppage of all civil aviation. Inside an Air Route Traffic Control Center., FAA Right now, airliners are being flown with few passengers and even no passengers while airlines attempt to stay temporarily competitive for time slots and gates at busy airports. The War Zone has obtained documents from airlines telling their employees to expect massive reductions in air travel services and subsequent layoffs . Domestically, Compass and Trans State Airlines have already announced they are ceasing operations and others are expected as airlines are asking for tens of billions of dollars in aid from the federal government. COVID-19 has had a massive effect on aviation already and we are only beginning to feel its effects. The United States Government COVID-19 response plan dated March 13th, 2020, is telling government officials to assume that in the absence of data on the virus, there will be multiple waves of this pandemic lasting up to 18 months. As it sits now, these closures have been intermittent and have been mitigated by fallback procedures. But as the virus quickly extends its presence across America, it is unclear just how much disruption the country’s air traffic control system is capable of enduring. We will keep you up to date as this unprecedented set of circumstances continues to unfold.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Apr 17, 2020",The Rich Are Scrambling To Escape COVID-19 On Private Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Small countries are taking extreme measures to halt international travel in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Those accustomed to private jet travel are used to demanding what they want and getting it. As a result, private jet flights escaping from and running to resort countries, such as those in the Caribbean, are currently in high demand—and they do not always occur under the most lawful of circumstances. The most wealthy among us are trying to get around flight bans with private jet flights as they are desperate to get into or home from Caribbean countries, many of which have partial or full international travel bans. Those with complete bans include Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, Columbia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Partial international travel bans are in effect for Belize, Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Antigua and Barbados, Saint Lucia, Grenada, and Venezuela. These countries are home to many affluent expatriates. The money some of them spend on private jet flights is staggering. One round trip to Europe in a Gulfstream 550 jet from the United States with five passengers can easily cost the client six figures. With the world being crippled in many ways by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultra-wealthy still have places to be and airline options are not only becoming restrictive, but they are also dwindling . Rumors currently abound of private jet pilots, both from charter operations and private flight departments, being offered large bonuses to get into and out of Caribbean resort countries undetected and bypassing customs and port of entry requirements. While not impossible, it’s an extremely risky game to play. Privately owned or chartered aircraft operate on demand, when and where their clients or owners need them. Private jet pilots have a “bag of tricks” that airline pilots don’t, including late-night flights to closed airports, low altitude visual flight rules (VFR) flights, tricks to bypass arrival lines, departing under VFR to avoid lengthy departure routing and many others. And that’s the list of legal options. With so much money on the line, less than reputable private jet operators undoubtedly have a less-than-legal bag of tricks. Yesterday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Mayor Cynthia Viteri resorted to stopping flights at Jose Joaquin de Olmedo International Airport by directing that ground vehicles be parked on the runway. The action is alleged to have been taken to stop two airliners, one each from KLM and Iberia, from arriving from Europe. Video footage from a Robinson helicopter has surfaced, overflying the parked vehicles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=WYxEDCEdYt4 It may shock the average person to understand that Ecuador found it necessary to physically block a runway to stop it from being used. However, it wouldn’t shock many in private aviation. Efforts to stop private jet travel are often futile. The War Zone recently documented the rash of drug smuggling operations using private jets in Central and South America. Even the largest international airports in small foreign countries often have no operating control tower in the middle of the night, which is more commonly seen stateside at regional or primary Class D airspace airports. In cases where the tower is closed, but the airport remains open, pilots use a common traffic advisory frequency to announce their intentions, often with no audience. Some airports are unattended and gates are locked after hours. If you think those who arrive in $10 million jets would never hop a fence at 2 a.m. after securing their aircraft, you’re wrong. Doing so is often perfectly legal, especially if the crew has no choice but to arrive after hours and has a valid reason to be there. Other airports have hours during which aircraft are specifically prohibited from arriving or departing, especially aircraft arriving internationally. JEAN CHRISTOPHE MAGNENET/AFP via Getty Images Sneaking into and out of a closed airport stateside is one risk, but the Caribbean, which due to a long and colored legacy of illicit drug trafficking , is no stranger to sketchy flights. The Caribbean waters are littered with abandoned drug-running aircraft. Unannounced aircraft with no flight plans draw attention from big brother. In recent decades U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reached out to and coordinated with neighboring and Caribbean countries to increase its ability to detect and control illegal border crossings of all kinds. The resulting joint operating plans make it much more difficult to get away with illicit and nefarious flight operations. On Tuesday of this week, a Hawker jet was detected by Aruba authorities flying suspiciously and at low altitude around the south end of the island. They landed at Aruba airport, which was closed, and were promptly arrested for landing without permission. The crew told authorities during questioning they had landed because of an unspecified fuel problem. The day before, private jet clients were openly asking in online forums for an operator who’d be willing to pick them up in Aruba to avoid being stuck there during worldwide quarantine efforts and airport closures. There’s no evidence linking the two events, but they speak to the current state of desperation among wealthy passengers. On Thursday of this week, a medevac Learjet landed at LAX after traveling from Aruba with a confirmed COVID-19 patient onboard. Despite less oversight, private jet flights are still subject to port of entry requirements and resulting scrutiny. As of Saturday, Chub Cay was taking every single person’s temperature. Temperatures of 99.9 degrees and higher were refused entry. The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism and Aviation issued a statement on March 16th, asserting that while only one confirmed case of COVID-19 exists in Nassau, they reserve the right to institute further measures to minimize the spread of illness. Effective March 19th, anyone from or who had traveled through the United Kingdom, Ireland and mainland Europe in the last 20 days will be prohibited entry. The circumstances and difficulties the aviation world is facing may get much direr. It’s not outside of one’s imagination to see a temporary total ban on civil aviation flights in the United States if the situation continues to deteriorate. In the meantime, private jet travel will remain the best bet when it comes to escaping to one location or another for the most affluent in our society, and for some, this is even the case if the law says otherwise.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 15, 2020",Air Force’s Gray Wolf Program Tests Game-Changing Small Low-Cost Jet Engine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it has completed a round of tests of a first-of-its-kind small, low-cost turbojet engine. The experiments were part of a program called Gray Wolf , which has focused heavily on the demonstration of technologies that could enable the development of cheaper cruise missiles. The engine could also power other future expendable air-launched systems or unmanned aircraft . A TDI-J85 engine from Technical Directions Inc. (TDI), a division of drone maker Kratos, powered an expendable test article from Northrop Grumman during the test flights. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is responsible for the Gray Wolf effort, released a picture of an F-16 Viper fighter carrying the flight vehicle, which also bears the logo of Griffon Aerospace , along with its announcement on Mar. 19, 2020. AFRL first revealed Gray Wolf in 2017 and hired both Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin to supply testbed systems for the program in December of that year. “The success of this test greatly increases our confidence in the performance of the engine and weapon systems as a whole,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Garry Haase, the head of AFRL’s Munitions Directorate, abbreviated AFRL/RW, said in a statement. “Developing the TDI-J85 engine in parallel to the cruise missile has proved challenging, but the collaborative partnership between AFRL, TDI, and Northrop Grumman has been outstanding.” One of Northrop Grumman’s TDI-J85-powered test articles under the wing of an F-16 Viper., USAF The TDI-J85 is 200-pound-thrust-class turbojet that weighs just 28 pounds. For comparison, the Williams F107 turbofan engine, which powers the AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) and variants of the Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile, is in the 600-pound-thrust-class and weighs around 67 pounds. The TDI-J85 engine., TDI TDI “The TDI-J85 engine underwent a successful flight test campaign culminating in multiple inflight engine starts and operation at high altitude. The engine met performance expectations for thrust and surpassed fuel efficiency expectations,” AFRL news release said. “The engines tested accumulated sufficient inflight operating time, building confidence in the design durability.” “The engine design focused on affordability and manufacturability, which enables increased production. Test results proved the engine capability,” it continued. “It is the first engine in its class and price point to successfully operate at altitude.” AFRL did not give a unit price for the TDI-J85. As of 2014 , each F107 was around $190,000. TDI TDI has been working on small jet engine technology, including for cruise missiles, since the 1980s . In 2013, it received almost $1.5 million from the Air Force for work specifically on “Low-Cost Propulsion System for Smart Munitions.” That contract ran through 2016, the year before the Gray Wolf program, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story , began. Low-cost, fuel-efficient engines have been a core focus of the program, primarily to help drive the overall cost of individual air-launched cruise missiles. In its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, the Air Force said that the average unit price across its purchases of both AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and AGM-158B JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) was approximately $1.266 million. Needless to say, this kind of unit price makes traditional large scale cruise missile attacks an especially expensive proposition. The Air Force’s plans to network such munitions together in the future to act together in swarms requires the ability to launch even greater numbers of weapons all at once or in coordinated waves for maximum effect. Beyond simply helping to reduce costs, improved fuel efficiency could also translate into greater range for weapons without having to increase the total amount of fuel they carry, something that could be invaluable in the future as the range of hostile air defense threats continues to increase . With an engine such as the TDI-J85, the fuel load could also be reduced to make room for larger warheads or other payloads , without sacrificing existing range. At present, the Air Force says it is aiming to demonstrate an experimental low-cost cruise missile design that can “cruise for distances greater than 250 nautical miles.” This is roughly equivalent to the JASSM’s range, but significantly shorter than that of the JASSM-ER or future AGM-158D JASSM-Extreme Range (JASSM-XR), as well as of the AGM-86B ALCM and Tomahawk. The improved engines also wouldn’t be limited to powering air-launched cruise missiles, either. Engines such as the TDI-J85 could help propel a new generation of other expendable systems, including decoys , as well as unmanned aircraft. The Air Force’s future plans for the Gray Wolf program are not entirely clear. In June 2019, the service announced that it was canceling additional phases it had planned to carry out and would be transitioning work on networked swarming munitions to a different project, dubbed Golden Horde, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . A briefing slide outlining the original plans for the Gray Wolf program., USAF Even if Gray Wolf does wrap up soon, it’s very likely that work on the potentially game-changing TDI-J85 will continue as part of other efforts. As noted, TDI has already been working on cost-effective and fuel-efficient engines, including for cruise missiles, under contract from the U.S. military for decades now. No matter what happens, the Air Force has clearly made important progress toward developing potentially game-changing low-cost cruise missiles, achievements that will likely impact the development of other systems in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 11, 2020",The Army And Navy Have Conducted The First Joint Test Of Their New Hypersonic Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy, in cooperation with the Missile Defense Agency, have conducted their first joint test launch of a new hypersonic warhead in the Pacific. The two services plan to eventually deploy this common hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top of land-based and submarine-launched missiles , respectively. A launch took place at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii at approximately 10:30 PM local time on Mar. 19. A ground-launched rocket booster propelled the Common Hypersonic Glide Body vehicle, or C-HGB, to the desired speed and altitude, after which it “flew at hypersonic speed to a designated impact point,” according to a Pentagon statement . The announcement did not say how fast the vehicle flew or how far, but hypersonic speed is defined as being above Mach 5 and the Pentagon said that the new weapons could enable the Army and the Navy to quickly “strike targets hundreds and even thousands of miles away.” “This test was a critical step in rapidly delivering operational hypersonic capabilities to our warfighters in support of the National Defense Strategy,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General L. Neil Thurgood, the Director of Hypersonics, Directed Energy, Space, and Rapid Acquisition, which is leading the Army’s portion of the program, said in a statement. “We successfully executed a mission consistent with how we can apply this capability in the future. The joint team did a tremendous job in executing this test, and we will continue to move aggressively to get prototypes to the field.” The conventionally-armed C-HGB is an unpowered conical hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. The conical design presents a less risky alternative to wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicles that are also in development within the U.S. military. However, the cone-shaped boost-glide vehicle is also understood to have less maneuverability and range. Both conical and wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicles have a similar concept of operation. After the rocket booster gets them to the optimal altitude and speed, they then glide down to their target at hypersonic speeds within the atmosphere along a relatively flat trajectory, maneuvering laterally. Their high speed and unpredictable flight path makes them harder for opponents to spot and track them , in turn, making it difficult to relocate critical assets or otherwise take cover before the strike hits, let alone attempt any kind of intercept . You can read more about the origins of the C-HGB, which draws on research and development work dating back to the 1970s, in this past War Zone piece . The Navy conducted a test launch of a prototype of this hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design by itself back in October 2017. A model of the C-HGB. , US Army “This test builds on the success we had with Flight Experiment 1 in October 2017, in which our C-HGB achieved sustained hypersonic glide at our target distances,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, Director of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs, which is heading up that service’s portion of the project, said in a statement. “In this test, we put additional stresses on the system and it was able to handle them all, due to the phenomenal expertise of our top-notch team of individuals from across government, industry, and academia. Today we validated our design and are now ready to move to the next phase towards fielding a hypersonic strike capability.” The Army plans to deploy hypersonic missiles carrying the C-HGB on ground-based launchers . The Navy plans to first integrate its own version of the missile into its future Block V Virginia class submarines, which will be the first to feature the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), a new hull section with four large-diameter launch tubes. Both services hope to begin fielding their respective hypersonic missiles in the early-to-mid 2020s. An Army infographic showing the basic components of its expected future ground-based hypersonic missile units., US Army A Navy graphic showing a cutaway of the Virginia Payload Module and its four large-diameter launch tubes., USN The Air Force had originally been part of the program, as well, with plans for an air-launched version that the B-52 bomber would carry.

MDA “monitored and gathered tracking data from the flight experiment that will inform its ongoing development of systems designed to defend against adversary hypersonic weapons,” according to the Pentagon statement. The development and limited fielding of ground , sea , and air-launched hypersonic weapons in other countries, especially Russia and China , has been a major driver for U.S. military hypersonic weapon projects. It has also prompted MDA and others to start on work on new anti-hypersonic weapon interceptors and associated sensors to defend against these threats. Overall, this latest C-HGB test is a prime example of the steps the U.S. military is taking toward a hypersonic future, both offensively and defensively.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",MV-22 Osprey Spotted Making Brief Stop At U.S. Embassy In Lebanon After Prisoner Release (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A lone V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon earlier today and stayed only briefly, possibly departing with Amer Fakhoury on board. Fakhoury, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested while visiting his native Lebanon last year on charges that he had tortured prisoners while fighting with an Israeli-backed armed group during the 1990s. He was released today after his charges were dropped, in part due to pressure from the U.S. government and Congress. The office of Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, who has been a key figure in securing Fakhoury’s release, announced he was on his way back to the United States in a statement on Mar. 19, 2020. It did not mention how he had departed Lebanon. However, earlier in the day, video footage had emerged on social media of the V-22 flying to the Embassy in Beirut and departing approximately 10 minutes later. The Osprey appears to have been a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22B. Plane spotters using online flight tracking software had also tracked a Marine Corps KC-130J Hercules tanker flying in orbit off the coast of Lebanon around the same time. A U.S. Air Force KC-10A Extender was also in the same area and appeared to refuel the KC-130J at one point, but the Marines Hercules are not capable of doing so, raising questions about what was going on. Regardless, the KC-130J eventually headed south, flying another orbit off the coast of Israel, before heading further south across Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. This would all make good sense. Due to diplomatic issues, U.S. military aircraft cannot fly directly between Lebanon and Israel. The route that the KC-130J flew is typically seen in flights between Beirut and larger American bases in Jordan . To execute this movement, the MV-22B would have had to refuel, requiring support from the KC-130J. The larger KC-10A could have been in a position to refuel other aircraft supporting the operation. It also possible that the KC-130J was simply on station to assist if required and that the MV-22B flew to a ship waiting offshore. However, the fact that the Hercules flew a second apparent refueling orbit further south after the Osprey had been seen leaving Beirut strongly suggests it was dragging the tilt-rotor with it toward Jordan. “Anytime a U.S citizen is wrongfully detained by a foreign government, we must use every tool at our disposal to free them,” Shaheen said in a statement. “I’m very glad that Amer is finally coming home and will be reunited with his family.” Fakhoury had stood accused of running the Khiam Prison , allegedly earning the nickname “ the Butcher of Khiam ,” as a member of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the 1990s. The SLA fought the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, among others, with Israeli support between 1982 and its disbandment in 2000. Khiam was reportedly the site of horrific torture and human rights abuses during the Lebanese Civil War. Fakhoury lawyers disputed his role at the prison, saying he never interacted with prisoners . Shaheen and others in Congress lobbied heavily for his release and threatened sanctions against the Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is now a part. Last year, President Donald Trump also held up military aid to Lebanon, but it is unclear if this was related in any way directly to Fakhoury’s case. UN-supplied refugee tents sit outside the remains of the Khiam Prison in 2006., Julien Harneis via Wikimedia Earlier this week, a Military Court of Appeals dropped the charges against Fakhoury, ostensibly citing a statute of limitations. There was an attempt by a Lebanese Military Judge to reverse that decision , which appears to have failed or at least not proceeded fast enough to prevent him from leaving the country. This may have, in fact, required the use of the Osprey to spirit him out of the Embassy directly. Lebanon is also now under a nation-wide lockdown over the expanding COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic , which includes shutting down the airport in Beirut, and Fakhoury is said to be in poor health already and in need of immediate medical care. Shaheen, as well as Fakhoury’s family, who live in New Hampshire, also thanked a number of other individuals, including Trump, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, Legislative Affairs Chief for the National Security Council Virginia Boney, Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Holzhall Richard, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, for their help in securing his release. “American citizen Amer Fakhoury, who has been in detention in Lebanon since September, is returning to the United States where he will be reunited with his family and receive urgent medical treatment,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in his own statement. “His return comes as a relief to those who have followed the case with grave concern. We are relieved to be able to welcome him back home.” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley were also mentioned, indicating a military component in the efforts to get Fakhoury home. The War Zone reached out to the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon to confirm that the Osprey did indeed carry Fakhoury out of the country, but had not received any responses at the time of writing. We will update this story as more information becomes available on how the U.S. government helped Fakhoury get back to the United States. UPDATE: 6:30pm EST: Fox News is now reporting that the Osprey was indeed a Marine MV-22, which launched from the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan , and that it did carry Amer Fakhoury out of the country. Despite the path of the KC-130J seen on online flight tracking software, the MV-22 reportedly then flew to Naval Support Activity Souda Bay on the Greek Island of Crete. Fakhoury is apparently still in transit back to the United States.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, the U.S. Army’s Rock Island Arsenal Museum found a picture in its archives that appears to be of a joke regarding the service’s abortive XM10 pistol competition, which followed the controversial adoption of the Beretta M9 . The photo shows the three actual handguns that took part in that program together with a squirt gun shaped like an anthropomorphic hot dog with “XM10” scrawled on the side. The Rock Island Arsenal Museum, the Army’s second oldest museum , which is located at the arsenal of the same name in Rock Island, Illinois, posted the picture on its Facebook page on Mar. 6, 2020. Rock Island Arsenal, which first opened in 1862, remains an active research and development facility specializing in small arms and artillery systems, among other things, and is home to the only foundry still in operation within the Army. “What caliber do you think a hot dog is?” the Facebook post asked. The War Zone reached out to the Rock Island Arsenal Museum after seeing the picture to see if there was any more information about it. “We came across this image while filing photos in our archives, and unfortunately there was no information accompanying the image,” S. Patrick Allie, the museum’s director, told us in an Email. The “hot dog gun” photo. Also seen are the Beretta M9, at top, the Smith & Wesson 459, at middle left, and Ruger P85, at middle right. Those three real guns took part in the XM10 competition., Rock Island Arsenal Museum “What we do know is this image shows the weapons, excepting the ‘hot dog gun,’ that were part of the 1988 XM10 sidearm trial which was a follow up to the XM9 trial,” he added. “If I were to speculate, I would say it was workers on the project having fun, or perhaps making a commentary on a trial that wasn’t being taken as serious since among the pistols in the trials was the M9 Beretta which was already adopted, and was the pistol that eventually won the XM10 trial.” These are good theories given the circumstances that led to the XM10 competition in the first place and virtually doomed it to failure from the very start – that is if the Army had ever been serious about it, to begin with. Starting back in 1977, the U.S.-military-wide Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) had begun trials searching for a new 9mm pistol to become the standard sidearm across the services. The winning gun in this competition was to be designated the XM9 and replace a slew of existing automatic handguns and revolvers, including the venerable .45 caliber Colt M1911-series pistols and .38 caliber Smith & Wesson M15 revolvers . The Army, which was leading the effort, eventually narrowed down the field of contenders to the Beretta 92FBS , the Sig Sauer P226 , the Heckler and Koch P7A10 , and the Smith & Wesson 459 . After tests in 1983, the service added in the Steyr GB , the FN Hi-Power BDA , the Colt SSP , and the Walther P88 to the mix. The field eventually narrowed to just the offerings from Beretta and Sig Sauer, with the Italian-made gun winning the competition in 1985. This immediately sparked a protest from Sig Sauer, who argued that testing showed that its pistol was superior and it had only lost because of collusion between Beretta and the Army. A US Army soldier fires an M9 pistol., US Army The Army and the Government Accountability Office spent two years going back and forth about the protest until the former agreed to conduct a second trial. This competition, for a pistol to be designated the XM10, quickly became a farce. Sig Sauer refused to participate after its experience with the XM9 program. Beretta also wouldn’t take part because of its position that it had fairly won the XM9 contract. It took another year for the Army to convince Smith & Wesson and Ruger to submit their 459 and P85 pistols, respectively. During the XM10 trials in 1988, the service also included some of the Beretta 92FBSs. The Rock Island Arsenal “hot dog gun” certainly epitomizes the Army’s struggle to find willing participants. By the end of 1988, the Army had declared the Beretta the winner again, ending the XM10 program. Whatever the truth behind the Army’s decision to pick the Beretta pistol, the XM9 did certainly have serious teething issues as it evolved into the standard-issue M9. Most infamously, between 1985 and 1988, Army and Navy testers documented at least 14 instances where the Beretta’s slide failed , sending parts flying off the back of the gun. In four of those cases, the shooter was seriously injured. Between 1989 and 1993, the Army and Beretta worked to correct this issue on the initial run of 160,000 guns. However, in 2015, inspections of some of the oldest M9s still in service in the Army showed that at least some of them were lacking these critical parts and still posed a major hazard to shooters. The service ordered all units to determine if they had any guns from these original batches and mail any pistols without the appropriate modifications straight to the Defense Logistics Agency. An official US Army notice from 2015 showing an anthropomorphic M9 pistol chastizing its user for not having installed the critical replacement parts back in 1993., US Army Some years after losing its bid to become the supplier of the standard U.S. military sidearm, Sig Sauer won a separate contract to supply P228 pistols, a compact version of its P226, for plainclothes military police officers and other personnel needing a more concealable gun, which became the M11 . Sig Sauer has, of course, now really had the last laugh. After years of abortive attempts to replace the M9, in 2017, the Army finally selected full-size and compact versions of the company’s P320 pistol series as the M17 and M18 respectively. These guns are now set to become the standard sidearm across the U.S. military, though other handguns will remain in service among more specialized elements , especially special operations forces . A member of the US Army fires a new M17 pistol., US Army After all this time, the XM10 competition has faded into obscurity. The “hot dog gun” would strongly suggest that, even at the time, those involved saw it as a joke best forgotten. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 3, 2021",Pakistani F-16 “Engaged” One Of The MH-47G Chinooks Three Times During Bin Laden Raid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The flight lead during the raid that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden, who was piloting one of the MH-47G Chinooks employed in that operation, says that a Pakistani F-16 Viper fighter jet “engaged” his helicopter three separate times as he flew toward Afghanistan during the exfiltration phase of the mission. The now-retired U.S. Army officer also says he was involved personally in two attempts during the Obama Administration to capture Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. The Trump Administration decided to kill Soleimani , who had been head of Iran’s Quds Force, in a drone strike in Baghdad in January. Retired U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 5 Douglas Englen offered these and other previously unreported details about operations from throughout his career with the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , also known as the Night Stalkers, in an exclusive interview with journalist and documentarian Alex Quade for Military Times , which is worth reading in its entirety. He only decided to share his personal memories after prompting from former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Panetta and retired U.S. Navy Admiral William McRaven, both of whom were heavily involved in the planning execution of the raid on Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011, according to Quade. “I’m telling it to you,” Englen told Military Times . “There’s never been an accurate air piece conveyed on what happened that night.” Many of the basics of the operation are well established at this point. Famously, two heavily modified stealthy Black Hawk helicopters were first to arrive at the compound and inserted the main raiding force. One of these helicopters subsequently crashed after experiencing a condition known as vortex ring state . Englen says the ambient temperature was hotter than expected, which can also impact a helicopter’s available lift, and the stealth Black Hawk had more fuel and personnel on board than initially planned, all contributing to the accident. It has also been widely reported that the use of the helicopters was controversial among the personnel involved in planning the operation and that McRaven, then head of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), had been particularly keen to employ them. There are indications that the stealth Black Hawks had been key to securing the final approval from President Barak Obama to launch the risky raid inside the territory of an ostensibly friendly nation. It’s not clear where Englen fell on that debate. He makes clear in his interview that he was among those who advocated for letting the stealthy helicopters penetrate into Pakistan first, rather than sending in the two MH-47G Chinooks, including the one that he would be flying, first to establish a temporary Forward Arming Refueling Point (FARP) and be in position in case something went wrong. So, when the Black Hawk crashed at the Abbottabad compound, Englen and the rest of the backup force in the Chinooks were still in the process of setting up the FARP at a site 30 miles to the north. He immediately got a quick reaction force into his MH-47G and set off to assist the main raiding party, while the other Chinook stayed behind to ensure that fuel would be waiting for the remaining force before it returned to Afghanistan. “We just went into contingency mode,” Englen explained. “Didn’t know the severity – if it was crashed with casualties? If it crashed in civilian area? All we do is minimize our time and get there as quick as possible.” One of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s MH-47s prepares to land and pick up US and Afghan personnel during an operation in Afghanistan in 2018., Resolute Support Mission Englen says that infiltrating into Pakistan in the first place had been relatively easy and, while he said that it was clear from lights coming on in buildings down below that they were waking average citizens up, there did not appear to be any major response from the country’s authorities. “Once we crashed the aircraft [the stealth helicopter], within the first 30 seconds of the mission, then that’s when we really woke up that entire valley,” he said. Special operators attempted to destroy the helicopter with explosives, which only drew further attention. Englen says that he was arriving right when the controlled demolition occurred and almost got caught in the blast. “I was probably 100 feet from the aircraft when it blew up. It pushed our aircraft to the side,” he said. “I had to actually fly away, make a tight circle and come back in, and land under the mushroom cloud. I landed to the east of the compound, right next to it. I mean like, right next to it.” As is well known, portions of the helicopter remained intact enough for recovery. Pictures emerged soon after the raid showing the tail section of the top-secret helicopter in particular detail. The tail of the crashed stealth Black Hawk hangs over the wall of Bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan following the raid., Public Domain After loading up Bin Laden’s body and other items of potential intelligence value from the compound, the raiding force began to make its way back to Afghanistan. Englen does not say exactly when during the exfiltration it occurred or where, but he says that one of Pakistan’s American-made F-16 Viper fighter jets was clearly hunting for the remaining helicopters and attempted to “engage” his MH-47G at least three times. “It was as an electronic fight. A missile never left the rail. So I was able to evade him electronically. That’s all I’ll say,” he said. “But, he was searching and hunting for me, and three times came very close to actually launching a missile.” Englen does not say what type of electronic warfare systems he employed to evade the fighter jet. It is known that the MH-47G has some form of radio-frequency countermeasures system , in addition to infrared and laser missile warning receivers. Quade also says that the 160th’s Chinooks had just received new electronic warfare equipment before the raid and that Englen had helped certify those systems and training crews to use them. The Night Stalkers Chinooks are without a doubt the most heavily modified and best-protected versions of that helicopter anywhere in the world. An older Army MH-47E Chinook special operations helicopter undergoing testing in an anechoic chamber . These chambers deaden ambient electromagnetic radiation so that engineers can test the interactions between the electronic suites, including electronic warfare suites, on aircraft and helicopters., USAF via Chinook-Helicopter.com The retired Chief Warrant Officer also says that he employed evasive maneuvers and a very low-level nap-of-the-earth flight profile to help get away from the F-16. “We pulled every technique and tactic out of the book. And it worked,” he said. “Now, in retrospect, we could have done it with two Chinooks, the entirety,” Englen added. “And more than likely – I don’t want to ever second-guess anybody – but in this condition, we would not have crashed, because we [the Chinooks] have the lift.” However, his experience with the F-16 raises questions about whether using only non-stealthy MH-47Gs  would have created unacceptable risks. It has long been understood that there was a real danger that, if any of the raiding helicopters were detected, that the Pakistani Air Force, which is on a perpetually high state of alert in case of attacks from India , might have tried to shoot it down. A Pakistani Air Force Block 52 F-16D Viper fighter jet., USAF This interview would only seem to confirm that this was very much the case and came closer to actually happening than has been previously known. At the same time, it also appears to indicate that the Pakistani Air Force did not swing into action until the crash at the compound, suggesting that the country’s air defense radars did not pick up any of the helicopters, regardless of their stealth features, during the initial inflitration. Interestingly Englen does say that this was not the first time during his career with the 160th that hostile combat jets threatened his helicopter, but he did not provide any further details about any other similar incidents. There are reports that three years later, U.S. special operators again rode in stealth Black Hawks during a raid into Syria, though primarily due to concerns about ground-based air defenses , rather than hostile combat aircraft. The very real vulnerability of conventional helicopters, as well as non-stealthy tilt-rotors and fixed-wing transport aircraft, to more advanced air defense networks has prompted work on stealthy helicopters and transport aircraft for decades now. The War Zone has explored many years worth of relevant programs extensively in the past . Beyond these and other interesting details about the Bin Laden Raid, Englen also says that he directly took part in two attempts to capture Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, once in 2013 and again in 2016. These are significant revelations given the ongoing debate around the Trump Administration’s controversial decision to kill Solemani outside Baghdad International Airport in January and its legal justification for doing so. For years, Solemani ran Iran’s Quds Force, which conducts various covert overseas operations overseas and provides different levels of support to various proxy forces throughout the Middle East and beyond. Now-retired U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal has said that he declined an opportunity to kill the Iranian officer in Iraq in 2007. McChrystal was head of JSOC at the time. The following year, President George W. Bush reportedly shot down a joint proposal from the CIA and Israel’s Mossad to assassinate Soleimani in Syria. That President Barack Obama was willing to try to capture Solemani is certainly an interesting addition to the discussion and it’s not clear what the justification would have been for doing so. In 2011, the Obama Administration had sanctioned the Iranian officer over a Quds Force plot to kill the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States in Washington, D.C. “It wasn’t ‘capture or kill,’ so if we couldn’t guarantee a capture, then we couldn’t take it to the next level,” Englen said in his interview with Military Times . “But we were minutes behind him and his vehicles in Iraq, and we could’ve gotten him. But our rules of engagement was, ‘capture only.'” As already noted, the first to Englen’s interview with Military Times is well worth reading in full. Englen was involved in some of the earliest U.S. military operations in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, including the mission to save Hamid Karzai, who later became president of the country, from getting captured by the Taliban . He also took part in the opening phases of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. With 34 deployments under his belt in total, equalling six years and nine months of total time spent in combat, including 2,500 sorties just in Iraq and Afghanistan, he has certainly seen and done a lot. Over the course of his career, 90 percent of the missions he flew were in support of so-call Tier One special operations forces, a term for the most elite and secretive units, such as the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 and the Army’s Delta Force . Quade says that this may be both the first and last time Englen shares this level of detail about his experiences. Still, he is due to get inducted into the Army Aviation Hall of Fame in April, at which time we may learn even more about his years as one of the Army’s most elite aviators.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 15, 2021",Air Force Wants To Acquire Losing T-X Jet Trainers To Help Revolutionize Pilot Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has been quietly in the process of trying to lease a small number of KAI T-50 Golden Eagle advanced jet trainer aircraft as it waits for the arrival of the first of its new T-7A Red Hawks . If the deal, which appears stalled for the moment, goes ahead, the aircraft could support a proof of concept experiment that could lead to ambitious and radical changes in how the service trains fighter pilots. Aviation Week published an update on Air Combat Command’s (ACC) little known RFX program on Mar. 18, 2020. ACC had announced it planned to enter into a sole-source contract with Texas-based Hillwood Aviation to rent between four and eight T-50s, with the expectation that the fleet, as a whole, would fly approximately 4,500 flight hours across 3,000 sorties each year for just one day shy of five years, in January. Hillwood, a subsidiary of The Perot Group , has a deal with KAI in South Korea to represent the T-50 in the United States. It’s something of a curious development from the start, given that Lockheed Martin had partnered with KAI to pitch a variant of the T-50 for the Air Force’s T-X contract. Boeing, together with Saab, won that competition in 2018 with what became the T-7A Red Hawk . Lockheed Martin still lists the T-50A as an offering for “ Advanced Pilot Training ” on its website. ACC wants the T-50s in the meantime to help begin testing a completely new training concept, also known as Project Reforge. U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, who is currently head of ACC, publicly outlined the plan in a piece for War On The Rocks in January 2019. “The way the Air Force trains aviators has its roots in the training architecture that was built to churn out aviators in World War II,” Holmes wrote. “Pilot training in the 1930s lasted 12 months – and, despite the proliferation of GPS, glass cockpits, autopilots, and digitally aided flight controls – it still lasts 12 months today.” At its most basic, the present system involves a three-phase Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) process, the first phase of which is on the ground entirely. The second phase sees trainees get into the air in T-6A Texan II turboprop trainers. During the third phase, also known as lead-in flight training (LIFT), the future aviators move on to more representative aircraft types depending on their assignments. Those destined to become fighter pilots presently spend more time in the T-6A before moving on to the T-38 Talon jet trainer. The T-7A is slated to eventually replace the T-38. Those future fighter jockeys then move on to the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) course. After that, it’s on to a Formal Training Unit (FTU) to learn how to fly a specific combat aircraft, such as the F-15C/D Eagle or F-16C/D Viper . The current process imposes major hardships on future aviators. At present, a trainee pilot, and their family if they have one, has to completely move from one base to another three times in a span of fewer than two years. On Mar. 3, the Air Force admitted it was short 2,100 pilots . This was an acknowledgment that a long-standing shortage of aviators was still ongoing, and had actually gotten slightly worse, despite cautious optimism last year that the trend was finally going in reverse. Speeding up and otherwise doing away with hurdles to training new pilots could certainly help turn this situation around. General Holmes’ plan envisions having future fighter pilots move only once, after completing the first two phases of UFT, to the home of their future operational fighter squadron. They would learn to fly the T-7A with a training unit there and then transition to flying their assigned combat aircraft at the same location. This would eliminate the need to send those individuals to another base for IFF and then to an FTU at yet another location before sending them on to an actual operational squadron. A graphical representation of the present fighter pilot training path, at left, and General Holmes’ Project Reforge concept, at right., via War On The Rocks In principle, this would significantly simplify the training pipeline and reduce hardships for future aviators. In turn, this would hopefully speed up the entire process and make it more attractive to new recruits. This would also allow them to forge valuable bonds and get experience working together with the same people they’ll eventually flying into combat with. Right now, there’s no guarantee that aviators leaving an FTU will go to the same operational squadron. Having training units with T-7As at the same bases with operational fighter squadrons might also help ease other training demands. The T-7As could potentially serve as “red air” aggressors for routine training, something the War Zone has discussed in more detail in the past. Many combat units have to use their own aircraft in this role, which is an increasingly costly proposition, especially when it comes to high per-flight-hour costs to operate advanced stealth aircraft, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . This also increases normal wear and tear on the airframes and puts precious flight hours on high-end combat aircraft. The Air Force has now hired seven different contractors to provide red air support at bases across the country to reduce these operational and logistical strains. Still, having T-7As permanently stationed at the same bases as operational fighter units that could be used for adversary missions, in addition to their training duties, would only offer additional resources in this regard. ACC has also discussed the possibility of employing an even more fighter jet representative derivative of the Red Hawk, referred to presently as the “ F/T-7X .” The War Zone has previously noted that the Boeing-Saab design is already very much a light fighter that could have wide-reaching applications beyond flight training. Having T-7A trainers collocated with operational fighter units could also simply be a way to save airframe life on the combat jets, in general, something the Air Force has already proven out on a more limited scale. Units flying the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber and U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane have T-38s associated with them to help pilots maintain basic flight proficiency and build flight hours without needing to fly either of these aircraft, which are extremely expensive to operate and limited in number. A pair of T-38 Talons., USAF The problem is that the Air Force isn’t scheduled to take delivery of the first T-7As, which offer advanced capabilities over the T-38 that Holmes sees as essential to putting his plan into action, until 2023 . The service doesn’t expect to reach initial operational capability with the type until 2024. So, ACC needs to rent or otherwise acquire an interim type to begin experimenting with and refining Project Reforge now. This is where the T-50s would come in. Seeing how well Project Reforge works, and what changes can be made to further streamline it, before the T-7As arrive makes good sense. So, it’s unclear why the Air Force has yet to formally execute the deal with Hillwood for the T-50s. Aviation Week said that the company declined to comment on the project. The deal has already faced some hurdles since ACC first issued the RFX request for information, apparently without much public attention, in May 2019. Mission Support Systems (MSS), another Texas-based aviation firm, had competed with Hillwood for the deal. However, the company told Aviation Week that it only heard about the RFX solicitation after seeing it mentioned in an unrelated presentation regarding a separate Air Education and Training Command (AETC) effort to acquire a small number of advanced jet trainers itself to supplement its T-38 Talons. The aging T-38 fleet has suffered a number of major accidents in recent years and is becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain. MSS had proposed leasing Italian-made Leonardo M-346 jet trainers to meet the RFX requirements. Leonardo had also competed in the T-X program, first together with Raytheon and then through its own U.S.-based subsidiary, with a variant of the M-346, known as the T-100 . T-100 demonstrators that Raytheon and Leonardo initially flew during the T-X competition. Raytheon eventually dropped out, leaving Leonardo to continue on alone., Raytheon The initial RFX plan included a requirement for supersonic speed, a capability the T-50 has, but which many other advanced jet trainers presently on the market, including the M-346 lack. The Air Force eliminated that requirement, which allowed MSS to compete, but then added a new demand that any jet it selected had to be capable of accepting a radar. There is no production version or established conversion of the standard M-346 with a radar, at present. These aircraft have an Embedded Tactical Training System (ETTS) the emulates the capabilities of various systems, including radars, as a cost-saving measure. Having a fully-functional radar, as well as other systems commonly found on actual fighter jets, is not a necessity for even advanced jet pilot training. The T-7As will also use an ETTS. The M-346FA light fighter derivative does have a radar, but the installation is not backward compatible with basic M-346 aircraft. A Leonardo M-346FA light fighter aircraft, which does feature a radar., Leonardo KAI’s T-50 has always had a radar installed. The original T-50s for South Korea’s Air Force had Lockheed Martin AN/APG-67(V)4 mechanically-scanned pulse doppler radars. Newer, armed South Korean TA-50s feature the Israeli-made Elta EL/M-2032 radar. KAI also offers a light fighter jet version of the aircraft, the FA-50 , with the EL/M-2032 as a radar option. MSS told Aviation Week that the Air Force had devised the radar requirement in order to justify eliminating their bid and awarding a sole-source contract to Hillwood. The company had proposed integrating a Leonardo Grifo-series pulse doppler radar onto its M-346s within 12 months of getting a contract award, which ACC apparently rejected. “The T-50 provides the advanced displays, training systems and active radar needed for the RFX. The M-346 variant provides advanced displays and training systems needed for the RFX but does not have an active radar at this time, and the timeline for incorporating one was unknown,” ACC said in a statement to Aviation Week . “Therefore, only the T-50 meets the basic requirements for the RFX.” A South Korean Air Force FA-50 light fighter., ROKAF It’s not clear if MSS is protesting the sole-source RFX deal with Hillwood, which might explain, in part, why ACC has not moved forward to finalize it. Other factors could also be at play, not least of which being the increasingly widespread impacts of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic . Project Reforge, as it is described now, is also extremely ambitious and it’s unclear if it is truly feasible, at all. This might prompt ACC to push it off amid various issues, including the COVID-19 crisis and Air Force’s broadly plans to trim its budgets. Despite General Holmes very real criticisms of the present centralized system, it does limit the total number of advanced jet training units the Air Force has to maintain at any given time. Project Reforge would significantly expand the total number of airframes that the service’s maintenance and logistical chains would have to support at each of its operational fighter jet bases. Keeping all of these new miniature school houses running could create its own strains on Air Force resources, which might outweigh the benefits, depending on the exact number of T-7As that Holmes expects to have at each base. ACC could ultimately decide to retain more of the existing training pipeline and implement the Project Reforge concept further along in the process. A new round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions might also help by consolidating more fighter jet units at fewer locations. Whatever aircraft ACC does or doesn’t acquire for Project Reforge in the end, the concept could certainly revolutionize how the Air Force trains its fighter pilots. With the shortage of aviators still causing serious headaches for the service, hopefully, it will be able to start experimenting to see if plan is truly game-changing sooner rather than later.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aircraft carrier island superstructures are complex and ever-changing steel castles that are bristling with appendages and pockmarked with apertures. Over the years, a carrier’s island can morph dramatically as new technologies and capabilities are integrated over a ship’s long service life—half a century for American nuclear-powered supercarriers. Upon close examination, one feature on American aircraft carriers’ islands that stands out is a seamless, wrap-around windowed room that juts out over the flight deck below. The panoramic window looks out of place next to all the smaller, armored windows that cover various sections of the island. Still, you may have never noticed or thought about this unique enclosure before, but you probably aware of the products it produces. The Island Camera Room has served an essential role aboard U.S. aircraft carriers over decades. Inside, a sailor mans a television studio-like camera that has the ability to pan across the entire flight deck, sweeping a radial arch that is mirrored by the glass surrounding them. Inside the Island Camera Room., USN All flight operations are recorded from this place, with each launch and recovery being documented for a number of reasons. These include providing situational awareness to crew scattered around the inside of the ship to provide a visual record of events should disaster strike. The latter has resulted in some of the most horrifying and spectacular footage in aviation history. The panoramic windowed pod of sorts seems to have been deployed as part of a refit initiative that occurred sometime in the 1980s with the installation showing up on all classes of carriers, from the Forestall class USS Ranger to the first-in-their-class USS Kitty Hawk and USS Midway to the unique USS Enterprise to the Nimitz class of supercarriers. Still, the general concept goes back even farther than that, to the early 1960s, as far as we can tell, when flat-pained semi-enclosed trapezoidal or square structures provided a similar capability. The Forrestal class USS Independence seen sometime in 1969-1970 with a three-sided filming partial enclosure. , Navsource.com USS Kitty Hawk in the early 1980s.

It seems that it is hard to justify it with current technology, where a series of fixed close circuit cameras could cover the entire deck in high-definition and provide the ability to digitally zoom in on things of interest during or after a recording has taken place. In other words, a single camera wouldn’t be limited to recording one area at a time. It would also eliminate the need for an actual camera operator.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",Navy Hospital Ship Still Weeks Away From Arriving In New York City To Help Battle COVID-19,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is planning to deploy the USNS Comfort , one of its two hospital ships , to New York City to help support response efforts related to the rapidly expanding COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic . Unfortunately, despite promises to send the ship “immediately,” that vessel isn’t set to arrive in New York Harbor for weeks, by which time the situation on the ground there may have significantly worsened already. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo and President Donald Trump announced the deployment separately on Mar. 18, 2020. However, the Navy Office of Information, the service’s top public affairs office, has confirmed to The War Zone that Comfort is presently undergoing maintenance at its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, meaning it is not available for immediate deployment. Some reports have indicated that the ship won’t be pier-side in New York until sometime in the middle of April. “The president, I spoke to this morning, he’s going to be making arrangements to send up this hospital ship, which is called [USNS] Comfort . It has about 1,000 rooms on it, it has operating rooms, and the president is going to dispatch the Comfort to us,” Governor Cuomo said. “It will be in New York City Harbor. This will be, it’s an extraordinary step obviously, it’s literally a floating hospital which will add capacity, and the president said he would dispatch that immediately.” “We are sending upon request the two hospital ships,” Trump also told reporters at the White House. “They can be launched in the next week or so, depending on need.” The USNS Mercy , the Navy’s other hospital ship, which is homeported in San Diego., USN U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had already announced at a press briefing yesterday that he had ordered the U.S. Navy to “lean forward” in preparing Comfort , as well as her sister ship USNS Mercy , to deploy to support the U.S. government’s response to the COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic. Earlier that day, USNI News had also reported that both of the ships were already starting the so-called “activation” process to transition from a reduced operating status in port to being fully operational, which takes approximately five days in total under optimal conditions. It is unclear if this was an accurate assessment of where the Navy was or is in the process of getting either ship ready for any actual operations. Military Sealift Command, which oversees both ships, had stated categorically to The War Zone that it had received no formal instructions to get either of the vessels ready for operations as of Mar. 17. We reached out multiple times afterward for further clarification about when, and if, Military Sealift Command had actually received any orders relating to the ships, but did not receive a response before all queries regarding these ships began being directed to the Navy’s Office of Information. Fox News has since reported that Mercy could set sail from her homeport of San Diego within five days, if required, but it is still not clear if there are any actual plans to deploy that ship. USNI News said that the Mercy would head to a location along the West Coast, eventually, but that the specific destination was still undecided. Later on Mar. 18, Secretary of Defense Esper told CNN that Mercy would deploy by the end of the month. “The big challenge isn’t the availability of these inventories, it’s the medical professionals. All of those doctors and nurses either come from our medical treatment facilities or they come from the reserves, which means civilians,” Esper had told reporters yesterday. “What I don’t want to do is take reservists from a hospital where they are needed just to put them on a ship to take them somewhere else where they’re needed.” The ships themselves certainly present challenges, too, with Comfort , as noted, being laid up at the moment, some Esper had also pointed out. USNI News reported that Mercy had been seen near Naval Base San Diego’s maintenance yard recently, as well, even though the ship is not apparently undergoing maintenance right now. The future of these vessels, which the Navy first acquired in 1986 and 1987, has been uncertain in recent years and there have been proposals to retire them in favor of other platforms . Comfort and Mercy do still offer many valuable medical capabilities. Each one of the 900-foot-long ships displaces 69,360 tons with a full load of 1,200 crew members, a mix of military personnel and civilian merchant mariners, and medical equipment and supplies. They can each accommodate up to 1,000 patients, including 80 in intensive care. Helipads on top of the deck allow for the rapid transport of patients to and from the vessels. The ships, which were originally developed to support expeditionary military operations, have an impressive array of specialized medical facilities typically only found on shore. This includes a dozen operating suites, burn wards, dental facilities, a laboratory to conduct various testing, MRI and x-ray equipment, a blood bank, and an on board oxygen generating plant. You can read more about these ships, the future of which has been uncertain in recent years, in this past War Zone piece . Both ships deployed to the Middle East between 1990 and 1991 to support the first Gulf War. Mercy returned to the region in 2003 as part of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The vessels have been employed in response to natural disasters and humanitarian crises , at home and abroad, as well, including in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. “They provide capabilities, but much like what DOD does provide, our capabilities are focused on trauma,” Esper noted to reporters yesterday. “And so whether it’s our field hospitals, whether it’s our hospital ships, they are focused on trauma” That’s not to say that the hospital ships, as well as deployable field hospitals, might not be a useful U.S. military tool to support the COVID-19 response efforts. The plan now is to use Comfort to treat other conditions in order to reduce the strain on New York’s hospitals and free up their resources to handle individuals who have contracted the virus. Mercy could perform a similar function somewhere along the West Coast, such as in Seattle, a major epicenter of COVID-19 cases in the United States. “They [the hospital ships] don’t have necessarily the – the space, the segregated spaces you need to deal with infectious diseases,” Esper explained yesterday. “And so one of the ways by which you could use either field hospitals, the hospital ships or things in between is to take the pressure off of civilian hospitals when it comes to trauma cases, is to open up civilian hospital rooms for infectious diseases.” A look inside the USNS Comfort during a mass-casualty exercise., USN The capabilities that these ships could offer in the immediate term are clear, which raises questions about why it has taken so long to even begin preparing them for potential deployments. A period of weeks, or even days, is an excruciatingly long time in the context of how fast COVID-19 has been able to spread . There could be a concern that as more patients with the virus arrive at hospitals, the risks of moving other individuals to Comfort or Mercy , who might be carrying it, but not showing symptoms, might go up. The Navy has already been keeping warships at sea for two weeks after visits to certain regions experiencing significant outbreaks of COVID-19. If either of the hospital ships had to quarantine individuals, or shut down entirely for a period of weeks following an outbreak on board, it could hamper their ability to contribute the response efforts. The situation also highlights broader concerns about the Navy’s critical, but underappreciated and largely unseen active and reserve sealift fleets, something the War Zone has covered in depth in the past. Last year, U.S. Transportation Command, together with the Military Sealift Command and the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration, conducted an unprecedented snap exercise to stress-test their shared sealift capabilities. The results were not comforting . Of the 33 ships that got an order to activate, nine experienced some sort of issue, three of which were categorized as being condition C-4, meaning that they could set sail, but not perform any real operations. The entire U.S. federal government, including the U.S. military, is steadily increasing its response to the COVID-19 crisis. Unfortunately, there continue to be reports that many of these efforts, including the release of basic, but vital supplies, such as protective masks from national stockpiles, are proceeding at worryingly slow paces. When it comes to deploying Comfort to New York, or Mercy to some other location on the West Coast, the initial decisions to do so clearly only came very recently and those ships are still weeks away from contributing in any meaningful way to the COVID-19 response efforts.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",N95 Mask Shortage Is A Horrific Manifestation Of America’s Crazy “Defense” Priorities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The defense budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year is $738 billion. Funding the larger intelligence and national security ecosystem costs many billions of dollars in addition to this sum. This is money being spent in the name of protecting the American people. For a country that can spend that type of treasure on weapons and warfighting infrastructure, it is downright astonishing that it can’t keep a stockpile of cheap respirators around, or at least guarantee the domestic production base to rapidly build more, in order to fight a pandemic that was not only far from unthinkable, it was inevitable . This simple fact alone should make you furious and question the priorities of the U.S. government and those who are tasked with presiding over it. The N95 respirator is not a high-tech piece of equipment. Far from it. They are disposable masks that, when fitted and worn properly, offer a reliable barrier against a number of things, including viruses. They are considered as essential for healthcare workers who treat patients with infectious diseases that can be transmitted through droplets of bodily fluids, offering them some certainty that they themselves will not end up contracting the patient’s illness. As such, they are absolutely critical to fighting a pandemic just like the one we are experiencing. In other words, they are just as important to keeping the American public safe as combat aircraft or a fighting ship. It is a fairly straightforward problem to deal with. Just stock enough of the masks to meet the most likely cases that will be experienced during a pandemic health emergency. They have a shelf life of roughly five years—although they can be used after that if there is no other choice—so every year a fifth of the stockpile would have to be replenished to keep the entire supply fresh. This is standard logistics for big government. A mix of a large on-hand supply in the Strategic National Stockpile and guaranteeing native production capability to rapidly make more is another option that invites some risk, while also alleviating the costs of stockpiling a portion of the shelf-life limited masks and could be more cost-effective over time. That being said, here’s the unimaginable reality courtesy of the New York Times : “The federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies includes 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks — only about one percent of the 3.5 billion that the Department of Health and Human Services estimates would be needed over the course of a year if the outbreak reaches pandemic levels. The department announced last week that the federal government had put in a guaranteed order for 500 million N95 masks over the next 18 months, a move it said would encourage manufacturers ‘to immediately increase production of N95s for use by health care professionals.'” You read that correctly. We have a minuscule fraction of the masks needed to deal with a pandemic. The Pentagon has announced it is contributing five million more N95s from its own reserves, but that clearly isn’t enough even in the relatively near-term. But there it is, this is all that we have on the federal level. While the production of 500 million N95 masks sounds like a lot over the next 18 months, it isn’t even close to reaching the potential demand and those won’t materialize anytime soon. What makes matters worse is that most of the production of these masks is based, you guessed it, in China. That country has its own incredible demand for respirators and is already running beyond production capacity . Additionally, although they are cheap to produce, they are not easy to make. So, it’s not like the U.S. can just quickly spin up production to the level required domestically to meet the projected need. Hospital clinicians work to test patients for the coronavirus, Covid-19 at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts on March 18, 2020, as the hospital has set up three tents in the parking garage where patients who have been pre-screened can show up for testing., Joseph Prezioso / AFP) (Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images At retail, small-batch prices, the average N95 mask costs between roughly $.75 and $1.50 under normal circumstances. Buying millions at a time direct would cut this cost down massively. Mike Bowen, vice president of Prestige Ameritech, which makes N95 masks, told the New York Times: “You know what a mask costs?… Listen to this: A Class 2 medical device, you can buy two of them for the price of a gumball. They’re cheap. They’re automated. They’re not handmade.” So let’s just use $0.50 per unit for government stockpile-sized contracted buys, which is likely high. In order for the U.S. Government to have a proper supply on-hand for a pandemic, we are talking about $1.75 billion worth of masks needed in the Strategic National Stockpile at any given time. Since the masks expire roughly every five years, that equates to $350 million a year. That is very roughly the cost of two KC-46 aerial tankers, a single Littoral Combat Ship, roughly one-thirty-eighth of a Ford class supercarrier, or about three F-35s and an F/A-18 Super Hornet. Once again, this is assuming an entire stockpile of 3.5 billion masks is on hand at all times instead of securing emergency production for a portion of that number if needed. Of course, these are just comparative numbers. The country does need a strong military and you could plug in many other government spending initiatives here for fiscal comparisons, but how on earth do we spend the type of money we do on weaponry in the name of keeping the American people safe, yet we have only a fraction of the stockpile of cheap N95s masks in place necessary to fight a flu-like pandemic while having no way to make up for the difference in the short term? We can prepare for World War III in every way conceivable, but we can’t stock some throw-away masks to ensure that our entire healthcare system doesn’t implode during a pandemic that has been long considered as just a matter of time . This is so astonishingly near-sighted it seems criminal. In doing what I do for a living, I see so much government waste and financial abuse it can get very discouraging at times, but this may be the worst example of absolutely broken fiscal priorities I have ever seen, and it could cost you your life . If we run out of N95 masks, our healthcare workers will be relegated to a potential death sentence in order to execute their jobs. Beyond their own risk, this would mean that a vast portion of all healthcare workers that are directly exposed to the virus will be knocked off active duty temporarily, and likely most around the time when the masks run out. Not only that, but those sick caregivers themselves will also end up taxing the healthcare system even more than it already is, and in a state with even less capacity to meet those demands than it had before. Does this sound like a looming disaster on top of a disaster? It is. The writing is already on the wall. The Vice President of the United States and the head of the Pandemic task force on coronavirus, Mike Pence, is now asking any industries that use N95 masks to protect their own workers to donate them to Hospitals . All new production had been diverted to the healthcare system and the federal government. Doctors I have talked to say that rationing medical supplies, in particular N95 respirators, has already begun and there is grave uncertainty around the state of the supply as the pandemic picks up steam. Some hospitals have already requested additional supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile. What some have received , even at this early stage in the crisis, are fewer masks than requested, many of which are actually expired. This is happening in the richest country on earth, one with supposedly the best medical system in the world, and before the pandemic balloons in scope. Maplewood, MN March 5: Dr. Deborah Birx, Ambassador and White House Coronavirus response coordinator held a 3M N95 mask. Vice president Mike Pence visited 3M World Headquarters in Maplewood, Minnesota, meeting with 3M leaders and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to coordinate the response to the COVID-19 virus., Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune via Getty Images So, how did this happen? Well, what’s clear is that the federal government released 85 million N95 respirators out of its strategic stash along with other staple medical items, like gloves and gowns, to deal with the H1N1 outbreak in the late 2000s. The N95 reserve in the National Strategic Stockpile was not replenished . This lack of action occurred even as alarms were sounding that a horrific pandemic could hit at any time. Only so many could be bought a year with the stockpile’s roughly $600 million annual budget, which many have decried as chronically underfunded to an absurd degree. In all, the reserve is worth just around $7 billion. Although not as egregious, a similar situation is happening with ventilators, critical life-saving breathing equipment used to save patients’ lives with this type of lower respiratory infection. There are about 200,000 of these machines active, in reserve, or retired and in mothballs in the United States. Realistically, the number is far lower due to issues with older units that may not be able to be reconstituted. At the same time, the demand for these units could reach nearly a million units as the pandemic peaks. These are not cheap N95 masks, they are expensive machines costing thousands of dollars each. Still, hasn’t there been a massive push by the government to produce and purchase as many as possible in as short a time as possible and train more staff on how to use them? Without these machines, doctors and nurses could be faced with similar horrific circumstances as what is being experienced in Italy, where patients with the best chance at living are given critical resources and the others are left to die. New ventilators at an Italian hospital fighting the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. , Photo by Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images Considering we will go into the jaws of hell to rescue a single American being held overseas against their will, it is odd that we are not doing everything possible, and have not been doing everything possible for weeks, to bring as many of these units and technicians to work them online as fast as possible. Why is an American life far more pressing of an issue where a dramatic military operation or negotiation is required than when one is dying on a medical bed without a piece of technology that can save their life? Of course, more resources can be focused on one person when many others are also not in need of help and it may be impossible to be able to satiate the demand for that many respirators in the near or even not so near term, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try? Every minute has been critical for weeks, yet movement on this issue remains abysmally slow . Meanwhile, other countries are putting in huge orders that will make it harder for the U.S. to receive additional units and parts to sustain them. Although they are costly, each ventilator costs roughly the price of a single Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guided bomb kit, they can be used repeatedly as the pandemic progresses. How is it that when U.S. bomb stocks get low we move to replenish them, but we take many weeks to spool of ventilator procurement during a crisis the likes of which we have never seen? How can we prepare and arm ourselves so completely for wars that may never come, but we are so ill-prepared for one that we knew was more likely around the corner than not? Maybe it’s the nature of the enemy. It’s easier to wrap your mind around a foe that has a body, a following, political aims, and threatening capabilities than something you cannot see that can’t be killed with bullet or bomb and can’t be tracked from 20,000 feet in the sky in some dangerous land. But that is no excuse for government and elected officials to have literally blown off the most basic and obvious necessity that will allow healthcare workers to even attempt to combat the enemy. It is a horrific mistake of historic proportions that could have the direst consequences in the weeks and months to come. N95s were consumer products you could grab at any hardware or medical supply store, now they are non-existent in the retail environment with supplied being diverted to the federal government. , Photo by Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto via Getty Images We had every warning: H1N1, MERS, Swine Flu, and Ebola, and that was just in roughly the last decade or so. It wasn’t debated if a pandemic was coming , it was just the question of when . Yet the American people will be potentially subject to a ‘respirator gap’ that could kill far more Americans than the events of 9/11 or even an attack far more deadly by an enemy actor. We need to understand how this horrible oversight occurred and those who are responsible for it, on all levels, must be held accountable for their decisions or their inaction. If nothing else, this is the most glaring reminder of just how screwed up the American government’s priorities are when it comes to “protecting the folks.” How we could have gotten to a point where the Pentagon loses far more money than it would cost to have these medical necessities on hand? It screams of a government and a society that has lost its sense of reality. It also points to a military-industrial complex that has brainwashed or bought those in power to such a degree that the protection the American people are given for their tax dollar is almost entirely against threats that go boom, regardless of the massive scale of harm that could be done by far less glamorous enemies of microscopic nature. Just ask yourself, which would you rather have right now as an American citizen: $1.75 billion worth of weapons or some non-essential pork or an ample supply of N95 respirators for the soldiers on the front line of a medical war that could be deadlier and more economically damaging than any conflict we have seen in the better part of a century? Sadly, the powers that be in Washington D.C. never asked themselves that question or just didn’t care. Now it’s too late.

From the pictures provided, the vehicle, which has 31,000 miles on it, is very clearly one of a number of these vans that the White House Communications Agency acquired in the early 1990s to act as “Roadrunners.” This the term the U.S. Secret Service uses to describe vehicles that provide essential command, control, and communications support when the President of the United States and their entourage is on the move . The seller does not say how or where they acquired the van, but they say they are the first civilian owner. The present asking price is $31,000 and they’re only accepting cash offers. A front via of the former E350 Roadrunner up for sale now on Craigslist., via Craigslist Here is how the seller describes the features of the vehicle, which they say “cost in excess of $100,000 to build”: “’94 Ford E350, V8 460 7.5L, AC, low original miles on a government well maintained engine. It was often transported from location to location via plane, train or semi; hence, the low miles and minimal wear and tear. Runs great! Has power locks, power windows, practically new tires, rotating captain’s chairs, carpeted panels line the interior (easy to remove for access to wiring), vented compartment for camping toilet (used to house a secondary AC unit), new custom molded carpet ready to install in front driver/passenger area and tow hitch. No cancer rust.” “Special extras: Generator under the hood, bank of 4 power storage batteries in outside compartment (behind the drivers door), additional 7000 kw generator in sealed compartment in the back, industrial plugs for power in and out of the vehicle, numerous power inverters and distributors, drum brakes, heavy duty anti-sway chassis, unique diamond plate running boards (for the Secret Service to ride on).” “Vehicle was decommissioned, save for a few lights and sirens. Satellite hook up remains as well as control panel of switches and monitors for the power and antennas. Included is the largest antenna that mounts on the brace on the back driver’s side.” The White House Communications Agency, which is a U.S. military unit within the White House, and U.S. Secret Service first began fielding mobile command posts to support the President back in the 1970s . However, these were limited in a number and many were primarily intended to provide additional communications support during overseas trips rather than provided dedicated support to motorcades. Many of the vehicles were leased or rented, as well.

A Chevy Suburban-based Roadrunner., Paul Carter A new 4×4, six-door design based on the Ford F350 Super Duty emerged at that time , something The War Zone was among the first to report on , and these trucks have seen increasingly regular use since then.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold in the U.S. and around the world, one of the first signs of how such a pandemic can impact critical services has reared its ugly head at Chicago’s bustling Midway Airport. A ground stop was called after three technicians that work in the tower tested positive for the virus. The tower was cleared as per the CDC’s recommendations and operations are set to resume, but at a reduced capacity using different air traffic handling procedures directed through a remote facility. Midway Airport supports roughly 680 flight operations per day, so the result of the closure and reduction in throughput will be felt. The highly infectious nature of the virus means that even critical support and infrastructure operations could feel its impact as time goes on. Everything from electricity to sewage takes constant labor to remain operational. The military is facing similar challenges , albeit to an even more pressing degree in terms of its personnel’s health, as service people often work together in very tight conditions, such as those in armored vehicles, command and control and missile alert facilities, ships and submarines, and aircraft. Even individuals that are not traditionally confined to the inside of a vehicle, but have to work closely together, such as infantry, are also vulnerable to this type of outbreak, which could drastically reduce the military’s readiness if it were to accelerate out of control. More cases of COVID-19 are emerging in the military as a whole, with new cases appearing on the Littoral Combat Ship USS Coronado earlier today. The Defense Department is assessing the risk to its service people, employees, and contractors in this regard, but at a certain point, the tradeoffs between risk mitigation and operational readiness will be unavoidable. We will update this post with more information as it comes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 24, 2021",Private Aggressor F-5 Fighter Force Is Flying With Helmet Mounted Displays,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tactical Air Support Inc. (Tactical Air), the Reno-based adversary support contractor that won a big Navy contract to augment training operations at nearby Naval Air Station Fallon, the home of Topgun, is now fulfilling that contract with its heavily enhanced F-5ATs. The aircraft are being overhauled from the ground-up for the adversary mission and morphing into the most advanced F-5s ever devised. The War Zone has learned that these enhancements now include the addition of a full-color helmet-mounted display that gives Tactical Air aggressor pilots unique and highly valuable capabilities, especially when paired with the jet’s plethora of other upgrades. To our knowledge, this is a first for the rapidly expanding contractor adversary support industry. The existence of the private aggressors utilizing helmet-mounted displays came to my attention when aviation photographer Christopher McGreevy posted some recent shots of flying operations at NAS Fallon. I noticed that the pilots were going about their high-octane trade with some unique headwear. I subsequently reached out to Tactical Air’s Mick Guthals, Senior Manager of Business Development with the firm, who provided a full rundown on this industry-leading capability and some of the other new bells and whistles on the company’s F-5ATs that he wasn’t able to disclose last time we talked, but could now. Christopher McGreevy Christopher McGreevy The F-5AT is equipped with the Scorpion HMD, one of the most capable and versatile in the world. Scorpion is used by a wide variety of aircraft, including A-10 Warthogs, F-16s, AC-130s, H-60s, and more. The F-22 was slated to receive Scorpion , as well, although that still hasn’t come to pass. The system uses a monocle over the right eye instead of a visor projection concept that is used in other systems. This provides a series of advantages. It is easier to integrate and fit and it can be used day or night and even with night vision goggles . The system projects everything from basic flight data to weapons information, including a gun pipper for dogfighting, and sensor and data-link information in an augmented reality manner. Christopher McGreevy Guthals told The War Zone that the HMD was actually less expensive than integrating a heads-up display (HUD) , which has far less functionality. In a sense, the F-5AT is configured similarly to the F-35 , in a less advanced form, which also dropped the HUD entirely, with the HMD taking on all of its functionality and more. Scorpion can also simulate the employment helmet-mounted sight-aimed high-off-boresight air-to-air missiles that have proliferated around the globe . This is a huge plus for an aggressor aircraft as it can realistically present a critical threat to even the most maneuverable and stealthy fighters, should they wade into the short-range fighting arena. Although it is hard to spot and nimble in certain respects, the F-5’s performance is lacking when compared to 4th and 5th generation fighters. An HMD that can simulate these types of missile shots helps level that playing field. Thales The F-5AT’s Scorpion HMD also records HD video right onto the jet’s open-architecture mission computer, a feature that is a huge leap in capability and is an invaluable tool to wield during the debriefing of the F-5AT’s fleet opponents. The video the helmet records is something akin to what the pilot is seeing through their own eyes, not just what is being viewed through a HUD at the front of the cockpit. The Scorpion HMD is just one facet of what is turning out to be one potent and efficient aggressor jet. The six fully configured F-5ATs Tactical Air now has on strength also sport the multi-mode Nemesis pulse-doppler radar from Duotech. This system takes up the majority of the jet’s nose, with the guns having been removed. The radar is designed specifically for the adversary mission and is fully fused with the aircraft’s Garmin 3000 avionics suite. Nemesis is superior in range to the AN/APG-66 radar that is found in a competitor’s A-4s and in older F-16s, some of which are going to be joining the private aggressor industry, and has the ability to simulate various enemy radars and missile systems. It is also designed for extreme reliability and has the potential to have its mechanically scanned array (MESA) antenna to be converted to a more capable active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna in the future. Duotech Duotech is also supplying the radar warning receiver suite for the F-5AT, which provides a high degree of passive situational awareness. The system, dubbed Argus , can be easily integrated onto certain aircraft, like the F-5, using existing apertures and has 360 degree, wideband threat detection capability. Duotech The jets are also set to receive a proprietary data-link that will allow them to share information freely among themselves, including targeting and weapons data, and it will support secure communications. This could be extremely useful if an AESA radar gets installed in some of the company’s F-5ATs. With the data-link, just one jet equipped with a more advanced radar could share all its information with other F-5ATs, making it a big force multiplier. Currently, the air combat maneuvering instrumentation (ACMI) pod the F-5ATs carry, the Cubic’s P5 model , offers limited aircraft-to-aircraft data-link capabilities, including the sharing of position data, which is highly useful for the aggressor role. These features are in addition to the airframes being overhauled by Northrop Grumman and the Garmin 3000 large panel display glass cockpit being installed, as well as hands-on throttle and stick controls, and other enhancements. The Garmin 3000 fighter cockpit concept (left) the F-5AT’s actual cockpit (right)., Garmin/Tactical Air The software that runs on the Garmin system and handles data-fusion and tactical information was also developed specifically for the aggressor mission. It’s called Venom and comes from L3Harris. In a press release , L3Harris described Venom as such: “Venom integrates the latest air-to-air capabilities using commercial off-the-shelf components, providing pilots’ desired look, feel and operation in the cockpit. The suite enables third-generation platforms to operate as a fifth-generation platform, and more realistically emulate modern adversaries. The Venom suite continues L3Harris’ work in adversary mission systems by integrating a high-resolution tactical situation display, presenting radar and datalink track information, threats, system status and weapons engagement information with the Garmin® G3000™ Integrated Flight Deck touch controller and bezel key interfaces. This provides pilots an intuitive, cutting-edge capability for performing adversary training missions. Scaleable, reconfigurable and adaptable, Venom enables platforms to maintain relevance by easily and affordably incorporating new or desired adversary capabilities.” Venom running on the Garmin 3000 larger area display found in the F-5AT’s drastically updated cockpit. , L3Harris Guthals noted just how reliable the F-5AT configuration is. Four jets now operating out of Fallon accomplished three sorties each on a single day last week. That’s impressive reliability by today’s tactical fast jet standards. Clearly, the Navy has taken notice as to what Tactical Air has accomplished with the F-5AT conversion and is looking at doing something very similar to its own comparatively antiquated F-5Ns, of which the service is buying more second-hand from Switzerland. Tactical Air is actually helping to manage that upgrade program for the Navy, so it is very likely that a similar, if not nearly identical configuration will eventually find its way into the Navy two F-5 equipped aggressor squadrons—VFC-13 and VFC-111—and the Marine’s single F-5 aggressor unit—VMFT-401. Christopher McGreevy As for the longevity of Tactical Air’s ‘super Tiger IIs’ of sorts, they came from surplus Jordanian stocks and apparently had very low flight time to begin with, with around 2,000 hours on each of them. Guthals notes that the F-5s are good for roughly 7,000 hours as originally designed and can go significantly beyond that with a service life extension. All told, it is fairly remarkably what Tactical Air has achieved with its F-5TA initiative. The little planes pack an incredible amount of current-day tech that is specifically designed for aggressor operations, not repurposed from combat applications, into highly reliable, proven, efficient, and enduring design. The Navy also gets to take advantage of its development work by upgrading its own F-5s, which remain the backbone of the Navy and Marine Corps’ aggressor force. The Navy passed over another aggressor company that proposed using the F-16 platform for the NAS Fallon contract due to Tactical Air’s efficient plan. Time will tell just how good of a decision that was, but as it sits now, Navy pilots are facing an enhanced F-5 adversary that is better adapted to the aggressor mission than ever before and Air Force pilots are likely to be slugging it out with the F-5AT soon, as well.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 15, 2019",Warning To Iran: AC-130W Gunship Practices Slaying Boats With U.S. Navy In The Persian Gulf,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force AC-130W Stinger II gunship recently conducted a first-of-its-kind training exercise in the Persian Gulf with U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and Cyclone class patrol boats . These assets working together could provide a formidable means of defeating swarms of small boats, such as the ones that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates in significant numbers . The exercise came just days before Iranian-backed militias killed two U.S. troops and a British servicemember, and wounded more, in a rocket attack that has led to retaliatory American airstrikes and a spike in tensions in the region. The exercise took place between Mar. 8 and 9, 2020, but the Navy’s top command in the Middle East only publicly announced that it had occurred on Mar. 15. It’s not clear how many AC-130Ws, P-8As, and Cyclones took part in total, but video and images Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) subsequently released show at least one Stinger II gunship and three of the patrol boats, including the USS Monsoon . “Our surface forces integrating with aircraft that have the firepower of an AC-130W brings a capability to the joint force that profoundly enhances our lethality in the maritime environment,” U.S. Navy Captain Peter Mirisola, head of Destroyer Squadron 50 (DESRON 50) and also presently commander of Combined Task Force 55 (CTF-55), NAVCENT’s main surface warfare task force , said in a statement . “The addition of the gunship to the joint maritime battle significantly enhances our ability to detect, track, engage and defeat surface threats in order to control water space in the Arabian Gulf.” During the exercise, at least one P-8A performed long-range maritime surveillance mission, while the Cyclones patrolled below. The maritime patrol aircraft and patrol boats then directed the AC-130W to strike a number of mock targets, including “ killer tomato ” floating target balloons, which ships typically use for gunnery practice. The approximately 330-ton displacement Cyclones are already a capable tool for engaging small hostile boats. Each one is armed with two 25mm automatic cannons and a variety of smaller machine guns and automatic grenade launchers. These patrol boats also now have two four-round launchers capable of firing AGM-176 Griffins , small precision-guided missiles capable of hitting moving targets. USS Monsoon and two other Cyclone class patrol boats take part in the recent exercise., USN The AC-130W has its own 30mm automatic cannon and 105mm howitzer , as well as the ability to employ various precision-guided bombs and missiles, including Griffins. Stinger II gunships, or the Air Force’s newer and similarly equipped AC-130J Ghostriders , would offer any group of U.S. forces engaging swarms of small boats the benefit of additional platforms relatively large magazine depth, both with regards to the guns and precision munitions, and the ability to loiter over a particular littoral area. A Block 10 AC-130W. The latest Block 20 configuration includes the addition of the 105mm howitzer., USAF The gunships also have an array of different sensors, including two different turrets equipped with both electro-optical and infrared video cameras, allowing them to spot and engage targets day or night, as well as in bad weather. There was heavy overcast during the recent exercise, highlighting the value of these capabilities. A sequence of captures from the feed from an infrared camera as the AC-130W Stinger II engages a “killer tomato” with its guns during the recent exercise in the Persian Gulf., USN The gunships could also potentially be more flexible than surface ships in responding to the sudden emergence of new groups of maritime threats that other assets, such as a P-8A, might detect approaching from different vectors. At present, the Poseidons lack any means of engaging small boat swarms themselves, though that is set to change in the future. This is, of course, not the first time the Navy has worked together with aerial assets from other services, including both special operations and conventional units, to counter the threat of small boats, including from Iran specifically, in both operational and training contexts. Famously, during the Tanker War sideshow to the Iran-Iraq war in the late 1980s, MH-6 and AH-6 Little Bird helicopters from the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, and later, OH-58D Kiowa Warriors from conventional units, flew from Navy surface ships, as well as sea bases , in the Persian Gulf, to engage various Iranian threats. These included small boats and ships engaged in naval mining operations , something that remains a major potential danger today as the regime in Tehran routinely threatens to blockade the strategic Strait of Hormuz that links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the rest of the world. Air Force A-10 Warthog attack aircraft regularly train to support maritime operations, as well. Last year, as the War Zone was first to report , photos also emerged showing some of that service’s F-15E Strike Eagles conducting operational patrols over the Persian Gulf carrying cluster munitions, weapons well suited to engaging small boat swarms. F-15E Strike Eagles, one of of which, at least, at left, is seen carrying cluster munitions, among other weapons, refuel near the Persian Gulf during a maritime patrol last year., USAF “We’ve effectively employed similar joint capabilities in the past to counter belligerent forces that attempt to disrupt or hinder the free flow of commerce and freedom of navigation in this region using force, or attack U.S., coalition, or partner forces in a conflict,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jim Malloy, head of Naval Forces Central Command, said in a statement regarding the recent exercise. “We will continue to work across component commands and coalition partners to further improve the lethality of our forces through our ability to simultaneously engage a multitude of threats in the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and adjacent waters.” This particular training event came just days before Iranian-backed militias carried out a rocket attack on Taji Air Base in Iraq that killed two U.S. troops and a British servicemember, and wounded 18 more individuals, including U.S. and coalition personnel and civilians. More American forces and other personnel at Taji were wounded in another rocket attack on Mar. 14, which followed U.S. retaliatory airstrikes on various Iranian-linked targets within Iraq. All of this has increased tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as Iran’s regional proxies. Another fatal rocket attack in December 2019 set a chain of events in motion that included the U.S. decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, which in turn prompted unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes aimed at American forces in Iraq. Tensions between the United States and Iran have been heightened for months now, in general, over a wide array of other incidents, including suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the Iranian shootdown of a Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman last year. The potential threat that Iran’s small boat swarms pose to American warships has been ever-present, as well. Some of Iran’s regional proxies also employ small watercraft, including as unmanned suicide boats laden with explosives. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have reportedly stepped up attacks using drone boats, as well as improvised naval mines , in the Red Sea in recent months. A screen-grab a video that Saudi Arabian authorities released showing a newer type of unmanned suicide boat, which mimics the look of a civilian fishing skiff, that the Houthis have reportedly been using in the Red Sea in recent months., Government of Saudi Arabia In December 2019, the Navy also confirmed to The War Zone that a number of Iranian boats had sailed remarkably close to the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships from her strike group as they transited the Strait of Hormuz that month. There had also been a string of attacks on commercial oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman last year, some of which involved limpet mines that teams in small boats placed on the sides of those ships. Iran has also employed its fleets of small boats as part of operations to seize foreign commercial ships . The situation in the region is likely to remain precarious for the foreseeable future. The U.S. military has now demonstrated its ability to call in AC-130W gunships to help other air and naval assets respond to any new maritime incidents in the future, which should serve as a potent deterrent.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 31, 2020",The Military Can Reinforce The Postal System If COVID-19 Causes Delivery Disruptions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The serious danger that the COVID-19 novel coronavirus poses in the United States and the major impacts it will have on everyday life, in both the near and long terms, are becoming more and more apparent every day. As federal, state, and local government responses become more expansive, there have been growing questions about what role the U.S. military might have in the coming weeks and months. The U.S. military certainly has valuable medical resources available, both in terms of providing immediate care and conducting research toward vaccines and other treatments, and certain State National Guards elements have deployed to help disinfect municipal facilities and otherwise assist with localized quarantines. However, the military’s standing contingency plans for how it would go about augmenting the U.S. Postal Service could be one the most obscure and useful things at its disposal and speaks to the immense logistical capabilities that it possesses that could be brought to bear, if required. This could be extremely valuable, if not outright critical if disruptions in various supply chains become severe or if there is a need to transport and distribute large amounts of supplies rapidly into quarantine zones. The U.S. military is prepared to act “in the event of a postal work-stoppage and the disruption of mail service on a national, regional, or local basis,” according to the 2006 version of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) Contingency Plan (CONPLAN) 2501 , which covered all aspects of what is known formally as Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). “The DOD [Department of Defense] may provide DSCA in support of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to safeguard, process, and deliver mail in those areas affected.” US Army personnel in Poland scan a US Postal Service Priority Mail package. During a disruption of mail service in the United States, US troops could be deployed to help get the mail delivered at home., USPS In 2008, NORTHCOM replaced CONPLAN 2501 with CONPLAN 3501 , which also covering DSCA activities and continued to include plans for “Postal Augmentation.” As of 2012, this specific iteration of the plan was still in use, but it is unclear if it has been updated since then. U.S. military commands often review and update standing contingency plans, as necessary. At least as of 2006, the concept of operations for augmenting USPS operations involved providing military personnel to sort mail and transport it between processing facilities, to include those at airports and railheads, as well as to lockboxes for delivery. The chain of custody for mail, the tampering of which is a federal offense, is heavily regulated, so troops would not be tasked with conducting home deliveries. However, they could collect and deliver mail to governmental and commercial addresses and staff customer service counters in post offices. Service members could also be called upon to maintain postal vehicles. The aims of all of these tasks are to reduce the strain on available USPS resources. CONPLAN 2501 and 3501 both outline a nation-wide response. “All major DOD bases and installations … should be prepared to provide a basic Force Package Option of 100 soldiers,” according to the 2006 plan. Despite the use of the term “soldiers,” all services would be required to be on call to provide personnel. These augmentees would not necessarily have to come from existing Military Postal Service (MPS) elements, though Military Post Offices could assist by providing additional mail processing capacity. Task force headquarters would manage military Postal Augmentation operations in large cities, as necessary. Service members would receive orientation and a crash course in their assigned tasks from USPS personnel upon arriving at their assigned locations. A flowchart from NORTHCOM CONPLAN 2501 showing the sequence of events by which the US military would become involved in domestic postal operations., NORTHCOM The original impetus for this contingency plan was the 1970 postal workers’ strike, which crippled America’s postal system and had numerous second-order effects. Most notably, at the time, stock market trading was heavily dependent on physical mail and there were concerns it would have to shut down entirely. In response, then-President Richard Nixon declared a national emergency and mobilized 24,000 active duty, reserve, and National Guard troops as part of Operation Graphic Hand . The strike thankfully lasted only eight days. Afterward, the U.S. military retained the Graphic Hand operational plans in case they became necessary again. They were eventually subsumed into the larger Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) planning. Members of the US military supporting Operation Graphic Hand sort mail during the 1970 postal workers’ strike., National Postal Museum The Postal Augmentation plan has evolved significantly since 1970 to take into account other potential mail disruptions beyond something like a strike. Both the 2006 edition of CONPLAN 2501 and the 2008 iteration of CONPLAN 3501 notes that military personnel would be required to help “develop and implement procedures to screen, identify, and handle suspected contaminated mail” and “develop and publish emergency action procedures in the event a package is suspected of being contaminated.” Both of these plans were notably issued in the years after the 2001 Anthrax attacks , which involved letters laced with that bacteria and killed five people, including two postal workers. It took years and cost millions of dollars to fully decontaminate two postal facilities that the letters passed through. The portions of NORTHCOM CONPLAN 3501 dealing with issues relating to potential contamination of mail. The previous CONPLAN 2501 has the exact same language., NORTHCOM All of this is relevant to the situation the United States is facing with regards to COVID-19, including contamination concerns. Though much about the virus remains unknown at this stage, initial studies have indicated that it can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days. While the stock market, which has been rocked already by COVID-19 concerns, may not be as threatened by mail disruptions as it was in 1970, many people still rely heavily on the USPS, including for the delivery of vital prescription medicines . The United States, overall, is very much a “mail-order” – and now E-commerce – society that has become accustomed to goods arriving at people’s doors in relatively short amounts of time on demand. Beyond these more mundane activities, the USPS may also have more elaborate functions as part of continuity of government operations, which entail various plans to ensure that the U.S. government keeps on running in the event of any kind of major crisis, from nuclear war to a pandemic. This could add additional emphasis to ensuring that the postal system remains functional. You can read more about U.S. continuity of government planning in this past War Zone piece. Regardless, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal, state, and local authorities increasingly encourage people to stay at home as much as they can, and amid talk of more aggressively enforced quarantines , delivery services of all kinds will see increased use and the strains that come with that. USPS already has deals to provide so-called “last mile” service for deliveries from some private companies, such as Amazon and FedEx, which will further add to its workload. With the likelihood that some number of postal workers will contract the virus for any number of reasons and will be unable to work, especially in instances where the symptoms are especially severe, ensuring that steadily more important delivery services continue as scheduled will only become more important. It’s true that the USPS has scaled back its “last mile” activities in recent years as companies have looked to provide more of that capacity themselves. Still, those arrangements reflect the immense existing infrastructure and reach of the postal service, which is available to deliver items to the vast majority residential, commercial, and governmental addresses nationwide. A USPS graphic from a 2016 presentation showing the myriad options for delivering items to customers across the “last mile.”, USPS This raises the possibility of whether, with appropriate authorizations, the U.S. military might be able to help the USPS expand its role during this new national crisis to include deliveries beyond mail, such as food and other supplies, especially if certain cities or other designated areas find themselves under a more stringent lockdown . The National Guard in a number of states has mobilized small continents to help with quarantine related activities , but these personnel, and those in the other reserve components of the various services, may be limited in what they can reasonably be expected to do. “If you mobilize the Guard and Reserve medical personnel from their civilian jobs … that directly impacts the community where they work,” U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff Surgeon for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, said at a press briefing on Mar. 16, 2020. “That’s the trade off.” The logistical capacity of the U.S. military, especially in the active component, from cargo aircraft to tactical trucks, might be a more readily utilized resource to augment services, such as the Postal Service, to help reduce strains elsewhere in various civilian and commercial supply chains, as well as military ones . With established relationships between USPS and private companies, such as Amazon, and networks of gig-economy workers already steadily more integrated into various supply systems, there is also the potential for cooperation in delivery services at various levels, in general. It remains to be seen just how severely COVID-19 will impact daily life in the United States, but the consensus from experts seems to be increasingly that the worst is unfortunately still yet to come. As time goes on, depending on how serious the state of affairs in the United States becomes, the U.S. military may be called upon to perform a variety of different functions. One of the most important roles American troops may fill in the end is propping up and leveraging existing delivery infrastructure, such as the USPS, to provide aid to average communities that may find themselves increasingly in need of critical supplies.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 15 years of operations, the F-22 remains the biggest dog on the air-to-air combat block. One of the many tricks up the Raptor’s sleeve is super-maneuverability, which is a result of its high thrust-to-weight ratio, massive control surfaces, fly-by-wire flight control system, and it’s two-dimensional thrust vectoring capability. These features combined allow the F-22 to perform incredibly throughout its huge envelope—from flying upwards of 60,000 feet in thin air to rocking and rolling and doing incredible backflips down in the far thicker air. An amazingly well-shot video of an F-22 Demonstration Team jet in action showcases the latter like never before. The video’s high frame rate and incredibly stable tracking allow us to visually consume all of the tiny details that make these maneuvers possible. In particular, the quick-fluttering movements of the jet’s massive computer-controlled control surfaces and its tilting thrust vectoring exhausts. Check it out: While the F-22 is amazingly nimble, Russia’s three-dimensional thrust vectoring-equipped fighter aircraft, especially Su-35, takes super-maneuverability to a whole other level.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",F-15E Strike Eagle Spotted Flying With An Inert B61-12 Nuclear Bomb Out Of Nellis AFB,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Exercise Red Flag is underway with the U.S. and some of its tightest allies fighting a mock air war over the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) in southern Nevada. Either in conjunction with the exercise or independent of it, there is a lot of testing currently going on over the same area. Case in point, this test F-15E Strike Eagle assigned to Eglin Air Force Base carrying an inert version of America’s newest variant of its long-running B61 series of nuclear bombs, the precision-guided B61-12. The jet was snapped by aviation photographer Kris Trajano on Tuesday, March 10th, 2020. The F-15E was followed by a pair of F-16s that were landing just before the first Red Flag launch of the day. It isn’t uncommon for various test, training, and tactics development missions to be executed in the space between the two daily Red Flag mass launches and recoveries. Still, it is interesting to see the B61-12 hanging on an F-15E coming into Nellis. Much of the test and evaluation work for the USAF’s nuclear weapons delivery systems occurs on the Tonopah Test Range in the northern reaches of the NTTR. Nearby Tonopah Test Range Airport also supports those activities under certain circumstances. It isn’t clear why the F-15E is carrying the weapon into Nellis. It appears to be a full-up guided round, but an inert one that lacks a nuclear warhead for testing purposes. The aircraft could be set to run another drop test on the Tonopah Test Range, or it’s possible, but less likely, that deployment of the weapon could be folded into an upcoming Red Flag mission. America’s NATO allies Germany, Italy, and Spain are the only foreign players taking part in this Red Flag, so an operational test of the weapon that will be the lynchpin of the Alliance’s nuclear deterrent in Europe would make some sense, especially this late in its development. It’s not unheard of for B61 deployment tactics development and training to occur out of Nellis, either. Kris Trajano As for the B61-12 program, which is seen as an essential upgrade to the Air Force’s only tactical nuclear gravity bomb, it has been mired in cost overruns and other issues . All said, the bombs will be worth over twice their weight in gold, literally , once they are operational. The F-15E, along with the F-16 and B-2, are the Air Force’s delivery systems for this weapon. The Air Force’s F-35As will acquire this capability in the future, as well. The 412th Test Wing at Edwards noted that it “advanced strategic capabilities [for the F-35] like Dual-Capable Aircraft” in a round-up of its accomplishments during 2019. “Dual-capable” in this context refers to the ability to carry both conventional and nuclear weapons. In 2017, Military.com had reported that the B61-12 might be integrated into the F-35A as early as 2020, but when The War Zone reached out to the 412th Test Wing for an update earlier this year, the unit’s public affairs office said it could not “provide a response at this time due to operational security reasons.” The updated B61-12’s ability to make precision strikes greatly increases its versatility, regardless of the plane carrying it, and the ways in which it could be employed during an actual nuclear strike . You can read all about the weapon and its developmental state here and here . Once the B61-12 is fully operational, it will be forward-deployed, including to Europe , where some of America’s NATO partners could be tasked with delivering a portion of the weapons during an all-out conflict. Inert B61-12 on an F-15E. , USAF Clearly, some form of advanced B61-12 testing is underway out of Nellis. Hopefully, this will involve ironing out some of the weapon’s kinks so that it can be made operational. Regardless, it’s always interesting seeing a tactical fighter carrying a weapon type that is intended to be far more destructive than anything else in the jet’s air-to-ground arsenal. It’s fascinating just how much destructive power can be packed inside the B61’s svelte, 700-pound frame. The B61-12 has a so-called “dial-a-yield” warhead with various settings, the highest of which is a 50 kiloton yield. This is a little over twice the power of the Fat Man bomb, a substantially larger weapon overall, which the United States dropped on Nagasaki at the end of World War II.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 21, 2021",Space Force Just Received Its First New Offensive Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Space Force has begun operating a new offensive weapon system, an upgraded version of a ground-based satellite communications jamming system, for the first time in its short history. The first iteration of the Counter Communications System entered U.S. Air Force service in 2004 and the program has now gotten transferred to the newest branch of the American military. The Space Force declared it had reached initial operational capability with the Counter Communications System Block 10.2 , or CCS B10.2, on Mar. 9. The Harris Corporation, which merged with L3 Technologies last year to form L3Harris Technologies, had received the contract from the Air Force to develop this upgraded variant of the system in 2014. The National Defense Authorization Act for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed in December 2019, officially established Space Force as a separate service within the Department of the Air Force. Units and assets previously assigned to Air Force Space Command now form the core of the new service, which is still very much in the process of standing up. “CCS is the only offensive system in the United States Space Force arsenal,” Lieutenant Colonel Steve Brogan, the Combat Systems branch materiel leader within the Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center’s (SMC) Special Programs Directorate, said in an official news piece about the system in January 2020. “This upgrade puts the ‘force’ in Space Force and is critical for Space as a warfighting domain.” The Air Force introduced CCS in 2004 and fielded the Block 10.1 upgrade in 2014. Last year, Harris also received a $72 million contract to begin developing the new iteration, the Block 10.3 variant. As of September 2019, the Air Force reportedly had at least seven complete CCS packages, which are intended to be rapidly deployable. “CCS has had incremental upgrades since the early 2000’s, which have incorporated new techniques, frequency bands, technology refreshes, and lessons learned from previous block upgrades,” Major Seth Horner, the CCS B10.2 Program Manager, also said in January . “This specific upgrade includes new software capabilities to counter new adversary targets and threats.” The various versions of the system all include a number of trailer-mounted dishes and associated equipment. Details on exactly how the CCS functions are limited, but it is understood to be a jamming system that disrupts transmissions from enemy communications satellites. This could give U.S. forces valuable advantages on the battlefield by disrupting the ability of enemy units to rapidly communicate and share information using satellite-based systems. A Defense Intelligence Agency graphic depicting the generic concept of ground-based satellite jamming., DIA The Air Force has described the effects as “ reversible ” in the past, meaning that when the jammer shuts off, the target satellite would go back to functioning are normal. The service had specifically chosen a non-kinetic anti-satellite weapon in order to avoid having to physically destroy hostile assets in space, which would create debris that could pose risks to friendly systems in orbit. This is notably different from Russian and Chinese anti-satellite efforts, among others , which include ground-based and air-launched kinetic interceptors , as well as possible dual-use “ killer satellites .” There are also reports that both countries are working on ground-based anti-satellite directed energy weapons. “We are not going down that path,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, then-head of Air Force Space Command, told lawmakers in 2016 , referring to the development of capabilities that would totally destroy enemy satellites and create debris. Hyten is now Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hyten’s comments would not necessarily preclude the development of offensive space capabilities that could create non-reversible effects and effectively destroy a target in space without totally disintegrating it. This could still include kinetic attacks, such as using a directed energy weapon, possibly mounted on another satellite , to destroy certain components without creating any substantial amount of debris. A Defense Intelligence Agency graphic showing the basic modes by which one satellite might attack another in space., DIA Regardless, Space Force reaching initial operational capability with a new offensive weapon system for the first time is certainly a notable milestone for the still extremely young service. Beyond that, it’s also a rare public announcement regarding the development of an American anti-satellite capability of any kind. The Counter Communications System has long been the only such capability the United States publicly acknowledges having, though it is understood that it has other offensive counter-space capabilities. Space Force Vice Commander Lieutenant General David Thompson told lawmakers the new service was working on new capabilities “to protect and defend” America’s space-based assets during a hearing on Mar. 4. “We began prototyping, and demonstrating, and preparing for what I’ll call abilities to protect and defend our assets, and we did that extensively in the budget in [the 2020 Fiscal Year],” he said. “In [the 2021 Fiscal Year], we are now taking steps to extend that across the fleet, as well as look at other capabilities to be able to continue to defend those assets that we have and defend adversary use of space.” Members of the 4th Space Operations Squadron, an element of the 50th Space Wing, load a trailer-mounted Low Profile Antenna, used to support deployed satellite communications activities, on a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy airlifter during an exercise in 2018., USAF In February 2020, the Air Force mentioned another counter-space system, called Bounty Hunter, in a news story about recent tests that the 17th Test Squadron had conducted. “The 17th TS’ [Test Squadron] Operating Location-Charlie [OL-C] conducts testing on the base’s higher classification systems,” that official news item said. “Recent tests we’ve done have been on the Bounty Hunter and the Counter Communications System, which are both electronic warfare systems located at Peterson [Air Force Base],” Technical Sergeant Tricia Benson, the OL-C Flight Chief and Project Manager, said in an official interview. There was no further information on Bounty Hunter or its capabilities. In its first-ever budget request, for the 2021 Fiscal Year, Space Force asked for nearly $54.7 million in funds for research and development of “counterspace systems,” including almost $50.5 million for continued work on the CCS program and just under $2 million for upgrades to Bounty Hunter. The remaining funds would support the development of a new and improved command and control architecture for counterspace capabilities. Details about all of these projects in the publicly available budget documents were extremely limited. USAF USAF Other U.S. military officials have alluded to the still-classified capabilities recently, as well. Former Secretary of the Air Force ominously stated last year that it might be necessary to conduct a show of force using unspecified systems to deter potential adversaries, such as Russia or China, from attacking American satellites. “We have a capability called a Counter Communications System that is built to deny an adversary the use of space communications,” General Hyten had also said in an interview with CBS News’ “60 Minutes” back in 2015. “All I can say is it’s a capability that exists on the ground and it does not create debris in any way.” “The only two things you told me about the U.S. ability to fight in space, are the ability to maneuver your satellites and to jam other satellites. Is that it?” CBS News’ David Martin then asked the general. “That’s not it, but that’s all I can tell you,” Hyten responded. Ensuring the United States has the ability to conduct a conflict in space, including as part of a larger crisis on Earth, and what such a conflict might actually look like are certainly among the most pressing issues facing Space Force, something the War Zone has discussed in detail in the past. The fledgling service has now publicly acquired its first new counter-space system and it will likely take over other existing top-secret offensive space capabilities, and the development of future ones, soon, if it hasn’t already.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2020",Here’s Everything We Know About America’s Airstrikes On Iranian-Related Targets In Iraq,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s top U.S. commander for operations in the Middle East briefed reporters this morning on the American airstrikes in Iraq last night on five sites associated with Kata’ib Hizbollah, an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia. He also offered additional details on the rocket attack on Taji Air Base outside of Baghdad that killed two U.S. military personnel and one British service member earlier this week, which prompted these strikes in the first place. Here is a breakdown of the new information that U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), as well as CENTCOM’s public affairs office, has now provided on the rocket attack on Taji and the American response: McKenzie blamed the Taji rocket attack on Kata’ib Hizbollah, but would not say whether Iranian officials had ordered it. The improvised rocket launcher could have fired up to 33 rockets, but only 30 functioned properly. Of the 30 launched, only between eight and 15 rockets actually struck Taji. Unspecified radars, possibly artillery counter-battery radars, such as the AN/TPQ-53 , helped determine the point of origin of the attack. U.S. personnel are examining the launcher and the three unfired rockets to gather additional intelligence. “That vehicle may have moved around for a month … because they know we’re looking,” McKenzie noted. “Had we seen that truck, we would have taken action … they know that, as well,” he added. McKenzie said that there was evidence that Kata’ib Hizbollah had been responsible for a total of 12 rocket attacks aimed at bases where members of the U.S.-led coalition are situated in Iraq in the past six months. McKenzie stated that the United States is in “constant communication” with Iraqi authorities about these kinds of hostile rocket attacks and said there were indications that Iraqi security forces had made some effort to prevent militias from doing so. McKenzie also said that a total of 18 military personnel and civilians had also been injured in the attack, but did not specify their injuries or their assigned units or nationalities. The Pentagon had previously said that 14 members of the U.S.-led coalition had been injured. The Pentagon has identified the two U.S. servicemember who died in the rocket attack on Taji as U.S. Army Specialist Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias and U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Marshal Roberts. Specialist Covarrubias was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, part of the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. Staff Sergeant Marshal Roberts was assigned to the 219th Engineering Installation Squadron, Oklahoma Air National Guard. The United Kingdom had identified the British service member killed as Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon , a British Army reservist, yesterday. The U.S. military conducted the “precision defensive strikes” on Kata’ib Hizbollah around 1:00 AM local time in Iraq on Mar. 14. The airstrikes targeted five different sites that contained “ advanced Iranian-supplied weapons”: A target in Arab Nawar Ahmad, Babil Province, Iraq, described as a “terrorist rocket storage” location. A target in Al Musayyib, Babil Province, Iraq, described as a “terrorist weapons storage” location. A target in Jurf Al Sakhar, Babylon Province, described as an “IRM [improvised rocket-assisted munitions] storage site.” A target in Jurf Al Sakhar, Babylon Province, described as a “propellant production / ACW [advanced conventional weapon] storage” location. A target in Karbala, Karbala Province, described as an “ACW storage” location. CENTCOM CENTCOM CENTCOM All of these sites were known to U.S. forces beforehand. There are other known Kata’ib Hizbollah sites in Iraq containing Iranian-supplied weapons, including some situated in locations where there would be a much greater risk of collateral damage. Manned fighter aircraft conducted all of the strikes. McKenzie would not say what type of aircraft or munitions were employed, or where the planes launched from, but said that they all returned to base without incident afterward. “We are confident we have effectively destroyed these facilities and expect that they will no longer be able to house the type of advanced Iranian-supplied weapons that were used in the Kata’ib Hizbollah attacks at the Iraqi base at Camp Taji,” McKenzie said. CENTCOM is still assessing the full extent of the damage to the facilities, the total number of Kata’ib Hizbollah casualties, and any collateral damage, with poor weather in Iraq hampering those activities. “I have no information on any IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] general being killed or injured,” McKenzie said. There had been unconfirmed reports that a senior officer belonging to Iran’s IRGC had died in the strikes. “The strikes you see now are designed to send a clear, unambiguous signal that we will not tolerate this behavior in the future going forward,” McKenzie said. McKenzie said that the U.S. had consulted with Iraqi authorities in the wake of the Taji rocket attacks and that they were aware a response would be coming. The strikes were not directly coordinated with the Iraqi government, which claims that an Iraqi Army and Federal Police units were among those struck. “I think the threat [from Iran and its regional proxies] remains very high. I think that tensions have actually not gone down,” McKenzie said. He further described the situation in the region as an “illusion of normality.” He warned that the impact of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus in the region, especially within Iran, could exacerbate the situation. Preparations are underway to deploy Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to Iraq to protect against future higher-end missile threats, such as Iranian ballistic missile strikes. Land-based Phalanx close-in weapon systems , designed to shoot down incoming rockets, artillery shells, and mortar bombs, are also being deployed. The Phalanx systems will be used to guard the Patriot sites. “Once the Patriots come in, they become a very high-value target,” McKenzie said. The Phalanxes “can’t be everywhere at once,” he added. “If I were to put one at Taji, it would have to come from another defended location,” he continued. The U.S. Navy is now operating two Carrier Strike Groups , the Truman Carrier Strike Group and the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group, in the region as part of a posture to respond to any future aggression from Iran or its regional proxies. This is the first time since 2012 that two Carrier Strike Groups have been simultaneously forward deployed to the region. “We have the flexibility, capability, and will to respond to any threat,” McKenzie said. How the situation in Iraq, and with regards to tensions between the United States and Iran and its proxies elsewhere in the Middle East, continues to evolve remains to be seen. The Iraqi Security Media Cell, tied to the office of the country’s Prime Minister, a post that is technically vacant at present , decried the U.S. airstrikes in a series of Tweets on Mar. 14. “The argument that this attack was in response to the aggressive action that targeted the Taji camp is a flimsy pretext and leads to escalation and does not provide a solution to control the situation, but leads to escalation and deterioration of the security situation in the country and exposes everyone to more dangers and threats,” one Tweet read. “This attack is not a partnership or respect for Iraq’s sovereignty and the integrity of its land, its skies, and its citizens, and it will have consequences that will be felt by all at the greatest risk, if not controlled, and respect for the will and policies of the Iraqi state.” The U.S. government’s decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani , then head of Iran’s Quds Force, in Baghdad in January was met with similar criticism and prompted pro-Iranian politicians to demand all American troops leave the country . The strike on Soleimani had followed another fatal Kata’ib Hizbollah rocket attack aimed at U.S. personnel in Iraq, after which the United States had also struck various sites belonging to that group. With the U.S. response limited to Iraqi militias, so far, it is less likely that there will be any immediate direct response from Iran. The Iranians had launched ballistic missile strikes on American troops in Iraq following the death of Soleimani. All told, as General McKenzie said, the “threat remains very high” and the situation in Iraq remains extremely fluid.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2020",American Retaliatory Strikes Against Iranian-Backed Militias In Iraq Have Begun (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but the U.S. military is conducting airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. This comes a day after a barrage of rockets hit Taji Air Base, situated just to the northwest of Baghdad, killing two American troops and one British service member, and wounding at least a dozen more members of the U.S.-led coalition operating in that country. “I have spoken with the president,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said during a press conference earlier on Mar. 12, 2020. “He’s given me the authority to do what we need to do, consistent with his guidance.” “Let me be clear: The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests or our allies,” he added. “All options are on the table.” Esper had also blamed Iranian-backed militias, who have also been tied to months of other rocket attacks aimed at U.S. forces across Iraq, for the strikes on Taji. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley had agreed that the U.S. government had “good confidence” that it knew who was responsible. In a separate press conference, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, had declined to say conclusively that Iran or its regional proxies had carried out the attack, but said that no other groups in Iraq had the means to do so. President Donald Trump had also said earlier in the day that “it has not been fully determined” who was responsible. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close confidant of Trump’s had separately told reporters that “I think the president’s going to be very aggressive” and that “at the time of our choosing, we should hit back.” He clarified that he was calling for action only against “the people who actually launched the rockets.” The full scale and scope of the strikes, and the exact group or groups they targeted, are unknown at this time. At least some of them appear to have occurred in the vicinity of Jurf Al Sakhar, also known as Jurf Al Nasr, a city situated some 30 miles southwest of Baghdad. It’s not clear if the strikes are limited to that location, though. The strikes could lead to a new spike in tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, after something of a lull following unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes against American personnel in Iraq on Jan. 7. That was the culmination of a series of events that started with another deadly rocket attack aimed at U.S. personnel at K-1 base near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, which killed an American contractor, in December 2019. The U.S. military had quickly responded with airstrikes on Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and neighboring Syria, which then prompted members of those militias and their supporters to try to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The Trump Administration then killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani outside Baghdad International Airport. Iran’s ballistic missile strikes were in direct response to that targeted strike. Despite continued rocket attacks aimed at various bases the U.S. personnel use in Iraq, including Taji, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the situation had calmed to the point that just recently the Trump Administration had recently decided to begin withdrawing some of the reinforcements it had rushed to the region in January. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 7:35pm EST: The Pentagon has released a statement regarding the strikes, saying it hit five “weapon storage facilities” belonging to Kata’ib Hizbollah, an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq that is a member of the Iraqi government’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an official umbrella organization for ostensibly state-sanction militias. The exact locations of all of the strikes remain unclear, but another one reportedly took place in Wasit Province to the southeast of Baghdad. The United Kingdom was reportedly consulted, but did not take part in the operation. The United States also blamed Kata’ib Hizbollah for the December 2019 rocket attack on K-1. Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, then-Kata’ib Hezbollah’s leader and Deputy Chairman of the Popular Mobilization Committee, which oversees the PMF, died in the same strike that killed Qasem Soleimani in January. The attack on Taji yesterday had also come on the occasion of Soleimani’s birthday. There are also reports of a new, separate attack, possibly using mortars, on K-1. UPDATE: 8:00pm EST: Pictures have emerged online of damage to Karbala Airport, which is presently under construction, reportedly from one of the U.S. airstrikes. UPDATE: 9:05pm EST: There are reports that the U.S. military specifically targeted facilities with an eye toward reducing Kata’ib Hizbollah’s Iranian-supplied small unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities. UPDATE: 9:35pm EST: The U.K. Ministry of Defense has issued its own statement relating to the strikes, making clear that they were not involved, but supporting “the right of the United States to defend themselves.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Force Munitions Air-To-Ground"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 11, 2020",Lawmakers Grill Army Officer Over Lack Of Missile Defenses In Iraq After Fatal Rocket Attack,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of Congress and a senior U.S. Army officer had a testy exchange on Capitol Hill today over the lack of air and missile defenses in Iraq in the wake of a rocket attack that killed two American troops and one British service member at Taji Air Base yesterday. Legislators were particularly interested in why the U.S. Army has not yet deployed its recently acquired Israeli-made Iron Dome systems , which are combat-proven against exactly these types of threats. The tense discussion also came amid reports that none of the rockets fired at Taji were shot down, even though the U.S. military says it is now in the process of bringing air and missile defense systems into the country. Congressmen Doug Lamborn and John Garamendi, a Republican from Colorado and a Democrat from California, respectively, grilled U.S. Army Lieutenant General Daniel Karbler, head of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, about Iron Dome and the attack on Taji at a hearing on Mar. 12, 2020. Earlier in the day, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), had told reporters that Iranian-backed militias in Iraq were very likely responsible for firing the rockets at Taji, which also wounded at least a dozen other personnel belonging the U.S.-led coalition at the base. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has also blamed at Iran and its regional proxies. “In CENTCOM, are there opportunities to use Iron Dome, which is a proven anti-missile technology that the Israelis developed and have produced partly with our tax dollars, that we could be taking more advantage of to protect our assets and our people?” Lamborn asked Lieutenant General Karbler. The Army purchased two batteries of the Iron Dome system last year, ostensibly to acquire an interim anti-cruise missile defense system. The system consists of a number of launchers loaded with Tamir interceptors tied to air defense radars. You can more about its capabilities in detail in these past War Zone pieces . Despite Lamborn’s description of it as an “anti-missile technology,” Iron Dome was developed originally primarily to counter smaller, less complex threats, such as rockets, artillery shells, and mortar bombs, a mission set also known as C-RAM. It has been extremely successful in this role in Israel, successfully knocking down thousands of incoming threats since it entered service in 2011, according to that country’s authorities . C-RAM systems also offer a means of defense against small unmanned aircraft, which are another increasing threat to American troops across the Middle East. Lieutenant General Karbler rightly pointed out that the Army is still in the process of training personnel to operate its Iron Dome batteries and otherwise get those systems operational and that they are not yet available for deployment anywhere. He added that the service expects to have an operational capability with the systems by the end of the year. Karbler also highlighted the Army’s concern that they cannot be readily integrated into its overarching air and missile defense network architecture. On Mar. 7, U.S. Army General Mike Murray, head of Army Futures Command, had told legislators in a separate hearing, that the service was scrapping plans to buy additional Iron Dome batteries over the integration issue, as well as other concerns, such as the system’s actual ability to engage cruise missiles and possible cyber vulnerabilities. The Army had also been having difficulties in negotiations with the manufacturer Rafael over access to proprietary information about Iron Dome to better assess its capabilities and to help develop ways to slot into the service’s Integrated Battle Command System network. “Iron Dome is a standalone system, not easily integrated into what we see as our future for air and missile defense of the Integrated Battle Command System, which basically looks at any sensor, best shooter to deal with the threats that are out there,” Karbler told Representative Lamborn. “I hear what you’re saying, but I don’t want to see the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Lamborn replied. “I don’t want to see a perfect hoped for and expected capability deter us from using something that is available and usable right now and will save lives.” “Earlier today, we discussed in the earlier committee, the two lives that were lost in Iraq to Katyusha missiles,” Congressman Garamendi further interjected, incorrectly referring to the unguided 107mm rockets in question as missiles. “The Iron Dome is specifically designed for [engaging] that missile and it doesn’t have to be integrated into your grand plan.” Lieutenant General Karbler is certainly not wrong about the importance of being able to integrate any future air or missile defense system into the larger plans for the Integrated Battle Command System. Networking is absolutely key to providing a capable layered defense that can tackle various types of incoming threats across a broad area at once during a crisis or conflict. Buying systems that can’t work with the existing or future architecture risks leaving the Army, and other services, with assets it can only use in very limited or specific scenarios, which doesn’t necessarily present good value for the investment. At the same time, there is a clear and immediate need for this kind of capability in Iraq, at least. Ensuring that the system is networked together there with other U.S. air and missile defense assets would necessarily be as critical in the current context, either. The Army has already demonstrated its ability to relatively rapidly acquire Iron Dome systems even without an urgent operational requirement, too. As Congressman Lamborn noted, the U.S. government has helped finance the development of the system, as well, and has good relations with Israel, raising the possibility that authorities in that country might be able to help speed up deliveries, if asked. A member of the US Army takes part in a base defense exercise at Taji Air Base in January 2020., US Army Beyond Iron Dome, Garamendi’s comments, in particular, reflect a growing frustration on part of Congress, as well as the general public, regarding the apparent lack of defenses available to counter the immediate threat of both rockets and ballistic missiles that U.S. forces in the Middle East, especially Iraq, face right now. Rocket attacks, similar to the one aimed at Taji yesterday, have been occurring regularly at a number of bases that American troops use in that country, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, for months now. Politico has reported that no existing U.S. air defenses at Taji shot down any of the incoming rockets in this latest attack and its not even clear if there were any such systems in place at all. Exclusive satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained of Al Asad Air Base, situated to the west of Baghdad, which was a target of unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile attacks in January, showed no signs of either higher-end air defense systems, such as Patriot surface-to-air missiles, or land-based Phalanx close-in-weapon-systems, which are designed for the C-RAM mission just like Iron Dome. At least as of 2019 , there were land-based Phalanx systems deployed in Iraq, but it’s unclear what bases they were present at. As point defense systems, they can only provide immediate defense in the area where they are deployed. Iron Dome has the benefit of being able to provide C-RAM coverage across a much wider area. On Mar. 10, CENTCOM commander General McKenzie had informed legislators that the U.S. military was in the process of sending air and missile defense systems into Iraq in response to the Iranian ballistic missile strikes earlier this year, but did not say what type of systems were headed to the country or how many. Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley had told reporters in January that the United States was having trouble negotiating the deployment of Patriots into the country with authorities in Baghdad. “We have to go into the closed session to be able to talk about what systems [are going into Iraq],” Lieutenant General Karbler told Garamendi. “It’s reported in the newspapers,” Garamendi chided him. “You know better,” he added before the hearing moved on. Patriot surface-to-air missile systems would offer a defense against certain Iranian ballistic missiles, but would not offer any protection against the smaller rockets that are routinely fired at American military and diplomatic personnel. It is fair to say that, at present, the Army’s Iron Dome batteries are not deployable and that there is no guarantee that they would be able to successfully intercept all of the incoming threats during a future attack, either. No air or missile defense system is perfect, something The War Zone has stressed in the past. US Army personnel train on a Patriot surface-to-air missile system., USAF Still, the apparent lack of low-end air and missile defenses of any kind in Iraq raises questions about why the U.S. military as a whole does not appear to have taken any additional steps to even mitigate the rocket threat. It is possible that diplomatic considerations have been an issue in deploying more low-tier air and missile defenses just as they have been with regards to sending Patriots. This is a threat that is real and well understood. In December 2019, The K-1 base near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk suffered a similar attack to the latest rocket barrage on Taji, which killed a U.S. contractor. That set into motion a chain of events that included the U.S. government’s decision to kill Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. That action directly led to Iran launching its missiles strikes aimed at U.S. forces in Iraq, which left more than 100 American service members with traumatic brain injuries . There were no fatalities, thanks in no small part to early warning from space-based sensors that gave American personnel enough time to seek cover. “I have spoken with the president,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters on Mar. 12. “He’s given me the authority to do what we need to do, consistent with his guidance.” “Let me be clear: The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests or our allies,” Esper also said. “All options are on the table.” U.S. retaliation now against Iranian forces or their proxies, in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East, for the Taji attack, which notably came on the occasion of Solemiani’s birthday, could easily prompt further strikes from those groups in response. Regardless, if the past few months are any indication, rocket attacks will continue to pose a significant threat to them, and one that is perhaps greater than it should be, until similar defensive systems are put in place.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 13, 2020","Rocket Attack In Iraq Kills American And British Personnel, Reprisal Strikes May Be Underway (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but at least two American military personnel, as well as a member of the U.K. armed forces, have reportedly died in a rocket attack on Taji Air Base in Iraq. There are said to be multiple additional casualties and there are already reports emerging that the United States may have struck bases housing Iranian forces and their regional proxies in neighboring Syria in response. The attack took place sometime between 7:30 and 8:00 PM local time on Mar. 11, 2020, at Taji, which is situated around 15 miles northwest of the center of Baghdad. The attackers fired approximately 15 unguided rockets from an improvised truck-mounted launcher, which Iraqi security forces subsequently found abandoned. These would be the first members of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq to be killed in a rocket attack like this targeting foreign troops, since Dec. 27, 2019. Nawres Waleed Hamid , a military contractor and U.S. citizen, died on that date in a similar attack on the K-1 base near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. No group has claimed responsibility, but previous rocket attacks aimed at bases that coalition forces use, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which have been regularly occurring for months now, have been tied to Iran and its proxies. There are already reports that the U.S. government believes that was the case in this attack on Taji and that U.S. military aircraft may have launched strikes on bases that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and militias that it supports, occupy in Syria. If true, this would be similar to the initial response from the United States to the killing of Nawres Waleed Hamid last year. Afterward, on Dec. 31, a mob made of Iranian-backed militia members and their supporters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. In January, the U.S. government further decided to kill General Qasem Soleimani , then head of Iran’s Quds Force, the arm of the IRGC responsible for offensive operations outside of the country, in Baghdad. Days later, Iran launched an unprecedented ballistic missile attack on bases that U.S. forces occupy in Iraq, that did not kill anyone but left more than 100 American troops with traumatic brain injuries . What further action the United States decides to take now remains to be seen. On Mar. 10, The Wall Street Journal had reported that the U.S. military had begun withdrawing some of the personnel that it rushed to Iraq and other locations in the Middle East following the spike in tensions across the region after the rocket attack on K-1 last year. “The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer,” U.S. President Donald Trump had also said during a speech on Jan. 8, the day after the Iranian ballistic missile attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq. “It will not be allowed to go forward.” This attack on Taji also comes just days after two U.S. Marine Raiders died during an operation against ISIS terrorists in Iraq. We will continue to update this story are more information becomes available. UPDATE: 6:20pm EST: U.S. Central Command has now confirmed that two American troops and one British service member died in the rocket attack on Taji. A dozen more coalition personnel, including more U.S. forces and a contractor, were injured. A U.S. official also told VOA that 18 rockets were fired at the base and that the launcher contained a total of 30, the rest of which did not function properly. Al-Monitor ‘s Jack Detsch noted that the attack also came on Qasem Soleimani’s birthday. He would have been 63. The U.S. House of Representatives also succeeded in passing a resolution intended to restrict President Trump’s ability to wage war on Iran without express authorization from Congress on Mar. 11. The Senate passed its version last month. In both cases, some Republicans joined Democrats in voting in favor of the measure, which the Trump Administration had publicly opposed. CNN also reported that a U.S. official that it spoke with had denied that the United States had carried out reprisal strikes in Syria, but said that it would pursue those it believes to be responsible in Iraq. That same individual said that the immediate American assessment was that the attack was carried out by Iranian-supported Iraqi militias. UPDATE: 7:15pm EST: Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the formal name of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, has released the following statement on the attack on Taji: “Three Coalition personnel were killed during a rocket attack on Camp Taji, Iraq, March 11. The names of the personnel are withheld pending next of kin notification, in accordance with national policies.” “Approximately 12 additional personnel were wounded during the attack. The attack is under investigation by the Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces. Camp Taji is an Iraqi base that hosts Coalition personnel for training and advising missions.” “Approximately 18 107mm Katyusha rockets struck the base. The Iraqi Security Forces found a rocket-rigged truck, a few miles from Camp Taji.” “This information is current as of 12:30 a.m. Baghdad time.” UPDATE: 8:15pm EST: U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has issued the following statement regarding the attack on Taji: “The Foreign Secretary has spoken to the US Secretary of State and we will continue to liaise with our international partners to fully understand the details of this abhorrent attack.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 19, 2019",Door Gunners On The Air Force’s New Grey Wolf Helicopters Need Protection From Sub-Zero Temps,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Air Force has begun testing and evaluating its new MH-139A Grey Wolf light utility helicopters it has found itself faced with at least one significant challenge. How do you ensure door gunners can adequately operate their weapons while exposed to extremely cold weather? The bulk of the MH-139As are set to replace UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters protecting intercontinental ballistic missile silos, many of which are situated in areas of the United States where the ambient temperature can drop well below zero in the winter. Representative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and a retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, raised the issue at a hearing on Mar. 10, 2020. The Air Force picked the MH-139A , a derivative of the Leonardo AW-139 helicopter that that Italian company is now building in the United States in cooperation with Boeing, in 2019. The first Grey Wolf arrived at Duke Field , part of Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, to begin the operational test and evaluation process last month. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force and will be the primary recipient of the MH-139As, is leading the effort at Duke Field. AFGSC, Detachment 7 stood up there to handle these activities last year. “We’re starting to deliver the MH-139A Grey Wolf helicopters and they have to have the capability to go to an ICBM site in case there’s a force protection issue, so you have a door gunner,” Representative Bacon said at the hearing. That’s “alright in the summer, but in the winter up there as you know its like minus 30 and what I’m hearing is it’s so cold that they can’t operate the guns.” The standard configuration of AFGSC’s MH-139As will include two 7.62mm M240 machine guns , one on each side of the helicopter. Though commonly referred to as door guns, these will actually be mounted in windows on the side of the fuselage between the cockpit and main cabin doors. A flight engineer leans out of a window on an MH-139A as it takes off from Duke Field in February. That window, and one on the other side of the helicopter, are where the Grey Wolf’s M240 machine guns will be mounted., USAF At present, to use the guns, door gunners would have to be standing in front of an open window, fully exposed to the weather outside. “At minus 30 [degrees Fahrenheit] it is hard to operate a machine gun with an open door,” Bacon added. The Congressman was specifically referring to the weather at ICBM sites belonging to the 91st Missile Wing, which is headquartered at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. It’s unclear if Bacon had heard similar concerns from personnel supporting the missile fields that belong to the 90th across Nebraska and Wyoming or  341st Missile Wing’s silos in Montana. A graphic showing the distribtion of missile silos assigned to the Air Force’s three missile wings., USAF “We’re aware of the weather conditions in Minot,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, told the Nebraska Representative in response to his questions. “I went up a year ago right before winter started and I was there on one of the warmest on record, so I did not get to experience the full Minot experience.” “Cold weather, primary challenge that has to be overcome,” he continued. “We’re working a variety of options, environmental options, clothing options, to try to mitigate that risk.” An environmental option could be a heating system in the helicopter or some sort of shield that allows the gunner to use their weapon, but keeps them warmer. Clothing options could simply be something like heavier coats, though Bacon also suggested the Air Force could look into gloves, or mittens with integrated hand warmers . An airman wears extreme cold-weather gear during a training exercise in Alaska., USAF The issue, of course, is that any additional extreme cold weather heating system could add weight to the helicopter and bulk inside the cabin that might impact other capabilities. Heavier clothing, while it might keep a gunner warmer, could also restrict their movement and their ability to use their weapon. Protected or not, operating in very cold temperatures is just physically taxing, as well. This is hardly a new concern for the Air Force, or the U.S. military, as a whole, when it comes to operating helicopters in extremely cold weather. In the early 1970s, the U.S. Army experimented with a kit to answer this same question with regards to UH-1H Huey helicopters operating in places like Alaska. That service had developed the door gun systems for all of its helicopters with the Vietnam War in mind, where the weather was significantly warmer and helicopters often flew with their doors off completely to help crews stay comfortable. The proposed solution then was to install a secondary set of doors in the UH-1H’s cabin, one on each side. This shielded passengers from the elements even when the main door was open, while leaving the gunner, wearing heavy clothing free to operate their weapon. Another door built into this “closure kit” also allowed the gunners to move into the main cabin even when the main doors were closed. A low-quality picture of a UH-1H with the “closure” kit installed, also showing one of the gunners seated in their position wearing cold-weather gear, including mittens and heavy boots., US Army A look at one of the internal doors found on both sides of the closure kit, which would allow the gunners to move into the main cabin with the main doors closed., US Army The Army did not adopt this configuration. It’s not entirely clear why, but a final report on the project pointed out that the kit was not compatible with a separate supplemental internal heating system for the helicopter and made it difficult to load and unload casualties on stretchers from UH-1Hs tasked with casualty evacuation missions. Today, Army UH-60 Black Hawks flying in extremely cold weather, such as those operating in Alaska, do not feature any specialized protection for door gunners, or the helicopter’s other occupants, beyond traditional heavy clothing and supplemental cabin heating systems . A ski-equipped UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter assigned to the 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment, which is based in Alaska, departs the Yakima Training Area in Washington State. This helicopter has its door guns installed in the open crew chief’s windows between the cockpit doors and the main cabin doors., US Army The Air Force itself only began arming its UH-1Ns with door-mounted M240 machine guns in recent years , as part of interim upgrades to improve their capabilities until new replacement helicopters arrived. It’s very possible that AFGSC had declined to add these weapons in the past, at least in part, because of the weather considerations. UH-1Ns assigned to the 54th Helicopter Squadron at Minot Air Force Base in more temperate weather with gunners in position with the main cabin doors open and the cockpit doors removed. This would be difficult, if not impossible to do during the winters at the base, where temperatures can drop to -30 degrees Fahrenheit., USAF These issues aren’t limited to the MH-139As supporting missile fields in North Dakota, either. The U.S. military as a whole is faced with the increasing likelihood that it will have to conduct operations in extreme cold weather environments , especially the ever more strategic Arctic region , in the future. Gunners on any kind of helicopter, as well as those on Marine and Air Force Osprey tilt-rotors , would be faced with the same predicament. It will be interesting to see what steps the Air Force ultimately takes to mitigate this issue and whether the options it selects might find their way onto other U.S. military helicopters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 31, 2020",Navy Filmed Russian Maritime Patrol Planes Buzzing Their Arctic Submarine Base Camp,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, has released a video, which U.S. Navy personnel down below captured, showing a pair of Russian Tu-142 Bear maritime patrol aircraft flying at relatively low altitude over a site off the coast of northwest Alaska being used to support the latest iteration of the Navy’s ICEX submarine exercise . The U.S. military says that the Tu-142s loitered over the area for some time as part of a 12-hour-long patrol earlier this week. U.S. Air Force General Terrence O’Shaughnessy, head of U.S. Northern Command, offered the additional details about the Tu-142s and their activities during a hearing before Congress on Mar. 10, 2020. The actual Russian patrol had taken place the day before. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters and Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18 Hornets escorted the maritime patrol planes while they flew through the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). Russian aerial patrols near Alaska are not uncommon and routinely end without incident. This particular flight was notable because a portion of the Russian mission took them over Camp Seadragon, a temporary base camp supporting ICEX 2020 in international waters off the coast of Alaska. The exercise began on Mar. 4 and will last approximately three weeks. The Seawolf class attack submarine USS Connecticut and the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Toledo are taking part in this year’s ICEX. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OnK3oKNsXYo A picture NORAD released of an F-22 escorting on of the Tu-142s during their patrol on Mar. 9., NORAD Another shot of an F-22 flying alongside one of the Tu-142., NORAD A CF-18 in the foreground, along with an F-22 in the background, flank one of the Tu-142s during their patrol on Mar. 9., NORAD It’s not clear which one shot the video of the Tu-142s flying overhead at approximately 2,500 feet, with three F-22s and a CF-18 escorting them. General O’Shaughnessy did not elaborate on exactly how long the maritime patrol planes remained over Camp Seadragon in particular, but NORAD has said that they were inside the boundaries of the Alaskan ADIZ for around four hours in total. O’Shaughnessy did say that the Raptors had flown 750 miles from Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska to intercept the aircraft. The Navy presently conducts ICEX once every two years. The exercise is ostensibly geared toward assessing the readiness of the service’s submarine force to operate in the Arctic region, as well as train with elements of other U.S. military services and military personnel from foreign allies and partners in this increasingly strategic region. It also routinely serves as an opportunity to test new systems and concepts of operation. The Connecticut , in particular, along with the other two submarines in the Seawolf class , are highly secretive boats that are regularly engaged in a wide variety of sensitive test and evaluation and operational missions, including intelligence gathering . “The Arctic is a potential strategic corridor – between Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the U.S. homeland – for expanded competition,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Daryl Caudle, Commander, Submarine Forces, said in a statement when ICEX 2020 began. “The Submarine Force must maintain readiness by exercising in Arctic conditions to ensure they can protect national security interests and maintain favorable balances of power in the Indo-Pacific and Europe if called upon.” With competition increasing in the region , especially as global climate change causes the polar ice caps to recede, opening up new pathways for military warships and commercial shipping, it’s not necessarily surprising that Russia would want to make its presence felt during ICEX 2020. It would have also offered the Tu-142s a potential opportunity to get a closer look at the activity at Camp Seadragon. The Russian long-range patrol underscored the need to have the “ability to react appropriately” and maintain a “persistent defense,” General O’Shaughnessy told legislators. As both the U.S. and the Russian military increasingly operating in the Arctic , it is very likely that the two countries will only further step up their monitoring of each other’s activities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 13, 2020","Video Shows Thrusters, Sauna, Other Features Of Russia’s Newest Ballistic Missile Submarine","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A guided tour of sorts of the first of Russia’s nuclear-powered Project 955A Borei-A class ballistic missile submarines, the Knyaz Vladimir , one of the country’s most advanced types, which is in the very final stages of construction, is something that promises to be interesting from the start. With the Russian Navy’s submarine force and its activities being major topics of discussion recently, including within the U.S. government , as well as the public at large, it’s something even more worth watching now. TV Zvezda , the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense, released a special on the Knyaz Vladimir , which is also known by the hull number K-549, on Mar. 7, 2020. This submarine is the first of the improved Borei-A subclass and has been under construction at the Sevmash shipyard since 2012. It conducted initial sea trails in 2018, followed by a second phase of at-sea testing last year, which included the launch of an RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile from one of its 16 missile tubes. Unspecified issues have delayed the ship’s commissioning , which is presently scheduled to occur in May. The Russian Navy already has three regular Project 955 Borei class submarines in service. It’s not clear when TV Zvezda actually shot the footage for the special, but says its the first time any media outlet has been onboard Knyaz Vladimir . The video very clearly shows work continuing on the outside and the inside of the submarine. TV Zvezda’s reporter similarly gets a look at various features of the boat, inside and out. Among the most interesting segments of the special is a close-up look at one of the submarine’s two auxiliary thrusters. Veteran U.S. Navy submariner Eric Moreno, a friend of The War Zone and the man behind the Reddit page R/Submarines and the Tac Ops podcast , highlighted on Twitter that the thruster appears to have an advanced type of shrouded propeller. The tips of the blades are welded to ring that rides inside the propeller shroud. This design would make the thrusters quieter, especially by reducing the noisy cavitation that the tips of the blades would create if they were exposed. This is one of the reasons why enclosed pump-jet propulsors have become increasingly the standard design for the main screws on military submarines, something that veteran U.S. Navy submariner Aaron ‘Jive Turkey’ Amick, another friend of the War Zone , has explained in detail in this past, as you can read about in this previous War Zone piece . He also explains the benefits of shrouded propellers versus standard types. Being as quiet as possible is absolutely critical for a submarine’s survival. So, it’s not surprising that the Borei and Borei-A class boats feature pump-jet propulsors, too, something not typically found on most earlier Soviet-era submarine designs. The Project 955 design was actually the first Russian nuclear-powered submarine type to use this type of propulsion system ever. Russia has claimed that even the initial three Boreis are substantially quieter than the latest variants of the Cold War-era Akula class attack submarines , understood to be some of the Russian Navy’s most advanced types. Pump-jets, however, are not particularly efficient at the low-end of a submarine’s performance envelope. The auxiliary thrusters offer the benefit of additional power during low-speed cruising, which also helps reduce the noise a submarine makes. Other Russian submarines, with and without pump-jets, such as the Akulas , as well as other types in service around the world, including the U.K. Royal Navy’s Vanguard class ballistic missile submarines, have similar thrusters for these same reasons. It’s important to note that the Boreis , and future Borei-As , are critical parts of Russia’s second-strike nuclear deterrent. Their entire purpose is to disappear into the vast expanses of the ocean and remain as concealed as possible. As a result, sailing around slowly and quietly at low speed is especially relevant to them, making the thrusters a particularly valuable addition to the design. Compared to the original Project 955 design, the 955As have other major structural differences, including the streamlining of the hull to remove the box-like missile tube structure behind the sail, a redesign of the rudders and vertical endplates, and a change in the shape of the sail. These alterations, coupled with other improvements, are supposed to give the Borei-As better maneuverability and efficiency, as well as a reduced acoustic signature overall. The boats also have updated communications and sonar suites.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 22, 2019","Edwards AFB Upgrades Point To Unexpected Home For B-21 Raider, Other Secretive Programs","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Historic Edwards Air Force Base, the center of the flight test world , has been going through a series of changes in preparation to receive the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . Now, satellite imagery shows that the area of the base where the B-21 test program was thought to be headed may not actually be its destination. As a result, it would seem that more than just one secretive large aircraft program may kickoff at the base in the not so distant future, or may even be underway there already. For years, the remote South Base complex at the sprawling test base was thought to be the place where the B-21’s flight testing would occur. The other bomber test forces, aside from the B-2 test force , were moved from South Base to the base’s main ramp years ago in preparation for new shadowy developments at South Base, which were thought to be at least primarily related to the new bomber. But satellite images point to the possibility that the B-21 test program may actually be housed in a remodeled complex located in the central part of the base, not South Base. This, in turn, points to the real possibility that South Base will house other sensitive large aircraft programs, and may be doing so already. A satellite image dated March 1st, 2020 of Edwards AFB. The bottom arrow points to South Base and the upper arrow points to what appears to be the future home of the B-21. , PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Since around 2011, South Base, where the Air Force’s bomber test force once called home, as did the YAL-1 Airborne Laser program, and more, was the presumptive residence for the future B-21 test program. The place was largely cleared out to undergo renovations and repurposing for a new, undisclosed mission. With the B-2 test program still colocated there in its own custom-built hangar, the avalanche of rumors and off-the-record statements about how the B-21 program would bed-down there made total sense. Adding evidence to this supposed eventuality, recently, large hangar structures were constructed on the apron areas where the bombers were traditionally parked. Nearly a year ago, The War Zone detailed these improvements , which seemed ideally suited for the new stealth bomber. The new additions included one elongated red shelter ideally suited for a stealthy flying-wing and a large hangar that could feasibly conceal at least two of the new bombers at once. These new facilities are in addition to the huge hangar that once housed the airborne laser program. And when we say huge, we mean huge. This hangar is roughly 500 feet long by 300 feet deep and very tall. It could conceal a number of programs of any size at one time. The largest hangar at South Base is truly massive. See the B-52 to the left for comparison. The aircraft scattered around the ramp to the rear, beyond the B-2 hangar, are historic aircraft in storage for possible display in the future. Notice how even the taxiway to the runway is fenced off at the secure facility. , USAF/Edwards AFB Public Affairs image Since that report, another of these large flight line area hangars has been erected. As a result, South Base’s apron has been transformed into an area that can easily stow its largest occupants out of the elements and out of sight. An image of South Base from March 1st, 2020. Note the second large hangar built over the parking areas. The B-2 hangar is seen to the right of the largest hangar that once housed the Airborne Laser program. , PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The addition of these new hangar facilities only solidified the idea that the B-21 test program would materialize at South Base fairly soon. But upon close examination of satellite imagery, it becomes apparent that another facility, located in the central base area, between the main ramp and NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center , has undergone major changes that seem to make it tailor-made to support the B-21 program. At first glance, the changes aren’t hugely apparent as the general layout of the facility has remained the same as it has been for years, but when one looks closer, changes do materialize, and they are significant in nature. The facility has been totally renovated, morphing from an area that was largely equipped to support tactical fighter aircraft programs, namely the F-22 Raptor, to one that is purpose-built to accommodate a test force of large flying wing aircraft . Image taken in September of 2015 showing the complex setup for tactical fighter test support. , Google Earth Image taken on March 1st, 2020 showing a drastically remodeled facility uniquely designed to accommodate large flying-wing aircraft. , PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The four near-identical hangars with 180-foot-wide spans have been fully renovated and altered similarly. Each has large work and maintenance areas attached to them that would be necessary to support a complex program like the B-21. This aircraft will have a smaller wingspan than its predecessor, the B-2A Spirit, which measures in at 169 feet. The B-2’s test fleet was made up of six airframes. It is thought the B-21’s test fleet will be four to six aircraft in size. The ramp area of the complex was totally jackhammered up and rebuilt starting in January of 2018, changing it from one bisected for fighter-sized aircraft to an expansive continuous operating area for far larger aircraft. Image of the complex taken in December 2017., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Image of the complex taken in January 2018., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. Today, the apron is replete with taxi lines that indicate the four hangars and exterior parking areas are designed to accommodate one large aircraft each, not a number of individual fighters. A pair of sunshade shelters sit beside two of the hangars. They are long, low-slung, continuous span, 180-foot-wide structures. Each is equipped with a wide jet blast deflector, which would allow the aircraft sitting in front of them to run their engines without disturbing what lies beyond the fenceline. An open parking spot area on the ramp also has an identical jet blest deflector, but no sunshade. Overall, this revamped area seems ideally suited for what we know about the B-21 and its looming test program . There are no other large, unclassified aircraft that would require such a unique facility. The fact that it is located in the central base area would be a welcome development for those working on the program as the location is more convenient than South Base. As for the operational state of this intriguing complex, at this point, it isn’t fully open for business yet. An additional parking lot was just recently laid down and there appears to be no day-to-day activity at the facility of any significant scale, which fits well with the B-21’s timeline as we understand it. The stealth bomber could take its first flight as early as next year , that is if everything goes as planned. Official rendering of the B-21 design. , USAF So, if this is where the B-21 test force will reside, what is going on at South Base? It’s possible that some of the Air Force’s other bomber operations have moved back there, but how that would necessitate the new hangars and the elongated shelter isn’t clear. Beyond that, the occupant of the huge South Base hangar remains unknown. One real possibility is the Air Force’s all but disclosed, but still secret RQ-180 high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) stealth drone. The clandestine unmanned system, which you can read more about here , here , and here , supposedly has moved into a semi-operational state. It would likely work with the B-21, B-2, any potential unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) in development, and other deep penetrating aerial assets during a conflict, so migrating it from Area 51 to Edwards seems logical, especially as its fleet size expands. The reality is that the RQ-180 is another candidate for the revamped mysterious facility in the main base area, as well. The flying-wing design could take advantage of the same features, like B-21. It is more likely that such a high-profile program like the B-21 would have such a facility fabricated for it, and everything else lines up, but the RQ-180 being a tenant of the cental base area complex is still possible. We will publish our feature on the RQ-180, which will delve into the issues surrounding it, including basing, in the near future, so stay tuned for that. With all this in mind, South Base could be used as a ‘gray area’ for supporting a number of cutting-edge flight test and weapons development programs, some of which could potentially work together as a family of systems. From emerging hypersonic systems , including those lugged aloft aboard B-52s , to advanced unmanned combat aircraft to the RQ-180 drone could all call South Base home as they emerge out of the deeply classified realm. They would make up an ecosystem of systems that are designed to cooperatively pierce the enemy’s anti-access umbrella. As such, they could be tested together out of South Base as they mature towards an operational state. We will have to see how this all pans out in the months and years to come, but as it sits now, the B-21 program is most likely not going to be based primarily where many thought it would be originally. As a result, it may not be the most secretive major aircraft program to call Edwards Air Force Base home, either now or in the not so distant future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Blue Angels are teasing the arrival of their new (to them) C-130J transport that will take up the role of Fat Albert . In somewhat of a cryptic post, the team showed close-up shots of the ex-Royal Air Force C-130J that is undergoing conversion to the unique Fat Albert configuration at Marshall Aerospace. One of the photos depicts a clear change in the classic Fat Albert paint scheme, with a slanted cheatline now separating the white upper area of the fuselage from the blue lower area. It also features the team’s name in gold writing instead of blue and two gold stripes instead of one thicker one. Overall, it appears the new Fat Albert will wear a more modern take on the iconic scheme, which is bound to be a controversial subject among air show superfans. The Blue Angels’ teaser post, which features a screenshot of someone editing a video showing the plane, also hints that Fat Albert will make its triumphant return soon. The team has gone nearly a year without a dedicated transport. It wasn’t exactly clear when the replacement ‘Herc would arrive, but it has been sorely missed on the air show circuit and by the team. Facebook Screenshot Here’s a look at the traditional Fat Albert paint scheme: The Blue Angels’ old C-130T transport lovingly referred to by its nickname, Fat Albert. , Cory W. Watts/Wikicommons The Navy finalized the deal in 2019 to buy the ex-U.K. Royal Air Force C-130J for approximately $29.7 million. The service had first announced its intention to buy the plane as a replacement for the previous Fat Albert, which was a decades-old C-130T model, the year before. The United Kingdom had retired most of its short-fuselage J models, which it had designated Hercules C5s, following the 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review. The original plan had been to remove all of the RAF’s Hercules from service, including its long-fuselage C-130J-30s, or Hercules C4s, in favor of the Airbus A400M . Issues with those aircraft led the United Kingdom to retain 14 of the extended length J models. As to exactly when the aircraft is slated to begin touring with the team, our friends over at Airshowstuff.com say the ‘Blues plan on getting the new Fat Albert out on the road by late spring. With the team getting Super Hornets next season , having their new upgraded C-130J already locked in and running operations for the 2021 season will truly make it one for the history books.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 13, 2021",The U.S. Military Says It Has Supported The Taliban In Fighting ISIS In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military says it has provided some form of limited support to the Taliban in fighting ISIS elements in Afghanistan . This revelation comes as American troops are beginning to withdraw from the country as part of a still very fragile deal that the U.S. government signed with the terrorist group last month. U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, the current head of U.S. Central Command, informed members of Congress of the limited cooperation with the Taliban during a hearing on Mar. 10, 2020. His testimony comes less than two weeks after the signing ceremony for the U.S.-Taliban Agreement took place in Qatar. The United States first began operations in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and succeeded in toppling the then-Taliban run government before the end of that year. McKenzie told lawmakers that the Taliban had been “very effective” in their efforts to “compress and crush” ISIS’ franchise in Afghanistan, also known as ISIS-Khorasan Province or ISIS-K, in the southern portion of the country’s Nangarhar province. The terrorist group has been doing this with “very limited support from us, and I would characterize that as very limited support,” the General said. McKenzie did not elaborate on exactly what this support entailed and it is not clear if there has been any direct U.S. military coordination with the Taliban on any level regarding the campaign against ISIS-K. The United States could simply be focusing its own efforts, including air and artillery strikes and raids on the ground , against that group in such a way that aligns with what is known about the Taliban’s own activities. The U.S. military has been actively engaged against ISIS-K since it first emerged in 2015. The United States notably dropped a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, also nicknamed the “Mother of All Bombs,” for the first time ever anywhere on one of the group’s tunnel complexes in Nangarhar in 2017. ISIS-K continues to maintain a significant presence in this province, which is situated along the border with Pakistan and the bulk of which lies within 100 miles of Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, despite both American and Taliban offensives against it. Just last week, the group killed 32 people and wounded dozens more in an attack on a gathering in Kabul that included numerous senior government officials, including Afghanistan’s chief executive Abdullah Abdullah. Regardless of the actual level of American support and despite a shared general opposition to ISIS-K, the idea that the U.S. government sees itself cooperating in any way with the Taliban militarily is still a stunning development after nearly two decades of fighting. As recently as January, the United States was still carrying out targeted killings of Taliban leaders, including one instance involving the use of a specialized Hellfire variant sword-like blades instead of high explosives. That there is any coordination what so ever between the United States and the Taliban is even more interesting given how uncertain the future of the recent deal aimed at ending the conflict between the two parties remains. McKenzie’s comments on Capitol Hill come just a day after the U.S. military confirmed it had begun troop withdrawals under that agreement, which U.S. and Taliban representatives signed in Qatar on Feb. 29. There are now reports that American forces have left or are in the process of leaving facilities in the Lashkar Gah, the capital of Afghanistan’s southern Helmand Province, and in the northwestern city of Herat. The deal stipulated that American troops would begin with pull out of the country within 10 days of that signing ceremony. The deal followed a week-long “reduction in violence” period wherein the Taliban scaled back operations in a show of good faith. US Air Force personnel load cargo onto a C-130J Hercules airlifter at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan., USAF Under the present plan, the United States expects to draw down the total size of its force in Afghanistan from 13,000 personnel to 8,600 personnel. The U.S. military could withdraw the vast majority of its forces within 14 months if the Taliban meet certain security and other conditions. McKenzie also told lawmakers that he had not yet developed any plans for a complete or near-complete withdrawal. However, President Donald Trump’s Administration had said that it would begin those withdrawals even if the Taliban did not immediately show signs it was living up to its end of the bargain. There also are reports that the U.S. Intelligence Community has evidence that the group does not plan to abide by the terms of the agreement. The Taliban also notably decided not to extend the reduction in violence period and have continued launching attacks. McKenzie downplayed this to legislators saying the incidents had been “relatively low in scale” and that “they are not directed against coalition forces,” but rather against the Afganistan government’s security forces. ""They are not occurring in city centers. They are occurring at isolated checkpoints, but those attacks are occurring and they are not consistent with a movement toward a negotiated settlement,"" Gen. McKenzie says about attacks post U.S.-Taliban peace deal signing — Lucas Tomlinson (@LucasFoxNews) March 10, 2020 Beyond that, Afghanistan’s own internationally recognized government, which was not involved in the negotiations that led up to the U.S.-Taliban agreement, had balked at conditions it is now supposed to fulfill as part of a push toward a final peace deal for the country. Demands for the release of thousands of members of the terrorist group that are presently charactered in the country has been a particularly major sticking point , though President Ashraf Ghani appears to be softening on the issue. It’s also important to note that Ghani was only officially declared the winner of Afghanistan’s most recent presidential election last month, five months after voters had gone to the polls. That election was mired in controversy and allegations of fraud. Ghani formally took the oath of office on Mar. 9, but his opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, did the same , establishing a parallel government and creating a massive political crisis. Ashraf Ghani, at right, shakes hands with Abdullah Abdullah at the NATO Summit in Warsaw, Poland, back in 2016., Alexey Vitvitsky/Sputnik via AP There is also the distinct possibility of increased domestic opposition to the deal with the Taliban following McKenzie’s remarks. Republicans, as well as Democrats, have criticized the Trump Administration over its dealings with the terrorist group already. No matter what, Afghanistan’s political landscape is very much in flux at the moment, which may only further increase the incentives for the U.S. military and the Taliban to continue their newfound partnership of convenience, even at a limited level, in the fight against ISIS-K.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 2, 2021",Air Force F-16s Are Getting Pylons With Built-In Missile Warning Sensors And Countermeasures,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is buying new Israeli-made infrared missile warning systems for Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard F-16 Viper fighter jets . The aircraft will carry these infrared warning sensors on specialized underwing pylons that are also capable of accomodating decoy flare and chaff dispensers and electronic warfare jammers. Israel-headquartered defense contractor Elbit announced that its American subsidiary, Elbit Systems of America, had received the contract for “pylon-based infrared missile warning systems” on Mar. 9, 2020. The Air Force has already set aside a little more than $17 million to buy these systems, but the complete contract, which covers work through at least February 2030, could be worth up to just over $471.6 million, according to an official Pentagon contracting announcement on Mar. 5. Neither the Air Force nor Elbit identified the specific warning system in question, but the Israeli company does offer a number of different suites as part of its Passive Airborne Warning System (PAWS) product line. In addition, Elbit says that PAWS-2 specifically can work with on unspecified pylon mount from Danish defense contractor Terma, according to Aviation Week . A graphic from an Elbit PAWS family brochure showing different variants of that system, as well as a specialized pylon from Terma, at left., Elbit In January 2020, Terma separately announced that it had received a contract worth approximately $84 million to supply examples of its Pylon Integrated Dispensing System Universal (PIDSU) to the Air Force for use on Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard F-16s. The Danish company offers PIDSU as a shell into which a customer can integrate its own choice of missile warning systems, flare and chaff dispensers, and electronic warfare jammers. Each PIDSU pylon can accommodate up to three flare and chaff dispenser buckets, while the exact configuration of the other systems is dependent on their respective designs. The pylons can still carry munitions and other stores, as well. Terma has already supplied Pylon Integrated Dispensing System Plus (PIDS+) and Electronic Combat Integrated Pylon System Plus (ECIPS+) pylons to the Belgian, Danish, Dutch, and Norwegian Air Forces for installation on their various F-16 variants. Terma has also built similar integrated self-defense systems for the Panavia Tornado combat jet in the past. A Royal Danish Air Force F-16BM Viper. One of Terma’s integrated self-defense pylons is visible on the outboard station under the left wing., Terma https://youtube.com/watch?v=J43SYKK0l28 A chart showing Terma’s various pylon offerings and their respective features., Terma Each PIDS+ pylon can only accept a maximum of two flare and chaff dispensers. They also feature variants of the AN/AAR-60 Missile Warning System , which has three separate warning sensors on each pylon. The ECIPS pylons carry the three AN/AAR-60 sensors, but do not have the flare and chaff dispensers. Instead, they also have an AN/ALQ-162(V)6 high-band radio frequency countermeasures system from Northrop Grumman installed. Typically, a Viper would carry one PIDS+ and one ECIPS+ to provide a mix of countermeasures capabilities. An aircraft with one of each would be carrying a complete array of six AN/AAR-60 warning sensors, an AN/ALQ-162(V)6 jammer, and three dispensers for expandable flares or chaff cartridges, just in those pylons. Both types of pylons are also designed work with the AN/ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management System, another Terma product , found on various types of F-16 Vipers. The Danish company also offers systems to provide alerts to incoming threats. This includes options for visual alerts through a fixed display in the cockpit or the feed in the helmet-mounted Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System ( JHMCS ), as well as various types of audio warnings, including through the Danish company’s own 3D in-cockpit surround-sound system .

Longer-range infrared homing surface-to-air missiles are becoming an increasing threat, even from non-state actors , as well. Elbit’s PAWS family and other similar passive infrared missile warning systems can also detect air-to-air missile launches and can spot air- or ground-launched non-heat-seeking missiles, as well. Combined with chaff or an electronic warfare system, the PIDSU pylons ould provide valuable added layers of defense for Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard F-16s. These types of missile warning systems, tied to other countermeasures suites, are becoming increasingly standard on advanced fourth-generation combat jets. Saudi Arabia’s latest F-15SA Eagles notably feature a missile warning suite with infrared sensors pointing in every direction for spherical coverage.

You mean those? pic.twitter.com/V00JGo98ON — Vinicius Marques (@Vinicius_MS8) August 19, 2019 While the Air Force is planning to replace significant numbers of its F-16s with F-35s over time, it still expects to fly hundreds of Vipers for decades to come , especially in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. So, it’s not surprising that the service is looking for ways to upgrade those jets to ensure they remain relevant for actual higher-end combat operations for the foreseeable future. In the same vein, the Air National Guard, in particular, was the first to begin upgrading parts of its F-16 fleet with AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radars (SABR). SABR is an active electronically scanned array type that expands those Vipers’ ability to spot and engage threats at longer distances and with greater precision. The Air National Guard has its own development and procurement streams and has used them to acquire other upgrades for their F-16s over the years, as well. The SABR upgrade is now finding its way onto F-16s assigned to regular Air Force squadrons. Between the new PIDSU pylons equipped with the Elbit missile warning systems and other countermeasures and the other upgrades, Air National Guard F-16s, and, to a lesser extent examples of those fighters in the Air Force Reserve, could be on track to becoming some of the best protected and most otherwise advanced and capable Vipers in the world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 10, 2020",Drones Have Been “Raining” Small Bombs On American Troops Guarding Oil Sites In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. forces guarding oil and gas fields in eastern Syria have recently come under attack from small drones dropping improvised mortar bomb-like munitions . It’s not clear what group was responsible for these incidents, which thankfully have not caused any casualties so far, but they are the latest examples of this steadily growing threat . The U.S. military, as a whole , has been developing and fielding an increasingly wide array of counter-drone systems in response. NPR was first to report on what it described as “a multiday attack on two of the oil fields” that U.S. forces are presently guarding in Syria on Mar. 6, 2020. This is reportedly the first attack on American troops in these particular areas since the U.S. military first announced their new mission guarding oil and natural gas-related sites in the country in October 2019 . NPR ‘s reporter in Syria, Tom Bowman, did not specify the exact locations of the attacks, or how many of them there were in total. He did say that members of the “West Virginia National Guard” had been on the scene of one of the incidents. The West Virginia Army National Guard has troops assigned to the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team presently deployed to Syria. In October 2019, the 30th briefly deployed a contingent of Bradley Fighting Vehicles, as well as supporting forces, to two forward operating bases, one at the Conoco Gas Plant and another known as Green Village, both of which are situated in the Syrian province of Deir Ez Zor. Elements of the brigade remained in the country after the Bradleys returned to Kuwait between November and December 2019, a shift in forces that The War Zone was first to report on. A map showing the general location of both the Conoco Gas Plant and Green Village sites in Deir Ez Zor province to the south, as well as other oil fields that US forces are presently guarding in the far northeastern corner of Syria., Google Maps Drones of an unspecified type, but “carrying a mortar [bomb],” attacked the West Virginian guardsmen on Mar. 4. More unmanned aerial vehicles conducted similars attacks two days later, both in the morning and the evening, according to Bowman. “We immediately sprung, got in the vehicle. I got a REDCON-1 [Readiness Condition 1] status,” Sergeant First Class Mitch Morgan of the West Virginia Army National Guard told NPR , referring to a full alert status ordering personnel to be ready to move and fight. “We were out in 2 minutes. We came out this way. As we were going out, they was [sic] raining mortars [bombs] in on top of us.” Elements of the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team in Syria in November 2019., Army National Guard NPR did not provide any pictures of the munitions, or their remains, employed during the attacks. Its report said that they left noticeable impact craters and sprayed at least one U.S. military truck, as well as oil tanks at the site in Syria, with shrapnel. “An interesting thing about these mortars is that some of them, we’re told by Army investigators, were made with 3D printers, which means that obviously someone pretty sophisticated put together these mortars, perhaps a nation-state,” Bowman said on-air on Mar. 6. Without more details, how sophisticated the munitions actually are is unclear. From the overall description of the attacks, the mortar bomb-like payloads and the drones themselves sound similar to the types that ISIS and other terrorist and militant groups have employed in Syria, as well as Iraq, for years now. There were reports that some ISIS-made munitions were also 3D-printed, but pictures of various types that have emerged have all pointed more toward injection-molded construction of certain parts combined with items from actual military munitions. 3D printing is increasingly more accessible , sparking concerns about the ability for private citizens with relatively modest means to make guns in their own homes. The equipment and materials necessary are not automatically prohibitively expensive or otherwise unavailable for non-state groups who are already spending hundreds of dollars, if not thousands or more, on acquiring small commercial drones, such as quad and hexcopter types, or the parts necessary to make capable homebrew designs . At the same time, there have been reports for months about U.S. intelligence streams showing increased threats to American troops from Iran or its regional proxies across the Middle East. These concerns have only grown since the Trump Administration’s decision to kill General Qasem Soleimani , then-commander of Iran’s Quds Force, in Iraq in January 2020. This is to say nothing of the unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile strikes on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure in September 2019, which the United States says Iran carried out itself and which Saudi authorities say was at least Iranian-sponsored . Two months later, Newsweek reported that Iranian-linked groups were employing “suicide drones” to surveil and harass U.S. personnel in an unspecified country, but offered few other details about these unmanned aerial vehicles. Regardless of who has been responsible for these recent drone attacks on U.S. forces in Syria, they underscore a very real threat that American troops will only encounter more and more on and off the battlefield . The War Zone has long sounded the alarm on this issue and noted the significance of ISIS increasingly using unmanned aerial vehicles armed with improvised munitions back during the Battle of Mosul in Iraq in 2016 and 2017. This is an issue that U.S. forces have since encounter outside Iraq and Syria, as well, including in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have at least been employing small drones for surveillance. This reality has led to a long-overdue explosion in the development and fielding of various counter-drone systems. The West Virginian Guardsmen in Syria reportedly drove off one of the drones during one of the recent incidents, but it’s unclear if they used a dedicated weapon, such as an electronic warfare jammer, various types of which are already in U.S. military service . A member of the US Army national guard aims a DroneDefender, a portable counter-drone electronic warfare jamming system, during training in Kuwait in 2017., Army National Guard The U.S. Air Force is also getting ready to deploy a system that uses a laser to physically shoot down small drones for field trials in an unspecified country.  That service is planning to conduct a similar operational experiment using a high-power microwave directed energy weapon, as well. The U.S. Army, which is leading a high-level Pentagon-directed counter-unmanned aerial systems effort, is set to deliver an assessment of a number of different systems already in use in April. These efforts aren’t limited to land-based systems, either. The U.S. Navy has recently begun testing a number of ship-mounted directed energy weapons that it hopes will be able to knock down small drones , among other threats, or at least blind or confuse any optical sensors they might be carrying. If these drone attacks on U.S. troops guarding oil and gas fields in Syria persist, those forward operating locations might well become a good place to explore the efficacy of new counter-drone systems.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The twilight of the Cold War was one of the most interesting times in American airpower history. There was so much older gear built-up, while a whole new generation of air combat systems was just hitting the flight lines or would be doing so soon . America’s strategic arsenal was staggering in size and capability. Strategic Air Command presided over throngs of aircraft that were focused primarily on putting nuclear warheads on targets in the Soviet Union. It was also an era of far looser regulations when it came to flying demonstrations, hence the video below, shot at Offutt AFB in 1987, depicting a Strategic Air Command airpower demo replete with a B-52 , a KC-135A and a KC-135R , a KC-10 , and even an FB-111 . The heavy jets put on one ridiculously awesome flying display, which included tight turns, high-speed passes at low-level, maneuvering formation work, and even a crazy overhead break. The KC-135A’s J57 and B-52’s TF33 engines trace the planes’ paths across the sky with ink-like smoke trails. The KC-135A’s part of the dual demonstration alongside the B-52 is the wildest of them all. One low-level pass, in particular, is especially intense. The KC-135R’s demo is a bit more subdued, but the KC-10 that follows it is downright amazing. The huge tri-jet tanker wheels around the sky with remarkable agility, executing steep bank turns and climbs. By the time the FB-111 comes along in the second video, it almost looks tame. There are some great little quotes in there as well, like “that is fucking impressive!” when the B-52 does its first pass and guns its eight engines. But the best has to be “take this Muammar!” just before the FB-111’s high-speed pass. It doesn’t get more 1980s than that! In the 33 years since this video was filmed, safety restrictions placed on air show demonstrations and flybys have grown ever more heavy-handed. After the crash of a B-52 practicing for an air show at Fairchild AFB in Washington State in 1994, restrictions got far more invasive for the big jet demonstrations. Today, even what seems like a benign planned flyover can ruin a pilot’s career. As such, this video is truly a time capsule of sorts that depicts conditions that will never occur again.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 13, 2020","Ford Class Of Supercarriers May End After Four Ships, Navy Eyeing Smaller Carriers: Report","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the hottest debates in the world of defense procurement and strategy surrounds the role that aircraft carriers will play in the future, one in which their ability to operate within striking distance of enemy shores is increasingly questioned . This issue has many facets, including air wing composition, the physical size of the carriers themselves, their propulsion type, shipbuilding capacity, force size, and more. Price is also a huge factor. With the troubled Ford class supercarrier topping out at around $15B for a single hull , competing priorities like the massively expensive Columbia Class nuclear ballistic missile submarine and the Navy’s dream of substantially expanding its surface combatant fleet are putting the viability of America’s current supercarrier concept of tactical naval aviation power projection ever more in question. In a fabulous story by Breakdefense.com’s Paul McLeary, the future of America’s carrier force structure is brought into focus, or at least the planning for that future force structure. I highly suggest you read the piece in full , but it is worth breaking down some of the main points here as they will have a substantial impact on many of the topics we have been covering or will be covering going forward. The rare sight of three supercarriers operating alongside each other in the Pacific. , USN Some of the key points include: The Future Carrier 2030 Task Force will soon be introduced and will partake in a six-month-long study looking at the viability and survivability of aircraft carriers in reflection of emerging threats that put into question carriers’ their ability to project relevant combat capability forward during a peer-state conflict. This task force will look to predict threats beyond 2030, as well as the shipbuilding sensitivities that will emerge during that time period. The findings could deeply influence the Navy’s future aircraft carrier procurement and operations strategy. The study will run in conjunction with the ongoing deep-dive into the Navy’s force structure and shipbuilding requirements over the next 30 years that is being headed-up by Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist. Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly is heading up the Future Carrier 2030 Task Force. The two initiatives could end up being at odds with one another, at least in some manner. Four Ford class supercarriers are currently planned, the last of which will be delivered around 2032. It is possible, if not likely, that the class’s procurement will end at that time and new class will take its place. This will likely be a cheaper and smaller design. A possible shift in the use of carriers from front line operations to controlling large swathes of ocean and bolstering critical supply lines during a peer state conflict is emerging. USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her strike group trained for such a role in the run-up to the Army’s massive Defender-Europe exercise . The “Ike” and its escorts simulated crossing the Atlantic under contested conditions—a reality that the Navy says has already manifested itself . This was the first exercise of its kind since 1986 and included fighting off simulated submarine, electronic warfare, and aerial attacks. In other words, the ships basically fought their way across the Atlantic and provided protection for a convoy loaded with land warfare reinforcements. The Navy’s current carrier deployment model is considered broken and it is restricted by the force structure that underpins it. The Lightning Carrier concept , which The War Zone was the first to report on , is being closely examined as a way to bolster and help redefine the Navy’s power projection options. Also, pushing detachments of F-35Bs ashore to austere airfields could be part of future air combat fighting doctrine. These are all issues that we have discussed before, but it appears they are picking up steam within the Pentagon. Amphibious ships turned Lightning Carriers would not replace the Navy’s big-deck carriers, but any carrier that comes after the Ford class is likely to be smaller. USS Ford undergoing trials off the Virginia coast. , USN Of course, our readers are familiar with the arguments in favor of smaller carriers and the benefits they could bring to the U.S. Navy, although it remains a bizarrely heated topic. While even stepping away from 100,000-ton displacement supercarriers to smaller, but still large, 65,000-ton designs is seen by many as sacrilege, pivoting from nuclear back to conventional fuel is even more controversial. Regardless, it seems that the powers that be within the Pentagon are finally coming to terms with the opportunity cost imposed by chasing an all supercarrier procurement strategy and how unsustainable it has become. Even disposing of nuclear-powered supercarriers once their service lives have ended is becoming a hugely costly endeavor . This is in addition to the concerns surrounding investing so much into so few hulls in light of the shifting geopolitical winds and America’s potential enemies’ growing anti-access, area-denial capabilities. The 65,000 ton displacement Queen Elizabeth class in CATOBAR configuration., BAE Systems As it sits now, we could be just six months away from the emergence of a major shift in American naval strategy, one that could degrade the notion that huge nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are the best way of achieving America’s national defense goals.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 9, 2020",Captured Narco Jet Loaded With 69 Bales Of Cocaine Is Biggest Bust In Belize History,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just after midnight on February 27th, 2020, a suspicious aircraft was tracked moving toward Belize airspace by a neighboring country’s counter-narcotics air asset. At just after four in the morning local time, the plane set down on an austere airstrip in Belize. Authorities, working off actionable intelligence regarding where the plane had landed, swarmed the area to find a Gulfstream II (G1159A) business jet loaded with a whopping 69 bales of cocaine on board. According to Belize’s Channel 5 News , it is the biggest captured haul of its kind for the country. Chester Williams, Commissioner of the Belize Police Department, the country’s top law enforcement officer, stated the following about the drug smuggling jet’s crew and those involved with transferring the illicit stash: “Inside the plane was sixty-nine bales of what we suspected to be cocaine. Those sixty-nine bales amounted to two thousand, seventy parcels of suspected cocaine. We also found in the area two M-16 rifles and some masks. We believed that those persons who were involved in the plane landing might have seen us coming into the area from a distance and by the time we got to the location they had disappeared. We still have teams in the area searching, with the hope that we will find person or persons. The drugs were subsequently moved from the location. … Let me say that there was no monies being moved, it was only drugs. No money was found on the plane or within the area of the plane. The investigation into the plane landing with a view to ascertain who the players are continues. Fingerprints were lifted from the plane and those prints will be sent to the AFIS, as well as to the Interpol to see if we can make a match either locally or internationally. We believe that the print might be for the pilot so we’ll see if there is anything on the pilot on Interpol database because Interpol does deal with fingerprints as well. So we’ll check to see if there is a match where that is concerned.” Departamento de Defensa de Belice It is not clear what country’s aerial assets were tracking the plane before it landed in Belize, but Mexico has these capabilities, some of which are quite advanced and provided by the United States . Other countries in the region have their own capabilities for monitoring or even intercepting these flights, any of which may have given authorities in neighboring Belize high-quality intelligence about the flight. The plane was supposedly first spotted over Venezuela. Departamento de Defensa de Belice The GII did not have a visible registration, which isn’t uncommon for drug-running operations. Blanking out the aircraft’s registration number or donning one that is totally fake is common. These GII aircraft are largely out of service now around the globe, making them incredibly cheap to acquire for this type of one-way flight. They can be had for the low hundreds of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars, depending on their airworthiness and overall condition. They can also carry a large payload, both in terms of volume and mass, which makes them even more attractive to drug cartels. 69 bales filled with bricks of cocaine is an amazing amount of contraband for one business jet to smuggle on a single trip. We are not sure at this time how many kilos are in an average bale of cocaine, but the street price of this load is likely staggering. The use of business aircraft to smuggle drugs throughout Central and South America has exploded in recent years and especially in recent months . This is the fourth narco aircraft to have landed and been seized in Belize in 2020 alone. The Cartels’ increased use of this smuggling tactic has led some countries to adopt hardline measures in recent years , but nothing has kept the flights from continuing and even increasing. A similar increase in narco submarine traffic and interdictions have also been noted as of late. Clearly the cartels see the use of these aircraft as a net positive risk-reward equation, regardless of massive seizures like this one. For countries with limited aerial capabilities, like Belize, they are uniquely challenging to deal with. One thing is certain, there appears to be a major appetite for cheap business aircraft in that part of the world for these nefarious operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 30, 2019",This Is The Letter The Navy Sent A Congressman Who Was Demanding Answers About UFOs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year, Congressman Mark Walker, a Republican from North Carolina and a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, wrote a letter to the U.S. Navy demanding answers regarding sightings of what are commonly referred to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs. Now, The War Zone has obtained a complete copy of the service’s response to these questions about how it is recording and assessing incidents involving what it calls unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, which the lawmaker has already said he felt was frustratingly insufficient. On Mar. 5, 2020, the Navy released an unredacted copy of the letter, which then-Undersecretary of the Navy Thomas Modly wrote on July 31, 2019, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Politico was first to report on this letter, after obtaining a copy, in September 2019, but did not publish or otherwise reproduce it in full. Walker had sent his initial letter, addressed to then-Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer, on July 16, 2019, and had made a copy publicly available on July 29, which the War Zone reported on at the time. It is also worth noting that Modly has been Acting Secretary of the Navy since Spencer resigned in November 2019. “There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled training ranges and designated air space in recent years,” Modly wrote in this July 31 response. “The Department of the Navy (DON) takes these reports very seriously and continues to log sightings and fully investigate the accounts.” You can read the full letter below. USN via FOIA Modly’s letter makes no mention of a number of high profile UAP incidents involving Navy F/A-18C/D Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets, dating back to at least 2004. You can read more about these particular events in detail in these past War Zone stories . It also does not discuss any Navy connection to the Advanced Aerospace Threat and Identification Program (AATIP), or its predecessor, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications (AAWSA) program, which existed for various periods of time within the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. You can find out more about those programs in these previous War Zone pieces . “The wide proliferation and availability of inexpensive unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has increasingly made airspace de-confliction an issue for our aviators. Naval aircrews have been provided reporting guidance to determine the frequency and location of UAS operating in training areas,” Modly wrote to Walker. “The guidance supports objective, data-driven analysis of incursions. The DON continues to dedicate resources to the tracking and investigation of reports that could affect the safety of our aircrews.” Walker’s original letter was very clearly asking for information about the highly publicized incidents that fighter pilots had reported both to their superiors and in the press, which involved purported flying craft capable of extreme levels of speed and maneuverability. The Congressman’s inquiry was not explicitly concerned about incidents involving smaller drones breaching restricted airspace around U.S. military facilities or threatening U.S. forces overseas, which has also become an increasing issue in recent years. “The DON is aligned with the Department of Defense (DoD) and interagency partners on this effort,” Modly’s letter continues. “The DON is leveraging established relationships with sister Services, other DoD offices, the U.S. Intelligence community and other U.S. government agencies that will help us to better understand these incursions into training areas.” Modly’s letter ends by saying that the Navy would continue to work with the House of Representatives via the House Armed Services Committee, of which Walker is not a member. It does not promise to provide him, or the House Committee on Homeland Security, any of the additional information or data on reported UAP sightings, or “ physical evidence ” thereof, that he sought. Walker had sent his letter in the first place because of his position that the reported UAP incidents represented a threat to Homeland Security, including to commercial and civilian aircraft, as well as military ones, flying in U.S. airspace. Walker’s position is not entirely unreasonable and The War Zone has reported in the past that some of the UAP sightings worried naval aviators for the same basic safety reasons, among other things. The congressman’s comments to Politico last year seem perhaps even more understandable after having read the full text of Modly’s response, as well. “While I am encouraged the Under Secretary of the Navy confirmed that UAP encounters are fully investigated, there is frustration with the lack of answers to specific questions about the threat that superior aircraft flying in United States airspace may pose,” Walker told that outlet in a statement. “If the Navy believes that China or Russia possesses advanced aerospace technologies that represent a national security vulnerability, the American people have the right to know what their government is doing about it.” It’s unclear if Walker, or any other members of Congress, have followed up or otherwise succeeded in obtaining additional information on this issue. At least some Senators , as well as President Donald Trump , have received classified briefings on the UAP sightings and what the Navy has been doing in response. However, in September 2019, the Navy told Politico that it had not received any further requests from legislators on this topic since Walker’s letter. “We are going to stay on the issue and follow through like we said we wanted to do,” Walker had said in his statement at the time. Whatever the case, the general public safety and national security concerns surrounding UAP sightings that drove Walker to write his original letter certainly haven’t disappeared from the general public consciousnesses.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2020",The Navy’s Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers To Be Armed With Hypersonic Weapon Interceptors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military is developing an interceptor intended to knock down hypersonic boost-glide vehicles specifically for deployment on U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system. This comes as that service says it expects to soon send two more of those destroyers to Spain, where they would join four other ships of that class that are forward-deployed there to, among other things, provide regional missile defense coverage . U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), offered the new details on what is formally known as the Regional Glide Phase Weapon System (RGPWS) program at the annual McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington, D.C. on Mar. 4, 2020. U.S. Navy Admiral Michael Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, the service’s top officer, discussed plans for the additional forward-deployed Arleigh Burkes while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Mar. 5. Vice Admiral Hill did not specifically say which ships might eventually carry the RGPWS, but did say that this interceptor was being designed to fit inside a Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) launch cell. MDA’s budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, a public version of which came out last month, does specifically mention plans to integrate this interceptor with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, which is found on a number of Arleigh Burkes , as well as Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense sites. In the 2020 Fiscal Year, MDA will “begin Aegis Weapon System analysis to determine preliminary design modifications to support Glide Phase Weapon Control and Integration, to include physical and software required modifications,” according to the Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal. “Analysis based on initial modeling to identify system design gaps and integration challenges needed to incorporate Glide Phase Weapon Control changes in the Aegis Weapon System” will begin in the 2021 Fiscal Year. A portion of the Missile Defense Agency’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request dealing with the RGPWS interceptor and other related efforts., MDA Another portion of the Missile Defense Agency’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request dealing with the RGPWS interceptor and other related efforts., MDA In total, MDA has asked for just over $117 million in Fiscal Year 2021 for the overall “Glide Phase Defeat Weapon System” effort, which includes the development of the RGPWS interceptor and the improvements to the Aegis BMD system, as well as other supporting work. It received a little over $88.5 million in the previous fiscal cycle for these projects. Aerospace Daily was first to report the existence of the RGPWS program in December 2019. This is separate from MDA’s Hypersonic Defense Weapon System (HDWS) effort and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Glide Breaker project. Concept art that DARPA has released of its Glide Breaker interceptors knocking down incoming hypersonic boost-glide vehicles., DARPA Publicly available details about the RGPWS interceptor’s design remain limited. MDA has been clear that it is primarily intended to knock down unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, rather than air-breathing hypersonic missiles. A boost-glide vehicle uses a rocket booster to loft it to a suitable altitude and speed, after which it follows a relatively level trajectory to its target. The name of MDA’s program had also already indicated that it would be a “regional” focused system aimed at defending against hypersonic boost-glide vehicle threats in different theaters around the world, such as Europe and Asia. Russia said that its Avangard boost-glide vehicle , which rides on top of a silo-launched rocket booster taken from an earlier intercontinental ballistic missile design, entered service in late December 2019. Nearly three months earlier, China had shown off mockups of its road-mobile DF-17 , which also carries a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, for the first time at a massive military parade in Beijing. Mockups of China’s DF-17 on parade in Beijing in 2019., China Military Avangard is a nuclear-armed strategic weapon, while the DF-17 is widely reported to be a tactical weapon with a conventional warhead. The U.S. government also says that it believes the Chinese, which are developing other hypersonic weapons , are working on their own nuclear-tipped hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon, as well. Depending on the exact design of the interceptor, as well as the capabilities of the modified Aegis BMD system, it may also be capable of engaging other unpowered hypersonic threats that are emerging, including new air-launched ballistic missiles with more advanced maneuvering capabilities. Russia has already put one such system, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal , into limited operational service and China is developing its own capabilities in this regard. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wkcfNxBdWMQ With all this in mind, it’s not hard to see why there would be interest in integrating the RGPWS interceptor onto Aegis BMD-configured Arleigh Burkes , which are forward deployed to Spain, as well as Japan, first. The ships offer added flexibility to rapidly reposition themselves in response to new developments during a crisis or an actual major conflict. They can also take up station far closer to potential launch areas, an important consideration when dealing with hypersonic threats, which can cross large distances in relatively short amounts of time. Whether hypersonic weapons start an action–reaction cycle in military spending or further weaken crisis stability may depend on whether countries building these weapons, such as Russia, China and the US, can agree on ways to control their proliferation | https://t.co/wB47hzzguV pic.twitter.com/EVPrL9RbN1 — IISS News (@IISS_org) March 5, 2020 MDA has already said that the future space-based Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Sensor System will support the RGPWS, according to Aviation Week . The satellites, which MDA hopes will be in orbit within three years, will be able to detect hypersonic weapon launches inside hostile territory and then cue other sensors, including those at sea and on land, to track them ahead of a possible intercept attempt. It’s also not surprising then to have learned that the Navy is expecting to get orders to deploy the two additional Arleigh Burke to Spain. The service has opposed these missile defense-focused forward deployments in the past, arguing that it places a severe strain on its resources to have to dedicate destroyers to this mission, which consists of effectively having the ships patrol in circles for extended periods of time. However, U.S. European Command, as well as members of Congress, see the mission as critical and have apparently swayed Navy leadership for the time being. “We support the additional two DDGs to Spain,” Admiral Gilday told lawmakers on Mar. 5, using the abbreviation for guided-missile destroyer to refer to the Arleigh Burkes . “We are very supportive and right now our understanding is that the Spanish want us there in greater numbers,” Gilday continued. “Certainly the commander of U.S. European Command does.” US Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers forward-deployed to Spain., USN “Those two additional DDGs would allow us the opportunity to continue to improve our ability to get indications and warnings in the potential battlespace and also dramatically improve our ability to better command and control,” U.S. Air Force General Tod Wolters, the present head of U.S. European Command, had told the Senate Armed Services Committee during his own testimony last week. Of course, just because the RGPWS interceptor is expected to be fielded first on the Aegis BMD-configured Arleigh Burkes , there’s no reason to believe that it would necessarily remain limited to those ships. The Aegis Ashore sites use the same architecture, which would allow them to readily integrate the RGPWS, as well. There could also be foreign interest, especially from Japan, which operates Aegis BMD-equipped destroyers of its own and is planning to establish Aegis Ashore sites in the future. It’s worth noting that critics have questioned how capable any anti-hypersonic weapon interceptor might ever be due to the speed of the threats and the complexities involved in intercepting them. These are concerns that apply to ballistic missile defense broadly. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley raised his own questions about this at yet another hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Mar. 4. “There is no defense against hypersonic … you’re not gonna defend against it,” he told lawmakers “Those things are going so fast you’re not gonna get it. You gotta shoot the archer. You gotta go deep, downtown and you gotta get it on the offense.” Still, with the explosion of hypersonic weapon developments around the world in recent years, there will undoubtedly remain an interest in the potential for various layers of interceptors, as well as sensors to support them, to at least try to mitigate the threat of new hypersonic weapons. The Navy’s Aegis BMD-configured Arleigh Burke class destroyers do look set to be among the first platforms to actually carry an anti-hypersonic weapon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 23, 2020",Marines Set To Be The First To Bring Back Land-Based Tomahawk Missiles Post-INF Treaty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is on track to be the first branch of the U.S. military to re-introduce a ground-launched version of the Tomahawk cruise missile following the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , with Russia last year. Though this weapon is most often associated with strikes against targets on land , the Marines plan to primarily employ them as land-based anti-ship weapons. U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger offered details on his service’s anti-ship missile plans while testifying before Congress on Mar. 5, 2020. The Pentagon’s budget proposal for the upcoming 2021 Fiscal Year revealed that the service had requested $125 million to purchase 48 Tomahawks , but details about the exact purpose of the acquisition were kept classified initially, according to official budget documents and a report from Task and Purpose . “Part of the homework that the Navy and Marine Corps done over the past six months is how we think we are going to need to operate in the future as an integrated naval force and that means the Marine Corps assumes a role that we have not had in the past 20 years which is how do we contribute to sea control and sea denial,” Berger told lawmakers . “The Tomahawk missile is one of the tools that is going to allow us to do that.” “It could be the answer, it could be the first step towards a longer-term answer five, six, seven years from now, but what we need is long-range precision fires for a small unit, a series of units that can from ship or from shore hold adversaries’ naval force at risk,” he added. In recent years, there has been a significant revival of interest within the Marine Corps, as well as the U.S. Army, in ground-based anti-ship capabilities, especially for use in a distributed warfare environment , such as a major conflict across the wide expanses of the Pacific region. A basic breakdown of Navy and Marine Corps Tomahawk acquisition plans from the 2021 Fiscal Year budget proposal compared to the previous two fiscal cycles., DOD A portion of the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget proposal covering Marine Corps “artillery weapon system” procurement, which notes “Missile procurement details are held at higher classification.”, US Navy There are still no details on the exact variant of the Tomahawk that the Marine Corps is looking to buy or what kind of launcher they’re expecting to use to fire it. Commandant Berger’s statement that the specific goal of acquiring the missiles is to be able to “hold adversaries’ naval force at risk” strongly points to the weapons being the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST). This is a subvariant of the new Block V Tactical Tomahawk, or TACTOM, also known as the Block Va . In addition to the general performance and capability improvements found on the Block V missiles, the MST has a new multi-mode targeting system , which includes an imaging infrared sensor, radiofrequency homing, and GPS-assisted guidance, allowing it to navigate to a target area hundreds of miles away and hit moving maritime targets. The missile will also have a two-way data link allowing for course correction and other targeting updates during flight. General Dynamics first developed surface ship and submarine-launched anti-ship Tomahawks variants, known as the RGM-109B and UGM-109B , respectively, which used active radar homing seekers, in the 1980s. The U.S. Navy withdrew these missiles from service in 1994 and eventually converted them into Block IV Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) variants. Years later, Raytheon, which is the present manufacturer of the Tomahawk series, under contract to the Navy, revived the concept of a Tomahawk that could hit moving targets at sea, which subsequently led to the MST program. “Now, this is potentially game-changing capability for not a lot of cost. It’s a 1,000-mile anti-ship cruise missile. It can be used from practically our entire surface and submarine fleet,” then-Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work had said of the concept in 2015. In January, Shephard reported that the Navy’s plans to reach initial operational capability with these missiles on its ships this year had been delayed. It’s not clear if that could impact the Marine Corps timeline for fielding its land-based systems in any way. The Marines will also have to develop a ground-based launcher to employ the missiles. In August 2019, the Pentagon did demonstrate a ground-launched Tomahawk using a launch cell from a Mk 41 Vertical Launch System mounted on a trailer. However, this was clearly a very experimental system for research and development purposes rather than an operational weapon system. That test occurred very soon after the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, came to an end. The INF had prohibited the United States and Russia from developing ground-based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. Before that treaty, which the U.S. government originally signed with the Soviet Union, came into force in 1988, the U.S. Air Force had operated a ground-launched nuclear-tipped land attack version of the Tomahawk known as the BGM-109G Gryphon , which had its own four-round tractor-trailer-mounted launcher. One possibility for the Marines could be adapting its M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) launchers in some way to fire MST missiles. However, the two weapons that HIMARS is presently capable of firing, 227mm artillery rockets and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) quasi-ballistic missiles, are both substantially shorter than Tomahawk. Separately in his testimony before Congress, Commandant Berger said that the Marines planned to integrate a ground-launched version of the smaller, shorter-range Naval Strike Missile (NSM) anti-ship cruise missile onto a derivative of HIMARS called the Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires (ROGUE-F). The present concept for ROGUE-F consists of a HIMARS launcher mounted on an unmanned chassis derived from the 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) tactical truck. The U.S. Navy adopted the NSM in 2018 for its Littoral Combat Ships and also plans to integrate it into a future class of guided-missile frigates, known presently as FFG(X) . Berger’s comments about Marines being able to employ anti-ship Tomahawks “from ship or from shore” does imply that whatever launcher the service might pick, it would want one that it could lash the deck of various classes of amphibious warfare ships or other vessels and then employ from that position. The Marine Corps has already demonstrated its ability to use HIMARS in this fashion. “A ground-based anti-ship missile capability will provide anti-ship fires from land as part of an integrated naval anti-surface warfare campaign,” Commandant Berger also said in this testimony. “This forward-deployed and survivable capability will enhance the lethality of our naval forces and will help to deny our adversaries the use of key maritime terrain.” It’s also worth noting that while the MST variant of the Tomahawk is primarily intended for the anti-ship role, the Navy has already said that it will have a secondary land-attack capability. NSM has also demonstrated its ability to strike land targets , in addition to ships. A briefing slide showing existing and planned future US Navy missiles. Both the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST)/Tomahawk Block Va and Naval Strike Missile (NSM) are noted as spanning the land attack and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) roles, the latter of which refers to engaging hostile ships., USN While the Marines may be first to field a ground-launched anti-ship Tomahawk, they may not be the only service to acquire them, either. The U.S. Army is also increasingly interested in land-based anti-ship capabilities and has already expressed an interest in acquiring its own ground-launched NSMs . No matter what, the return of the ground-launched Tomahawk in the U.S. military, at least in the anti-ship role, is very much on the horizon now.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Feb 14, 2020",Can And Should B-1B Bomber Crews’ Low-Level Flying Skills Be Saved?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just three weeks ago, The War Zone published an expose on the current woes facing the Air Force’s tired B-1B Lancer bomber fleet. We were first to report the details of new measures aimed at prolonging the bomber’s life as much as possible. These included flight hour restrictions and an end to low-level terrain-following certification requirements, which was a staple of the training syllabus for its crews that enabled a major capability of the bomber to be used. This major change within the B-1B community definitely has its detractors, as well as its champions. Here’s where the debate currently stands, according to our sources. There is a fair argument to be made that low-level training, which has been the source of great airframe resource depletion, has been necessary and valid. Weapons School graduates and others who develop tactics for combat aircraft think beyond weapons delivery and look at the bigger picture, including asking themselves “How can a combat aircraft be used for effect beyond dropping weapons?” There are two common ways. Global Power As A Deterrent The first way happens in times of peace or heightened tension, or any time the presence of bombers is needed to make a statement. Bombers such as the B-1 have a long history of being pre-positioned overseas. The Air Force has historically referred to these bomber movements as “global power” deployments or exercises. The presence of bombers has an effect on regional geopolitics and military decision making. Generals and politicians alike understand this and send bombers to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom, Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean from time to time to achieve various objectives beyond normal training and deployment requirements. After being pulled from continuous deployments to Al Udeid in 2018, the B-1 fleet was recommitted to semi-regular global power missions. USAF The Show Of Force: The Main Argument For Why Low-Level Training Existed Even in times of war, a B-1 has non-kinetic capabilities, such as being able to conduct shows of force , the reason for which B-1 aircrews and combatant commanders justify low-level training. A show of force is essentially a short, low-altitude, high-speed flyby, not unlike the ones B-1s perform at air shows . During a show of force, the aircrew maximizes the impression the B-1 leaves by making the flyby as loud and abrasive as possible, usually in full afterburner and sometimes popping MJU 23/B infrared decoy flares. The objective is to threaten, intimidate, and ultimately force enemies who don’t want to be bombed into fleeing or at least ceasing fire. Shows are force are becoming more and more popular because they still save lives, but the justification and authorization threshold is much lower than that for dropping kinetic weapons. In 2015, the United States Air Force conducted 18,019 combat aircraft sorties in Afghanistan, but only employed weapons during 3,330 of them. Shows of force have been used by B-1s in maritime interdiction operations , as well. The bombers conduct these missions in collaboration with the joint interagency effort to confront cartel narcotics trafficking. Various provisions within U.S. law and the Law of Armed Conflict mean that the U.S. military can’t attack Latin American drug smugglers except in self-defense and prohibit military personnel from carrying out certain law enforcement tasks, but B-1s certainly can make their presence acutely known to traffickers. Fast-moving drug-smuggling boats from Peru, Columbia, and Bolivia have been stopped in their tracks by a B-1 show of force without a shot being fired. If you’re a smuggler on a loud boat you may not know you’re being tailed by Customs and Border Patrol, the United States Coast Guard, or even military jets. A single show of force pass from a 146-foot-long B-1 in full afterburner low over the waves has been known to make smugglers hastily abandon ship. In that eventuality, the Coast Guard moves in and picks the smugglers up out of the water, commonly without incident. In 2016, the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid tried to limit B-1 shows of force to 2,000 feet above ground level. The deployed B-1 community there prepared an extensive and comprehensive presentation illustrating that 1,000 feet above ground level was the optimal altitude for shows of force. They narrowly won that debate. USAF The Argument For Real-Life Low-Level Training B-1 operators further justify low-level training by pointing out that simulator training is insufficient. They say the simulator is ideal for crews training on complex procedures while not expending actual flight hours, but it can’t adequately prepare crews for doing a terrain-following check (preparing the AN/APQ-164 radar for terrain-following flight operations) in a combat environment, then doing a ‘letdown’ to a show of force through clouds and around terrain. Aircrews express that the sensation of executing that letdown at night is like descending into a black hole, which requires confidence, experience, and awareness to pull off in combat. There’s nothing like the real thing . The terrain-following check and letdown are occasional prerequisites for the show of force and if that show of force ends up causing insurgents to retreat, cease fire, or surrender, B-1 aircrews affirm the years of low-level training and expense of the airframe B-1B fleet’s collective airframe life were worth it. The Argument Against Traditional Low-Level Training The detractors of low-level training don’t contest how valuable shows of force are as a capability. They offer the proposition that legacy low-level training has been excessive. Case in point: In 2018, Dyess Air Force Base proposed lengthening its frequent low-level training route , known as Instrument Route (IR) 178, to 544 nautical miles long. In 35 years and 12,000 combat sorties, no B-1 has ever flown a low-level ingress to contested or denied airspace. In our previous article, we outlined how the B-1 Systems Program Office, along with B-1 maintainers and engineers, generally agree that low-level training has been one of the if not the biggest source of fleet wear and tear. With these factors considered, you can’t deny the detractors have a point. Especially considering that low-level show of force maneuvers are generally conducted over a single location, not along some long meandering route. A Compromise Solution What if B-1 crews continued to be trained and certified on low-level flight for the preservation of their show of force capability, but drastically shortened the length of their training routes? More specifically, can B-1 aircrews accomplish and satisfy show of force training with a terrain-following check and letdown as described above upon returning to base and a flyby before entering the traffic pattern? Dyess Air Force Base already has an operating control tower and protected Class C airspace that can’t be intruded upon by aircraft that aren’t speaking with local controllers. Ellsworth Air Force Base is similar, but has Class D airspace . There are protections and increased safety offered near the B-1’s home airfields that aren’t offered on long low-level training routes. Alternatively, this training could be executed periodically in secure airspace, such as bombing ranges and other areas away from populated areas. USAF The Risks Posed By Traditional Low-Level Training There are other problems with legacy low-level training beyond airframe wear and tear. These problems are not unique to B-1s, either. Low-level training routes, such as IR 178, are depicted on civil aeronautical charts, but no airspace is reserved or set aside for them specifically. Civil and military aircraft share the airspace and they don’t have to talk to each other or controllers. In most cases, they can’t because the majority of civil aircraft don’t have UHF band radios that the military does. Previously, collisions between military aircraft conducting low-level training and civil aircraft have happened and are a risk that must be mitigated . In addition, low-altitude high-speed flight gives aircrews fewer chances to egress a failing or crashing aircraft and increases chances of colliding with terrain or obstructions . Over the years, the statistics have caught up. Of the eight B-1 crashes , four of them, tail numbers 84-0052 , 86-0106 , 85-0078 , and 85-0091 crashed during low-level training. 84-0052 had six crew on board and three of them died. The second two crashes were fatal for all aircrew members. The final, 85-0091 in 2013 , crashed in Montana as it was exiting a low-level training route. Thankfully, all crew members survived, but it was only one of two out of the four B-1 crashes involving low-levels with no fatalities. The four other B-1 crashes resulted from various situations not related to low-level training. Eliminating traditional low-level training in the B-1 community immediately decreases the risk of losses of life, which is paramount. A distant, but still important second consideration is the risk of losing the aircraft themselves. If we crash our nation’s military assets in training they can’t be employed in actual defense of our national interests. USAF It Doesn’t Have To Be All Or Nothing, Does It? Performing short flybys for show of force training may reduce the readiness of aircrews for long-range low-level missions, and as a result, remove that capability from the bomber’s portfolio, but the concept would potentially allow aircrews to perform show of force maneuvers with confidence over the battlefield. It’s hard for anyone to justify flying a B-1 at low altitude for 544 nautical miles just to train for show of force maneuvers. There can be no doubt this conversation has been had in formal meetings many times by those who are in charge of and develop the tactics for the B-1 program. They were brilliant enough to foster the B-1’s evolution from a nuclear deterrent into a precision strike close air support platform, and they were thoughtful enough to integrate the show of force concept soon after. Whatever transpired in those meetings, the decision was made for the entire life of the B-1 to continue training for and certifying aircrews on long-duration low-level flights, and now the bill for those decisions has come due. Yet it seems odd that this has come down to an all or nothing proposition. Training for show of force operations can still be accomplished with far less impact on the B-1’s longevity by simply tailoring low-level training to that tactic specifically and not to low-level interdiction, which was originally meant for use during World War III. With any luck, the Air Force will get creative about this issue and allow for the B-1 force to retain a highly useful tactic while also preserving the B-1’s airframe life for as long as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2020",Turkey And Russia Announce New Buffer Zone In Syria After Brutal Spate Of Violence,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey and Russia have cut a deal that will put a new ceasefire into place between forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and anti-regime groups in northwestern Syria. It also lays out plans for a formal buffer zone between the two sides that Turkish and Russian troops will patrol together. This follows a massive burst in fighting in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province, which, in turn, prompted a major Turkish military intervention after dozens of Turkish troops died there in airstrikes last week. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, standing side-by-side, announced the agreement following a face-to-face meeting in Moscow on Mar. 5, 2020. The two leaders had agreed to meet in the aftermath of still murky airstrikes that killed at least 33 Turkish soldiers in Idlib on Feb. 27. After days of drone and artillery strikes on Assad’s forces, and increased support to Turkish-backed Syrian forces, Turkey officially launched Operation Spring Shield into northwestern Syria on Mar. 1. The Syrian regime has lost multiple fixed-wing combat jets and helicopters, dozens of armored vehicles and artillery pieces, and thousands of troops in the recent fighting. “Considering all the recent developments, a new status quo is inevitable in Idlib,” Erdogan said at the press briefing on the agreement. “We have deployed additional military units to Syria to ensure regional stability. Our priority is to enable de-escalation in Idlib.” “We have always solved our problems by working together,” Putin said. “Today was no different.” This is the full text of today’s agreement between #Russia and #Turkey on #Syria , ending a two-week escalation and establishing new dynamics in the north west. #Erdogan #Putin pic.twitter.com/kWIN6FD5og — Hassan I. Hassan (@hxhassan) March 5, 2020 The agreement contains three major provisions, the first of which is a ceasefire which will go into effect at 12:01 AM local time on Mar. 6. This halt to “military actions” is limited to “the line of contact in the Idlib de-escalation area.” In 2017, Turkey and Russia, together with Iran, agreed to turn Idlib into an ostensibly neutral safe zone, a deal you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The second and third provisions cover the establishment of a buffer zone that will extend six kilometers, or just under 4 miles, both north and south of the M4 highway in northwestern Syria. “Specific parameters of the functioning of the security corridor will be agreed between the Defense Ministries of the Turkish Republic and the Russian Federation within seven days,” the text of the agreement says. Turkish and Russian troops will begin actively patrolling along the M4 to enforce this corridor starting on Mar. 15. A map with Syria’s Idlib province highlighted. The western end of the M4 highway is also visible., Google Maps The deal represents an immediate territorial gain for Assad, as it creats a hard front line that pushes Turkish-backed forces north of the M4 and cedes areas south of that highway, which had been part of the original de-escalation zone, to his regime. The Syrian regime also remains in control of the M5 highway, which it recently recaptured and is a major strategic route . At the same time, the Syrian government’s ability to reassert authority over all of Idlib looks beyond reach for the forseeable future. This is despite Turkey and Russia “reaffirming their commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic” in this new agreement. A Russian Ministry of Defense map showing the boundaries of the Idlib de-escalation zone as of 2017., Russian Ministry of Defense The plans for joint patrols along the western end of the M4 sound like they will mirror patrols that Turkish and Russian forces presently conduct on parts of that same highway in northeastern Syria. In October 2019, the two countries agreed to create another buffer zone along that end of the Turkish-Syrian border. This followed a unilateral Turkish intervention earlier that month that was primarily aimed at ejecting U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces from that same area. For practical purposes, all of these deals have left Turkey in de facto control of a wide swath of northern Syria.

Fighting looks set to continue right up until the ceasefire begins.

For his part, Assad has never given up his claim to Idlib, or any other part of Syrian territory presently under the control of foreign or foreign-backed forces. In 2018, despite the designation of Idlib as a “de-escalation zone” the previous year, the Syrian regime, with support from Russia, moved again to recapture the province in the face of persistent attacks from Turkish-backed militants there. Another deal between Turkey and Russia brought those plans to a halt and allowed Turkish forces to establish dozens of observation posts in the region with the goal of halting further attacks from anti-regime forces. Those Turkish outposts have since become their own point of contention between Assad and the Turkish government. Notable absences in Turkish, Russian Idlib deal: • The fate of Turkish observation stations that are encircled by the Assad regime • Refugees who are recently displaced by the fighting • The fate of the territories captured by Assad since May. — Ragıp Soylu (@ragipsoylu) March 5, 2020 The desired end to anti-regime violence emanating from Idlib never materialized and Assad has launched a number of subsequent offensives, the most recent of which began, again with Russian support, in January . Erdogan’s government, which has been staunchly opposed to Assad since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, steadily increasing its involvement in the fighting in Idlib in response, including indirect and direct support for various anti-regime groups. An explosion in the use of shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS, against both Syrian and Russian combat aircraft flying over the region, was one particularly notable development. Armed Turkish drones , as well as F-16 Viper fighter jets, also proved to be an especially decisive factor in keeping Assad’s forces at bay.

It’s worth noting that Turkey and Russia both say Syria was responsible for those strikes, but there is evidence to suggest Russian jets may have actually carried them out. Still, despite all of this, Turkey and Russia seem most interested in finding a stable status quo that meets their particular agendas. Turkey appears intent on neutering Assad’s military capabilities if it cannot secure his ouster in some way for good. Russia’s main reason for being in Syria in the first place is continued access to geopolitically strategic naval and air base facilities along the Eastern Meditterren Sea, which does not require the Syrian regime to exercise authority over any significant portion of the country. Ergodan and Putin themselves have an obvious interest in maintaining the relations between their two countries, too. The increasingly dictatorial Erdogan has moved closer to the Russian sphere of influence in recent years and away from his NATO allies, especially the United States. The Turkish government’s purchase of Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has caused particular strain with other members of the Alliance, even causing the U.S. government to eject Turkey from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. “There is always something to talk about, but now the situation in a well-known area – Idlib – has escalated so much that it requires our direct, personal conversation,” Putin said in remarks with Erodgan before the meeting that led to the new agreement on Idlib. “We need to talk about the situation that has developed to date so that nothing like this happens again, and so that it does not destroy the Russian-Turkish relations, which I, and as I know, you too, treat very carefully.” Erdogan and Putin shake hands ahead of the meeting where they finalized their latest deal regarding Syria’s Idlib province., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP For the moment, that relationship has led yet another new status quo to emerge in Idlib and the rest of northwestern Syria. Unfortunately, Ergodan and Putin still face serious challenges in preserving their latest deal and the course of the Syrian conflict, as a whole, remains uncertain as ever.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2020",One Example From The Army’s Tiny Fleet Of Stretch Limo-Like Humvees Is Still Soldiering On,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army recently posted pictures online of a rare six-door stretch Humvee variant. The service originally acquired a small number of these vehicles more than a decade ago as part of a program to develop a mobile communication and data-sharing network. At least one of these war wagons, which are reminiscent of commercial Hummer limousines, remains in service and still supporting research and development efforts. The Army’s Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center posted the pictures of one of these stretch Humvees recently, but they were actually taken last October at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. The vehicle is 50 percent longer than a standard four-door Humvee and has a station wagon-style rear end with a pair of doors that open outward. A look inside the rear of the Army stretched Humvee at Aberdeen Proving Ground in October 2019., US Army An employee of the C5ISR Center works on a laptop inside the stretched Humvee at Aberdeen Proving Ground in October 2019., US Army It’s not entirely clear when or where the Army acquired these Humvees. A May 2006 blog post on a site called Flash Off-Road suggests that a commercial dealer in the Los Angeles, California area built six of them around that time for the service. The large windows on either side of the vehicle’s rear end are certainly a commercial feature found on civilian Hummer H1s in the station wagon configuration. It is very possible that a company that did, or still does, civilian H1 limousine conversions was responsible for making these Humvees for the Army. The pictures Flash Off-Road obtained in 2006 showed one of the vehicles with a roof-mounted air conditioning unit, as well as a large roof rack – another commercial Hummer option – and at least 12 coaxial cable jacks at the rear. The blog speculated at the time that these might be destined for border patrol work. A commercial Hummer H1 with a station wagon-style rear end featuring the same large windows found on the Army’s six-door stretch variant., Michael Gil via Wikimedia A Hummer H1 stretch limousine conversion., Franco Folini via Wikimedia However, the first job for these six-door Humvees was actually as part of the Army’s Mounted Battle Command On The Move ( MBCOTM ) network program. Work on MBCOTM began in 2002, but it became a formal “program of record” in June 2005, which also aligns with the appearance of the stretch Humvee nearly a year later. The Army had envisioned MBCOTM as a so-called “B-Kit” system that it could integrate, in full or in part, onto a variety of different vehicles, including regular size and stretch Humvees, the M1130 Stryker Command Vehicle variant, and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle . Personnel inside would have access to various radios and other networking systems to provide line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communications, via Milstar communications satellites, and data sharing from both fixed positions and on the move. “Essentially it is a TOC (Tactical Operations Center) on wheels,” Rodney Young, then the MBCOTM Project Manager, said in an official interview circa 2006. “It makes the commander mobile in a way like never before.” “The biggest issue with the whole design was just fitting it into the HMMWV [High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle],” Pat DeGroodt, the lead systems engineer for the MBCOTM program, said in another official interview circa 2006. There are pictures of standard size Humvees with different MBCOTM kit configurations, but the extended length variant could only have offered additional space inside for various systems and personnel to operate them.

The Army reportedly planned to begin fielding “command Humvee” variants that year, with MBCOTM kits for the M1130 Strykers and Bradleys in 2007 and 2008, respectively. One of the six-door stretch Humvees equipped with a prototype MBCOTM system, including the large satellite communications antenna dome at the rear., US Army It’s not entirely clear why, but the Army ultimately canceled the MBCOTM program in 2008. The requirement for this kind of on-to-move wideband communications and data-sharing capability didn’t go away and the service has pursued a number of similar develops since then, including the Mission Command On the Move ( MCOTM ) system and, more recently, the Warfighter Information Net-Tactical (WIN-T). A 6×6 BAE Systems Caiman Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) vehicle equipped with the MCOTM system., US Army Interest in these capabilities within the U.S. military has hardly been limited to the Army, either. Other U.S. government agencies, as well as foreign military forces , have been pursuing similar systems for the same reasons. In 2018, The War Zone was first to report on a six-door SUV based on a Ford F350 Super Duty chassis that the U.S. Secret Service had put into service as its own new mobile command center, replacing earlier four-door Chevy Suburban-based Roadrunner vehicles. The six-door Ford F350-based platform that the US Secret Service is now using as a mobile command post., The Armored Group The Army does appear to have abandoned any interest in its militarized Humvee limos as platforms to carry its new networking systems. WIN-T components are now fielded across a mix of 4×4 M-ATV mine-resistant vehicles and standard size Humvees, as well as Stryker wheeled armored vehicles and tactical trucks. M-ATV and Humvee-mounted portions of the WIN-T system., US Army A Stryker wheeled armored vehicle equipped with components of the WIN-T system., General Dynamics The stretch Humvee at Aberdeen shows that at least one of these vehicles remains in the Army’s inventory. That the C5ISR Center is in possession of it isn’t particularly surprising. The Army’s Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center’s (CERDEC) Command and Control Directorate (C2D) built all of the prototype MBCOTM systems. CERDEC got a name change and became the C5ISR Center following the establishment of Army Futures Command in 2018. It’s not entirely clear what the C5ISR center was using this particular Humvee for last year. It had two roof racks covering the entire top of the vehicle and a number of small antennas on top at the rear. The panel where the coaxial jacks used to be was blocked off, but wires were visible feeding through that space from the antennas to various systems inside. A close up of the rear end of the six-door stretch Humvee at Aberdeen Proving Ground in October 2019. , US Army The captions on the recently released pictures offer limited details, but do say that the vehicle was being used for “research on positioning, navigation and timing systems.” The U.S. military as a whole is increasingly concerned about the very real threat of an opponent jamming or spoofing GPS signals , limiting or outright denying the availability of that satellite navigation network to American forces or rendering it dangerously unreliable. This has driven demands for what is often referred to as Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) to protect against these kinds of “navigation warfare” attacks. The Army, as well as the other branches of the U.S. military, have been exploring a wide range of technological solutions and other operational concepts to provide a layered approach to providing this critical Assured PNT capability. You can read about those efforts in these past War Zone pieces . It’s interesting to note that U.S. Army Major General Chamberlain, the Director for Army Budget for the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller, specifically highlighted work on a “low-earth-orbit satellite, which will provide the Army access to assured position, navigation and timing information under conditions where the global positioning system may be limited or denied” while briefing reporters on the service’s most recent budget proposal for the 2021 Fiscal Year in February. However, there’s no indication that the Humvee was involved in work on this particular program. Whatever the case, at least one of the Army’s Humvee command and control wagons is still running and helping in the development of new capabilities to ensure that American troops have access to the information they need and when they need it.
