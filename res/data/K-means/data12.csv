By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Taiwanese Air Force is reportedly getting closer to accepting its first four updated F-16V Viper fighter jets, part of a critical upgrade project for the country’s fleet of older F-16A/B aircraft. That program is just one of a number of modernization efforts its air arm is pursuing as it struggles to keep pace with China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s developments, which include fifth generation stealth fighters , new missiles , and more . On Dec. 26, 2017, Taiwanese outlet Up Media reported that the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) had finished converting the initial four F-16Vs and that American test pilots had arrived to test the aircraft. Lockheed Martin, which developed the upgrade package, has been working together with the Taiwanese state-run aviation firm on the project. Flight testing is set to begin in 2018 and the full upgrade program is supposed to wrap up some time between 2022 and 2023. The updated aircraft offer significantly expanded capabilities over the F-16A/B Taiwan’s air force presently flies, which first began arriving in the 1990s. The upgrade package adds new mission computers, navigation equipment, large color multifunction displays, Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) transponders, updated electronic warfare suite, and the Link-16 tactical data link, among other additions. Most significantly, though, the F-16Vs have an AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) , an active electronically scanned array type. This unit scans faster and is more precise at longer ranges than the AN/APG-66 mechanically-scanned types in the F-16A/B aircraft. Other air arms , including the U.S. Air Force , have already recognized that SABR on its own is a cost effective way to squeeze more capability out of older Viper types. It is also worth noting that Taiwan was the first country to purchase the F-16V upgrade, although at the time of its origination it hadn’t yet been given that designation by Lockheed Martin. This adaptable upgrade roadmap is becoming increasingly attractive to global F-16 operators. A Taiwanese Air Force F-16B., Kyodo via AP When the U.S. approved the deal in 2011, there were also plans to deliver new jamming pods, targeting pods, and various new weapons, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, the CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon cluster bomb , and various laser and GPS precision guided munitions. The radar absorbent Have Glass II II surface treatment for the F-16 were also part of the deal. Earlier in 2017 , the United States approved another arms sale that could include AGM-88B High Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM) and AGM-154C Joint Stand Off Weapons (JSOW), both of which could also be important options for Taiwan’s F-16 fleet, helping them suppress enemy air defenses and giving them a stand-off strike capability during a conflict. Up Media added in its report that the first batch of AIM-9X missiles , which have more range, are more maneuverable, and have an improved seeker head capable of high off-boresight cueing via a helmet mounted display , would arrive in 2018. All of this will be essential if Taiwan expects to have even a chance of holding its own with the Chinese military during a crisis. In September 2017, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force officially declared that the fifth generation J-20 stealth fighter had entered operational service . In addition, China is in the process of adding new capabilities to its own still very capable fourth generation Su-27 Flanker derivatives , as well as expanding its fleet of airborne early warning and electronic warfare aircraft , as well. A medium weight, less complex stealth fighter, the FC-31/J-31 , is also deep in development. At the same time, China has substantially increased its ground and sea arsenal , including the development of improved amphibious warfare capabilities , new long range ballistic missiles and other anti-access/area denial technologies that both present a challenge to Taiwanese forces and might delay or otherwise limit the ability of the United States to intervene in a crisis. In October 2017, Chinese premier Xi Jinping said would use any means necessary to “defeat” any Taiwanese bid for independence. It remains unclear how many of Taiwan’s F-16A/B aircraft will actually go through the conversion process, though. When work began on the initial four planes this year, IHS Jane’s reported that AIDC was in the process of building facilities that could handle conversion work on up to 24 aircraft per year. If the project starts in earnest in 2018 and runs through the end of 2023, this would only account for approximately 120 of Taiwan’s more than 140 existing F-16s. The saga of Taiwan’s efforts to either acquire newer F-16s or upgrade its existing aircraft has been going on for more than a decade already. In 2006, then U.S. President George W. Bush and his administration delayed approval of a Taiwanese request for F-16C/D aircraft, ostensibly because Taiwan’s political opposition had blocked the requisite funding. The first prototype F-16V conversion., Lockheed Martin However, many observers felt that this was actually an attempt to avoid further angering the government in Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be an integral part of its territory and does not recognize the authority of its nominally independent government. Though the United States officially has a “ One China Policy ” that recognizes only the People’s Republic of China with its capital in Beijing, it does reserves the right to sell weapons to Taipei under the Taiwan Relations Act , also known as Public Law 96-8. Lockheed Martin actively pushed to let the sale of C/D aircraft proceed. In one 2010 briefing to U.S. Air Force officials, the defense contractor argued that without the deal it might have to shut down the Viper production line – something that has not come to pass – and that the United States might have no choice but to sell Taiwan F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to help it keep up with Chinese developments. The briefing also said that other American and western options would be difficult for Taiwan to obtain given those companies’ commercial aviation deals to the Chinese government. A low quality scan of one of the slides from the 2010 briefing Lockheed Martin gave to members of the US Air Force., USAF via FOIA President Barack Obama and his administration eventually blocked the sale of the C/D aircraft entirely, offering the upgrade plan instead. President Donald Trump initially took an openly pro-Taiwan stance and has routinely criticized China and its business practices in particular. This suggested the U.S. government might be more willing to expand and fast-track defense and security related deals under the Taiwan Relations Act. In June 2017, the Trump administration did approve $1.3 billion in new arms sales to Taiwan. However, Trump and his cabinet have since gone back and forth in their rhetoric and policies toward China, at times sanctioning entities in the country and lauding its government , as they seek to court the country’s help or otherwise goad it into helping contain an increasingly belligerent North Korea . Taiwan’s defense budget and competing priorities within the country’s air force might also slow the F-16 upgrade project or curtail how many aircraft ultimately receive the updates. As of January 2017, The Diplomat reported that Taiwanese authorities had set aside less than $4 billion of the more than $5 billion that the United States had estimated the full package, including the associated weaponry, would cost. It’s not entirely clear whether Taiwan’s F-16V upgrades include an overhaul of the basic airframe either, which could become necessary to further extend their overall service life. The U.S. Air Force is in the process of putting some of its older F-16C/D aircraft through a service life extension program and has already allotted a certain amount of the production of those components to support allies and partners through foreign military sales. At the same time, the Taiwanese Air Force is also interested in upgrading its fleet of nearly 50 French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets, which first entered service in the 1990s and have become increasingly accident prone . Taiwan and France have been in discussions about the scope and cost of such an update package since June 2017, which could include extending the life of the associated Mica and Magic 2 air-to-air missiles. A Taiwanese Mirago 2000-5., Toshiro Aoki via Wikimedia According to Defense News, Taiwanese legislators are withholding any funding for the upgrades until they receive a formal written report with more details. Seperately, Taiwan is suing France to recover bribes officials had paid during the course of the initial Mirage 2000 purchase. In 2010, the government in Taipei won a similar suit over kickbacks relating to its French-made Lafayette -class frigates. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who the Chinese government sees as a strong advocate for the island becoming an independent nation, is pushing for less reliance on foreign arms imports, too. This might further prompt a shift in resources from upgrading existing aircraft to developing new, indigenous types. “In the current phase, we are committed to building our own military jets and submarines, which, particularly for young engineers and researchers, will create many new job opportunities,” Tsai said in October 2017 . “I trust that a more robust defense industry will not only strengthen our military capabilities, but prove beneficial to our overall industrial development as well.” But the development cycle for even a new fourth generation jet could be long and expensive for Taiwan and even more so in the island’s case given the political sensitivities and restrictions foreign firms face when dealing with the government in Taipei. These factors almost certainly preclude the country from even considering partnering with an outside contractor to develop a true fifth generation capability and have so far kept it out of the U.S.-led Joint Strike Fighter program . In the 1980s, Lockheed Martin did help Taiwan in its earlier effort to develop the so-called Indigenous Defense Fighter , also known as the F-CK-1 or Ching-kuo , after the U.S. government blocked sales of Northrop F-20 Tigersharks and F-16s. It did so within the limits of American export laws, though, and the company itself has since derided the design as the “best aircraft the U.S. State Department ever designed.” The public debut of the prototype F-CK-1D, in the foreground, and F-CK-1C, in the background, in 2007.

The F-CK-1C/D Hsiang Sheng variants including an all-new glass cockpit and updated electronic warfare capabilities, among other improvements. The country dropped more extensive plans to add low-observable features to the design, as well as extend its range with conformal fuel tanks, but is now in the process of developing new indigenous air-to-air and stand-off cruise missiles to go along with those upgraded aircraft. As such, upgrade programs like the F-16V project are still likely to offer Taiwan the fastest and most cost effective means to expanding the capabilities of its air force in the near future. With China surging ahead in its own defense developments, Taiwanese authorities cannot realistically afford to wait for a domestic fighter if they expect to maintain any sort of deterrent to a potential Chinese military intervention on the island.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 18, 2018",Russia Fires Topol Ballistic Missile to Test New Tech to Defeat Missile Defense Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it has tested yet another new reentry vehicle design on an RS-12M Topol intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The development comes amid persistent complaints about America’s ballistic missile defense shield, as well as renewed tensions between the Kremlin and the U.S. government over various agreements limiting the development of nuclear weapons. On Dec. 26, 2017, the Russian Strategic Missile Force fired a Topol with the “perspective [sic] armament” from the Kapustin Yar range in the Astrakhan Region near the border with Kazakhstan, state-run media outlet TASS reported . The Kremlin did not say how far the test missile flew, where it landed, or whether the experiment had been a success. “During the tests, specialists obtained experimental data that will be used in the interests of developing effective means of overcoming anti-ballistic missile defense and equipping the perspective grouping of Russian ballistic missiles with them,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, according to TASS. “The test courses and the measuring systems at the Kapustin Yar practice range allow testing perspective [sic] armament capable of overcoming ABM defenses, including their future configuration, across the entire range of the conditions for the armament’s delivery to targets in the interests of the Strategic Missile Force and the Navy.” This would seem to suggest that the test of the modified RS-12M is in support of a broader, ongoing, and perhaps growing program to craft strategic weapons that can defeat ballistic missile defense systems. Russia often uses Cold War-era Topols for this test work, which makes sense given that it has been steadily replacing with the updated Topol-M and the improved RS-24 , also known as the Topol-MR or Yars. Topol-M ICBM test launch from Kapustin Yar test range, Russia was widely seen this morning across E-CNTRL Europe. These views are from SE Austria, by photographer Gerald Reczek. pic.twitter.com/olhdx6uxpJ — severe-weather.EU (@severeweatherEU) December 26, 2017 The Topol-M, in operation since 1997 and able to reach a peak speed of some 15,000 miles per hour, already improved the design’s ability to defeat ballistic missile defenses, as our own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, explained in 2014 : “The Topol-M missile was designed to penetrate an American anti-ballistic missile shield by leveraging high-speed, a relatively small infrared signature during its boost phase, advanced decoys (as many as ten carried on a single missile), maneuvering mid-course capability, and maneuvering independently targeted reentry vehicles, of which it can carry up to six, although they are said to carry just one operationally. “The missile’s high speed shortens the time anyone can react to it, and every second matters when it comes to ballistic missile defense. The rocket motors were designed for a short, very powerful boost stage so that American space-based infrared detection satellites ( SBIRS , DSP ) have less time to detect and track it. Its decoys make it hard for radar to adequately track the correct target, and its countermeasures are said to have been upgraded to fool infrared tracking systems, which are used for mid-course interception . The missile and reentry vehicles’ ability to dynamically maneuver outside of their ballistic track makes producing an effective kill solution, or even predicting the TOPOL-M’s target, problematic. All these features come together to make a missile that is probably outside of America’s missile defense capabilities today, and the sheer number of them that exists makes the idea of defending against anything but a limited barrage totally invalid.” This isn’t the first test of a modified Topol in 2017, either. In September 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced it had fired an RS-12M with an unspecified “advanced combat payload,” which may have been a hypersonic boost glide vehicle . “Russian officials claim a new class of hypersonic vehicle, probably called ‘object 4202,’ is being developed to allow Russian strategic missiles to penetrate missile defense systems,” U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center said in a 2017 review of worldwide ballistic and cruise missile developments. Hypersonic vehicles have very different flight characteristics and signature compared to ICBMs, which could make them harder for space- and surface-based defense systems to track and defeat. A Topol-M on its road-mobile transporter-erector-launcher., Vitaly Kuzmin Also in September 2017, Russia reportedly tested an RS-24 with a new warhead design, again with an eye toward defeating ballistic missile defense systems. You can read more about these “independent post-boost vehicles,” or IPBVs, here . These experimental launches followed a massive strategic exercise the month before, in which the Russian military fired multiple nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. The new work and displays of force are both aimed clearly at challenging America and its ballistic missile defenses in particular. The United States repeatedly insists that the shield is not a threat to the credibility of Russia’s nuclear deterrent, but the Kremlin has rejected these assurances . The Russian government is similarly critical of the U.S. military’s work on its own hypersonic systems , which could give it the ability to conduct long-range strikes with little notice against time-sensitive targets, including road-mobile ballistic missiles, critical command and control nodes, and even hostile foreign leaders, a capability commonly known as prompt global strike. The video below shows the September 2017 Topol test: “Why do they need such weapons?” Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in December 2017 . “I believe they want it for one thing – blackmail – as it creates an illusion of a possible strike with impunity.” At the same time, the dispute over ballistic missile defense has become increasingly intertwined with spats over deals limiting the two countries’ respective developments of strategic arms. In December 2017, the U.S. government formally accused the Kremlin of violating the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, with the deployment of a new nuclear-capable land-based cruise missile, known as the 9M729 . The INF bans both Russia and the United States from fielding new land-based missiles of any type, conventional or nuclear, with a maximum range of between 310 and 3,420 miles. Experts also believe the still in development RS-26 Rubezh , a new ballistic missile design the Russians derived from the RS-24, may break the INF , as well. In response, the Kremlin, including Putin himself, accused the United States of being in violating the agreement already with the construction of Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense sites in Poland and Romania . The U.S. military says that the launchers at these bases can only hold anti-missile interceptors that the INF does not cover, but Russia says they could potentially fire land-attack cruise missiles and, as a result, doubly threaten its national security. US Navy sailors stand guard outside the Aegis Ashore facility in Romania., Kay Nietfeld/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP “They are searching for some violations on our part while consistently infringing on it themselves,” Putin said. “All that seriously affects security in Europe and in the whole world.” There is a concern that these growing disputes could lead to the erosion of other significant arms control deals, too, such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, and its follow-on agreements. As we mentioned earlier, there is already a debate about whether the RS-24 ICBM is in line with limits on increasing the number of warheads associated with existing missile systems. The Russians claim the Yars is an all new design that isn’t subject to the treaties. The United States, along with many experts, say it is simply an upgrade of the existing Topol-M. “We will not let ourselves be drawn into a senseless arms race that will exhaust our economic potential,” Putin has stressed. The latest RS-12M test launch and other developments would seem to suggest otherwise. It’s true that Russia’s long standing budget woes have led it to delay or cancel various major procurement programs and upgrade projects in 2017 alone, including the rail-mobile Barguzin ICBM . However, the country remains committed to the development of the RS-26 and the silo-based RS-28 Sarmat ICBMs. There have been reports that Sarmat may be able to carry two dozen Object 4202 hypersonic vehicles and suggestions that it is a direct response to America’s pursuit of a prompt global strike capability. With fears over North Korea’s own rapidly advancing ballistic missile programs , the United States is only looking to expand its ballistic missile defense infrastructure , which will only continue to draw the ire of Russia, too. In November 2017, the White House asked Congress to approve $4 billion for more interceptors and other associated systems . The next month, legislators subsequently included nearly $5 billion in a short-term spending bill . It’s worth noting, as we at The War Zone have repeatedly noted, that America’s present ballistic missile shield has yet to prove itself under anything approaching real world conditions. Separately, the U.S. military is working to modernize all three legs of its own nuclear deterrence, including new nuclear-capable stealth bombers and long-range cruise missiles , ballistic missile submarines , and silo-based IBCMs , which could cost the United States more than $1 trillion in total. In response to Russia’s breach of the INF, Congress has allocated funds for the Pentagon to at least study potential designs for a similar American weapon, in an attempt to goad the Kremlin back into compliance with the deal. If the INF and other strategic arms deals do collapse completely, it could prompt to further and unrestricted development of new nuclear-capable ballistic and other missiles, potentially leading to further tensions in Europe and elsewhere. If even the treaties remain technically in place, Russia’s new missile developments are likely to continue to be a significant point of contention between it and the United States.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 15, 2021",The US Army Wants to Buy 150 Helicopters for Allies and “Other Government Agencies”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is looking into the possibility that other companies beyond Bell Helicopter may be able to deliver 150 helicopters of various types over a five year period as part of a larger combined deal on behalf of non-military U.S. government agencies and foreign allies and partners . Ostensibly the plan is to justify a sole-source contract to the Texas-headquartered company, but it might prompt creative offers from other competitors. On Dec. 20, 2017, the Army made the announcement on the federal government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps. The service is interested in specifically buying a mixture of Bell Models 407GX , 412EPI , 429 , and 505 , as well as Huey II conversions . The total purchases could amount to as many as 150 aircraft, with deliveries beginning in 2019 and running through 2024. The final contract would also include spare parts and other services as well. The helicopters would not be for the U.S. military, but would instead go to “other government agencies,” which could include the State Department, federal law enforcement entities, or even members of the Intelligence Community , or be part of foreign military sales deals. The Army’s notice makes it clear that in the past they have handed deals for these helicopters straight to Bell, but that they are required by law to prove that the firm is the only one that can meet its needs. Any company that submits information has to show “how the complete lifecycle of the aircraft would be supported” from production to flight operations. The service has already been on something of helicopter shopping spree on behalf of foreign governments recently, having signed a $1.4 billion deal with MD Helicopters for 150 MD 530F light attack helicopters in September 2017 . Dozens of these are already destined for Afghanistan , Kenya , and Lebanon . A pair of Bell 407s belonging to the Delaware State Police, similar to the 407GXs the Army is interested in buying. , USAF There is undoubtedly similar interest among American allies and partners for the various Bell utility helicopters mentioned in this new notice. The 412 series and 429 are already in widespread international service, both with militaries and civil government agencies, as well as commercial operators. These types would be ideal for light transport duties, surveillance, or in a casualty evacuation role. The Bell 505, also known as the Jet Ranger X , is newer offering that has yet to develop a strong customer base since Bell first unveiled it in 2013. The company bills the aircraft as a “clean sheet design,” but it borrows heavily from the older Model 206L Jet Ranger , as its name implies. With an airframe that makes use of composite materials in addition to traditional metal components, a new engine, and more modern avionics, it could be an attractive option for organizations still flying the older Jet Rangers as small personnel transports, training, or for surveillance or border and maritime patrol missions. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HAnfkUfSrj0 On top of that, the Army has already facilitated the delivery of dozens of 407s and Huey IIs to American partners around the world. The 407s that went to Iraq were in a gunship configuration consisting of rocket pods, which are now able to employ the laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II laser-guided rocket, or APKWS II , as well as machine guns. It’s not clear if any armament options will be part of the planned contract, as was the case with the MD Helicopters deal. All of the aircraft the Army mentioned in their plan can readily accept electro-optical or infrared camera turrets and many could carry weapons if necessary in a light attack or armed scout role . US-supplied Kazakh Huey II shows up at Russian-Kazakhstan exercise Unbreakable Brotherhood 2017. Full video: https://t.co/42WRH6MUYS pic.twitter.com/CuKcxB8GVv — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) October 26, 2017 And by including other U.S. government requirements in the purchase order, the Army could potentially save money with an even larger block buy. The State Department is a particularly likely customer, since it already operates 412EPs and Huey IIs. As of December 2016, though, all of those aircraft had first rolled off Bell’s production lines sometime between 1966 and 1974 . Customers and Border Protection is another major helicopter operator with a significant number of Huey IIs already on hand. With President Donald Trump’s increased emphasis on border security and efforts to expand law enforcement presence along the U.S. boundary with Mexico, its possible that the agency could be interested in expanding their fleet. A US-supplied Iraqi Air Force Huey II., USAF It seems likely that no other firm besides Bell would be able to provide these helicopters, along with the support and services the Army wants to go along with them. There would be no other manufacturer able to supply the 429s and 505s, which the sources sought notice mentions by name without any apparent possibility of considering alternative helicopters with similar capabilities. But there could be other sources for the remaining types of helicopters, or at least similar enough aircraft to meet the Army’s requirements. The service itself just retired its entire fleet of OH-58D Kiowa Warriors, which are similar structurally to the 407 series. The type’s highly controversial retirement was quickly followed by the U.S. military facilitating the transfer of some of these helicopters to a number of foreign partners, including Tunisia and Croatia . Most recently it was announced that Greece will receive 70 of the still very relevant scout choppers. Greece to receive 70 OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed reconnaissance helicopters through the US Excess Defense Article (EDA) programme in 2018 for a total price of $47mil.

The Army could conceivably agree to hire a contractor to refurbish either its existing stockpile of OH-58Ds or upgrade second-hand 407s to a standard similar to Bell’s GX. There are similarly sources of older 412EPs and Huey variants on the second-hand market that a separate firm could offer to rebuild into configurations that match the capabilities offered by the EPI and Huey II. The Huey IIs already require older donor UH-1 airframes as the starting place. A Bahrain Police Bell 412EP., Bell Helicopter There is already historical precedent for this, as well. Most recently, the Army has hired contractors to upgrade a number of older UH-60L Black Hawks to the newer UH-60V configuration featuring a glass cockpit from Northrop Grumman. The service is doing this in order to save money over buying all-new UH-60Ms straight from Sikorsky. On top of that, the Sierra Nevada Corporation is pitching upgraded ex-Army UH-60Ls, which it calls the Force Hawk , to the U.S. Air Force as a replacement for its aging UH-1N helicopters. Again, this is in direct competition to Sikorsky’s pitch for a sale of all-new HH-60Us. A model of Sierra Nevada’s proposed Force Hawk., Joseph Trevithick Third parties have also offered upgrades for Bell helicopters, especially the Huey family, in the past, too. In the mid-2000s, private military company DynCorp, which has long been in charge of maintain the State Department’s helicopter fleet among other work, offered a UH-1H conversion it called Global Eagle . This update involved replacing the existing engine with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT-6, modernized cockpit controls, and other new features. Many other companies offer similar conversions/refurbished helicopter variants that essentially take old airframes and turn them into near zero time, highly updated aircraft that have decades of service life to give. With a possible purchase of up to 150 aircraft on the table already, the Army’s proposed contract could be worth at least hundreds of millions of dollars. It wouldn’t be hard to imagine that a company like Sierra Nevada might be interested in finding a way to make an offer. If the final arrangement separated out orders for new 429s and 505s into a separate deal, it would be even easier for other companies to at least pitch an alternative. Anyone who’s interested in proposing a different plan to deliver the helicopters will have until Jan. 19, 2018 to make their case.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 23, 2018",Document Offers New Details About Those OV-10 Broncos That Went to Fight ISIS,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Thanks to a newly released briefing, we can now reveal even more information about the pair of OV-10 Broncos that the U.S. Special Operations Command sent to Iraq to hunt ISIS . This includes information about the unique configurations of these Vietnam-era planes, such as their ability to track targets by homing in on cellphone signals and to share data across multiple networks. We also found out about the extensive testing that preceded their trip to the Middle East, and the lessons learned from employing a updated light attack aircraft on a modern battlefield. In July 2017, the Pentagon’s Joint Requirements Oversight Council formally directed U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, to conduct a “limited objective experiment” to see if a light turboprop aircraft could provide more flexible and responsive close air support and limited strike capabilities both when operating from remote or austere locations – or even an aircraft carrier , amphibious ship , or sea base – or in support of a larger force, according to the undated presentation, which we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. The theory, which is one we have argued for more than once ourselves, was that such an aircraft could be a cost-effective tool for limited conflicts that would also free up far more costly higher performance or specialized aircraft from having to conduct these missions. The aircraft would be focused on conduct counterinsurgency and irregular warfare missions working with both special operations forces and conventional troops. If possible, it would still be able to operate safely in contested or degraded environments and maybe even generate very little noise , enabling it to orbit discreetly above a specific target area for a protracted period of time. Optimally, it would have a mixture of weapons and sensors that would allow it “ find, fix, and finish ” the enemy independently in cooperation with other manned or unmanned aircraft and be easy to deploy and operate by a small number of personnel even with limited facilities and support. We know that when it came time for the final OV-10G+s to go down range, they did have an impressively small footprint that allowed them to quickly self-deploy from one location to another, even improvised airfields. One of the two OV-10G+ aircraft., John Lequerica This experiment, also known as Combat Dragon II, had been in the works since the late 2000s, having built off an earlier U.S. Navy project called Imminent Fury. The new test program had run into opposition from Congress owing to a political dispute over the preferred aircraft, the Brazilian-made EMB-314 Super Tucano . You can read about this particular saga in detail here . A concept of operations for Combat Dragon II with silhouettes of OV-10 Broncos indicating the notional aircraft., SOCOM via FOIA The project was always “aircraft agnostic,” according to the briefing, meaning that the chosen platform was not as important as testing the associated doctrine, tactics, and other procedures. SOCOM eventually decided to enter into a three-way partnership with the Navy and NASA to modify the pair of OV-10 aircraft into the new G+ configuration. “OV-10s did provide numerous capabilities,” the presentation notes. “However[, they were] primarily selected based on availability and no acquisition or leasing costs.” SOCOM via FOIA NASA agreed to turn over the Ex-U.S. Marine Corps planes, which it still has for aerospace research purposes, in exchange for the guarantee that it would get them back with all new glass cockpits and other basic improvements. You can read more about how that arrangement came to be here . The Naval Air Systems Command handled the modifications to the two aircraft, which cost approximately $20 million in total. This package included various sensors, weapons, and self defense systems, such as missile approach warning sensors and decoy flares. NASA’s OV-10s in their D+ configuration in 1998., NASA The most obvious part of the sensor suite was the high-definition L3 Wescam MX-15HD sensor turret, which has electro-optical and infrared full motion video cameras, the ability to produce high-resolution still imagery, and a combination laser range finder and designator. The primary weapon during the aircraft’s deployment to Iraq was 7- and 19-tube rocket pods loaded with the highly accurate laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II rocket, or APKWS II . As our own Tyler Rogoway wrote in 2016 : “The Broncos were used to find, fix and finish the enemy. In the past, this process was largely accomplished by at least two very different aircraft and platform communities, both of which usually had their own unique command and control structures. By condensing all the required capabilities into a single platform—the OV-10— the kill chain could be drastically compressed and save gobs of money in the process. “The truth is, OV-10s weren’t really close air support aircraft in the traditional sense at all—they were manhunters.” But we now know the exact configuration of the amazingly intricate communications and data sharing system in each aircraft the truly allowed them to perform this mission. The planes had data links that could pass audio and video across four different network protocols, including Link 16 and Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), both of which are common on many U.S. military tactical aircraft although rarely are they installed together on the same aircraft. The Advanced Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) typically found on ground vehicles was also installed on the Broncos. SOCOM via FOIA Each aircraft also had four Harris AN/PRC-117G radios . Also known as the Falcon III, these are multi-channel encrypted systems that can work either across line-of-sight or via satellite. In addition to the APKWS II rockets, initial testing included loading the aircraft with the larger Cold War-era five inch Zuni folding-fin aerial rockets. We don’t know for sure if these weapons had a guidance system, but it seems hard to believe that this wasn’t the case given the aircraft’s focus on precision munitions. In the late 2000s, the North American division of the European missile consortium MBDA had demonstrated a laser-guided conversion for the Zuni to the Marine Corps and Navy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only such system available. Similar to the APKWS II, the new weapon used existing five-inch wrap-around fin rocket motors. Unlike the smaller weapon, MDBA’s front end was entirely self-contained and would not have allowed the U.S. military to repurpose older stocks of Zuni warheads. There is no indication that the Broncos fired any guided Zunis during their subsequent deployment to Iraq. https://youtube.com/watch?v=cbEBKY9arYQ But perhaps most interestingly, each one of the refurbished OV-10G+s had a specialized “airborne precision geo-location” system, or APG. This equipment would have allowed the aircraft to spot and track specific individuals based on the signal from a cellular or satellite telephone. This targeting mechanism makes use of information the National Security Agency intercepts and has become a common, if controversial way for U.S. special operations forces in particular to target individual terrorist and militants. The U.S. military has nicknamed these strikes, which technical target only the phone in question, as “ touchdowns .” Killing the person holding the device is a “ jackpot .” APG systems are already a key part of armed drone missions and U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships have also used them to enable targeted strikes. It’s not surprising that SOCOM would have wanted to add this capability to the OV-10G+s given what we know of their concept of operations during their subsequent deployment to Iraq. Tyler Rogoway had this to say in 2016: “As far as just how precise the OV-10 crews could be with their laser-guided rockets and high-end targeting sensors, the Bronco’s prowess in this department was almost freakish. It wasn’t just taking out bad guys in windows—they were doing the same with fighters hiding under eaves, overhangs, dense cover and in doorways. Essentially, the Broncos were flying snipers for special operations forces hunting ISIS in Iraq. They could observe with great clarity from on high, collect intelligence and stalk the enemy. They could also kill that enemy with incredible accuracy. Instead of using a sniper’s bullet, the Broncos used the Pentagon’s guided munition equivalent, laser-guided rockets. “One shot, one kill, even under the most demanding of combat conditions.” Before that, though, a small detachment of 11 special operators and members of the Marine Corps set about training to operate the newly modified aircraft, beginning in February 2012. Four months later, the aircraft went to Jaded Thunder , a large, but obscure exercise the secretive Joint Special Operations Command runs so its operators can practice calling in air and artillery fire support missions with various aircraft and other assets from around the U.S. military, as well as foreign forces. Afterwards, the group traveled to Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada, home of the Navy’s legendary TOPGUN program , to learn to fire the guided APKWS II rockets, before heading out for additional exercises. And while the initial modifications had been in progress, between October 2012 and January 2013, personnel in the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s Joint Force Development office, or J7, poured over old studies, reports, lesson learned documents, books, and other material, and interviewed dozens of subject matter experts to get their opinions on what these new aircraft should be able to do. Not surprisingly, these reviews produced many common conclusions about the utility of airpower in limited conflicts – as well as highlighting an seemingly perpetual inability to either learn or apply those lessons from previous counterinsurgency and irregular conflicts. SOCOM via FOIA The experts were generally in agreement that there was a need for a cost-effective capability to fill a gap between helicopters and drones and high-end jet combat aircraft. In addition, they pointed out, as we at The War Zone have done ourselves, that this disconnect would only grow with the introduction of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. “Find and fix capability with ‘longer time on station’ is the leading enabler for COIN/IW [counterinsurgency/irregular warfare] mission success,” one bullet point in the briefing notes. “Strong agreement by air component [subject matter experts] low-cost turboprop driven aircraft are essential to lower operational costs to fight/win long term COIN/IW conflicts.” SOCOM via FOIA The J7 office rolled all of the data into what the U.S. military calls a Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) analysis. There were a number of big takeaways. According to the assessment, close air support doctrine itself was fine, though it could do with more counterinsurgency- and irregular warfare-specific guidance. There was a desire to make sure that commanders decentralized close air support assets to make them more responsive to the demands of smaller units. SOCOM via FOIA This came along with the recommendation that the U.S. military should purchase one or two squadrons of light attack aircraft, an idea that the Marine Corps and members of Congress have both advocated for since then. Nearly 70 percent of the individuals the J7 assessors interviewed said that existing aircraft were not efficient choices for limited conflicts and a full 70 percent said specifically that a light turboprop aircraft was the right choice. Those experts also said that any such light attack units would need new training to combine both close air support and other “non-kinetic” functions, such as forward air control and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. SOCOM via FOIA There would be a need to increase the number of joint tactical air controllers to help coordinate the activities of the new, forward deployed aircraft with ground forces, especially smaller conventional units, such infantry platoons or squads. Altogether, the officials in the J7 office estimated that using light attack aircraft to supplement high-end combat jets and other aircraft could save between $1 and $2 billion per year in the cost of operation. SOCOM put those theories to the test in 2015 when it set the two Broncos to Iraq. By all accounts, they performed extremely well, but as we’ve already noted, the U.S. military never intended Combat Dragon II to be anything more than a proof of concept. The results of the project did have a direct impact on subsequent Air Force and SOCOM efforts, though. SOCOM via FOIA Earlier in 2017, the Air Force brought together various light attack aircraft for a demonstration program, which it nicknamed Combat Dragon III. Unfortunately, the service has yet to publicly release any findings from that test program, also referred to as OA-X, and plans to send one or more of the participating aircraft abroad for a combat evaluation have yet to materialize . More importantly, SOCOM has begun its own its own complementary effort , which, like Combat Dragon II, is “platform agnostic,” focusing on desired capabilities and effects rather than specific aircraft and systems. You can find out more about the kind of tech the special operations community is looking for in its Light Attack Support Special Operations (LASSO) program, here . With so many questions asked and information gathered during Combat Dragon II, along with other experiments before and after, its unclear why any more review and assessment of the concept is necessary. We don’t know how OA-X or LASSO will evolve in the near future, but in the meantime multi-role fighter jets continue to fly these missions at considerably higher costs. As the experts noted during the Combat Dragon II experiment, it seems unreasonably difficult for these lessons to gain traction, despite the ever growing mountain of evidence. It’s clear that both conventional and special operations forces remain as interested as ever in the concepts the U.S. military explored with the two OV-10G+s.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 28, 2018",Afghan A-29s Aren’t Dropping Laser-Guided Bombs or Engaging Targets at Night,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military routinely touts the successes the Afghan Air Force has had with its A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft. But after nearly two years of operations, Afghan pilots still can’t drop laser guided bombs or fight at night and it’s unclear when that will change. Despite repeated reports suggesting otherwise, Afghan Air Force A-29s have yet to employ any precision guided munitions during combat missions. In an Email to The War Zone, the NATO-led advisory mission in the country, known as the Resolute Support Mission, also confirmed that it had only recently begun training crews to use weapons of any kind at night. In December 2017, Afghan pilots dropped their first live 250-pound class GBU-58/B laser guided bombs on a training range in Afghanistan. Defense contractor Raytheon specifically began selling this smaller, lighter member of the Paveway bomb family in 2011 as a way for air forces to try and reduce collateral damage, but has also pitched it as an ideal weapon for light attack aircraft . “Until now, U.S. advisors have focused the training of the A-29 pilots on visual deliveries as part of a continuous progression that will incorporate precision guided munitions and night weapons delivery,” U.S. Air Force Major Nicholas Plante, the chief public affairs officer for Resolute Support’s Train, Advise, Assist Command-Air (TAAC-Air), told The War Zone. “The ability of the Afghan Air Force to deliver precision guided munitions in a training environment, like the GBU-58, will add increased capability when it’s eventually employed in combat.” The thing is, official descriptions and media reports of Afghanistan’s A-29 have routinely highlighted their ability to employ precision guided munitions, and by extension their ability to conduct night time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions using an on board sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, since the first four touched down in the country in January 2016. That Afghanistan’s planes may technically be able to perform these missions if crews had the right training might not necessarily be the case, either. Afghan Air Force personnel practice assembling and loading laser-guided bombs onto the A-29 with an inert weapon. They have not employed this capability in combat., USAF “The A-29 can employ laser-guided bombs,” the Pentagon wrote in its December 2017 “Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan” report , the second of two such reviews it published every year. “But employment training is delayed due to technical issues with front seat targeting and aircraft performance limitations.” TAAC-Air said it could not speak directly to the content of the Department of Defense report. At the time of writing, the Pentagon public affairs office had not yet responded to queries for additional information about these issues. The Sierra Nevada Corporation, which supplied the aircraft for Afghanistan in cooperation with Brazilian plane maker Embraer, had not responded to a request for comment. Based on the available information, and specifically the comment about “front seat targeting,” the “technical issues” might be a matter of making sure the pilot can properly set the weapons before releasing them or view the feed from the A-29’s sensor turret. Troops on the ground could in some cases be able to mark targets with hand-held laser designators to help mitigate these problems, but still that isn’t even happening. The “aircraft performance limitations” could have been related to range, maneuverability, or altitude restrictions when carrying larger laser-guided weapons, such as the 500-pound class GBU-12/B laser-guided bomb. This seems like a remote possibility given that the Super Tucanos have reportedly had no trouble flying missions with unguided weapons in the same weight class. Below is a video of a Beechcraft AT-6 light attack aircraft, similar to the A-29, dropping a GBU-58/B during a test: At present, Afghan Air Force A-29s employ 250-pound class Mk 81 and 500-pound class Mk 82 iron bombs, unguided 70mm rockets, and the aircraft’s two wing-mounted .50 caliber machine guns. The Pentagon and the Resolute Support Mission both insist the lack of a precision munitions capability has had little to no impact on the Afghan Air Force’s Super Tucano operations in the meantime. Between June and November 2017, Afghan Air Force’s 12 A-29s flew almost 900 missions, with less than 330 of them involved air-to-ground attacks, or just under two every day on average, according to the Pentagon. The aircraft flew 152 airstrikes in total in 2016. Between January and November 2017, U.S. military aircraft flew more than 1,100 close air support missions and more than 4,000 sorties overall. “The A-29 employs unguided munitions through its onboard targeting computer that aids the pilots in accurate visual weapons delivery from all altitudes using tactics refined through repetition during their training with advisors both in the United States and in Afghanistan,” Major Plante explained. In addition, Afghan Tactical Air Coordinators “increase attack effectiveness and precision by providing target guidance and talk-ons to pilots during execution of a mission. Their role is significant in effective targeting, decreasing collateral damage, and is a critical piece of the integration of airpower to support ground maneuver units.” It’s true that the low- and slow-flying A-29s would have a better chance of identifying their targets and engaging them with unguided weapons than higher and faster-flying combat aircraft. The Super Tucanos would be perfectly able to attack large, static targets, such as enemy-occupied structures, too. The Pentagon was quick to highlight the aircraft’s role in strikes against Taliban narcotics production centers in November 2017. “They’ve got the A-29, which has been very successful and continues to build into a very viable platform,” U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Lance Bunch, Director of Future Operations for the Resolute Support Mission, told reporters in December 2017. “The first strikes as part of this air interdiction campaign were conducted by the Afghan Air Force, where we worked with them to deliver targets that they then went and struck to start that entire campaign.” But no matter how accurate the pilots are with dumb bombs, that is no substitute for a guided munitions capability, which was one of main reasons for getting these aircraft to the Afghan Air Force in the first place. It is impossible to believe that the inability to employ those weapons has not limited the aircraft operational effectiveness, especially when it comes to attacking moving targets or providing close air support to friendly troops who may be very close to enemy forces or innocent bystanders. This would be especially likely to occur during fighting in built up urban areas, something that has hardly been out of the ordinary in Afghanistan. When U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis visited the country in September 2017, the Taliban launched a bold attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport in the capital Kabul. Coalition warplanes flew close air support for Afghan troops who responded on the ground, but inadvertently caused a number of civilian casualties when one of their missiles malfunctioned and went flying into a nearby residential area. Using dumb bombs and unguided rockets can only increase the risk of collateral damage in any situation, which is an important consideration in a conflict where even mistake can be a major propaganda victory for the enemy. It’s a major reason why the U.S. military has almost exclusively relied on precision guided munitions for airstrikes against militants in both Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria. We at The War Zone have similarly questioned the wisdom of the U.S. military employing iron bombs for so-called “ terrain denial ” missions in Afghanistan. “Precision weapons has changed the way we fight and we’re not going back,” Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Heather Wilson said during a speech in September 2017. “The world will not tolerate imprecise weapons.” A member of the Afghan Air Force loads an unguided bomb onto an A-29., USAF And the inability to employ weapons or even patrol at night is a significant issue, too. Insurgents and terrorists in Afghanistan have long used the cover of darkness to conceal their movements and launch surprise attacks on government security forces. Persistent aerial surveillance and the ability to conduct both precise close air support and strike missions at night have been and continue to be essential parts of the U.S.-led campaign to keep the Taliban at bay. Earlier in December 2017, the U.S. military released footage of just such a mission that took out the leader of the Taliban’s elite “ Red Unit ” in Helmand province. These are key capabilities the Afghan military will need in order to be able to do so on its own, especially given that militant groups groups have been steadily improving their ability to conduct operations after the sun goes down. You can read about that in more detail in a previous piece I wrote about the changing nature of night fighting in the country. Persistent problems with finding qualified pilots, sensor operators, and ground crew personnel can’t have helped matters, either. As of November 2017, the Afghan Air Force had 14 qualified crews for its dozen A-29s, 30 percent below the authorized force level. “The lack of qualified candidates with the necessary technical skills to complete training presents a challenge,” the Pentagon acknowledged in its biannual report in December 2017. “Finding suitable candidates with English skills remains difficult.” That there are simply not be enough individuals available to routinely have two-man crews flying A-29s might help explain why problems setting up a “front seat targeting” capability was an issue to begin with. It also suggests that there is a lack of qualified sensor operators. Maybe most telling is that photographic evidence does not generally show Afghan Air Force Super Tucanos flying with their ventral sensor turrets at all. One of the A-29s the Afghan Air Force uses for at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia with the sensor turret., USAF There is evidence that there have been significant issues in training individual to operate and maintain these systems on other aircraft, as well. The separate Special Mission Wing (SMW), part of the Afghan Special Security Forces, the country’s much-touted and well-funded special operations community, has a fleet of PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, similar to the U.S. Air Force’s U-28A aircraft , which do have a electro-optical and infrared sensor turret on board. “The PC-12 can send full-motion video (FMV) to a ground station and the onboard crew can perform real-time analysis of collected data,” the Pentagon reported in December 2017. “Despite these capabilities, SMW personnel require training to improve the integration of intelligence into combat operations.” A rare, but low quality image of one of the Afghan Special Mission Wing’s PC-12NG aircraft., DOD The Afghan Air Force still relies heavily on contractors to keep the A-29s operational in general. As of November 2017, private firms were providing 60 percent of the required maintenance for the aircraft, something the Pentagon expected to continue for the foreseeable future. “Because A-29 programs [sic] are still in the early stages of a rapid operational fielding, aircraft maintenance capabilities remain a challenge,” the Pentagon’s December 2017 report said of a program that began in 2014. You can read all about the saga of getting the Super Tucanos to Afghanistan here . The aircraft have been in country for two years flying missions, so calling this the “early stages of a rapid fielding” seems a bit farcical. These problems are hardly limited to specific aircraft types and we at The War Zone have also repeatedly documented similar manpower and logistical issues throughout Afghanistan’s rotary wing aircraft fleets . None of this is to say that A-29s aren’t an important addition to the Afghan Air Force. The aircraft give the service more flexibility and increased capability, all at greater ranges and speed than with its armed helicopters . An Afghan Air Force MD 530F light attack helicopter., USAF In addition to the dozen A-29s in country, there are another seven situated at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia in the United States to train new pilots. By 2019, the U.S. military hopes to have facilitated the delivery of a full force of 25 A-29s for the Afghans. But there are clearly significant challenges to ensuring the Afghans can take full advantage of the aircraft they have already. The U.S. military-backed plan to overhaul the Afghan Air Force could further increase the strain on existing training and logistics pipelines. Starting in 2018, the U.S. military plans to begin assisting with the delivery of AC-208 Combat Cavarans with sensor turrets and the ability to employ laser-guided 70mm rockets . These single engine aircraft are already in service with the Iraqi and Lebanese air forces, both of which use them as platforms to fire Hellfire missiles, which could be another option for the Afghan examples later on. An unarmed Afghan Air Force C-208 Grand Caravan., NATO The Afghan Air Force expects to take delivery of three of the planes in 2018 and have a full fleet of 32 in service by 2023. It might be easier for the Afghan Air Force to absorb these aircraft because it is already flying unarmed C-208s in a variety of support roles and has developed a certain proficiency at maintaining them. There would still be questions about how well the service would be able to maintain the AC-208’s sensors and other mission systems without outside support, at least in the near term, though. At their best, these aircraft can’t match the full capabilities of the A-29, though. Adding them to the mix might suggest the United States is concerned that the Afghans may not be able to fully make use of the Super Tucanos any time soon. This begs the question about whether the aircraft, which have a price tag of approximately $18 million each, a cost the United States has largely underwritten, have been a worthwhile investment if they’re still not reaching their full potential after almost two years of in-country operations. In the meantime, the NATO-led coalition, and the U.S. military most of all, continue to fly the vast majority of airstrikes in Afghanistan, a number that has dramatically increased in 2017. This has come at great cost since multi-role fighter jets such as the F-16 Viper and B-52 heavy bomber have been the main aircraft flying over the country. Absent another alternative, until the Afghan Air Force develops a more robust capability, we can expect coalition aircraft will continue to provide this vital support for the foreseeable future . Light attack aircraft with a functional precision guided munitions capability would be a much more cost effective tool for these missions. Unfortunately, in addition to the limited capabilities of the Afghan Air Force, the latest push to develop a U.S. military light attack aircraft force , which came to a head earlier in 2017 with a highly publicized U.S. Air Force test project, appears to have stalled out . Some have gone so far as to suggest private military companies could help provide an immediate and lower cost capability that is more effective than what the Afghans can provide for themselves at present, and also far cheaper than having American aviators continue to fly the missions. We at The War Zone have previously discussed the ins and outs of those proposals in detail . “The Afghan Air Force is … increasing its strike capabilities with ongoing U.S. advisor-led training,” Major Plante said. “The A-29 Super Tucano with precision guided munitions will provide the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces on the ground a vital battlefield advantage in their country.” However, the A-29s and their more advanced capabilities are clearly still years away from making their impact felt in the fight against the Taliban, ISIS and Al Qaeda-linked terrorists, and other militant groups, if they ever do. Until this occurs, and other parts of the Afghan Air Force finally stabilize as well, the U.S. will be relied upon to fill this gap. As such, the idea that America could have ever left the country militarily before a robust Afghan air arm was firmly in place was and still remains a farce. Update 12/22/17: Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) has responded to our queries and provided important additional information about Afghanistan’s A-29s and their capabilities. The company has been involved in resolving the two specific issues the Pentagon mentioned in its report. “The front seat targeting limitation is a reference to a sensitive slew controller for the EO/IR sensor when it is used for laser guided bomb targeting,” Scott Oxarart, a Sierra Nevada communications representative said in statement. “SNC has resolved this issue and is fielding a software improvement. “The aircraft performance limitations comment is an artifact of the current airspeed limitation of the sensor used in firing laser-guided bombs,” he added. “This is not an inherent A-29 issue, rather an artifact of the sensor specified in the original USAF requirements document that we were provided. SNC and Embraer have provided additional engineering and flight test data to expand the operational airspeed envelope to address USAF concerns associated with this sensor. That data is with the USAF at this time. The limitation is not associated with the A-29 itself.” In a separate phone call, Taco Gilbert, the Senior Vice President for SNC´s Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance division, said that Afghan A-29 crews had proven to be “very, very precise” with unguided bombs since they began flying combat missions in 2016 and that those missions had resulted in no confirmed collateral civilian casualties to date. He added that this mirrored feedback the company had received from other Super Tucano operators, including Colombia, with regards to employing dumb bombs. It is worth noting that alleged civilian casualties from Afghan and coalition air strikes has spiked in 2017 as the total number of missions has similarly increased . A recent New York Times report also called into question the accounting of civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria, an issue that could extent to other conflict zones, as well. In addition, in the late 2000s, the Central Intelligence Agency led an effort to give Colombia’s Air Force a precision guided munition capability, specifically to enable targeted strikes against specific rebel leaders. According to The Washington Post , the country’s Super Tucanos had been limited to attacking larger area targets. Gilbert further stressed that guided weapons were not necessarily a requisite for precise air-to-ground attacks, but acknowledged that the Afghans would be even more capable with their A-29s if they gained the ability to use precision guided munitions. He noted that avoiding the need to use expensive precision guidance kits would make a light attack aircraft an more cost effective alternative to fast-moving jet combat aircraft in permissive environments, as well. It will be interesting to see if the Afghans continue to employ unguided bombs once they gain a more robust precision capability. We will definitely keep following the ambitious U.S.-backed plans to transform the force.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 2, 2020",Almost All of the UK’s Surface Combatants Are in Port While Germany Has No Working Subs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. British and German naval forces are both suffering from historically low readiness, with almost all of the Royal Navy’s destroyers and frigates in port and none of Germany’s submarines in working order. This only underscores existing concerns about both organizations spending priorities match their needs and their abilities to respond to crises close to home and outside of Europe. On Dec. 20, 2017, the Royal Navy acknowledged that only one of its 13 Type 23 frigates, HMS St. Albans , was on duty protecting the United Kingdom’s national waters and that all six of its Type 45 destroyers were also pierside. Two months earlier, after an accident crippled the submarine U-35 , the German Navy, or Deutsche Marine , was similarly forced to concede that this meant that all six of its Type 212A boats were sidelined for repairs. For its part, the Royal Navy remains “deployed globally on operations and will be protecting our national interests throughout Christmas and New Year,” a spokesperson insisted to The Telegraph newspaper . “There will be 13 ships and submarines deployed away and in home waters, as well as the at sea nuclear deterrent .” That only one of these 13 deployed vessels is a major surface combatant is a serious issue, though, and speaks to broader readiness and morale issues across the board. What the U.K. Ministry of Defense had said would be “The Year of the Royal Navy” has turned out to be full of significant disappointments for the service. The Type 45 destroyer HMS Diamond sits in the fog at the loading bay at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Portsmouth., Crown Copyright In June 2017, the HMS Queen Elizabeth , the Royal Navy’s first super carrier and its largest ship ever, did first put to sea for the first time. Earlier in December 2017, Queen Elizabeth II herself commissioned the ship, which is named after 16th century monarch Queen Elizabeth I , who famously directed the country’s naval forces to destroy the Spanish Armada . “Today marks the start of a hugely significant chapter for the Royal Navy, and indeed the nation, as the future flagship is commissioned into Her Majesty’s fleet,” U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said at the commissioning ceremony on Dec. 7, 2017. “It is an honor to witness the crowning moment of an extraordinarily busy year for the Royal Navy that has seen us name the second carrier, HMS Prince of Wales , cut steel on the first Type 26 frigates and launch the National Shipbuilding Strategy.” Below is a full video of Queen Elizabeth’s commissioning ceremony: What Williamson didn’t mention was that the Royal Navy has yet to receive any operational F-35B Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to begin forming the core of Queen Elizabeth ’s air wing, that the Fleet Air Arm might not ever have enough of those aircraft to operate that ship and Prince of Wales simultaneously in the strike role , and that the Ministry of Defense was considering scrapping its last two amphibious warfare ships, along with other cuts, to both help pay for the carriers and find sailors to serve on them. That’s to say nothing of technical issues with the United Kingdom’s Vanguard -class ballistic missile submarines and apparently terrifyingly poor discipline and low morale among the sailors on board those boats. Then in December 2017, one of Queen Elizabeth ’s propeller shafts sprung a leak during as the ship progressed through additional sea trials, leading to reports of significant, but brief flooding in one of the engine compartments. This is actually not uncommon and is exactly why navies put ships through these types of tests before committing them to actual operations, something Defense Secretary Williamson was quick to point out to the BBC . “It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials program will not be affected,” a Royal Navy spokesperson also said in a stament to the national broadcaster. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gJ6DdNq98SE But critics were quick to seize on as more evidence the ship, which cost more than $4 billion to build, isn’t ready for real missions, with or without aircraft. It didn’t help U.K. officials had tried to hide the issue, according to the BBC, before downplaying its significance. The latest news that a confluence of maintenance issues and crew turnovers had forced the bulk of the Royal Navy’s most capable surface warships into port at the same time only raises new questions about the service’s ability to conduct major operations or make real use of its new carrier in the near term. As we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly , the United Kingdom might not have enough destroyers and frigates at present to provide a full complement of escorts and conduct separate naval activities even when all of its Type 23s and Type 45s are combat ready. HMS Queen Elizabeth , at left, with a pair of Type 23 frigates as escorts., Crown Copyright As Defense Secretary Williamson noted, construction on the first Type 26 frigates, which will replace the older Type 23s, started in July 2017. The Ministry of Defense doesn’t expect the first three of those ships, also known as the City -class , to be ready for service until the mid-2020s and there’s no fixed timeline for when the eighth and last ship will arrive. The present plans do not provide for a one-for-one replacement of the Type 23s, either. The United Kingdom has yet to settle on a final design for the five less capable Type 31e General Purpose Frigates that it plans to buy to make up the difference. Pre-existing budget cuts and economic uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s planned departure from the European Union, commonly known as the British Exit or Brexit , surely haven’t helped matters any. In October 2017, BAE Systems, which is part of the consortium responsible for the Queen Elizabeth -class carriers and owns the shipyard building the Type 26s, announced it would cut 2,000 jobs in the United Kingdom, including hundreds supporting the Royal Navy activities. As such, there are already indications that the U.K. Ministry of Defense may be looking to its NATO and other European allies to help with the shortfall, operating the ship in concert with other navies to reduce the strain on its own forces. The United Kingdom and the United States have gone so far as to sign a deal that will put U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs on board Queen Elizabeth for her as yet unscheduled first operational cruise in order to make up for the lack of Fleet Air Arm aircraft. Queen Elizabeth during her initial sea trials in June 2017., Crown Copyright The state of Germany’s navy suggests that there could be serious problems with this course of action, too. For the Deutsche Marine , the fate of the Type 212A submarines is similarly indicative of more widespread issues across the service. The boats are an advanced and extremely quiet diesel-electric design that uses an air-independent propulsion system centered on hydrogen fuel cells that allows them to stay under water for weeks at a time. The submarines form a key component of NATO’s plans to seal off the heavily contested Baltic Sea in the event of a major crisis, especially any potential military confrontation with Russia in that region. Unfortunately, the class has been a maintenance nightmare since the German Navy commissioned the first two boats in 2005. The issue is really two separate problems creating what has become a perpetual cycle of breakdowns and delays in getting boats back into service. After the end of the Cold War, the German government, focused heavily on rehabilitating what had been an independent East Germany, and in the face of what appeared to be dramatically reduced security concerns in Europe, slashed defense budgets and the size of its military as a whole. The German Navy ordered only limited stocks of critical spare parts up front for its new Type 212As. The German Navy’s Type 212A submarine U-32 . , Bundeswehr Now, the Deutsche Marine effectively has to special order new parts for every major repair, which has proven to be an expensive and time consuming process. At the same time, the consortium of German ship builders responsible for the submarines have had only a limited chance to develop their own experience with the type and shore up adequate supply chains and skilled labor forces, leading to further delays and persistent problems. When U-35 , Germany’s fifth Type 212A, joined the country’s navy in 2015, a problem with its main screw created so much noise that it was impossible for the submarine to operate effectively, according to report by Der Spiegel . Radar and communication equipment failures and accidents further crippled the ship. Unnamed Deutsche Marine personnel at the time complained to Der Spiegel that they had identified these same issues with U-31 years earlier and that the main contractor, ThyssenKrupp, had done nothing to fix them. When it commissioned U-36 the next year, the service initially cannibalized many of her parts to keep its sister ship operational. Budgetary and logistical constraints mean that it’s not clear when Germany will have all six boats operational again . German shipyards are simply unable to perform the necessary work on all of the Type 212As at once, further slowing down the repair cycle. The German Navy expects that U-36 will be back in service by May 2018. U-31 , which has been sidelined since 2014, just finished its overhaul, but still needs to complete a normal series of sea trials before returning to active duty, slated for some time in 2018, as well. Maintenance on U-34 will start in January 2018 and repairs on U-33 will begin the next month. It’s not clear how long it will take to get those two boats back in service. There is no firm start date for when there will be shipyard space for U-32 , which suffered a battery failure on its way to Norway for an exercise in July 2017. And then there’s the matter of U-35 , which likely hit a rock during a dive off Norway, severely damaging one of its four stern planes, which is now waiting in line for repairs. Even if the boats were all in working order, it wouldn’t matter, though. The Deutsche Marine only has three fully trained crews and continues to struggle to meet its recruiting goals. Keeping those sailors proficient while the submarines are sidelined can only be a challenge and could further reduce their readiness. “This is a disaster for the Navy,” Hans-Peter Bartels, who is presently the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces in Germany, told German outlet NPD in December 2017. He added that he believed it was the “first time in history” that all of the service’s submarines would “have nothing to do for months.” Two Type 212A submarines at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft shipyard Kiel in 2013., Bjoertvedt via Wikimedia Starting in 2014, Germany has been steadily increasing its defense spending. This was initially in response to increasing concerns about Russia’s revanchist foreign policy since the Kremlin seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. Tensions between the Kremlin and NATO, as well as other non-aligned neighbors, such as Sweden and Finland , have steadily increased since then. In 2016, German Chancellor Anegla Merkel promised even more significant increases in the country’s defense budget, citing pressure from U.S. President Barack Obama. At the same time, then U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump had made a campaign issue out of NATO members’ contributions to their collective defense. Since winning the election and taking office in January 2017, Trump has continued continued to demand that America’s European allies increase these expenditures. “The turnaround for the better has begun,” Bartels said. “The basic decisions have been made, but it will take years again for that to happen.” His surety may not reflect the political landscape in Germany, though, where the most recent federal election has left the dominant, centrist Christian Democrat (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) political bloc scrambling to build a coalition government. Its long-time partner, the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD) has gone into opposition. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the SPD, declared earlier in 2017 that any increase in defense spending should be focused entirely on humanitarian efforts, underscoring a fundamental debate about the role of the German military in the world. This in turn has had a direct impact on defense procurement. Nowhere is this perhaps more visible than with the German Navy’s newest surface combatants, the Baden-Wurttemberg -class “frigate,” which has a displacement closer to what other navies would classify as a destroyer, but very little in the way of firepower to match its size. The ships are almost exclusively focused on low-threat missions such as counter-piracy and humanitarian relief. The German frigate FRG Baden-Württemberg. , Bundeswehr On top of that, as has happened with the German Navy’s Type 212As, these ships may be suffering from Germany’s limited shipbuilding capacity. There are reports of a persistent list of more than a degree and the vessels are notably overweight compared to the initial design specifications, both of which could limit their operational capabilities. There are also similar questions about whether or not there will be enough sailors to operate them effectively or if their small crew size is adequate to begin with. You can read all about these ships in depth in a separate feature from our own Tyler Rogoway . The states of the Royal Navy and the Deutsche Marine are both worrisome, but even more so when taken together, given the aforementioned increasing tensions with Russia and China’s growing worldwide naval capabilities . It especially calls into question NATO’s ability to respond to contingencies or skirmishes in the Baltic Sea , the North Sea , the Black Sea , and the Mediterranean . German Tanker FGS Spessart , at center, refuels both the Type 23 frigate HMS St Albans, at left, and the Norwegian Frigate HNoMS Roald Admundson, as the ships shadowed the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov earlier in 2017., Crown Copyright In all of those areas, the Russian military in particular is increasingly positioning itself, thanks to integrated air defenses and shore-based anti-ship capabilities , increased submarine patrols, and other capabilities, to deny access in a crisis. Moscow is also investing heavily in capabilities to jam or otherwise disrupt communication nodes and navigation systems, as well. It also limits the ability of both countries, either separately or as part of NATO or other international organizations, to project naval power elsewhere in the world when necessary. One of the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers, HMS Diamond , had been on patrol in the Persian Gulf when it suffered a mechanical problem in November 2017 and had to head home for repairs without another similar British ship being able to take its place. As Germany’s Bartels noted, it will take years to truly turn things around in that country and the same is true in the United Kingdom. It’s clear, though, that the present course in both cases is only going to become more unsustainable and that the Royal Navy and the Deutsche Marine will need to take a hard look at their priorities to make sure they remain capable and credible forces in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 28, 2018",Now The Air Force Wants New Engines For Its B-52s That Burn 40 Percent Less Fuel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released new details about its desired requirements for a possible program to re-engine its fleet of Boeing B-52H Stratofortress bombers. The service says it is hoping the upgrades could improve fuel efficiency by up to 40 percent, provide more on board electrical power, be hardened against nuclear explosions and cyber attacks, and otherwise keep the aircraft combat ready until at least 2050, at which point the youngest among them will have been in operation for nearly 90 years. Between Dec. 12 and 13, 2017, the Air Force held a series of meetings with industry representatives at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, home of the 2nd Bomb Wing and its B-52s. The service released the briefing slides from those events on FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on Dec. 15, 2017, which FlightGlobal was first to report. Engine-makers Honeywell, General Electric , Pratt & Whitney , Rolls Royce , and Safran USA were all in attendance, as was Boeing and various other potential vendors, according to the briefing slides. “This event does not indicate a promise by the Government to issue a request for proposal or a solicitation of any type,” the Air Force stressed up front. “Nothing discussed in this meeting authorizes you to work, start work, or bill for work.” USAF The need to re-engine the aircraft is steadily becoming inevitable at this point, though. One of the slides said that Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees both the B-52s and the United States’ land-based, nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, expects the BUFFs to remain operational at least until 2050, and possibly beyond. The aircraft will be the primary launch platform for the up-coming Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) nuclear capable cruise missile. The bombers, which began to receive new equipment that allows them to carry precision guided munitions in their bomb bays in November 2017, will continue to fly conventional missions , well. One of the 2nd Bomb Wing’s B-52Hs., USAF Re-engining the bombers will be essential if the service actually expects them to remain combat ready for nearly nine decades, and they clearly know it. The Air Force’s industry day confirmed that it is looking for a one-for-one replacement for each of the eight engines on its 76 B-52s – a full purchase order that would include at least more than 600 new engines, not counting spares, plus new nacelles and pods, electrical systems and other improvements. The new commercial-off-the-shelf powerplants would need to be at least 20 percent more fuel efficient the existing TF33 turbofans. The last time the Air Force looked into re-engining the fleet in 2014 the minimum requirement was between 15 and 25 percent. But this 20 percent minimum increase in efficiency metric is just a threshold number, the service is hoping it might actually be able to find replacement engines that are up to 40 percent more fuel efficient. The long and somewhat fruitless saga of B-52H re-engine attempts., USAF At the same time, the new engines can’t impact the aircraft’s flight performance, center of gravity, or limit its maximum takeoff weight or weapon carrying capacity. The Air Force does say it might be willing to consider changes to the aircraft’s structure that require changes in weapon release envelopes. In line with the B-52���s nuclear mission, the engines and their associated hardware have to be hardened against electromagnetic pulses from nuclear weapons going off nearby. Any vendor that proposed a commercial engine with the ability to send out information wirelessly about its functionality for maintenance purposes would have to disable that feature and otherwise shield the system from cyber attacks. USAF However, the Air Force does want the engines to be able to record important functional data to help ground crews spot and identify problems. The 2014 plan called for a minimum of 15 to 25 years of service life on each engine before the need for a major depot-level overhaul and an overall sustainment plan laid out to nearly 2055. The briefing slides do not say whether or not these requirements have changed since then. The eight engines should also be able to provide at least 400 kilovolt-amps (kVA) of on board power in total at a typical cruise speed, the same as a heavy duty portable commercial power generator, and potentially up to 500 kVA. The Air Force says the extra power is necessary to help support unspecified future upgrades, but lasers and standoff electronic warfare systems are likely growth capacities for a re-engined B-52, all of which require a lot of power. USAF Above all, the goal is to be able to implement this significant update without the need for dramatic changes to the wings, engine pods and pylons, and cowlings and nacelles. The new powerplants will need to seamlessly work with the existing fuel lines, as well as hydraulic and pneumatic systems. The Air Force hopes whatever new engines it might buy won’t have a need for serious maintenance that requires ground crews to remove them from the aircraft entirely for at least 6,000 flight hours at a time on average, and up to 8,000 flight hours if possible. When the engines do come off, the service wants maintainers to be able to swap them out in four hours or less. Air Force personnel work on the engines on a B-52H bomber., USAF The biggest question that remains is how long it might take for the Air Force to get the re-engine program up and running. In its industry day briefings, the service said that there was a team already in place to manage the project and initial funds in the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year that President Donald Trump signed into law on Dec. 12, 2017. Unfortunately, Congress has yet to appropriate any actual money to go towards that budget and the U.S. government as a whole continues to move along on short-term funding measures known as “continuing resolutions.” At the same time, the Air Force itself has not settled on an acquisition plan, having described three potential courses of action that it could consider. USAF Two of these involve reviews of separate formal proposals for the necessary aircraft modifications and the engines themselves that are either simultaneous or split into a two-step process. The other option would be to let the contractor integrating the new engines on the B-52s pick the powerplants it deems best suited for the upgrade. In its industry day presentation, the Air Force offered a detailed timeline of how the process might work under the two-phase plan. If it could get things moving in the 2018 fiscal year, the initial low-rate conversion process wouldn’t begin until 2025 and full-rate work would run through at least 2034. Air Force personnel “wash” an B-52H’s engines with a special solution to help prevent corrosion., USAF This means the bulk of the B-52s could continue flying with their older engines for another decade at least. Each one of the existing TF33 turbofans, which have been out of production for decades, need a complete depot overhaul every 6,000 flight hours. This process costs the Air Force approximately $2 million every time. USAF As we at the War Zone have mentioned numerous times before , absent some form of public-private partnership, it could continue to be difficult for the Air Force to find the necessary funding for this new project as well as its other modernization priorities, including other updates for its two legs of the nuclear triad, such as the B-21 Raider stealth bomber , new IBCMs , and the LSRO program . That latest defense budget would provide ample funding these existing projects, but the Congressional Budget Office has warned that nuclear modernization plans alone could ultimately cost more than $1 trillion . USAF A public-private deal could get around this by offering to pay contractors primarily out of the cost savings from the new, more fuel efficient engines, potentially making the re-engine effort cost-neutral for the Air Force. If the suppliers can achieve the goal of a 40 increase in efficiency, this type of arrangement could be even more attractive. Agreeing to start work without a firm understanding off the ultimate benefits could still require a leap of faith for any vendors involved in the final project, though. As noted, the Air Force will have to decide how it wants to proceed soon if it plans to get new engines onto the B-52s any time soon. In the meantime, the aircraft will continue to fly combat missions with the same engines they had when they entered service in the early 1960s.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",The US Air Force Still Has At Least One MAC-10 Submachine Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Military Armament Corporation Model 10 submachine gun, better known as the MAC-10, is an iconic gun, but one that many people are likely to associate with criminals and Hollywood movies. Its designer, Gordon Ingram , and his business partner Mitchell WerBell III , had originally hoped it would become an essential tool for special operations forces, covert operatives, and law enforcement – and apparently some are still sitting in U.S. military armories. On Dec. 13, 2017, members of the U.S. Air Force’s 492nd Special Operations Wing held a meet-and-greet and tour for civilians at Hurlburt Field in Florida. There was even a firepower demonstration and the unit brought out an array of American and foreign firearms, including a well-worn MAC-10 with a sound suppressor. Other unusual weapons on display included a folding stock variant of the ubiquitous Kalashnikov AK assault rifle, an Israeli Galil SAR carbine, and an Austrian Steyr AUG assault rifle. The 492nd helps train members of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), test aircraft, and develop new special operations tactics and techniques. Until May 2017, the unit had been known as the Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center, or AFSOAWC . Like other special operations elements in the U.S. military, AFSOC personnel familiarize themselves with various uncommon and foreign weapons that they might encounter in the field, especially while training friendly troops overseas . As such, it’s not surprising that the Wing has older and more obscure weapons on hand. Visitors to Hurlburt Field on Dec. 13, 2017 talk to a member of the 492nd Special Operations Wing in front of a table of various firearms., USAF Official photos from the event show a member of the 492nd hosing down various reactive targets, including containers of water and one that burst into flame, with the diminutive MAC-10. The target range also included a dummy sitting on a mock bus stop bench with a bottle of “booze” in paper bag. It’s a setup that plays more to the popular conception of the gun as a sidearm of bank robbers, drug dealers, gang members, and other criminals, which certainly became true in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, movies and television shows further popularized the MAC-10 and its derivatives as the weapon of choice for criminals and terrorists and anti-hero cops and mercenaries alike. MAC-10 with suppressor. , Mike Cumpston/wikicommons At less than a foot long with its wire stock folded up and less than seven pounds empty, the small guns were easy to carry concealed. They might not have been particularly accurate, but firing more than 1,000 rounds per minute, they could lay down a hail of fire in a confined space. With that rate of fire, a shooter could expend the gun’s magazine – with 30 rounds in the .45 caliber version and 32 in the 9mm variant – in seconds, though. But these same attributes that made them attractive to criminals were the ones Ingram and WerBell thought would make them ideal for counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism type missions, as well as for police duties and VIP protection details. The U.S. military’s interest in such weapons, during the Vietnam War in particular , is quite possibly how it came to be in possession of the 492nd’s MAC-10 in the first place. In the 1950s, Ingram had set up his own firm, Police Ordnance Company, selling in part weapons of his own design. His .45 caliber Model 6, which looks similar to the legendary Thompson submachine gun, achieved at best moderate success with law enforcement organizations and he found little interest in his subsequent designs in the United States or abroad. In 1964, he crafted his first prototype Model 10 in .45 caliber. The next year he made a second prototype in 9mm. He found no takers for his newest guns and shelved the project, moving on to take an engineering job with aviation firm Fairchild-Hiller. During the same period, WerBell had been working separately developing sound suppressors and other specialized weapons for elite U.S. military units and government groups focusing on covert and clandestine activities, such as the Central Intelligence Agency. His company, Studies in the Operational Negation of Insurgents and Counter-Subversion, or SIONICS, built suppressors for the M14 and M16 rifles that went to special operations elements fighting in Southeast Asia. WerBell, a veteran of the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, the precursor organization to the CIA, and professional mercenary later in life felt a Model 10 with one of his suppressors would be well suited to discreet operations. Typical .45 caliber loads propel the bullet at subsonic speeds, which already eliminates the usual sharp crack that would come from the bullet breaking the sound barrier. He offered Ingram a partnership deal, which eventually morphed into a new company called Military Armament Corporation (MAC) in 1970. The firm subsequently rebranded the guns as MAC-10s and offered a smaller .380 caliber version called the MAC-11 . With connections to the CIA and the U.S. special operations communities, and by extension to similar foreign military and intelligence organizations, WerBell became the gun’s primary pitchman. He toured all over, but especially in Southeast Asia demonstrating MAC-10s for American, South Vietnamese, and Thai military personnel , among others. WerBell was so eager to show off the gun, Ingram had to design quick craft an initial batch of suppressors to go along with the guns for the initial trips, according to one article from Small Arms Review . https://www.instagram.com/p/BD_kQdpj0ka WerBell did eventually develop a SIONICS unit specifically for the MAC-10 that featured two distinct chambers that would bleed off propellant gasses, reducing noise from firing and eliminating any muzzle flash. It also served as an easy way to hold the gun steady, but quickly became too hot for shooters to hold with their bare hands, leading to the further addition of Nomex cover. U.S. Army Special Forces and the U.S. Navy SEALs and Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) did purchase small numbers of the guns, along with a host of other submachine guns and compact rifles . The SEALs and UDTs still had the guns in their armories at least until 1982, when the Navy merged the two organizations together. In April 2016, the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana said “Cats and Dogs” – a reference to small numbers of various non-standard guns – were among the rifles and submachine guns still in Navy arsenals in a official briefing describing plans to consolidate that inventory. The same is likely true of arms lockers throughout the special operations community and even among some regular units, especially in the Air Force, where small arms are generally not a priority . The Navy’s small arms inventory as of 2016, including “Cats and Dogs” in various categories., USN The MAC-10s appeared in the arsenals of similar units around the world, too, but never in large numbers. The Israelis did use them in lieu of their own Uzi submachine guns during the famous raid to liberate hostages at Entebbe airport in Uganda in 1976. Law enforcement officials were dismissive of the MAC-10. “I didn’t think the MAC-10 and -11 were up to police requirements for either accuracy or burst control,” David Steele, who served for a time a weapons researcher for the International Association of Police Chiefs, wrote in The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons , first published in 1986. “I thought both MAC models were fit only for combat in a phone booth.” The gun made its big break in Hollywood in the hands of John Wayne’s titular main character in the movie McQ , with the weapon being a prominent feature in the marketing material for the film, but it wasn’t enough . Infighting within the company had pushed out both Ingram and WerBell, according to another Small Arms Review article . By 1975, MAC filed for bankruptcy. The end of the Vietnam War and the U.S. military’s shift away from guerrilla warfare, special operations, and counter-insurgency couldn’t have helped matters any. A succession of companies purchased the rights to build the submachine guns, but there continued to be only limited interest among military and law enforcement groups. As already noted, it became increasingly common to find them in the hands of criminals and terrorists and the MAC-10 became in many ways synonymous with crime in the 1980s . Any success on the civilian market was initially cut short by the 1984 Firearm Owners Protection Act , which banned the sale of new production machine guns to private citizens, immediately leading to a surge in the price of existing weapons that the law grandfathered in and making them prohibitively expensive. Companies still make semi-automatic derivatives and there are still a number of fully-automatic versions that individuals can legally purchase, all depending on local laws and ordnances.  But the guns are mainly popular among civilians for competitive shooting and as a sort of cult classic among firearms collectors, given both their history as a special operations weapon and their more recent associations. For the 492nd, its MAC-10 appears to be equally more for show than anything else at this point. However, there is growing interest among special operations forces in more compact firepower once again.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Trump Steps Over The Line,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Absolutely historic moments occurred just minutes ago as President Donald Trump visited Truce Village , historically the highest profile and one of the tensest locations along the demilitarized zone that bisects the Korean Peninsula. Trump met Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at the demarcation line that runs through the site, stepped over it at the invitation of Kim, and then walked dozens of feet into North Korea territory with remarkably little security in the immediate vicinity for a photo op. It was truly an amazing, albeit hectic moment to behold. In total, the meeting between Trump and Kim lasted roughly an hour and took place in Freedom House on the South Korean side of the demarcation line. After the meeting, Trump escorted Kim back to North Korean territory with South Korean President Moon Jae-In by his side. As far as we know, the entire affair came together within roughly a day’s time after Trump tweeted that he would like to meet Kim during his visit to the DMZ. Uncharacteristically, North Korea accepted the request within just a matter of hours via diplomatic channels and on state-run media. Even if the Secret Service knew there was a possibility that this could occur, one can only imagine how much work it took in such a tiny amount of time to ensure the President would be safe for the unprecedented rendezvous, not just from an official act of aggression, but also from an incident resulting from confusion or the actions of a lone actor. It was truly an amazing feat in logistics and security operations to behold. Negotiations between the two countries over North Korea’s ever-growing nuclear arsenal had stalled after Trump walked out on Kim during their second summit in Hanoi last February. Although The War Zone had been highly critical of how the first summit and the subsequent negotiations were handled, we had encouraged direct engagement at the highest levels between North Korea and the U.S. from well before Trump had floated the idea. We also thought his decision to walk out on Kim in Hanoi once he finally realized that after eight months no substantial progress was to be made, was the right one . Kim Jong Un remains a brutal dictator and presides over a government that is one of the world’s worst human rights offenders. North Korea is also no closer to nuclear disarmament now than before Kim decided to enter a period of detente prior to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. In fact, by all accounts, the regime’s nuclear arsenal has only expanded since then. Following the crumbling of negotiations in Hanoi, the entire issue had been in a state of purgatory of sorts—one which seemed particularly ideal for the North Korean regime. Still, robust sanctions have been having an impact on the country’s already notoriously rickety economy and doing nothing seemed more like a tacit acknowledgment of North Korea as a nuclear state than anything else. In addition, Kim had started testing short-range ballistic missiles again, which irked North Korea’s neighbors and was an ominous sign of what could come. North Korea had also labeled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo persona non grata to future talks, meaning future progress via the State Department looked unlikely at best. A U.S. special envoy had since been named to North Korea, Stephen Biegun , but it was unclear what the change of a point man would accomplish. With all this in mind, the answer as to what the next step should be regarding North Korea’s nukes seemed largely elusive, with the White House discounting the issue and claiming progress in terms of North Korea’s nuclear and missile testing activities and a less confrontational state along the DMZ. All the while, Trump maintained that he had a great relationship with Kim and continued to sing his praises. The two also exchanged letters during this period, which may have got the ball rolling on the historic meeting at the DMZ. So, was Trump’s social media olive branch a good move? I think it was. We are where we are. We can debate the decisions of the recent past, but it won’t change them. Trying to jumpstart talks can’t do much harm as Trump has already given away the photo op of North Korea’s dreams—twice—and elevated Kim on the international level. Making history by having a U.S. president step foot on North Korean soil may help further erode the distrust between the two long-time foes or it could go down as another dead-end in North Korean-U.S. diplomacy, we just don’t know. What happens next is what really matters. Supposedly, both sides with put teams together for imminent negotiations. How this will be different than before remains unclear, but another round of engagement on some non-executive level is now in the works. Will this reinvigorated process flounder on for months again? North Korea had mastered a unique flavor of never-ending diplomatic foreplay long ago and it continues to wield it with incredible prowess. Or will the Trump Administration cut to the chase with Kim’s crew? Clearly, the slow-roll wait and see attitude and the placation of North Korea’s diplomatic corps’ wily tactics won’t go anywhere. So, we could very well be right back where we were within a number of weeks. But then the Trump Administration’s second chance at negotiations with Pyongyang would have come and gone and it would be hard to argue that it isn’t finally time to draft new policy surrounding the idea that North Korea has no intention to denuclearize for the foreseeable future. So yeah, the chances that this will actually change anything are very low. But considering the stakes and where we were at up until this point, why not give it a shot? And yes, it is troubling that the President of the United States seems to relate so well to dictators and tends to fawn over them incessantly, especially Kim. But setting that aside, this is his strategy that is unfolding and we are already deep in it whether some like it or not. It’s one that is all about him and his stated ability to gain unprecedented leverage on America’s most bitter foes via personal relationships and flattery. If it doesn’t bear fruit then he will have to live with that highly inconvenient reality going into the 2020 election. Still, we can’t stress enough that even after this historic event, there remain zero indications of any kind that North Korea is willing to actually give up its nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. In fact, denuclearization wasn’t even mentioned in any of the comments the President made today, at least that I heard. Regardless, one thing that may unite the U.S. during these turbulent and politically-charged times is the thought of how great it would be to see the concertina wire torn down, the wild expanses demined, and Truce Village turned into a museum once and for all. That DMZ, and the standoff that goes along with it, is a cancer on humanity’s soul. If Trump can somehow excise it, we should all be ready and willing to congratulate him for doing so.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 20, 2019",Boeing Unveils Prototype For The Navy’s MQ-25 Drone Tanker Competition (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After piquing our interest with a cryptic post on Twitter, Boeing has given us the very first look at its prototype for the US Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray unmanned tanker initiative. The Chicago-headquartered firm is now the second entrant in that competition, the other being General Atomics , to offer a look at their full concept and the first to show off an actual working prototype. On Dec. 19, 2017, Boeing made the full announcement about the new unmanned aircraft from Phantom Works, the company’s secretive design division that is roughly analogous Lockheed Martin’s legendary Skunk Works. The firm did not say if the drone had internal nomenclature or nickname, as had been the case with its Phantom Ray entry into the Navy’s abortive Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program, or UCLASS . Lockheed Martin is now the only remaining participant in the MQ-25 program, also known as the Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), to have not revealed art or images of their entry. “Boeing has been delivering carrier aircraft to the Navy for almost 90 years,” Don Gaddis, the head of the refueling system program at Boeing’s Phantom Works, said in a press release. “Our expertise gives us confidence in our approach. We will be ready for flight testing when the engineering and manufacturing development contract is awarded.” Boeing says the drone is functional, though it hasn’t flown. It will finish engine test runs on the ground ahead of deck handling demonstrations in early 2018. The Navy wants all of the competitors to submit their formal MQ-25 proposals by Jan. 3, 2018. There is no doubt about it, Boeing’s design looks impressive and follows somewhat with the very limited amount of concept art the company released in the past for the UNCLASS unmanned naval combat air vehicle program that was later replaced by the far less ambitious CBARS tanker initiative. The landing gear look carrier ready, and although there isn’t a requirement for stealth, the design does appear to have some low-observable features although it isn’t optimized specifically in that manner. Also note that the prototype has the same artwork on it as the UNCLASS art below. The inlet design still remains a mystery as the photo Boeing has released seems to show a tiny inlet area built into the aircraft’s bulbous forward fuselage. This is likely an optical illusion, or a smaller inlet for other purposes, and a larger inlet exists that can be seen from more elevated viewing angles. Boeing In all, Boeing’s MQ-25 entrant’s configuration is similar on a basic level to General Atomics’ Sea Avenger concept, which itself was remodeled from the Predator-C/Avenger unmanned aircraft . Both designs include wide v-tails, a dorsal inlet, a chined fuselage, and so on. General Atomics—maker of the Predator,  Reaper, and Avenger drones—has shown their Sea Avenger concept which reworks their Predator-C/Avenger into a more bulky fuel truck. We still have no idea what Lockheed will bring to the competition, but it’s probably safe to say it will be highly impressive. , General Atomics We don’t know if Boeing’s airframe was designed with growth potential for other missions in mind, such as the ability to act as a multi-sensor platform or communications node, or even eventually being able to carry a small weapons payload if the Navy should ask for such a capability. If any of this is so, Boeing would need to include areas for bays or apertures that could potentially accommodate these systems. Supposedly the Navy already wants at least an area for a radar to be mounted as a future capacity for growth. Upon close examination, there does seem to be a relatively large ventral bay shown directly behind the aircraft’s nose gear doors. It isn’t clear if this is a large access panel that has been left open or if this is a payload bay of some kind. There appears to be an access area or bay behind the main gear. It isn’t clear if this is a space for missionized equipment or if it could even potentially be adapted into a weapons bay in the future., Boeing We have contacted Boeing for more images and details and they politely told us that they aren’t going to release anything further until the new year. Regardless, Boeing has an outstanding and seemingly very under utilized legacy when it comes to high-end unmanned aircraft systems. The company gave birth (at least publicly speaking) to the semi-autonomous and networked unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) concept a decade and a half ago and self funded further exploration into this space before the USAF largely started acting as if this game-changing capability didn’t exist. Winning the MQ-25 contract, which appears to be far from highly lucrative , at least initially, would give the company a massive foothold into the true future of air combat. Considering the company’s success with Naval fighters, the Navy’s carriers seem like a perfect place for Boeing to finally begin this forestalled revolution. But it must be noted that we still don’t know exactly what is flying in the classified realm, although we can easily speculate with confidence, and considering Lockheed still hasn’t come forward with their offering, Boeing and General Atomics could still be very surprised by a highly mature competitor thanks to the Skunk Works and their experience with high-end unmanned aircraft. We will continue to keep you up to date on how Boeing’s MQ-25 and the CBARS program progresses. But considering the requirements for the Navy’s first high-end carrier-based drone were so heavily watered down over the years, the prospect of slowly transforming carrier air wings into unmanned swarms is still very exciting and it will have wide-ranging strategic and tactical implications in the decades to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",We Broke Down Trump’s Security Strategy Into Bullets So You Don’t Have To Read All 60 Pages,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, then candidate Donald Trump spent a considerable amount of time highlighting potential threats to the United States at home and abroad. Now after nearly a year in office, full of national and international crises , the president has unveiled a new national security strategy that he insists will put “America first.” On Dec. 18, 2017, the White House released the full strategy in text form ahead of Trump’s speech announcing the latest over-arching security policies for America. The nearly 60-page document does outline The Trump Administration’s broad understanding of the present geo-political situation around the world, America’s interests within that context, potential threats to those goals, and what the U.S. government can do to safeguard itself. The White House broke down this national security overview into four core national security pillars: protecting the American way of life, promoting American prosperity, preserving peace through strength, and advancing American influence. Though non-binding and broadly worded, the strategy does offer a new sense of the Trump Administration’s desired direction for the country. President Donald Trump speaks at Yokota Air Base in Japan in November 2017., Kyodo via AP By way of introduction In his written introduction, Trump said “I pledged that we would revitalize the American economy, rebuild our military, defend our borders, protect our sovereignty, and advance our values” and that ­ “the United States faces an extraordinarily dangerous world, filled with a wide range of threats that have intensified in recent years.” The president specifically calls out North Korea , Iran , “radical Islamist terror groups,” and “ criminal cartels ,” as well as “unfair trade practices” and “unfair burden-sharing with our allies.” Already in 2017, Trump has announced major policy shifts with regards to the war in Afghanistan , countering Iran and its government’s influence outside the country, and the status of the city of Jerusalem . “This National Security Strategy puts America first” and “it is a strategy of principled realism that is guided by outcomes, not ideology.” The full introduction appeals to the ideals of America’s founding principles and traditions, including freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and a respect for the rule of law, noting that “we are proud of our roots and honor the wisdom of the past.” “America’s achievements and standing in the world were neither inevitable nor accidental.” The document specifically mentions the fight to “ end slavery ” during the American Civil War and the African-American civil rights movement , as well as the U.S. military’s participation in World War I and World War II and the Cold War. The United States has “defeated fascism, imperialism, and Soviet communism and eliminated any doubts about the power and durability of republican democracy,” it notes, but does not make any mention of America’s own history as a colonizer . The new national security strategy says these successes “bred complacency,” as other “countries exploited the international institutions we helped to build.” Though it offers no specific examples, the written introduction lambasts unnamed foreign powers and past U.S. presidential administrations as having weakened America’s competitiveness abroad and overburdened Americans with regulations and taxes at home – common , but disputed mantras that Trump repeated during his presidential campaign and after taking office. “The United States will respond to the growing political, economic, and military competitions we face around the world.” Russia and China are both challengers to American interests militarily and economically, the overview notes, before again highlighting the threats that North Korea, and Iran, as well as “jihadist terrorists to transnational criminal organizations pose.” “Rival actors use propaganda and other means to try to discredit democracy,” the national security strategy declares, but makes no specific mention of the widely accepted view that the Russian government directly and actively interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It does however specifically mention the “barbaric ideology” of ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other “jihadist terrorists,” and their desire to impose “ Sharia law .” There are numerous, unfounded conspiracy theories in the United States that American Muslims and immigrants who practice Islam are seeking to impose these Islamic tenants on the rest of the country. The introduction also notes growing conventional and nuclear challenges to U.S. military superiority, but only specifically mentions North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction – including chemical and biological weapons – and its “advanced missiles.” “We learned the difficult lesson that when America does not lead, malign actors fill the void to the disadvantage of the United States.” “Competition does not always mean hostility, nor does it inevitably lead to conflict – although none should doubt our commitment to defend our interests.” H.R. McMaster, Trump’s National Security Advisor and a sitting three star general, is largely viewed as the primary architect behind the White House’s foreign policy doctrine. , AP Pillar I: Protecting the American people, the homeland, and the American way of life “We will strengthen control of our borders and reform our immigration system. We will protect our critical infrastructure and go after malicious cyber actors. A layered missile defense system will defend our homeland against missile attacks. And we will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders.” This first pillar places military attacks from nation states such as North Korea and Iran, terrorist attacks by foreign and domestic actors, drug and human trafficking, intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices , and foreign interference in American political institutions together as the major security threats to the United States and the American way of life. Though the issue of terrorism is heavily framed around the threat of “jihadist terrorists,” the strategy does declare that “the United States rejects bigotry and oppression and seeks a future built on our values as one American people. We will deny violent ideologies the space to take root by improving trust among law enforcement, the private sector, and American citizens.” The need for improved border security, to include the construction of President Trump’s signature border wall and travel bans , are necessary to defend against attacks on the homeland involving weapons of mass destruction, as well as other terror plots, to protect against pandemic diseases , halt transnational criminal activity, protect America from dangerous cyber attacks , and shield critical civilian infrastructure, such as power grids, from physical, cyber, and electromagnetic pulse weapons , more commonly known as EMPs. The proposed responses to each of these threats revolve heavily around calls for more and better intelligence, including sharing information with allies, taking direction action to neutralize threats “at the source” abroad and encouraging foreign partners to do more themselves, and holding anyone who harbored hostile actors or threatens American interests accountable. In his speech, Trump chose to highlight the sharing of intelligence about a potential terrorist attack with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Yesterday I received a call from President Putin of Russia thanking our  country for the intelligence that our CIA was able to provide them  concerning a major terrorist attack planned in St. Petersburg, where many people, perhaps in the thousands, could have been killed. They were able to apprehend these terrorists before the event, with no loss of life. And that’s a great thing, and the way it’s supposed to work. That is the way it’s supposed to work.” We have already seen other examples of this policy with the Trump Administration’s increased willingness to authorize sensitive special operations raids, including in Yemen , Somalia , and across Africa . Trump has also been adamant that America’s allies must contribute more to their shared defense and that partners, such as Pakistan , must do more to combat terrorists within their borders. There were also specific calls for improved and expanded ballistic missile defenses , biomedical innovation to combat infectious diseases , building more secure government computer networks , hardening critical civilian infrastructure against cyber attacks , improving the overall preparedness and readiness of average American citizens for any potentially catastrophic event. Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House in December 2017., Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Pillar II: Promote American Prosperity “We will rejuvenate the American economy for the benefit of American workers and companies. We will insist upon fair and reciprocal economic relationships to address trade imbalances. The United States must preserve our lead in research and technology and protect our economy from competitors who unfairly acquire our intellectual property. And we will embrace America’s energy dominance because unleashing abundant energy resources stimulates our economy.” The Trump administration links economic success directly to national security in its overall strategy, focusing on domestic factors, international relationships, encouraging American innovation, and supporting the American energy sector. In line with the Republican Party’s principles , though economists debate the actual existing and potential impacts , the strategy says that eliminating regulations, reducing taxes, and cutting the national debt are essential to improving the domestic economy. “As the world watches — and the world is indeed watching — we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for American families and businesses.  It will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country,” Trump said in his speech, declining to mention the widespread view that the tax plan will dramatically increase the national debt. There was also a call for improving domestic infrastructure, which is another of Trump’s much repeated campaign promises. “Let me begin by expressing our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers for the victims of the train derailment in Washington State,” Trump said the the beginning of his speech. “It is all the more reason why we must start immediately fixing the infrastructure of the United States.” It is not clear whether the state of the rail infrastructure actually played a part and initial reports suggested an obstruction on the tracks could have been the cause of the accident. There was a separate call for developing programs intended to help Americans get the skills necessary for manufacturing jobs and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. Though there was no specific mention of existing trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has repeatedly criticized , the national security strategy does call for new and “modernized” trade deals. The Trump Administration’s commitment to building new trade partnerships is somewhat undermined by its scuttling of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and hostility to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T-TIP . In addition, the United States should work with “like-minded partners” to counter unfair and corrupt foreign trade practices and other economic activities and to craft unspecified “new market opportunities.” There is a broad call for kick-starting American innovation in science and technology and finding new ways to attract both talented individuals and capital for such projects. The U.S. government should make increased use of public-private partnerships between the U.S. government, universities, private companies, and other organizations, especially for advanced defense and security-focused research and development . The United States needs strong intellectual property protections and similar defenses to guard the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) against “economic theft” and espionage, particularly by China. The U.S. government routinely accuses the Chinese government of stealing military and civilian technical data and other sensitive information, especially through cyber attacks . Congress should strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS , to make sure it better prevents potential opponents from “illicit appropriation of U.S. public and private sector technology and technical knowledge.” An improved and broad emphasis on cyber security will also help defend against the theft of sensitive information. In a major break from President Barak Obama’s Administration, the Trump Administration’s initial national security strategy defines expanding America’s own energy resources as a major imperative and cites global policies intended to mitigate climate change as an implicit threat to U.S. national security. The strategy mentions coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power by name, but does not talk about hydroelectric, solar, wind, or similar power sources. These are referred to collectively as “renewables.” President Trump, who has voiced support for advanced fossil fuel technologies such as “ clean coal ,” has already announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. “U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests.” “The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while expanding our economy. ­ is achievement, which can serve as a model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains, not from onerous regulation.” The report does not specifically note that the Department of Defense remains concerned about the impacts of global climate change both as a cause of instability worldwide and potential danger to its own facilities and activities . AP Pillar III: Preserve Peace Through Strength “We will preserve peace through strength by rebuilding our military so that it remains preeminent, deters our adversaries, and if necessary, is able to fight and win. We will compete with all tools of national power to ensure that regions of the world are not dominated by one power. We will strengthen America’s capabilities – including in space and cyberspace – and revitalize others that have been neglected. Allies and partners magnify our power. We expect them to shoulder a fair share of the burden of responsibility to protect against common threats.” “ Peace through strength ” has been a common phrase among Republicans since President Ronald Reagan popularized it as a party slogan in the 1980s. After Trump took office in January 2017, now disgraced former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn cited it as a central tenant of the administration’s foreign policy. The third pillar reiterates the central categories of threats that are present throughout the rest of the strategy, Russia and China, North Korea and Iran, and terrorists and other trans-national criminals. “China seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region , expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favor.” “Russia aims to weaken U.S. influence in the world and divide us from our allies and partners.” “The Iranian regime sponsors terrorism around the world. It is developing more capable ballistic missiles and has the potential to resume its work on nuclear weapons that could threaten the United States and our partners.” The national security strategy specifically says that Iran’s actions have helped reinforce that in the Middle East that “Israel is not the cause of the region’s problems” and that “states have increasingly found common interests with Israel in confronting common threats.” There had been some evidence to support this conclusion before the Trump Administration decided to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital earlier in December 2017. On Dec. 18, 2017, the United States used its veto power in the United Nations Security Council Resolution to block a statement the other 14 members – including major American allies and partners such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan – had voted for calling for the U.S. government to reverse its decision on the matter. “North Korea is ruled as a ruthless dictatorship without regard for human dignity. For more than 25 years, it has pursued nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of every commitment it has made.” “Jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qa’ida … are linked by a common radical Islamist ideology that encourages violence against the United States and our partners and produces misery for those under their control.” To combat these threats, the national security strategy calls for a significant buildup of the U.S. military, both in size and capability, specifically criticizing the idea that American technological superiority can make up for a shrinking overall force. This theory has increasingly been a hallmark of America military planning since the end of the Cold War, linked to the notion of the so-called “ Revolution in Military Affairs ” and reinforced by the idea of the “Third Offset,” which you can read about more here. “The United States must retain overmatch – the combination of capabilities in sufficient scale to prevent enemy success and to ensure that America’s sons and daughters will never be in a fair fight.” There are broad calls for the improvements in conventional military capabilities , continued modernization of the three legs of America’s nuclear triad , and safeguarding and rejuvenating the defense industrial base to be able to sustain this growth. Notably, the strategy may allude to up-coming changes in the situations where the United States sees the use of nuclear weapons as acceptable, which will likely come out in full as part of the forthcoming, separate Pentagon-wide nuclear posture review. At present, the United States does not have a “ no first use policy ,” but still states that it will not use nuclear weapons except except in response to a very specific set of parameters . “While nuclear deterrence strategies cannot prevent all conflict, they are essential to prevent nuclear attack, non-nuclear strategic attacks, and large-scale conventional aggression. In addition, the extension of the U.S. nuclear deterrent to more than 30 allies and partners helps to assure their security, and reduces their need to possess their own nuclear capabilities.” There are also calls for new defense and security efforts in space and cyberspace . The Trump Administration has already been pushing heavily for a renewed focus on manned space activities , reestablishing the National Space Council under the leadership of Vice President Mike Pence, and has elevated the status of the U.S. military’s Cyber Command . The Intelligence Community’s should continue to expand and improve its ability to collect and fuze information from multiple sources for intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes. The national security strategy gives special emphasis to combing open sources for information, which would include social media and other internet-based sources. To pay for all this, in his speech, Trump called for the elimination of mandatory spending caps that have been in place as a result of the 2011 Budget Control Act, a process known commonly as sequestration. “Our strategy breaks from the damaging defense sequester.  We’re going to get rid of that.” Any president would have limited control over this decision as it is responsibility of congress, though. Legislators continue to struggle to fund full budgets, continue to rely on short-term “ continuing resolutions ” to keep the government in operation. In addition, the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year that lawmakers passed in November 2017 and Trump signed into law earlier in December 2017 doesn’t call for the increase in funding that would be necessary to make Trump’s promises of greatly enlarged military a reality. In addition to military developments, the idea of peace through strength in the national security strategy does include a focus on diplomacy, but with an emphasis on military cooperation. “We must enable forward-deployed field work beyond the confines of diplomatic facilities, including partnering with military colleagues in conflict-affected states.” Diplomats should also focus on forging economic relationships with American allies and partners that favor the United States and employing economic pressure and sanctions against opponents. The diplomatic corps is should be the forefront of countering hostile propaganda and “ weaponized information ” from both state-run media and proxies, such as “trolls” on the internet, a term describing social media accounts and other sources of information that deliberately spread false or damaging information to inflame tensions. The national security strategy specifically highlights China’s use of artificial intelligence to scrape and categorize public internet information about its citizens, Russian information warfare , and terrorist groups recruiting and radicalizing individuals online. “We must consider more cost-effective and efficient ways to deliver and evaluate content consistent with U.S. national security interests.” Olivier Douliery/Abaca Press/Sipa via AP Pillar IV: Advance American Influence “We will advance American influence because a world that supports American interests and reflects our values makes America more secure and prosperous. We will compete and lead in multilateral organizations so that American interests and principles are protected. America’s commitment to liberty, democracy, and the rule of law serves as an inspiration for those living under tyranny. We can play a catalytic role in promoting private-sector-led economic growth, helping aspiring partners become future trading and security partners. And we will remain a generous nation, even as we expect others to share responsibility.” The national security strategy calls for “encouraging aspiring partners” since developing countries with weak institutions and other fragile or failing states are generally the greatest source of instability and threats to U.S. interest. The prime vehicle the Trump Administration has outlined this development is economic, including via public-private partnerships and otherwise encouraging private interests to invest in projects with foreign allies and partners. Those projects have to be of mutual benefit to the United States, though. The strategy specifically insists that this wouldn’t be akin to colonial mercantilism and would benefit both parties. Though China is not mentioned by name, this proposed policy seems specifically targeted at countering the influence the Chinese has gained, especially in Africa , through economic investments and incentives. The Trump Administration is also calling for a renewed focus on American interests in multilateral forums, such as the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund , and World Trade Organization . Trump has personally accused many international organizations of taking an unfair stance toward the United States and its allies . There is a specific call for preserving a “free and open internet” worldwide, though critics of the Federal Communication Commission’s recent repeal of so-called “ Net Neutrality ” rules might contend the Trump administration has not put this policy into practice domestically. Lastly, there is requirement to champion American values, particularly political and religious freedoms, empowering women and youth, and promoting better worldwide food security and healthcare. There is no specific mention of defending the rights of homosexuals and transgender individuals.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2018",Afghanistan’s Rebuilt UH-60s Could Actually Hurt Its Warfighting Ability in the Near Term,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Afghan Air Force pilots are already flying their first UH-60 Black Hawks as part of a U.S.-backed plan , known as the Afghan Aviation Transition Plan, to replace that service’s Mi-17 Hips. Unfortunately, new official data from the Pentagon makes it clear that it will be years before these new American-supplied helicopters can realistically take over from the existing Russian-made ones due to issues with pilot training, maintenance difficulties, and other factors. But what’s most concerning is that these new aircraft are likely to hurt Afghanistan’s combat capabilities in the near term. On Nov. 20, 2017, six members of the Afghan Air Force formally graduated from a conversion training course at Kandahar Airfield, becoming the country’s first pilots qualified to fly the UH-60.  However, as of December 2017, the service had a total of four aircraft and no complete qualified aircrews, to include co-pilots, crew chiefs, and gunners. Contractors are the ones primarily responsible for maintaining the four UH-60A+ helicopters Afghanistan has on hand already. Across the Afghan Air Force, “pilot training remains an issue,” the Pentagon noted in the second of its biannual “Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan” reports for 2017. “The lack of qualified candidates with the necessary technical skills to complete training presents a challenge. Finding suitable candidates with English skills remains difficult, although there has been a steady flow of candidates entering the aircraft maintainer pipeline.” In addition, “The Afghans still rely heavily on CLS [contractor logistics support] to perform nearly all maintenance tasks,” the review continued. “The [Afghan Air Force] will likely rely on CLS for nearly all UH-60 maintenance.” An Afghan Air Force pilot proudly displays his diploma at a ceremony celebrating his graduation from the UH-60 conversion course in November 2017., USAF At present, Afghanistan expects to receive two more UH-60s each month starting in January 2018. The United States ultimately plans to supply a total of nearly 160 of the helicopters, including dozens in a still unspecified gunship configuration that could include rockets and machine guns, known as the UH-60FFF, for “Fixed Forward Firing.” At this rate, the Afghan Air Force will have 28 UH-60s by the end of 2018 and 52 by the end of 2019. The NATO-led advisory mission in the country says it will train a total of 36 individual pilots through 2018, 6 pilots at a time in an eight week conversion training course. As we at The War Zone have noted many times before , expanding the Afghan Air Force’s transport helicopter fleet would definitely improve the country’s ability to rapidly respond to internal threats and be more proactive in taking on militants and terrorists. It would also improve vital casualty and medical evacuation capabilities, which could help reduce the Afghan military’s historically high casualty rates . On top of that, the U.S. military insists that Afghanistan’s Mi-17s, which are the present workhorse of the country’s air force, are increasingly old and unsustainable . The exact age of the existing fleet isn’t clear though, and through 2013, the United States had been perfectly fine with buying new Hips straight from Russia. Following the Kremlin’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, however, the U.S. government began imposing economic sanctions on Russian arms manufacturers and dealers, which steadily increased in response to Moscow’s continued support for separatists fighting the government in Kiev and Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad . The UH-60s for Afghanistan are all older A models upgraded to be as close as possible to the UH-60L variant, primarily by replacing the engines, but still without digital flight management systems and other updates found on newer U.S. military models . Though the update is supposed to reset the lifespan of the airframes, these “new” UH-60A+ Black Hawks for the Afghan Air Force may actually be older than its Mi-17s. Regardless, the United States’ own latest accounting only raises more questions and concerns about whether this is true and whether the new UH-60s offer a realistic way to increase the size and capability of the Afghan Air Force. As of October 2017, Afghanistan had 27 flyable Mi-17s, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR , while another 19 were undergoing heavy maintenance, waiting to do so, or were in the process of returning from an overhaul. The Afghan Air Force has a standing requirement for more than 50 Hips, which it has never been able to meet. A member of the US Air Force moves a Afghan Air Force Mi-17 ahead of loading it onto a cargo aircraft for shipment to a private contractor for overhaul in 2010., USN So, with this in mind, the Afghan Air Force should be able to replace its active Hips by the end of 2018, but this is only half of the transport helicopters it says it needs already. With the deliveries in 2019, the service would still be short of meeting this long-standing and well-defined demand. The Black Hawk also has notably less carrying capacity, meaning that the Afghans could need more UH-60s to perform the same number and scope of missions its Mi-17s are flying now. In November 2017, the U.S. Air Force, which supports the NATO-led advisory effort, said that the plan was to have four fully-qualified UH-60 crews ready by the 2018 “ fighting season ” – which starts in the Spring and runs until snow, low temperatures, and other Winter weather makes fighting impractical for all sides – and another 28 ready by that time in 2019. And given the aforementioned difficulty Afghanistan has in recruiting and training pilots, the NATO advisory mission is focusing first on converting Mi-17s aircrews to fly the UH-60s rather than finding all-new trainees. Though it makes a certain amount of sense to tap an existing source of experienced pilots and crew, there are only a total of 27 fully aircrews qualified for the Mi-17s to pull from in total, according to the Pentagon. Pilots alone could quickly become an issue, since each Black Hawk will need a qualified pilot and a co-pilot. The first 36 UH-60-qualified aviators could only be enough to operate 18 airframes unless there is a separate pipeline for co-pilots or the United States decides to hire contractors to help fly the aircraft, as it has done in the past . Contractors will also likely be essential for sustaining the Black Hawks for the foreseeable future, which are significantly more complex and maintenance intensive than the Mi-17s, at least in the near term. The Afghans have had similar issues with the newer, American-supplied MD-530 light attack helicopters. According to the Pentagon, as of November 2017, private companies were still providing 65 percent of the required logistics support for those aircraft, which the Afghan Air Force had chosen in 2014 after consultations with the United States specifically for its relative ease of operation and maintenance requirements. Ironically, the Afghans are especially proficient at both operating and maintaining their Mi-17s independent of outside support and continue to improve their capability in this regard. “Better maintenance and more disciplined use of the Mi-17 aircraft resulted in better maintenance and lower-than-expected attrition during this reporting period,” the Pentagon acknowledged in its December 2017 review. Since they initial UH-60 pilot candidates had been among those assigned to fly Mi-17s, it might impact the Afghan Air Force’s ability to continue operating its Hips in the meantime, too. Beyond conducting air assault, transport, resupply, and casualty evacuation missions, these older helicopters are an important tool for delivering close air support to Afghan forces on the ground. Between June and November 2017, Mi-17s provided nearly 20 percent of all Afghan Air Force air-to-ground fire support missions using forward-firing unguided rockets and automatic cannon and side-firing machine guns. It’s also worth noting that the entirely separate Special Mission Wing (SMW) has no apparent plans to replace its Mi-17s with UH-60s and has managed to obtain 110 percent of its authorized number of Hips to support its operations. The SMW is part of the Afghanistan’s much touted Special Security Forces, which also includes special forces and commando elements, as well as the shadowy Ktah Khas special mission battalion. Even then, the SMW’s Hip fleet has not been large enough to provide the necessary support. In November 2017, a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook flew more than 15 individuals to safety after Afghan special operations forces liberated them from a Taliban prison. A grainy image the NATO-led advisory mission in Afghanistan released showing Afghan commandos leading individuals to a U.S. Army CH-47 after their rescue in November 2017., NATO This only underscores the pressing need for more helicopter airlift capabilities across the country, even among Afghanistan’s most elite and best funded units. Slowly adding UH-60s at the cost of experienced Mi-17 crews could not only offer few benefits immediately, it could have a negative impact on Afghan operations at a time when they are under increasing attack from steadily better equipped opponents . “I am happily announcing that today a new page is opening in Afghanistan Air Force life,” Major General Abdul Raziq Sherzai, the head of the Afghan Air Force’s Kandahar Air Wing, said at the graduation ceremony in November 2017. “Today we can see that we are not far from standing on our own feet.” From all accounts, though, the Afghans and their American partners, still have years to go before this statement becomes a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2018","That Massive Cross-Country USAF Airlift Exercise Was the Largest of Its Kind, Ever","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier in December 2017, Americans across the country looked up to see a steady stream of lights in the sky, which, as we were first to explain, was a huge formation of U.S. Air Force transport aircraft plodding their way to the Nevada Test and Training Range, or NTTR. But if the spectacle seemed particularly eye catching this time around, it’s because this particular iteration of what is known as a Joint Forcible Entry Exercise, or JFEX, was the largest one ever. On the night of Dec. 9-10, 2017, a total of 37 C-17 Globemaster III and 21 C-130 Hercules airlifters took off for Nevada from a dozen bases around the United States as part of the capstone JFEX for the U.S. Air Force Weapons School Integration phase’s Class 17B. The simulated mission was to get into enemy territory and drop U.S. Army paratroopers, who would then establish a presence on the ground. Additional aircraft, including F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, flew support missions against the mock opposing forces. In total, more than 100 planes were involved in the exercise, making the biggest of its kind, according to an official Air Force article . “It requires a lot of integration with other assets, F-16s, and F-15s for example, to clear the lane for the MAF [Mobility Air Forces transport planes] to get to the objective area, air drop and put in our joint partners, in this case the Army,” U.S. Air Force Major J.R. Wendler, a member of the 16th Airlift Squadron, which flew C-17s from Joint Base Charleston in South Carolina, said after the event. “We flew in with 37 C-17s and 21 C-130s Hercules, pressed into contested air space, and fought our way in.” USAF JFEXs have historically been large exercises with their size and scope giving students at the U.S. Air Force Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base an opportunity to plan and execute a full-size mock airborne operation. The exercises are some of the most demanding and challenging for airlifter crews and instructors judge successes and failures based on how the entire force works together in the air and on the ground. You can find a more detailed look at the ins and outs of these events in an piece The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway previously wrote about Class 14B’s exercise, which occurred in December 2014. Here was the perspective from your #34WPS #CSAR crews providing real world SAR. #congratulations #WIC17B pic.twitter.com/N1SZmGq1zU — B. McDonald “Shwag” (@Shwag92) December 15, 2017 We still don’t know exactly why Class 17B’s mock airborne assault was so large, but it fits with a growing trend throughout the Air Force. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States military has shrunk in overall size and has come to rely even more heavily on its ability to rush personnel and equipment anywhere they might need to go across long distances on short notice. At the same time, potential real world adversaries, especially near-peer opponents such as Russia and China , have steadily improved and expanded their anti-access and area denial capabilities. Integrated air defense networks feature weapons and sensors with increasingly longer range, making the prospect of inserting an airborne force into hostile territory a more complicated and riskier proposition, which The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway noted in our earlier report on this event, writing: What’s actually pretty cool is that these folks were lucky enough to  see what America is capable of in a time of war. The United States  ability to project immense power rapidly into remote places is a very  strong deterrent in itself, and a very important capability to use  against an enemy should the need arise. During a major peer-state  conflict, especially one against say China, where the vastness of the  Pacific region can either work against or for you, these types of  tactics will be critical to success. With our best aircrews ready to inject major military power virtually anywhere with a dirt strip  long enough to accommodate our C-130s and/or C-17s, it opens up a whole  new set of options for commanders and keeps the enemy from being able to neuter America’s regional combat capability just by barraging master  air bases with ballistic missiles and other long-range weaponry. A C-17 Globemaster III touches down on an airstrip within the NTTR during a JFEX in 2016., USAF The potential for various other types of contingencies that may require American airlifters to fly into dangerous or unknown air space has only grown, as well. The Air Force is increasingly called upon to support networks of remote “contingency operating locations” and “forward operating sites” established as part of far-flung counter-terrorism and security cooperation missions across the globe. This has been particularly pronounced with regards to the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria , as well as operations throughout Africa . “The reason why we are providing so much support as Air Mobility Command and as the MAF is because we’re preparing for the future which requires readiness,” U.S. Air Force Captain Tom Sallenger, a member of the 15th Airlift Squadron, which also contributed C-17s from Joint Base Charleston for Class 17B’s JFEX, explained. “In planning a contingency operation, we need to have real-life experiences and some of those experiences can only be obtained in a scenario as in-depth as the JFE.” Beyond this massive exercise, it’s been a big year for Air Mobility Command, or AMC, which oversees the bulk of the Air Force’s airlifters. In July 2017, it relaunched a major international airlift get-together under the nickname Mobility Guardian . https://youtube.com/watch?v=LgDrg30lRr4 Previously known as the Air Mobility Rodeo, AMC had not held one of these events, due to a combination of budget cuts and operational demands, since 2011. The first iteration of this new premier training exercise included some 3,000 American military personnel, along with approximately 650 foreign participants, many of whom brought their own aircraft. This event involved scenarios ranging from combat air drops to humanitarian relief missions, and included conventional and special operations forces, underscoring the scope of potential Air Force airlift missions. You can read about the extent of that event in more detail here . USAF The Air Force has been experimenting with mixing and matching various conventional and special operations forces to form teams that can quickly move into a forward area and begin conduction combat operations, as well. These concepts include Rapid Raptor , which involves a C-17 carrying the personnel and equipment necessary to set up a temporary operating location and sustain a small detachment of four F-22 stealth fighters at a suitable airfield anywhere in the world within 24 hours. This tactic is now being ported over to other fighters as well, including the F-35. “Mobility Airmen are often the first to arrive and the last to depart,” U.S. Air Force General Carlton Everhart II, head of AMC, said ahead of the start of Mobility Guardian. “Exercising our capabilities together is critical so when we are called upon, we can deliver quickly and precisely.” With growing security concerns throughout East and Southeast Asia , persistent and evolving conflicts in the Middle East, increasing American military involvement in Africa , and a revanchist Russia challenging the United States and its allies in Europe , there are no shortage of potential contingencies the Air Force might have to respond to at a moment’s notice. Airlifters will continue to be essential for supporting those activities. So, while Class 17B’s JFEX was the largest ever, it might not be for long. We’ll be waiting to see if Class 18A’s exercise in June 2018 is on par with this massive event.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 18, 2019",BAE Systems Wants Its MAGMA Drone to Maneuver Using Only Supersonic Blasts of Air,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In cooperation with The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, BAE Systems has test flown a small unmanned plane, called MAGMA, that it says could eventually have a revolutionary flight control system. The “wing circulation control” and “fluidic thrust vectoring” features could have significant implications for civilian and military aviation, especially future stealth aircraft designs . According to the U.K.-headquartered defense contractor , the wing circulation control system will siphon air from the drone’s engine and blasts it at supersonic speed through the trailing edges of its wings, eliminating the need for traditional flaps and ailerons for flight control. The fluidic thrust vectoring component similarly blasts air to deflect the engine’s exhaust and change the direction of flight without help from a rudder. “The technologies we are developing with The University of Manchester will make it possible to design cheaper, higher performance, next generation aircraft,” Clyde Warsop, a BAE Systems Engineering Fellow, said in an official press release . “What we are seeking to do through this program is truly ground-breaking,” Bill Crowther, head of the MAGMA project at The University of Manchester, added. The benefits of the two systems could be immense. Future aircraft designs without moving control surfaces at all would be inherently more aerodynamic and could be less complicated, bulky, and more reliable. At present, the drone uses the blown air to move traditional surfaces, but this still removes the need for physical actuators of some sort. BAE Systems and The University of Manchester say the goal of the project is to prove the viability of an aircraft design without any moving control surfaces whatsoever. If the MAGMA test program proves successful, it could be revolutionary for the aviation industry as a whole. Removing the need for traditional control surfaces would offer a way to lighten the overall design of any aircraft, because there would be no need for complex control lines and actuators. There wouldn’t be any large, moving surfaces anymore, either, making it more aerodynamic and potentially faster and more maneuverable at higher speeds. It would remove potential points of failure that could lead to the aircraft going out of control. This could result in combat aircraft that are less sensitive to battle damage or other in-flight emergencies. Research and real world experiences have already shown that just selectively adjusting thrust on individual engines on multi-engine aircraft could provide an alternative, if limited means of control without the need for elevators, rudders, flaps, or ailerons. A lack of traditional control surfaces could potentially mean reduced maintenance and logistics requirements, too. Ground crews would have fewer components to keep in working order and parts to manage in general. BAE Systems The importance of these developments would be especially pounced with regards to military stealth aircraft designs. Joints, gaps between parts, and large, moving surfaces – such as flaps and ailerons – are exactly the kinds of things that reflect radar waves and low observable designs try their best to avoid using them where ever possible. At the same time, air forces around the world are already facing the prospect of increasingly more capable integrated air defenses full of surface-to-air missiles with cuing from multiple types of radars, including lower frequency types, and other sensor systems . What might have been “invisible” to one sensor system by itself in the past may no longer be fully shielded from a full network fusing together information from multiple sources. The need for aircraft stealth capabilities in general is only going to become more important as time goes on, but designers will now increasingly need to focus on broadband low observability, as well. Eliminating the need for any moving control surfaces would be an excellent way to streamline a basic planform and optimize it for low observability. The Magma drone., BAE Systems Given the aforementioned trends in military aviation, BAE Systems is hardly the only company looking into new low observable concepts. In the United States, the U.S. Air Force and NASA have been working with private firms to develop morphing wing systems that could provide similar broadband stealth benefits and there is likely to have been or be similar work in progress in the classified sphere. You can read all about this technology and the possibility of further developments in a feature by The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway. It’s not the first time BAE Systems has publicly looked into “flapless flight,” either. In 2010, the defense contractor test flew a modified version of its Eclipse drone that used blown air over the wing and thrust vectoring to help maneuver, as well. That project, known as the Flapless Aerial Vehicle Integrated Interdisciplinary Research Program, or FLAPIIR , was also a product of a partnership with research institutions, in this case academics from the Universities of Cranfield, Leicester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Southampton, Manchester, Wales Swansea, and York, as well as the Imperial College in London. The drone, called Demon, was itself the result of a five year development cycle, that cost the better part of $10 million. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZxI_s89qZuI The MAGMA design is significantly refined and the developments could be particularly useful for the United Kingdom, which is actively pursuing a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) project in cooperation with France. Since 2014 , French firm Dassault has been working in partnership with BAE Systems under an initiative known as the Future Combat Air System . This is separate from a project of the same name that European aviation consortium Airbus crafted in response to a German-Spanish requirement. The Anglo-French effort has focused on building upon the work BAE Systems and Dassault had already done with their Taranis and nEUROn prototypes respectively. As of 2016, both of those individual demonstrators remained in flight testing, with France going so far as to conduct a test exploring the integration of land-based nEUROns with the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , its air wing, and the rest of its associated battle group. The Dassault nEUROn flies with a Rafale M fighter jet past the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle during a test flight in 2016., Dassault Aviation Success with the MAGMA project could definitely expand the capabilities of any future FCAS concept, since a stealthy UCAV using the wing circulation control and fluidic thrust vectoring technology might be even more capable than a manned design. A drone could possibly use those systems to perform high-G maneuvers that would put dangerous levels of stress on an actual pilot, not to mention offering up a very low-observable design likely at far lower cost than a manned aircraft. Unfortunately, the future of the Anglo-French partnership is uncertain. Though the French have tried to downplay the issue , there is a concern that United Kingdom’s planned departure from the European Union, commonly known as the British Exit or Brexit, could scuttle the defense cooperation deal. BAE Systems has already trimmed 2,000 jobs from its U.K.-based operations in response to the economic fluctuations following the referendum on abandoning the economic bloc, impacting both its aviation and shipbuilding arms . Regardless, the new control systems could be game changers broadly if they prove viable. BAE Systems itself could leverage the new technology to further develop Taranis independently or for entirely new civil and military aviation projects. BAE Systems is heavily invested in being on the “bleeding edge” of aerospace research and development and says its partnership with The Manchester University, which bills itself as a leader in unmanned aviation research , is part of a broader effort, amounting to nearly $5.9 billion since 2012. This spending has included work and other partnerships on hypersonic engines , new composite materials, advanced manufacturing techniques, and artificial intelligence . Still, there are some issues that would clearly need to be overcome, such as what would happen if an engine quit? Would a backup generation system provide ample air long enough to allow the aircraft to make an emergency landing? Would some backup control surfaced be retained to overcome this possible weakness? Whatever happens, between Wing Circulation Control and Fluidic Thrust Vectoring, and the separate research into morphing wings, advanced technology developments look set to take stealth combat aircraft in an all new era.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 25, 2019",Draken Picks Up a Dozen South African Cheetahs to Emulate 4th Generation Adversaries,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Draken International, a private company that specializes in supplying “red air” adversaries to help train U.S. military fighter pilots, among other services, has announced it will be adding a dozen ex-South African Cheetah fighter jets to its already impressive inventory. It’s the latest in a flurry of developments through this steadily growing industry, as firms try to meet increasing requirements for 4th generation platforms or equally capable surrogates. On Dec. 11, 2017, Draken released a statement outlining the purchase of nine single-seat Cheetah Cs and three two-place Cheetah Ds though Denel. Per the terms of the deal, the South African state-owned defense conglomerate will fully regenerate the aircraft, which have been sitting in storage since their retirement from the South African Air Force in 2008. In addition, Denel will provide additional support services for the aircraft going forward. “Capacity and capability are the dominant themes for the ADAIR [adversary air] business driven by the contractual requirements of our customers,” Sean Gustafson, Draken’s Vice President of Business Development said in a statement. “Draken is committed to delivering extensive capacity in order to manage a majority of the enormous ADAIR demand throughout the entire [U.S. Department of Defense].” The Cheetahs , which are capable of traveling at supersonic speed, will definitely expand the kind of capabilities Draken can offer and its capacity to do so. The aircraft are the result of an extensive South African modernization program for its fleet of French-made Mirage III fighter jets , which turned what is essentially a late second generation design into nearly a fourth generation aircraft. One of the Cheetahs destined for Draken’s fleet during an inspection in South Africa., Draken International After Apartheid-era South Africa found itself under an arms embargo in 1977, it had no choice but to either develop its own combat aircraft or upgrade existing designs. One of the projects the Atlas Aircraft Corporation, now Denel Aviation, crafted was a massive upgrade for the older Mirages. The state-operated firm recruited a significant number of Israeli specialists with experience both working with the French design and working on the abortive IAI Lavi fighter jet program. Israel had already overhauled its own Mirage III and V fleets to create advanced derivatives known as the Nesher and the Kfir . The resulting Cheetah is rumored to be a direct descendant of the Kfir and is similar in many ways, especially visually given with the addition of forward canards above the air intakes, but the South African aircraft does have its own distinct planform. Atlas claimed it had replaced approximately 50 percent of the airframe as part of the conversion. An Israeli Kfir C2, similar to the later Atlas Cheetah., משתמש:אסף.צ via Wikimedia The South Africans also upgraded the French engines inside and added additional stores pylons, an air-to-air refueling capability, a new Israeli-made mechanically-scanned pulse-doppler radar, more modern avionics and navigation equipment, and an electronic warfare suite to both alert the pilot to incoming missiles and jam their seekers. The upgrade also included the ability for the pilot to use a helmet-mounted sight for off-boresight targeting and a modernized Hands On Throttle-And-Stick, or HOTAS, control arrangement. But the aircraft only began to enter service in 1986, at a time when South Africa’s foreign interventions were waning. Though they flew patrols during the so-called “ South African Border War ,” they never saw combat. In 1990, that conflict ended with the creation of the new nation of Namibia. Four years later, white minority rule in South Africa ended, which led to a significant review of the country’s security services and its foreign policy. As such, the Cheetah Cs and Ds spent relatively little time in the air – Draken says its 12 aircraft will have an average of just 500 hour per airframe – before the South African Air Force replaced them entirely with the Saab Gripen in 2008. This low usage, combined with the jet’s other capabilities, made them an attractive and low-cost choice. Even if they are cheap to acquire, the relatively unique aircraft – there were only ever 38 Cs and 16 Ds – could prove difficult and expensive to maintain, but the arrangement with Denel appears designed to mitigate that risk up front. “These highly capable platforms were selected over early model F-16s and non-modernized Mirage F1s based upon their true fourth generation capabilities,” Draken’s Gustafson said. “This is why we have purchased … the Cheetah, the first truly fourth generation platform in the industry.” This claim may not be entirely accurate given the South African jet’s pedigree, but it’s hard to deny that the jets are about as close to a fourth generation platform as one can get without actually buying one. And that’s an increasingly important consideration. For more than two decades, the adversary air industry had been slowly expanding, especially in the United States. This has acceleratated as the Pentagon has faced budget caps and cuts, as well as a shrinking overall force size and a worn out fleet of 4th generation fighter jets, limiting the amount of personnel and aircraft individual services can dedicate to the aggressor role itself. An F-16C from the US Air Force’s own 18th Aggressor Squadron., USAF This is only likely to become more pronounced as the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy acquire more fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , something The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has written about extensively over the years . It is simply not going to be cost effective to have 5th generations fighters flying as adversaries, especially for basic training duties. As for dedicated adversary units within the Pentagon’s portfolio, funds to expand the number of squadrons focused on this mission even with fourth generation aircraft is unlikely to materialize. This is especially problematic because 5th generation fighters need greater adversary capacity to train against in order to challenge their pilots. The Air Force in particular has scaled back their organic adversary elements in recent years. But faced with emerging threats and the need to train and challenge 5th generation fighter pilots in training, the service has become increasingly in favor of shifting increased aggressor capacity to private contractors, such as Draken. Using contractors gives the U.S. military more flexibility to schedule exercises around the training and pre-deployment needs of fleet units rather than the availability of aggressors and do so for a lower overall cost. The company provides its own pilots and maintains for its own aircraft, meaning the U.S. military doesn’t have to pull its own resources away from other priorities or maintain separate, dedicated units. At the same time, the nature of the potential threat has begun to change, too. Advanced fourth generation aircraft are increasingly proliferating around the world, even among relatively small air arms, increasing the chances American aviators might encounter them in a real world situation. To try and keep pace, Draken has maintained a fleet that includes A-4K Skyhawks and L-159E Honey Badgers with modern pulse-doppler radars – the AN/APG-66 and Grifo-L respectively – and capable suites of self-protection systems. One of Draken’s A-4K Skyhawks with another behind it and an L-159E Honey Badger to the right., Draken Internaitonal These jets can and do provide opponents for the U.S. military’s most advanced aircraft , but there’s a physical limit to the kind of threats they can truly represent. Draken fully acknowledges that it decided to purchase the Cheetahs because its existing fleet cannot meet all of its customers demands. Namely something with a radar that can tote a jamming pod while traveling at supersonic speeds. It is the same reason why the company announced it had picked up more than 20 ex-Spanish Mirage F1Ms in November 2017. Starting 1996, Spain had put those aircraft through a modernization program that added color multi-function displays, a new heads up display, GPS and other navigation system upgrades, modernized communications equipment, and other improvements. Perhaps most importantly, the aircraft received new Cyrano IVM pulse-doppler radars with air and sea search and air-to-ground ranging functionality. A Spanish Air Force Mirage F1M., Chris Lofting via Wikimedia “Purchasing fighter jets with modern radars and sensors well in advance of expected demand is the principal reason why Draken is the world’s largest provider of this vital service,” Gustafson had boasted in a separate statement at the time. “These Mirage F1s proved to be the best equipped and lowest time fighters of their kind available to the industry.” Both these comments and the remarks about the Cheetah’s fourth generation capabilities are obvious digs at Draken’s competitors, many of whom have also clearly seen the changing trend in requirements for more advanced adversaries. “The requirements we’re seeing the [U.S.] Air Force describe clearly include a modern radar such as AESA [active electronically-scanned array] or a highly capable mechanically scanned array radar,” Jeffery Parker, CEO of Airborne Tactical Advantage Company, or ATAC, told FlightGlobal in September 2017. That month, ATAC, a subsidiary of Textron since 2016, announced it would be acquiring more than 60 ex-French Mirage F1s and upgrading them with new radars and other systems. The Virginia-based company already operates Kfirs, as well. The next month, it emerged that TacAir had purchased more than 20 ex-Jordanian F-5E/F Tiger IIs and put the jets through an update program, which you can read about in more detail here . Other competitors exist as well, but at this time the thirst for commercial adversary air support is only likely to continue to balloon as the F-35 begins full-rate production. Some of ATAC’s Kfirs., ATAC Though private adversary air support is a growing industry in general, there is an immediate impetus to these purchases, too. In January 2018, the Air Force is likely to start considering who it will hire to provide those services at Nellis Air Force Base in support of its much vaunted Weapons School and capstone Red Flag exercises . Draken already been doing for years to a lesser degree. The deal could be worth as much as $7.5 billion over the next decade and require the winning company or companies to fly almost 37,000 flight hours in total, according to FlightGlobal. The Air Force is expected to pick a winner for the Nellis contract some time in 2019. There’s clearly a desire on the part of these firms to get out ahead of the contract and make sure they have applicable fleets of aircraft operational beforehand. This won’t be the only such deal coming up by any any means either. And the international marketplace will be just as in need of these services as the domestic one. Draken seems to be betting that the Cheetahs, as well as the Mirage F1Ms, will give it a significant edge over the competition.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",Decades Ago The Navy Tested A Maritime Patrol U-2 Variant That Was Way Ahead Of Its Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than six decades of service to the United States, the U-2 Dragon Lady has become an iconic design, with numerous variants acting as both a high-flying spy plane and test bed for first the Central Intelligence Agency, and then the U.S. Air Force and NASA. For a short time it looked as if another organization, the U.S. Navy, might join its short list of American operators, with aircraft Lockheed had configured as maritime surveillance platforms. In 1972, the Navy obtained a single U-2R, known both as Article 061 and by its Air Force serial number 68-10330, as part of an experimental program called Project Highboy. In cooperation with the manufacturer Lockheed, the service made substantial modifications to the aircraft, configuring it for an all-new mission, tracking ships at sea. The initial phase of the project cost $5.5 million at the time – more than $33 million in 2017 dollars – and lasted six months, according to Unlimited Horizons: Design and Development of the U-2 , an official NASA monograph by Peter Merlin. The Navy referred to its U-2R as the “EP-X.” Though this was the only example it ever officially took ownership of, this was not the Navy’s first experience with the U-2. To help extend the range of the aircraft and get them into more remote areas, the service had helped train CIA pilots to fly off aircraft carriers using specially modified variants, the U-2G and U-2H. That concept proved successful, but costly and the Navy became increasingly resistant to the idea owing to the amount of resources it had to pull away from other duties to support the flights. However, training for carrier operations using the larger and much more capable U-2Rs continued at least into the 1970s. The Navy itself had expressed interest in joining the spy plane program as early as 1963, but the National Reconnaissance Office successfully blocked the purchase of any additional U-2s the next year in favor of more focus on spy satellites. The service’s separate plans to acquire the aircraft as airborne communications relays never came to fruition, either, according to Merlin’s monograph. A US Air Force U-2C., USAF The EP-X tests offered another opportunity, though, and also helped support the development of other then state-of-the-art technologies. The utility of an aircraft capable of broad maritime surveillance over a large area would have been particularly obvious to the Navy at the time. The service had spent the better part of a decade attempting to track and monitor shipping to and from North Vietnam and interdict ships smuggling men and materiel into the South. At the same time, North Korean commandos had attempted to infiltrate into the South by sea on numerous occasions and that country’s naval forces routinely sortied out to harass allied and civilian boats . Just being able to spot and track the movements of Soviet warships and commercial vessels would have been a valuable intelligence tool, too. The EP-X test aircraft seemed well suited to many of those requirements. The unique Dragon Lady variant had a new nose section and two equipment pods, one in the leading edge of each wing. Various specialized equipment went into the U-2R’s other modular payload bays . The EP-X and its various systems., Lockheed via NASA An X-band phased array AN/APS-116 radar went into the nose. Originally intended as a weather radar, the unit proved capable of performing a surface search function and it was sensitive enough to pick up submarine periscopes poking up above the water. The same system subsequently went into the EP-3E Aries intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, the S-3A Viking submarine hunter , and later models of the SH-3 Sea King helicopter. The equipment pod on the left wing held a so-called Return Beam Vidicon camera , or RBV, an early multi-spectral imaging sensor consisting of three video cameras each recording in only one spectral band – blue-green, yellow-red, and near infrared. The complete system would then merge the three sets of data into a single image. It could provide continuous, but relatively high-fidelity imagery without the need for film. The first three Landsat imaging satellites used a similar setup . The video clip below describes the capability of Landsat 1, including its RBV sensor. https://youtube.com/watch?v=grgpQh7j6zo On the right side, there was an AN/ALQ-110 radar signal tracker linked to a T-35 camera, a combination that had been inside the nose of the standard U-2Rs. A communication relay went into the aircraft’s “Q-bay,” which normally held one of a number of different types of visual cameras. Perhaps the most important piece of equipment sat in the plane’s “E-bay.” Earlier in 1972, as part of a program called Senior Dagger, the Air Force had developed a digital data link that would allow its own U-2R pilots to send radar data to a ground station in near real time. The NASA monograph says there was only one aircraft bailed to the Navy for conversion to this EP-X configuration, but other sources suggest there was a second aircraft. It is possible that Lockheed made up a second example for its own test purposes. This confusion could be based on the proposed transfer of two ex-CIA U-2Rs to the Navy by way of the Air Force for further EP-X tests, which may or may not have occurred. Regardless, with the full set of systems installed, the EP-X test bed could not only monitor a wide area both visually and via radar, but it could then feed that information straight to friendly ships or shore-based headquarters within its line of sight. In 1973, the aircraft proved it could do just that during a test flight off California in which it sent data to analysts at Lockheed’s facility in Sunnydale. A US Air Force U-2., USAF Between 1974 and 1975, the aircraft came back out for a series of tests called Outlaw Hawk. The primary goal of these experiments was to test an experimental ship-to-shore data link setup, called the Flag Command and Correlation Facility (FCCF), on board the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk . The FCCF could provide an “integrated war-room display” of all of the information flowing into the system, according to one 1978 technical report from the Naval Ocean Systems Center. This gave the ship greatly increased situation awareness, allowing it to monitor a number of friendly ships, and other unspecified “targets of opportunity” during the day and at night, according to a now declassified 1976 Office of Naval Research report . During one of these tests, the EP-X, flying from Lockheed’s facilities at the U.S. Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, contributed to this overall picture. The crew of the Kitty Hawk received the information in near real time, even though the ship had departed from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and was sailing in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles away. The benefits of the capability would have been obvious. A fleet of high-flying, long range EP-X aircraft could have provided invaluable information to carrier battle groups, surface task forces, and other naval assets during a conflict. With that data in hand, those commanders would have been able to better allocate their resources, perhaps taking up a more advantageous position respective to the enemy, staying out of range of their stand-off weapons, or avoiding a superior force altogether. The information could also be used to target the Navy’s own standoff weaponry. Even the ability to better target Russian task forces with nuclear weapons would have been an obvious benefit of the Cold War era. The USS Kitty Hawk much later in life., USN It could have had important peace time applications, as well, from monitoring shipping traffic to and from potential opponents to search and rescue missions. The aircraft could have patrolled for smugglers and enemy inflitrators in certain areas, as well, something that, as we previously noted, would have been particularly useful in and around the Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, a combination of factors ultimately scuttled any possibility of a fleet of EP-X aircraft. After the Vietnam War ended, the Pentagon’s budget had contracted dramatically, forcing all the services to trim back various programs. On top of that, the National Reconnaissance Office continued promoting increasingly capable spy satellites as an alternative to the high-flying U-2s. In 1974, the CIA had ended its Dragon Lady operations, turning over its remaining aircraft to the Air Force. Around the same time, the Navy shelved the EP-X in favor of using a combination of EP-3E aircraft and satellites to conduct similar maritime surveillance functions. It’s not clear whether or not the EP-X program had an influence on the wing-mounted “ superpods ” that the Air Force subsequently fitted on its U-2Rs and carried over to the still-in-service U-2S models. Those 24-foot long equipment pods can hold 800 pounds of gear, making them some three times larger than those of the Navy’s experimental version, according to the NASA monograph. A U-2S with the superpods., Lockheed Martin The EP-X concept itself, one of a long-range, high-flying, broad area maritime surveillance platform, never went away. In the early 2000s, the Navy crafted a requirement for an unmanned system with very similar requirements as part of the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program, or BAMS. The initial concept called for a drone that could fly at an altitude of at least 40,000 feet and would have an overall range between 1,000 and 3,000 miles, allowing it to provide persistent coverage of a wide area. The unmanned aircraft would complement the Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft, which subsequently became the Boeing P-8A Poseidon , and ship-based manned and unmanned aerial surveillance capabilities. These requirements morphed into a more demanding rubric as the project proceeded. Northrop Grumman used a highly modified Gulfstream G-II test aircraft to prove the concept initially and to support further testing of the components associated with the BAMS initiative. The almost grotesquely modified G-II BAMS test bed., NAVAIR To test the plan in a more mature fashion, the Navy obtained a pair of Northrop Grumman RQ-4A Global Hawk drones fitted with an active electronically scanned synthetic aperture radar, a turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, a receiver for signals from the Automatic Identification System , or AIS, and electronic support measures to detect and track enemy electronic emissions. The AIS is an unclassified maritime transponder system that both naval ships and commercial vessels use to broadcast their position to help avoid collisions and other accidents. These BAMS demonstrators , or BAMS-D flew in support of exercises and actual operations, including counter-piracy missions in the Indian Ocean. In 2008, the Navy selected a purpose-built variant of the Global Hawk as the winner of the formal competition for the new drones. The RQ-4N beat shared efforts by Boeing and Gulfstream, who offered an unmanned aircraft based on the G550 bizjet , and Lockheed and General Atomics with a version of the MQ-9 Reaper . One of the BAMS-D drones., USN The maritime surveillance Global Hawk derivative, now known as the MQ-4C Triton , has reinforced wings and fuselage, improved de-icing features, and better resistance to lightning strikes compared to the earlier models. It features the same basic sensor package as the BAMS-Ds, with Northrop Grumman’s fully matured active electronically scanned AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) radar at the core of its capabilities. You can read more about the Triton here . That a variant of the Global Hawk won a competition for what is very much a spiritual successor to the U-2-based EP-X isn’t particularly surprising. The Air Force has itself gone back and forth about whether or not to replace its remaining Dragon Ladies with the RQ-4. The U-2 continues to serve owing in no small part to the fact that it can fly at a higher altitude than the Global Hawk. Lockheed Martin had pitched an unmanned version to the Air Force as one possible alternative, as well as a new drone using some of the Dragon Lady’s components, called the TR-X . Neither of those aircraft has made an appearance publicly, though it is possible that Lockheed has produced or is in the process of developing a new, high altitude unmanned surveillance aircraft in the classified sphere . The service expects to reach initial operational capability with the MQ-4C in 2018 and full operational capability five years after that. There is already work in progress to expand existing American bases around the world to accommodate the new aircraft. Plans to expand the Triton’s sensor suite , to include a signals intelligence system among other equipment, could allow the drones to supplant the Navy’s aging EP-3Es. The service has also conducted tests to possibly integrate a similar capability onto the P-8A. More than four decades after the EP-X effort came to an end, the Navy now looks set to get its long-range, persistent aerial maritime surveillance platform. If anything, that is a huge testament to the original visionaries behind the little known EP-X program from so long ago.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps wants to get back into the business of “itty bitty boats,” potentially purchasing an entire family of small watercraft . The service says diminutive boats could give conventional and special operations Marines more flexibility, offering commanders new options for deploying smaller elements on discreet or distributed operations. U.S. Marine Corps Major General David Coffman, presently serving as the U.S. Navy’s director for expeditionary warfare, detailed the basic concept to Military.com on the sidelines of Navy League event in November 2017. With various types of craft, regular Marines and special operators might be able to better patrol the flank during operations in littoral areas, rapidly transport reinforcements to support offensive or defensive operations, or rapidly launch raids from multiple directions. The senior officer said that interest in the idea of small groups of waterborne Marines had come straight from the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Robert Neller. “The Marine Corps largely got out of what we call itty bitty boats … the commandant wants us to get back in the boat business,” Coffman said, according to Military.com. “He’s recognizing he needs to distribute his force and be able to move in smaller discrete elements and different ways.” At present, the U.S. military’s lightest watercraft primarily reside within the U.S. Navy’s Special Warfare and Expeditionary Warfare communities. The Naval Expeditionary Warfare Command’s fleet focuses mainly on aiding sailors in intercepting and boarding suspicious vessels and patrolling ports and other small waterways. Naval special warfare elements operate a number of highly specialized types, some with low-observable features, to facilitate Navy SEAL raids or help get the special operators into denied areas full of enemy defenses. Both the Marine Corps own special operators and its Force Reconnaissance Units already have light watercraft, as well. US Navy sailors ride in a RHIB during a training exercise., USN Coffman reportedly envisions a new Marine Corps watercraft contingent with at least 1,000 small boats. The officer suggested that the Navy’s standard 36-foot Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat , or RHIB, might be the best starting point since Marines could quickly “sex up or simple down” the design for particular missions. The RHIB typically has a crew of three and carry a number of additional personnel or cargo depending on what other equipment it has fitted. The Naval Special Warfare model have weapon mounts at the bow and stern that can accept a 7.62mm M240 machine gun or a .50 caliber M2 machine gun , as well as a small search radar, GPS navigation system, and communications gear. The Marine Corps could add a turret with electro-optical or infrared cameras, as well as other sensors to certain types to be able to better patrol and scout along the shoreline. It is possible that other configurations could include additional kinetic or non-kinetic weapons, from miniaturized precision missiles to electronic warfare systems, or serve as a launch pad for small drones. Some boats might act as more command and control nodes with additional communications systems and data links to share video feeds and other sensor information. With a top speed of nearly 40 miles an hour and a range of approximately 200 miles, the RHIBs could just give Marine commanders new ways to rapidly deploy forces to rush to the scene of an ambush or launch multi-pronged attacks on littoral targets. Amphibious warfare ships or sea bases could conceivably send out either small groups or entire swarms of Marines in watercraft depending on the mission requirements. Various types of RHIB inside the well deck of the interim sea base USS Ponce ., USN This could potentially be a boon in congested waterways, such as the Persian Gulf , the Baltic Sea , and the Black Sea , where larger ships might have trouble maneuvering and present large targets for enemy forces on shore. The watercraft force could also reduce the Marine Corps reliance on the Navy to provide these types of capabilities. “A lot of my theme is trying to flip the script, move from defensive to offensive,” Coffman said. This officer in particular , as well as the Marine Corps as a whole , has already been looking at a variety of ways to maintain and expand the ability of Marines to perform their core expeditionary mission as increasingly advanced weapons and sensors continue to proliferate around the world. Near-peers and smaller potential opponents are steadily fielding improved anti-ship cruise missiles , maneuvering ballistic missiles , integrated air defenses , guided tube and rocket artillery , among various other systems . Coffman says he and Neller see the proposed watercraft force as a potential way to get around at least some of these mounting threats. A pair of US Navy RHIBs at speed during a training exercise., USN “That’s part of how you counter the peer threat: ‘I’ll out-asymmetric you,’” Coffman. “So [Commandant Neller is] excited about that, that work’s going to happen.” It’s not clear whether or not the RHIB could truly offer the kinds of capabilities the Marines are interested in, though. Its range means it would still need support from a mother ship or base on land even in relatively constricted waterways. Its open design isn’t designed with high-end stealth features in mind or well protected from even heavy small arms fire, let alone larger weapons such as man-portable guided missiles, or even air-burst artillery. But it could still serve as a valuable starting place for developing new concepts of operations and exploring their viability. Additional types of watercraft could follow, adding new capabilities to the force. The Naval Special Warfare community already has experience in buying small specialized, low-observable boats that the Marine Corps could leverage for its own use. The SEALION-II, one of the Naval Special Warfare Command’s special stealthy watercraft., USN The Marine have already been experimenting with novel concepts in this regard themselves. In April 2017, Marines tried out HSP Technologies’ HyperSub during a larger technology demonstration event at Camp Pendleton in California. HyperSub is half speed boat and half submarine, able to cruise at 30 miles per hour on the surface or move along submerged at 6 miles per hour. The craft can stay underwater for up to 12 hours at a time and carry 6,000 pounds of cargo or mission systems. There are other potential designs that might be useful for the Marine Corps watercraft future, or supporting that force’s operations. The Navy is continuing to test the M80 Stiletto as a possible craft to support special operations and other roles. Though far larger than the RHIB, the stealthy boat could act as an intermediary between a larger mother ship and a smaller craft, transporting the smaller elements closer to the target area with a lower probability of detection. Manufacturer M Ship Company says the existing prototype can carry one standard RHIB, but that they could scale the design to meet the requirements of the customer. Another option for the Marines might be to combine a small boat with unmanned watercraft to form a more flexible manned-unmanned team. There have already been tests with an unmanned RHIB and other smaller craft . Either remote controlled or operating autonomously , such craft could potentially carry sensors, weapons, or both and scout ahead of the main force, identifying threats and possibly eliminating them to clear the way. It could allow a smaller force to patrol or defend a larger littoral area, as well. At present, Coffman and Neller appear to still be formulating the exact concepts they’re most interested and how to focus the effort. But though the exact size and shape of the proposed watercraft force isn’t clear yet, support among the service’s senior officials is. “If we were to claim any moniker, we want to be the father of the 1,000-boat Navy,” Coffman said.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 26, 2020","Germany Reportedly Favors Typhoon to Replace Tornado, Also Eyeing F-15, F/A-18","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An official statement from the German Ministry of Defense says it is now leaning toward purchasing Eurofighter Typhoon multi-role fighter jets rather than F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as replacements for the country’s Cold War-era Panavia Tornado swing-wing combat aircraft, and could consider Boeing’s F-15 Eagle or F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well. The significant shift away from Lockheed Martin’s fifth generation aircraft could be a reflection of a variety of factors, including the stealthy jet’s long term cost , security concerns regarding the cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System computer network that supports the jets, and cool relations between Germany and the United States. Deputy Defense Minister Ralf Brauksiepe explained the ministry’s official position in response to a letter for more information about the replacement program from an unnamed Green Party legislator, which Reuters obtained . In addition to the Typhoon and the F-35, an unspecified version of Boeing’s F-15 Eagle and that firm’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet are also in the mix of potential options. In November 2017, a senior German defense official, speaking anonymously, described the F-35 as the country’s “ preferred choice ” to replace the Tornados. “The indicated view of the inspector of the air force that the F-35 Lightning II is an especially suitable successor to the Tornado system is not the position of the federal government,” Brauksiepe wrote in the letter, according to Reuters. The unnamed official had previously indicated that only the F-35 could meet the requirements of the German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, because of its low-observable characteristics and that it was already in production. Germany wants to have completely replaced all of its approximately 85 Tornados by 2030, a process that it expects to take at least five years . A Luftwaffe Torando wearing a special NATO “ Tiger Meet ” paint scheme., Bundeswehr The Luftwaffe could easily need those replacements earlier, though. In 2015, Deutsche Welle reported that only approximately 30 Tornados were actually combat ready at any one time. A year earlier, Der Spiegal obtained a report that said fewer than 70 percent were even airworthy at all. Considering the relatively small fleet size, this doesn’t appear to be caused in part by a programmatic decision or one based on large-scale deployment needs, but primarily by years of shrinking German defense budgets following the end of the Cold War. Replacing the Tornados with Typhoons could make a significant amount of sense for Germany, which already operates multiple squadrons of the type. In November 2017, the Luftwaffe sent six of them to Israel to join that country’s Blue Flag exercise for the first time ever. Eurofighter, a consortium that includes portions of Airbus Defense in Germany and Spain, BAE Systems in the United Kingdom, and Leonardo in Italy, manage the development and production of the fighter jets. A major sale to the Luftwaffe could be worth billions to the group and help keep the production line running and its employees at work, an important domestic consideration for the Germans. On Dec. 11, 2017, Qatar signed a deal for 24 of its own Eurofighters, making it the ninth country to buy the type. This alone could mean significant lower training and maintenance costs, not to mention saving on large infrastructure needs, compared to acquiring an entirely new type of aircraft, and especially one with high secondary cost demands like the F-35. It also could make it easier for the Luftwaffe to quickly absorb the new aircraft into its inventory. Existing Typhoon variants are already compatible with the targeting and reconnaissance pods the Luftwaffe uses on the Tornado, as well as many of its weapons. Saab has already tested the Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile on one of the fourth generation fighter jets, as well, giving it a relatively long-range standoff attack capability. A Luftwaffe Typhoon carries a pair of green Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missiles during a flight test., Airbus Defense The Swedish firm makes the weapon in cooperation with European missile consortium MBDA. MBDA is also working to integrate the dual-mode version of the Brimstone air-to-surface missile , which features both laser- and millimeter wave radar guidance options and can attack moving targets, onto the U.K. Royal Air Force’s Typhoons . New Eurofighters could also take on multiple roles and offer an expanded capability in air-to-air combat if they include the CAPTOR-E active electronically scanned array radar, a relatively simple and effective way to extend the jet’s ability to spot and track hostile aerial threats. New versions could also sport the PIRATE IRST, an infrared search and tracking system Germany left off its existing fleet for cost saving concerns. Germany has already expressed an interest in integrating both CAPTOR-E and the MBDA Meteor advanced beyond visual range air-to-air missile into its existing Typhoons, which would result in a massive leap in air combat capability. The Luftwaffe could require special modifications to their new aircraft in order for them to take over the Tornado’s nuclear strike mission. At present, the United States maintains a stockpile of B61 nuclear gravity bombs in Germany that it could release to German units in a crisis. The Tornados are the only German aircraft that can carry these weapons at present. But Germany, like many of its fellow NATO members, is increasingly concerned by Russia’s foreign policy, which has only become more revanchist since the Kremlin seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. In spite of international criticism and economic sanctions, Moscow has only deepened its support for separatists fighting the government in Kiev and stepped up harassment of European countries opposed to its policies, including with electronic warfare and cyber attacks . And what Typhoon lacks is the low-observable features of the F-35. The unnamed German defense official had insisted in their November 2017 comments that the Luftwaffe needed a stealth aircraft to match the increasing capability of foreign air defense systems, particularly Russian-made designs . The Kremlin’s deployment of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea mean parts of Germany are already within range of these weapons at all times. That the Joint Strike Fighter was the only western fifth generation aircraft in series production, another key requirement for any aircraft destined to replace the aging Tornados, made it appear to be the only available choice. At the same time, though, the costs of purchasing, maintaining, and operating a fifth generation aircraft have also proven to be high and the F-35 continues to struggle through its development. As of October 2017, more than 20 percent American F-35s across were non-flyable due to a lack of spare parts alone, according to the Government Accountability Office , a U.S. Congress watchdog agency. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., Lockheed Martin On top of that, there have been growing concerns among many partners to the Joint Strike Fighter program outside the United States that the Autonomic Logistics Information System , or ALIS, is multi-faceted security threat. In addition to harvesting data about the aircraft’s components and whether they need replacement or other maintenance, the computer system acts as a loader for the aircraft’s operational data packages, which would include information on flight plans, potential threats and hazards, and other mission details. It’s also the port that ground crews would use to install patches to the jet’s software. There is a fear that this essential and centralized system could be vulnerable to cyber attacks , with an enemy potentially being able to feed in viruses that break or confuse the system, which in turn could effective ground the jets during a crisis. Various countries have also become worried that the cloud-based network is collecting sensitive sovereign data and sending it straight to Lockheed Martin. Australia, Italy, and Norway are all pushing for filters that would allow them to at least limit what does and doesn’t get into the ground-based portion of the ALIS system. Only Israel has been able to secure the right to install its own software packages separate from the network. So it could be the opinion of the German Defense Ministry that the F-35 is not a particularly realistic option to replace the Tornados, despite being in production. This would leave only advanced fourth generation designs, like the others that Deputy Defense Minister Brauksiepe mentioned in his letter. A US Air Force technician jacks in to the F-35’s computer system., USAF In July 2017, Germany and France did announced plans to make their own stealthy jet, but as we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly, development cycles have proven to be lengthy and often exorbitantly expensive. It’s entirely unclear at this point when any aircraft the two countries jointly design will be available, or what form it might take, if it even comes to fruition at all. France infamously bailed out of the Typhoon program in 1985 and decided to pursue its own design, which became the Dassault Rafale . There may also be a political dimension. The relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Angela Merkel, who just won a fourth term as Germany’s Chancellor, has been visibly cool. The two have publicly sparred over a number of issues and Merkel has come out vocally against the Trump Administration’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital . At the same time, her Christian Democrat (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) political bloc failed to secure a majority in the last federal election and have so far been unable to form a majority coalition with other parties. Their traditional partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) has refused to join the coalition this time, leaving a mix of leftist parties, including the Greens, and the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) as the only other options. Merkel has refused to work with AfD on principle. A pair of Luftwaffe Eurofighter Typhoons., Bundeswehr Domestic politics had already been a major issue in defense spending. In January 2017, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the SPD, argued that any additional defense spending should be focused on supporting humanitarian interventions and related activities. “Germany spends 30 to 40 billion Euros on supporting refugees because of military interventions years ago that went wrong,” he said . A larger defense budget “should be considered a contribution to stabilization.” It could be increasingly politically untenable to entertain the idea of buying the F-35, or even Boeing’s F-15 or F/A-18E/F, both due to the Trump Administration and the domestic political landscape. With other European options, such as France’s Rafale and Sweden’s Gripen E also apparently not in the running, at least based on information available at this time, there may now be no other easily realizable option than the Typhoon. Germany could buy more Typhoons and push forward with a new unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) program with France instead of a manned fifth generation fighter. Doing so would cost far less than pursuing a high-end, clean-sheet fighter design, and these aircraft could pickup for the Typhoon’s shortfalls in the coming decades, as the Typhoon becomes increasingly less survivable. Namely these advanced drones could be used for deep strike, reconnaissance, and suppression of enemy air defenses, as well as manned-unmanned teaming, working as the automated wingman for Typhoon pilots. A UCAV would also feature a far stealthier, broadband low-observable overall design compared to the F-35. Also, such an initiative would help secure Germany a foothold on the future of air combat, which will be increasingly less likely to have humans sitting at flight controls. In the meantime, Germany could enjoy the large efficiencies of operating a single multi-role manned tactical fast jet fleet, as well as the aforementioned upgrades in combat power these jets, old and new, would feature. Standoff weaponry could be procured in the near-term for the most perilous of strike missions. On the other hand, if the political hurdles could be overcome, Super Hornets, and the latest version of the F-15 Strike Eagle in particular, could provide Germany with a power fighter capability. But considering the industrial benefits of just sticking with the Typhoon, not to mention all the other reasons laid out above, the introduction of either type seems quite doubtful. Every twist and turn in this saga only means that Germany is getting closer to when it will need to have a replacement for the Tornados ready or risk losing the capability those units offer altogether. The Defense Ministry and the Luftwaffe will have to reach some sort of consensus to avoid any additional delays in the process. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Saab was part of BAE Systems. BAE Systems does have two subsidiaries in Sweden, but these firms are unrelated to Saab.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has made an unannounced, but triumphant stop in Syria ahead of trips to Egypt and Turkey , ostensibly to declare victory over terrorist elements in the country and announce a troop withdrawal. Rather than marking the end of an era, the Russian leader’s visits underscores the Kremlin’s significantly expanding presence in the Middle East and role in its political and military affairs . On Dec. 11, 2017, Putin touched down at Russia’s Hmeimim Air Base near the Syrian city of Latakia in a Tu-214PU . Su-30SM fighters had escorted the aircraft, one of the Russian government’s latest strategic airborne command posts , or “doomsday planes,” which has the ability to serve the needs of the country’s leaders during a nuclear war or other major global crisis, into the embattled country. The Tu-214PU is loosely analogous something of a cross between the U.S. E-4B Nightwatch and the C-32A . https://youtube.com/watch?v=t77PFej_iAg Media captured during the event showed the base brimming with aircraft and other activity, including Su-35 advanced Flanker , MiG-29SMT Fulcrum, and Su-34 Fullback multi-role fighter aircraft , Su-24 Fencer and Su-25 strike jets, and Il-76 transports, an A-50M airborne early warning plane , an Il-22PP electronic warfare platform, and various other types, along with helicopters and air defense gear. After landing, Putin reviewed and met with various Russian military personnel at the base, accompanied by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and a noticeably giddy Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, among others. The trio then received a briefing in the “quaint” operations center at Hmeimim Air Base and had a meet-and-greet over coffee with what appeared to be a specially selected group of young Russian troops. “Over slightly more than two years, the Russian Armed Forces have routed together with the Syrian army the most combat-capable grouping of international terrorists,” Putin said during a speech on the tarmac. “In view of this, I have made a decision: most of the Russian military contingent staying in the Syrian Arab Republic is returning home, to Russia.” “You are coming home with a victory, to your relatives, parents, wives, children and friends,” he continued. “Your Motherland is waiting for you, my friends. Have a safe trip home and thank you for your service.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=viJ_lyEw9oc Back in June 2017, Assad had made another very public visit to the base, a particularly visible display of the Russian-Syrian alliance. This latest surprise appearance was clearly a Putin-focused affair to celebrate Russia’s successes and at one point a Russian official appeared to prevent Assad from sharing the Russia’s president limelight in front of the cameras. On Dec. 6, 2017, Chief of Russia’s General Staff and First Deputy Defense Minister, General of the Army Valery Gerasimov, announced that Syria was entirely free of ISIS . The Russian Ministry of Defense also extended an offer to help the United States and its international coalition battling the terrorists in Iraq and Syria. On Dec. 9, 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi announced that ISIS was totally defeated in his country, too. There have since been reports of continued fighting against the terrorists in both countries, including more Russian air strikes in Syria . The idea that any party has completely destroyed ISIS in either Syria or Iraq is an extremely dubious. The core of the organization, including leader Abu Bakar Al Baghdadi, are in hiding, but have so far been able to elude capture and targeted strikes, all while inspiring individuals around the world to launch attacks and forming connections with established militants . The remnants of ISIS are unlikely to simply disperse and the group, an evolution of Al Qaeda in Iraq , could even rebrand itself yet again. https://youtube.com/watch?v=J_Jzghni6IE Furthermore, both Assad’s Partner Hezbollah and U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces have cut deals in the past with ISIS that has allowed its members to slip away in exchange for evacuating them from certain areas. There is little indication of a long-lasting political settlement between the regime in Damascus and the myriad actors still opposed to it and the Russians know this. “If terrorists again raise head, we will deliver such strikes on them that they haven’t seen so far,” Putin declared at Hmeimim. He added that the “memory” of sacrifices the country’s security forces made against terrorists and militants both in Syria and in Russia “will give us an additional force to eradicate that absolute evil – international terrorism – no matter under what guise it hides.” Putin, second from the right, along with Sergei Shoigu and Bashar Al Assad, review troops at Hmeimim on Dec. 11, 2017., Office of the President of Russia It’s already unclear exactly what Putin’s draw down will amount to, whether it actually involves a large reduction in the total size of Russian forces in Syria long term, rotating new units in to take the place of existing troops, or simply ending active combat operations and sending personnel back to the garrisons at Hmeimim and Russia’s naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. The Russian president has announced major withdrawals in the past and in those cases the result was primarily a change in the composition of the contingent in country after a short reduction in overall footprint. Regardless, Putin’s announcements do represent practical and political victories for both Russia and Syria. The Kremlin, along with Iran and Iranian-backed proxies , was instrumental in saving Assad from certain defeat at the hands of a mixture of rebels and extremist groups in late 2015. Putin and Assad meet with Russian troops at Hmeimim on Dec. 11, 2017, Office of the President of Russia With Moscow’s support, the government in Damascus has stabilized the situation in the western portion of the country, routed rebels to the east , and has now been able to turn its attention to re-establishing authority all the way to the Iraqi border . In the process, Russia has secured strategic basing deals to continue operations at Hmeimim and Tartus for decades to come. Tartus is particularly important , giving the Russian Navy a key warm water port outside the bottleneck of the Black Sea to support operations in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and beyond. Securing these strategic assets over the long-term was clearly one of the primary motivations behind the Kremlin’s decision to step into Assad’s mess. Putin giving his speech at Russia’s airbase in Syria. The base has been leased now to Russia for decades. Same with their port in Tartus which as expanded greatly in size as well. , Office of the President of Russia And after his jubilant stop in Syria, Putin flew to Egypt, where the larger Il-96 presidential plane , similar in form and function to the U.S. Air Force’s VC-25A , known popularly by its call sign when the President is on board, Air Force One, was waiting to take him further on. This visit is another visible example of Russia’s growing influence throughout the Middle East and North Africa , even among traditional American partners, including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates , and Saudi Arabia . https://youtube.com/watch?v=fntGohuownI Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who came to power following a coup in 2013, has been actively supporting rogue General Khalifa Haftar’s efforts to take control of Libya and has now found himself battling an ISIS franchise in the Sinai Peninsula . At the same time, President Barack Obama’s administration had limited ties and military aid to Sisi’s government over human and political rights concerns, prompting the Egyptian leader to turn to Russia for assistance in these efforts and other areas. U.S. President Donald Trump had reversed course and appeared to be mending relations with Sisi, who he met with during a state visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017 and then invited to the White House in September 2017. However, in August 2017, the U.S. government had continued to withhold key aid over the Egyptian leader’s dictatorial policies. Putin on board the Tu-214PU heading to Syria., Office of the President of Russia Now, Sisi may be inclined to turn toward Russia yet again following the U.S. government’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision that countries across the Arab and Muslim worlds have almost universally criticized. In a statement on Dec. 5, 2017, the Egyptian president’s office said that Sisi had warned Trump not to “complicate” the situation in the Middle East and warned against “taking measures that would undermine the chances of peace in the Middle East.” Russia had already been increasingly interested in taking advantage of these political spats to increase its own standing in Egypt and potentially secure new strategic economic and military deals, something we at the War Zone have already written about in great detail here . Putin, left, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi together on Dec. 11, 2017., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP During Putin’s visit, he formalized plans to help Egyptian authorities establish their first nuclear power plant, which could have a total of four reactors in its final configuration. That work will cost at least $21 billion and Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom says the initial construction will be done sometime between 2028 and 2029. In addition, the two countries agreed to resume direct commercial flights between Cairo and Moscow, which had stopped after ISIS blew up a Russian airliner in 2015. At least initially, there were no new announcements about the sale of military hardware or basing rights, but Egypt has steadily been looking to purchase more advanced systems from Russia and make other military cooperation deals. Earlier in 2017, Egyptian authorities had also consulted with their Russian counterparts about the sale of communications and other systems for its pair of French-made Mistral -class amphibious assault ship . Egypt’s Mistral-class amphibious assault ship ENS Anwar El Sadat ., David Boyer/Sipa USA via AP Originally, these ships were supposed to go to Russia, but France blocked the deal in response to Russia’s intervention in Crimea in 2014. Egypt subsequently bought them and Russian officials have since offered to install many of the systems they had previously intended to fit on the vessels. In addition, the Egyptian military has bought Russian-made Kamov Ka-52 , and is expected to buy K models as well, the same type Moscow had originally planned to deploy on the ship . The sale of advanced MiG-29s , also known as the MiG-35, to Egypt also marked a change in what had been the country’s ever-growing reliance on American air combat hardware. Military cooperation between the two countries is growing elsewhere, as well. In August 2017, Russian and Egyptian paratroopers announced plans for a first of its kind joint exercise in Russia . Two months later, the Russian destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov made a very visible stop in the port of Alexandria to replenish supplies of food and water during a cruise that reportedly covered 15,000 miles. There have been reports that Russian personnel are in Egypt, potentially to help out with the fight against ISIS in Sinai. Now that the Kremlin has claimed victory over the terrorists in Syria, any additional offers of help might seem especially attractive. Maybe most importantly from a strategic standpoint, a deal has been in the works that would give Russian aircraft basing and airspace rights in Egypt, a move that would allow Russia to rapidly deploy large amounts of airpower to the nexus between Africa and the greater Middle East. Combined with Russia’s long term holdings in Syria, this would give Moscow far more military influence and tactical flexibility over the region as a whole. After the meeting in Cairo, Putin boarded the Il-96 and headed to his third stop of the whirlwind day to meet with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in Ankara. As with Egypt, Russia has similarly expanded its ties with Turkey in recent years due to strained relations with the United States following the July 2016 coup attempt , as well as over the U.S. government’s support for Kurdish groups battling ISIS in Syria. Russian and Turkish authorities have been working together to craft so-called “de-escalation zones” in northern Syria, which have effectively acted as buffers to keep the Kurds contained in various cantons and limit the possibility of a de facto independent Kurdish state emerging. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uEeHxWDWAqc Notably, in July 2017, Turkey announced it was moving ahead with the purchase of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system. This has irked its fellow NATO-members, especially the United States, who say it doesn’t meet the alliance’s standards and could pose a security risk by giving the Kremlin an opportunity to test some of its latest air defense weaponry against against top-of-the-line western aircraft. Turkey is a member of the U.S.-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and is in the process of developing its own fifth generation stealth fighter with help from the United Kingdom . On top of that, Turkey, like Egypt, is concerned about the U.S. government’s decision regarding the status of Jerusalem, which Erdogan called a “ red line ” for relations with Israel. In November 2017, the Trump administration had reportedly begun scaling back support for the Kurds in what many viewed as an attempted to mend ties with the Turkish government. However, the Jerusalem decision has given the Kremlin an all new opening to drive a wedge between the two countries. Putin shakes hands with Turkish President Recep Erdogan on Dec. 11, 2017., Evgeny Biyatov/Sputnik  via AP At home, Putin is undoubtedly hoping to use his claimed victory in Syria, as well as Russia’s growing international relevance in the Middle East, to boost his stature ahead of what will almost certainly be a very controversial presidential election in 2018. Russian authorities have already announced they will bar prominent opposition politician Aleksei Navalny from even running in the polls after his disputed conviction for alleged financial crimes. “Yes, I will run for the president of the Russian Federation,” Putin said earlier in December 2017 , and is apparently considering running as a independent candidate.”Russia will move only ahead and in this advance nothing and nobody will stop it.” Whatever happens, this trip can be viewed as almost a blueprint for a grander regional strategy Moscow is working very hard to realize. Above all else it seems clear that Putin is still eager to present Moscow as an alternative to with Washington in the Middle East and elsewhere. His warm welcomes in Syria, Egypt, and Turkey show that he is having a certain amount of success in this endeavor so far. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Air Froce has declared an initial operational capability, or IOC, with its F-35I Joint Strike Fighters , also known as Adir or “Mighty,” makes it the first foreign operator to put the stealthy jets into active service. With Israel’s air war over Syria heating up and tensions growing with Iran , the first examples are now ready for actual combat missions, but it doesn’t automatically mean they’ll be sling missiles or bombs on real targets just yet. On Dec. 6, 2017, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the achievement , which marked the end of the IAF’s 140 Squadron’s year-long qualification process. The unit, also known as the Golden Eagle Squadron, stood up in December 2016 to receive the country’s first F-35Is . Israel now has a total of nine Adirs and is looking to purchase at least 50 in total, and that the number might eventually grow to 75 . Though more than a dozen countries are part of the international Joint Strike Fighter program, only the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps had previously declared they had reached the IOC milestone. “The main theme that characterized the past year was learning,” the commanding officer of 140 Squadron, named only as Lieutenant Colonel Yotam, said in an official news release .  “Every day in the past year ended with a debriefing in which we learned something new: about the aircraft, about its systems, operation, and maintenance.” Though the F-35I is based on the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A, we don’t know exactly how similar the operational Adirs are in terms of configuration or capabilities to the latest American examples, which still lack numerous important features , including the ability to hit moving targets on the ground. Israel has secured unique rights from the manufacturer Lockheed Martin to modify and expand on the aircraft’s underlying software packages. Three of 140 Squdaron’s nine F-35I Adirs., IAF This could eventually include Israeli officials fully separating their jets from the overarching, cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System , or ALIS, that is at the core of all other Joint Strike Fighter mission systems. Various F-35 operators have expressed concern about whether this controversial computer system is scooping up too much sensitive information and is dangerous vulnerable to cyber attacks, two deeply intertwined issues we at The War Zone have previously explored in depth . In May 2017, the IAF revealed it would be buying a single aircraft to act as a dedicated test bed for these changes. It is unclear whether or not the Israelis have been working on any new software updates or installed them on their existing aircraft already. On top of that, Israeli defense contractors are reportedly at work on developing conformal fuel tanks to the Adirs, hopefully without  heavily negating the jets’ low-observable shape, which would help increase their overall range, while reducing strain on the IAF’s limited aerial refueling tanker fleet. The F-35I will also undoubtedly gain the ability to employ Israeli-specific air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions and there is even the possibility to could eventually contribute to the country’s unspoken nuclear deterrent , which experts believe includes thermonuclear gravity bombs along with land- and submarine-launched missiles . It is possible Israel could choose to supplement the jets already extensive suite of sensors and electronic countermeasures with its own domestically designed systems, which could increase its already impressive potential as an electronic intelligence gathering platform . The IAF will definitely be interested in making sure the Adirs can share information back and for with the service’s Eitam airborne early warning planes and Shavit electronic intelligence aircraft. “I don’t look at it [the F-35] just as a plane and capability,” Major General Amir Eshel, who led the IAF until retiring in August 2017, told Israeli newspaper Haaretz shortly thereafter. “Before the plane was received, we thought about how to change the air force and adapt it to a fifth-generation fighter, and not the opposite. If we’d done the opposite, we would have only diminished the plane’s capabilities. You need to look at it at a system-wide level – not of the plane, of the whole air force. How the F-35 makes the other planes far more effective, the information it shares with them and with our information centers, how they can then do so much more thanks to that information. It goes far beyond the fact that it can operate in places that no other plane can.” Regardless, the stealthy F-35 is an important addition to the IAF’s arsenal. Regional opponents, chiefly Iran, continue to develop offensive capabilities that could threaten Israel and deploy expanding and increasingly capable networks of defensive systems to guard them from pre-emptive strikes. “The announcement of the operationalization of the ‘Adir’ aircraft comes at a time in which the IAF is operating on a large scale on a number of fronts in a dynamic Middle East,” Major General Amikam Norkin, the commander of the IAF, said in a letter distributed across the service. “The constantly evolving and complex challenges are met with a high-quality and professional aerial response.” In September 2017, the Iranians publicly unveiled its latest ballistic missile, the intermediate-range Khorramshahr , which they say can reach Israel. Israeli officials, as well as their American allies, are worried that Iran might be covertly developing a nuclear weapon that it could fit onto such a weapon. Iran denies it has an active nuclear weapons program and insists its broader ballistic missile program is to defend against “aggression” from Israel and the United States. Increasingly wary of a pre-emptive strike, Iran has acquired and deployed new Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile systems that present a credible threat to non-stealthy aircraft. With their ability to move through potentially hostile air space with a low probability of an opponent detecting them, the Adirs give Israel more options on how to respond to fleeting, time-sensitive targets inside denied areas in general. Given the country’s position, full of neighbors who might not want Israeli aircraft flying over on their way to attack another party, the IAF has had to plan in the past to either run the additional practical and political risks or otherwise fly circuitous routes to the target area. The first F-35I prototype., Lockheed Martin The IAF has also increasingly found itself launching punitive strikes into Syria , predominantly aimed at the regime of Bashar Al Assad and elements of the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah , both of which receive substantial support from Iran. On the night of Dec. 1-2, 2017, Israeli aircraft reportedly hit a suspected Iranian base near the Syrian capital Damascus, though it was unclear whether or not anyone was occupying the facility at the time. The F-35Is could provide an important and more survivable asset for responding to crises or other short-notice missions further afield, which Israel has had to rely on its F-15s for in the past. In 1985, Israeli aircraft attacked the Palestinian Liberation Organization at the groups then headquarters in Tunisia and reportedly attempted to strike the terrorists in Algeria three years later .  More recently, in 2009, the IAF reportedly hit Iranian arms shipments in Sudan that were bound for the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. There have already been multiple , unconfirmed rumors that the F-35Is have attacked Syrian targets, but there is no indication that the jets have flown any combat missions. Now that 140 Squadron is ready to go, that could quickly change. Syria has long presented a potentially deadly air defense environment, which only became more threatening after the Russians officially linked their S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to the larger Syrian network in August 2017. Though the Kremlin has so far declined to engage Israeli intruders, it is something the IAF would have to consider in future operations.  Assad’s own SA-5 surface-to-air missiles are aging, but still a potential threat, as well, and Syrian air defenders have increasingly attempted to shoot down Israel’s aircraft and missiles. The F-35Is would offer increased protection for Israeli pilots flying these missions, even over Syria’s most densely defended areas, such as around the capital Damascus. And if nothing else, sending the Adirs into Syria would provide a real world demonstration of their capabilities for both the Syrians and the Iranians, as well as Iran’s other regional proxies, to see. With this in mind, we could see the jets used on an operational mission as early as tonight. On the other hand, the Adirs still might not end up flying over Syria any time soon, either. Israel might be disinclined to risk its new and expensive stealth fighters on missions that its existing aircraft, armed with stand-off weapons and carrying advanced electronic countermeasures, as well as being supported by standoff electronic warfare and cyber warfare capabilities, have been able to perform without incident. Syrian air defenders have not been able to shoot down any Israeli aircraft in the course of more than four years of sporadic strikes. The proximity of Israel to Syria means that there have been reports that the IDF may have conducted strikes using ground-launched guided artillery rockets, something it can do from safely within the country. And even though the F-35Is would be even better protected against Syrian air defenses, there is always the possibility of a lucky shot or just an accident. The Joint Strike Fighter’s low observable characteristics don’t actually render it invisible and the jets aren’t immune to normal wear and tear . During 140 Squadron’s qualification period, one of its Adirs ended up briefly grounded after a bird strike . IAF The practical and political fallout from an F-35 crash over Syria would be immense, not just to Israel, but to other Joint Strike Fighter operators, including the United States. There is nothing to suggest the Syrians wouldn’t happily share any parts of the aircraft they might recover with Iran, as well as Russia. Even if those countries were unable to glean any significant information from their examinations, it would be a propaganda coup for all of them. The U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps have also not yet committed their F-35s to actual combat operations , either, despite both services having declaring IOCs with their respective A and B models. The F-22 Raptor stealth fighter was in service for nearly a decade before the United States sent it into hostile territory . 140 Squadron doesn’t even have its full complement of the fighter jets yet, with another six aircraft expected to join the unit in 2018, according to Defense Update. The IAF plans to form another two squadrons with F-35Is by 2024. None of this is to say that Israel couldn’t employ its Adirs over Syria or anywhere else and the jets could also potentially provide an important electronic intelligence gathering capability for the country throughout the region. “We have yet to complete our acquaintance with the aircraft,” Lieutenant Colonel Yotam, the 140 Squadron commander, added in his official comments. “We still have tests, development of combat doctrines and extensive learning before us. We haven’t stopped learning thinking and developing upon being declared operational.” With limited numbers of the jets on hand, the IAF will have to decide whether or not to make a statement or make sure the aircraft it does have are in reserve for contingencies that absolutely require their advanced capabilities, such as quelling a more imminent threat against Israel itself or attacking targets over-long range that are defended by an advanced integrated air defense assets.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2018","Top USAF Civilian Is a “Fan” of the A-10, but Dozens Will Still Likely Get Grounded","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force top civilian official has made uncharacteristically strong comments in support of the A-10 Warthog and a vital re-winging program that could keep the jets flying through 2040, saying she’s a “fan” of the venerable ground attack aircraft. Unfortunately, it’s still likely that more than 100 of the aircraft will end up grounded , at least temporarily, and it’s not clear how much support there might be for an alternative, low-cost light attack platform that could help fill the resulting gap. On Dec. 7, 2017, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson , along with Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Ellen Lord, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition James Guerts, went before the Senate Armed Services Committee to talk about improvements to how the U.S. military goes about buying weapons and equipment. One of the topics that came up during the testimony was the Air Force’s plans for the Warthogs , 110 of which are in need of new wings in order to keep them flying. In its markup of the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year, the House Appropriations Committee included more than $100 million to resume production of the replacement parts and begin installing them on the aircraft, something their counterparts in the Senate are reportedly working on adding to their version now. “If that comes through, we will work on executing that so we can get that line back up so that we can re-wing,” Wilson explained to the assembled Senators. “I think the amount would be the tooling and the first four or five sets of wings for the A-10.” The Air Force has long had a complicated relationship with the Warthogs, which we at The War Zone have touched on many times before , and the service has repeatedly attempted to cut funding for important upgrades and retire the planes for good. They argue that the aircraft has become too old and vulnerable to be useful in anything but a “permissive” environment without the risk of enemy air defenses or hostile aircraft. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP However, the aircraft continue to fly exactly those sorts of combat missions , contribute to the standing defense of South Korea , and take part in important routine training exercises and security cooperation activities . As such, Congress has continually stymied any plans to get rid of them. For nearly a decade, the re-wing program in particular has been a point of contention between the Air Force and lawmakers. Despite initial plans to make sure all of its 280 A-10s had the improved “thick” wings, the Air Force project ended the project early, with more than a third of the aircraft still in need of the new parts, ostensibly due to budget cuts. Without them, they’ll steadily become unsafe to fly at all, but with them, they could be ready to go through at least 2040, according to the Air Force’s own estimates . But “I happen to be kind of a fan of the A-10 myself,” Wilson told legislators during the hearing, giving an unusually firm endorsement of the Warthog. This doesn’t mean this particular saga is over just yet, though. In September 2017, U.S. Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, head of Air Force Materiel Command acknowledged that even if there was funding for the new wings, it might not keep the A-10s in the air. She said that the first of the nearly 110 Warthogs in need of the upgrades could have to stop flying for safety reasons by the 2018 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2017. An A-10 sits at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey between flying missions against ISIS terrorists in Iraq in 2017., USAF If and when money for a new re-wing effort becomes available, the Air Force will have to hire contractors, who will in turn have to reboot production of the components before anyone can actually update any aircraft, which will take additional time. At present, the U.S. government as a whole is working on a temporary funding measure that will keep it up through Dec. 22, 2017. Lawmakers will have to pass another bill to keep things running after that and there’s no firm timeline for when the new defense budget will become law. Both Congress and the Air Force agree the initial funding won’t cover anywhere near the total number of aircraft waiting on new wings, either. Future budgets will continue to have to take into account the service’s various other priorities, many of which are extremely costly, including the continued development and fielding of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, delays in getting the new KC-46A tanker , and the need for monetary incentives to keep pilots in uniform and avert an even worse shortage of aviators . In the past, the Air Force has suggested it might be able to buy more time by scavenging wings from other A-10s sitting in storage in the famous Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force base. In her September 2017 interview, Pawlikowski was dismissive of the long-term viability of that idea, noting that the wings would still be old and could only give aircraft “a few more hours” of flying time. There aren’t enough A-10s in the Boneyard to offer new wings for all the aircraft in need, anyways. As of Nov. 15, 2017, there were 50 A-10Cs and another 49 A-10As in storage, according to data from the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, which manages the facility. The A models have long served as parts sources to keep existing aircraft going and many don’t even have wings to give anymore. The Cs are supposed to be available in case of an urgent demand for replacement aircraft, too, and rendering any of them non-flyable would impact this already thin reserve force. Contractors remove a wing from one of the A-10As at the Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona., USAF The Air Force could have avoided this predicament if it made the original re-wing program a priority and finished the work, or even just slowed the pace of the upgrades rather than scrapping the entire project altogether. Now the situation might present an opportunity for the Air Force to follow through on plans to acquire a largely off-the-shelf light attack aircraft to help fill the gap. This could also provide a low-cost partial alternative to employing F-16 Viper multi-role fighter jets and B-52 heavy bombers in permissive environments for some missions, and could be especially useful in Afghanistan. John McCain, a Republic Senator for Arizona, has been a vocal proponent of this idea, even attempting to force the Air Force to accept the proposal by adding more than $1 billion to an early draft fiscal year 2018 defense budget for these aircraft. Subsequent negotiations have since cut this proposed line item to less than $500 million . It’s not clear whether the Air Force how, when, and even if the Air Force might move ahead with that plan, though. From the very beginning of the test project, also known as OA-X, the Air Force has steadily downplayed its significance . Heather Wilson, at center, shakes hands with Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein during the OA-X tests in August 2017., USAF Though four aircraft took part in the program, the Air Force said only the A-29 Super Tucano, which American defense contractor the Sierra Nevada Corporation and Brazilian plane maker Embraer provided jointly, and Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine had the features necessary to proceed to any notional second round. That combat evaluation, which reportedly could still occur in an unspecified country in the Middle East or Central Asia, has yet to materialize . Even if the Air Force decided to buy a readily available platform, such as the A-29, a formal light attack aircraft program would still need time to acquire the aircraft, establish units and train crews, and develop a concept of operations for employing them. All of this would take yet more time to put in place. During the December 2017 hearing, Secretary of the Air Force Wilson said that there was a final report from the service’s light attack experiment, which it held earlier in the year, but that she hadn’t read it yet. The Air Force says it will release the results “when appropriate,” according to Military.com . With dozens of A-10s steadily becoming unusable and no obvious solution in sight, it’s hard to think of better time to reveal those findings.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Blackwater Founder’s Private Afghan Air Arm Pitch Included An-26 Gunships And AH-1 Cobras,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In August 2017, it emerged that infamous private military contractor Erik Prince was proffering up the idea of privatizing the war in Afghanistan to both that country’s leadership and U.S. government officials, including offering to create a mercenary air arm to aid beleaguered Afghan troops. A more detailed breakdown of what that force could have looked like, such as plans to turn Russian-made An-26 cargo planes into gunships and acquire AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters , has now emerged. On Dec. 7, 2017, BuzzFeed News published a briefing it had obtained, outlining Prince’s plan, optimistically titled “An Exit Strategy for Afghanistan.” The proposal is linked to a nominally independent Dubai-based firm called Lancaster6, though a spokesperson for long-time private businessman and retired U.S. Navy SEAL told the outlet that Prince’s own Chinese-funded Frontier Services Group would have been involved. Prince, who has various ties to President Donald Trump’s administration, which includes his sister, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, has publicly defended the idea of replacing American troops and the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan with a new, private force. There is no indication that the U.S. government is actively considering the proposal. The plan would “remove the irritant and stigma of foreign invaders while providing a strong skeletal structure with key aviation and governance enablers to ensure [the] viability and success of [Afghan National Security Forces],” the briefing explains. “Unrelenting pressure placed upon Taliban force them to the bargaining table, annihilate ISIS,” another bullet point reads. The proposal, which focuses exclusively on the restive eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Helmand, also includes plan to develop mining activities in Afghanistan ostensibly to provide improved quality of life and draw locals away from supporting insurgents, a concept the U.S. government and its allies have long attempted to implement in the past without success . However, the briefing makes it clear that this would have the added benefit of providing the United States with a new source for rare earth metals and other materials. A standard An-26 transport belonging to the Hungarian Air Force., Adrian Pingstone via Wikimedia Under the proposal, contractors would have worked closely with Afghan military units and government officials, both to advise and assist those elements and provide key specialized capabilities, including intelligence, communications, medical, and other support. But most importantly, a composite “turn key” air wing would fly close air support, intelligence and reconnaissance flights, and logistics missions from bases in Nangarhar and Helmand. When news of Prince’s plan first appeared in August 2017, the available information indicated that the air component of his force would include A-4 Skyhawk jets , T-bird armed crop dusters, An-26 transports, and Super Puma and Gazelle helicopters. Lancaster6 had reportedly also offered to provide a propriety intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone called Lionseye, for which there is little publicly available information beyond its reported 12-hour endurance. The briefing BuzzFeed obtained describes an even more robust force. Close air support in both in Nangarhar and Helmand would reportedly have come from a mixture of A-4 Skyhawks, AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters , and “An-26G” gunships. In Helmand only, the proposed attack force included four Gazelle light attack helicopters, as well. via BuzzFeed News via BuzzFeed News The Douglas A-4 Skyhawk was a marvel when the first versions began to enter U.S. Navy and Marine Corps service in 1956. Despite its relatively small size, the “Scooter” could carry an impressive payload of bombs and missiles over a respectable range. It was also fast and nimble, features that continue to make it a popular for contractors playing the role of enemy fighter pilots to this day. It’s not clear where Prince expected to acquire these jets from, but it is possible he planned to purchase the seven jets the plan required on the second-hand market from one of the Skyhawks’ numerous former operators, such as Argentina . Various private companies in the United States are still flying them , as well, and may have been willing to part with some of them for the right price. Some of A-4 Skyhawks that private firm Draken International operates., Draken International Depending on the source, it could have taken a significant amount of effort to get them back to flying condition, though, especially for combat missions. Contractors would have to make sure add in the right targeting equipment if the pilots wanted to make use of laser- or GPS-guided precision munitions. A number of the examples in private hands, such as Draken International’s advanced A-4Ks, already have some modern capabilities that are used for training purposes. The briefing doesn’t state which of the numerous different models of AH-1 Cobra gunships, which Bell Helicopter initially developed during the Vietnam War, would have gone to Afghanistan, either. It is possible Prince again had sources on the second-hand market for older single- or twin-engine models, many of which had electro-optical and infrared camera in a turret under the nose and the ability to launch TOW and Hellfire guided missiles. Textron is still building the latest version, the significantly improved twin-engine AH-1Z Viper . If the Trump Administration had agreed to the plan, it is possible that they could have found a way to approve a sale of those helicopters to Lancaster6. The Anglo-French Gazelle is also out of production, but is still in active service around the world in both military and civilian roles. Late model military types had  roof-mounted sights for firing wire-guided missiles, but they can also carry 20mm cannons and .50 caliber machine gun pods, as well as unguided rockets. The last close air support tool, the An-26G side-firing gunship, is by far the most eye catching addition in the entire presentation. At present, there is no clear indication that this aircraft even exists. A Ukranian Air Force An-26 in 2016., Rostislav Kalousek/CTK via AP Still, it wouldn’t be a particularly complicated conversion and used examples of the basic cargo aircraft are readily available. There are a number of windows on the aircraft’s left side that could provide a mounting point for automatic cannons. Adding one or more sensor turrets with electro-optical and infrared cameras would aid in targeting, and if it included a laser designator, it could allow the crew to fire precision munitions. Basic bomb racks that attach to the fuselage are already available for the An-26 family. Various companies, including ATKOrbital and Airbus Defense , have begun offering modular weapon and sensor kits that could work with various airframes. Bulgarian firm LASA Engineering , which has ties to Prince, could have been involved in this proposal. LASA is also responsible for the T-bird, a converted Thrush 510G cropduster that would have provided “armed reconnaissance” to the mercenary force in Afghanistan, according to the briefing. You can read all about that aircraft, and its complicated history, here . Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support would have come from the Lionseye drones and a number of tethered aerostats, along with three Diamond DA-62 twin-engine turboprops. Diamond offers a special mission version of this light aircraft known as the MPP. This version of the aircraft has modular payload bays that can accept various electro-optical and infrared cameras, surveillance radars, communications packages and other systems. A satellite data link allows it to share any of that information with personnel on the ground in near real time. Diamond Aircraft Rounding out the force would be a pair of regular An-26 transports – one each in Nangarhar and Helmand – and 10 EC-225 Super Puma helicopters to help shuttle Afghan troops around the country’s more remote regions and provide combat search and rescue capabilities. The EC-225 is the last version of the Super Puma, now an Airbus Helicopters product, which is already in service with dozens of military and civil operators. The design can readily accept sensor turrets and machine guns for close-in protection, as well as other self-defense systems. Functionally the force makes decent sense for Afghanistan. It could also have simply served as starting place to get things moving, with Lancaster6 and Frontier Services Group adding more assets to the mix or deploying additional task forces in other provinces as time went on. But it remains unclear as ever how Prince’s plan would be able to do what thousands of highly equipped American and other foreign troops have been unable to over the past 16 years . There’s nothing to say that contractors would be any more incentivized to actually “win” the conflict than Afghan or international military forces, however that end state gets defined in the end. The briefing BuzzFeed obtained highlights the fact that there are already tens of thousands of contractors there supporting the NATO-led coalition. U.S. Army Gen. John Nicholson, head of all U.S. forces and the international coalition in Afghanistan reportedly refused to meet with the private contractor to discuss the plan in the past. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster were apparently opposed to the idea , as well. Combined with President Trump’s new, publicly announced strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia broadly and the recent surge of American aircraft and troops into the region , it seems unlikely that the U.S. government will be seriously considering Prince’s plan any time soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",US Military Goes on Alert Ahead of Trump’s Plan to Move US Embassy into Jerusalem,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has reportedly deployed additional troops throughout the Middle East ahead of President Donald Trump announcing that the United States has recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s official capital or that he is otherwise ordering the U.S. Embassy to relocate there from Tel Aviv. World leaders, experts, and observers all warn that the decision could fundamentally undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and trigger widespread political unrest throughout majority Muslim countries. On Dec. 5, 2017, U.S. Central Command, which has responsibility for American military activities throughout the Middle East and Central Asia – with the exception of Israel , which is the responsibility of U.S. European Command – told Foreign Policy’s Paul McLeary that it had “contingency plans in place.” The U.S. Marine Corps had dispatched elements of its Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams , or FAST Companies, to provide additional security at American embassies across the Middle East, according to Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin. Trump is expected to officially detail the new policy on Dec. 6, 2017. “We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem,” then candidate Trump told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, on March 21, 2016. “I want to give that [Israeli-Palestinian peace] a shot before I even think about moving the embassy to Jerusalem,” he told Mike Huckabee during an interview on the former Arkansas Governor’s Trinity Broadcasting Network in October 2017. While Israel claims Jerusalem as its exclusive capital, the Palestinians want it for their own future state. This Old City within is home to some of the most holy sites in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, some literally on top of each other, which has already made it a contentious location for millennia. FAST Marines during a training exercise in Morocco., USN A 1995 law, unimaginatively called the Jerusalem Embassy Act , required the U.S. government to move the embassy into the contested city by 1999, but all American presidents since then have signed a waiver every six months delaying the order. Though there are reports that he could push back the decision again, Trump increasingly seems to have decided that the potential for Israeli-Palestinian peace has run its course. It remains unclear whether if he will decide to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital , move the U.S. Embassy there, or both. Either way, the message would be clear, that the United States understands the city to be the Israeli capital now and forever. Absent a final, mutually agreed upon settlement of the issue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, making the move is almost certain to provoke protests and potentially violent skirmishes at and near American government and facilities U.S. nationals own and operate in Israel and the occupied territories, the Middle East as a whole, and beyond. The reported U.S. military moves make it clear that they are well aware of this fact. US Central Command says it has “contingency plans in place” in the event violence breaks out after White House Jerusalem announcement on Wednesday. @ForeignPolicy — Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) December 5, 2017 Since the infamous attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 12, 2012, both the Pentagon and the State Department have implemented various contingency plans and bolstered the size and scope of available quick reaction forces around the globe. U.S. Central Command’s contingency planning is likely part of a standing and overarching U.S. military operating concept focused on the potential of widespread global unrest, nicknamed Operation New Normal, the exact details of which remain classified. I mean, the Pentagon literally calls this the ""new normal"" pic.twitter.com/YkVOos22t2 — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) December 6, 2017 Still, as a result, it is almost certain that every one of the U.S. military’s regional commands has a broad plan in place to respond to widespread public disturbances and that they would coordinate with each other to make the best use of their respective resources. The FAST elements, which the Marine Corps enlarged after Benghazi, are a early line of this scalable defensive posture defense. The Marines already have a close relationship with the State Department and provide a standing guard at various Embassies and diplomatic posts. US Marine Corps Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams, or FAST teams have bolstered security across “several” U.S. embassies in the Middle East ahead of the expected announcement Wednesday by President Trump about moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. — Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) December 5, 2017 First formed in 1987 in response to the rising threat of terrorist attacks, these units can rapidly deploy around the world to provide additional manpower and firepower to embassies and other diplomatic posts. Depending on the situation, they might bring along a variety of standard infantry arms, including .50 caliber M2 machine guns or 40mm Mk 19 automatic grenade launchers, as well as specialized riot control gear, such as non-lethal weapons . There are standing FAST companies in the Middle East, Europe, and the Pacific region, as well as a number of teams on standby in the United States. The elements in Europe also have a historical relationship with posts in Africa and it is possible that some mixture of these Marines is now forward deployed from North Africa to Indonesia. If the reaction to the U.S. government’s change in policy on Jerusalem proves to be too much for those teams to handle, the Marines also have dedicated crisis response elements for operations in Africa and the Middle East forward deployed in Rota, Spain and in Kuwait respectively. These Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Forces have MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors and KC-130 aerial tankers to help rush additional personnel across those regions in an emergency. Marines with the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Africa prepare to board an MV-22 Osprey during training in Spain., USMC The Marine team in Kuwait, which has also included at times AV-8B Harrier jump jets , F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets , and EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, has been heavily committed to the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, though. It is unclear whether or not they are available for this new contingency. In addition, after the Benghazi incident, the U.S. Army established rotating rapid response infantry companies for different global regions. These include the East Africa Response Force in Djibouti and another element forward deployed in Kuwait. On top of that, there are special operations forces positioned around the world that can quickly deploy to provide additional support if a crisis erupts. Commands can often call upon other permanently forward deployed and rotating ground forces to support contingency responses if absolutely necessary, as well. DoD U.S. Air Force aerial refueling tankers and transports , as well as U.S. Navy amphibious ships and other surface vessels are often prepositioned to help support these contingency deployments. Both services often have manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets on hand, as well, in order to keep commanders on the ground abreast of changing circumstances and general events outside the gates of an embassy or other facility, as well as rapidly developing threats. Various types of Air Force special operations aircraft that might take part in any response effort as they are often better suited to getting into harder to reach areas , especially if the situation has deteriorated beyond just intense protesting. By design, these units are trained to operate in remote locations with little direct support. US Army National Guardsmen and US Air Force personnel train to conduct contingency operations in Djibouti., CJTF-HOA If an evacuation of any of these sites became necessary, U.S. military personnel on the ground and in the air would be essential in moving American government officials and civilians to safety. These units would coordinate with the State Department’s own security personnel and its other assets, including its own Air Wing , which could provide additional helicopters or fixed wing aircraft . Private contractors working for U.S. intelligence agencies and other U.S. government organizations might end up in the mix, along with local security forces, as happened during the Benghazi incident. It remains to be seen exactly what the U.S. president’s policy decision will be and what form the subsequent reaction will look like. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “warned [Trump] of the dangerous consequences such a decision would have to the peace process and to the peace, security and stability of the region and of the world,” Nabil Abu Rudeina, his spokesperson, said according to Reuters . This is likely to be an understatement . Traditional Muslim American allies in and around the Middle East, including NATO member Turkey and key counter-terrorism partner Jordan , have already publicly voiced opposition to the plan. Jordan, which acts as custodian for Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem’s Old City has a particularly keen interest in avoid a unilateral move that puts the city inside Israel. A view of the Wailing Wall, a Jewish holy site in Jerusalem, with the Dome of the Rock, a mosque of great significant in Islam, which sits above., Kyodo via AP The decision could also create tensions with other important U.S. partners around the world, including non-Muslim countries in Europe who support a final and lasting peace settlement between Israel and Palestine. It is also almost certain that some of America’s biggest opponents on the world state, chiefly Russia and Iran , will seize on the decision in attempts to challenge American influence both in the Middle East and elsewhere. It is possible that Terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda and their global factions could decide to step up attacks on American troops, U.S. interests, and other targets linked to the United States around the world. “He’s going to continue having conversations with relevant stakeholders, but ultimately he’ll make what he thinks is the best decision for the United States,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Dec. 5, 2017. “The president, I would say, is pretty solid in his thinking at this point.” The reported prepositioning of the initial wave of U.S. military response forces, as well as potential plans to deploy more if necessary, would seem to suggest that Trump’s thinking is to go ahead with moving the Embassy to Jerusalem in spite of the obvious concerns.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 21, 2020",The Navy Is Changing Its Plans for its Dumbed-Down Zumwalts and Their Ammoless Guns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The future USS Michael Monsoor , set to become the U.S. Navy’s second stealthy Zumwalt -class destroyer , is underway for the first time for sea trials. The milestone comes as the service continues to reformulate the role of the ships , now saying they will be focused on attacking surface targets at sea, as well as on land, while the vessels’ future seems as uncertain as ever in the face of continuing budget shortfalls and personnel problems . The second Zumwalt -class ship, also known as DDG-1001, sailed down the Kennebec River in Maine, on its way to the Altantic Ocean from Bath Iron Works (BIW) shipyards, giving journalists and others on the shoreline ample opportunity to grab a peek and take photos of one America’s most advanced warships. The Navy expects to commission the USS Michael Monsoor in 2018. BIW laid down the hull of the third and final ship in the class, the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , in January 2017. “ Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) is currently on Builders Trials, testing the hull, mechanical and engineering components of the ship,” Bath Iron Works said in a statement, according to the Portland Press Herald . “While all these systems are tested pier-side, there is no substitute for the real world testing taking place in the Gulf of Maine.” Getting the second stealthy ship out to sea is an important achievement for both the Navy and BIW. The Zumwalt -class has been controversial to say the least and is the end result of a meandering set of often changing requirements and proposed ship concepts dating back to the 1990s. The class was originally supposed to consist of 32 ships in total and has shrunk to a planned purchase of just three, with each one having a price tag of $4 billion. That’s not counting another $10 billion in research and development costs, either. At the same time, though, the Navy has steadily hacked away at various requirements, stripping planned systems from the design, in no small part to try and control any further cost overruns and delays. Close-in protection, ballistic and air defense capabilities, and various other associated systems are no longer part of the base design, something The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway explained in detail in a past feature , leaving it with limited utility despite its size and cost. In September 2016, he wrote : “The various omissions in the Zumwalt ’s capability have resulted in a ship that is focused on chucking cruise missiles and sending GPS guided cannon shells dozens of miles inland. But if the Navy wants a stealth Tomahawk chucker, guess what? They already have four of them with far more vertical launch cells than the DDG-1000 has. These are the converted Ohio class nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs). In the coming years, Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarines with extended payload modules will take up this role as the four converted Ohio class SSGNs are retired. “Minus its 155mm guns, has the stripped-down, anti-air mission-less Zumwalt become a far more vulnerable above-water guided missile submarine? A stealthy anti-submarine, special operations, and land attack arsenal ship? If so, why not build more submarines instead? They would be far more survivable and can stay on station much longer than the Zumwalt .” To add insult to injury, in November 2016, the Navy admitted it had cancelled plans to buy the specialized and exorbitantly expensive Long-Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP), each of which would have cost some $800,000, for the Zumwalt ’s main guns without an immediate replacement shell in the works. This effectively left one of the ship’s key weapons as dead weight. There ships will also receive various additional systems in the form of add-on packages attached to the deckhouse and elsewhere, which can only impact the ship’s finely tuned, complex, and expensive stealth shape in a negative manner. The Portland Press Herald reported that, while she is officially in service, Zumwalt is still in the process of receiving unspecified weapons and critical mission systems at her homeport of San Diego. Now, struggling to find a job for the ships, the Navy says it wants to turn them effectively into floating arsenal ships full of stand-off weapons to strike at targets ashore and at sea. The future USS Michael Monsoor sits at Bath Iron Works in Maine during her christening ceremony in 2016., Joel Page/Portland Press Herald via AP On Dec. 4, 2017, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Ron Boxall, the service’s director for surface warfare, told USNI News that officials were rethinking the Zumwalt -class’ requirements in light of experiences with the much maligned Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and the new Guided Missile Frigate Replacement Program, or FFG(X) . The stories definitely having some similarities, with the Navy struggling to improve the capabilities of the chronically under-performing LCS ships, before deciding to curtail its purchases and pursue a new design, which you can read about in more detail here . “Let’s get this same type of team together and take DDG-1000, which has some of the most advanced capabilities of any ship we’ve ever produced, and at the same time look at some of the challenges we’ve had,” Boxall explained. “So looking at where we go with that [155mm] gun, how we can take advantage of what that ship is good at, and come up with a new set of requirements.” “Obviously, a lot of those are classified, but the good news is that we’re going to look at focusing that ship more on offensive surface strike,” he continued. “And so this ship was already designed to do some of that mission, but we were focused on the very clear requirement we wrote for this ship in 1995, and the world has changed quite a bit since then. And so we’re modifying the missions and where we are with it.” It’s not necessarily a bad idea, at least in principle. As we at The War Zone highlight routinely, developments in various, so-called “ anti-access/area denial ” systems, such as supersonic and hypersonic anti-ship missiles and progressively longer range integrated air defenses , pose an increasing threat to surface ships and any aircraft they might be carrying on board. Old concept art showing the Zumwalt shooting down incoming cruise missiles, a role the ship is no longer equipped to perform., USN But more realistically, this is just the cheapest and easiest way to find an useful operational niche for the ships to fill. Focusing the stealth destroyers on this particular mission set is almost just a matter of filling the ships’ vertical launch system cells with a mix of land-attack and future over-the-horizon anti-ship cruise missiles , and maybe even finding usable ammunition of some sort for its main guns, but that isn’t really even a show stopper. The Navy may not even have to split the Zumwalt’s 80 vertical launch system cells between two types of weapons as it proceeds with development of new versions of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) that have an anti-ship capability. At present, the cells are partially dedicated to highly localized air defense, stuffed with quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles . Those weapons could also offer a limited close-in defense against small swarming ships, as well. The guns would present a different challenge. Even with the now cancelled LRLAP round, which featured a combination of GPS and inertial navigation as the guidance method, these weapons would have have been mainly useful against static targets, not mobile ships on the high seas. Using existing Army guided artillery rounds, such as Excalibur , would have run into the same problem, but the range of each shell would suffer badly compared to the LRLAP. The Navy is working on a shell that can hit moving targets and do so in the increasingly likely event that an enemy is jamming GPS signals , but this ammunition is still in the research and development phase and it would require a forward deployed “third party{ asset to laser-designate the target. Work on an advanced electromagnetic railgun , which was one possible eventual replacement for the Zumwalt ’s 155mm guns, but it is still similarly not in a state where an operational weapon is viable. The USS Zumwalt in 2016., USN In high-threat scenarios, these newly refocused Zumwalt s would be best suited to operating ahead of a larger force, making use of networked data links for stand-off targeting information, but still under the outer edge of an air defense umbrella provided by other assets, such as the Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. They will undoubtedly leverage the Navy’s expanding Navy Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air, or NFIC-CA , for this surface strike role, something that it is almost certainly planning to do already. This ambitious networking plan focuses on providing common data links between ships, aircraft, drones, and any other relevant asset to rapidly pass targeting information back and forth seamlessly. With the system in place, a Zumwalt could potentially launch cruise missiles at land or naval targets at maximum standoff range and in its maximum stealth mode, using data from various external sources, life stealth aircraft and satellites. It could also pass control off of its launches cruise missiles to other assets operating nearer to the target area if necessary. With their own limited close-in defenses and degraded low observable design, the Zumwalts may still not be able to get close enough to take out more heavily defended targets ashore, though, including long-range radar sites. The Zumwalt in Norfolk in 2017., USN But there’s a real question about whether or not giving the three-ship Zumwalt -class this operational mission makes practical sense or not. Making the stealth destroyers the service’s premier means of striking at enemy surface vessels, as well as land targets, in denied areas ahead of a major naval task for might give the ships something to do, but there would be few of them to go around in an actual contingency or during normal patrols. Also, this role is better served by submarines, both guided missile SSGN and fast attack SSN types, although the Zumwalts bring some networking and flexibility advantages to the fray. But are these small advantages enough to justify this limited role for the $22B class? The fact that the service will stick the stealthy ships into Zumwalt Squadron One, rather than a unit that describes its function, such as a destroyer squadron, is another possible hint that it might still not know exactly what it wants to do with the ships. On top of that, the costs to deploy and operate the unique ships could be significant separate from any other considerations. The Navy would have to weigh those costs against a number of other, more pressing priorities, including just making sure the surface force can meet its most basic operational obligations . A string of embarrassing and deadly accidents earlier 2017 has exposed serious, systemic issues that will take years to correct, even with appropriate funding , stable budgets , and clear vision. In September 2017, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer and U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson made a shocking public disclosure during a hearing before Senate Armed Services Committee that the service was only able to meet 40 percent of the total demand for surface warships at any one time. The next month, details emerged about a worrying maintenance backlog that was keeping attack submarines pierside for months on end – more than two years in the case of the Los Angeles -class USS Boise – in some cases just waiting for routine work to begin. The sorry state of the Navy’s organic shipyards and subsequent increasing strain on private contractors only compounded these issues. In April 2016, the service had to inject $450 million into the Zumwalt program itself because of concerns about BIW’s performance and capacity . Works move Zumwalt ‘s stealthy deckhouse during the ship’s construction., USN Even if the Navy does deploy the Zumwalts primily in the surface strike capacity, it might not be for long as costs mount to operate the specialized stealth ships in this fairly limited role. It is still entirely possible that the Navy will see these challenges and ultimately decide to turn the Zumwalt ’s into special projects and research and development vessels , just as it has done with its three Seawolf -class submarines . Or even worse they will turn into testing ships, with the small and highly unique fleet slowly cannibalizing itself to keep one hull operational. In the meantime this mission shift seems like an attempt to forestall this from happening, at least for the time being. Without the will to invest in the ships to make them what they were once intended to be, this at least gives them a notional purpose for the time being. What’s most frustrating it that it’s impossible that the Navy wasn’t aware of these issues and this type of potential outcome as it rabidly stripped missions and capabilities from the the class during its development cycle, keeping the program roughly on track, but making it increasingly less relevant in the process. It was a conscious and avoidable decision as we have highlighted in great detail before , and now we will have to wait and see if these ships can win what will be a bloody fiscal battle to keep them in play.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 21, 2019",Israel Launches Flurry of Strikes in Syria as its Air War in the Country Turns to Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israeli aircraft have reportedly launched a new series of attacks in Syria focused on suburbs of the capital Damascus, just days after a similar strike, and details about all of them remain sketchy. What does seem clear is that Israel remains determined as ever to prevent Iran from gaining any firmer a foothold in Syria while also looking to expand its own diplomatic ties and work to isolate the regime in Tehran more broadly. On the night of Dec. 4-5, 2017, Israel reportedly struck targets in the Syrian cities of Yafour, Deiraj , and Jamraya , all in and around Damascus. Reports are still coming in as to type of weapons employed, the nature of potential targets, and the results of the strikes, but Israel had previously attacked Jamraya , home to a Syrian military base and suspected chemical weapons production site, twice in 2013 . Syrian state media outlet SANA reported that Israeli aircraft had fired six missiles and that the country’s air defenders had intercepted three of them, though there was no independent confirmation of those details. Separate reports suggested the attacks had destroyed the chemical weapons facility in Jamraya, as well as an S-200 surface-to-air missile position. These new reports follow an earlier strike overnight on Dec. 1-2, 2017, when at least five missiles hurtled toward the city of Al Kiswah, another suburb of Damascus situated some 10 miles to the south, according to SANA . In that incident, Syrian officials said Israeli forces had employed surface-to-surface weapons, while other reports said that the Israeli Air Force jets had launched cruise missiles while inside Lebanese air space . Syria said that the target was an ammunition depot belonging to the country’s 1st Division, while international media outlets said the attack leveled a base that experts believed to be Iranian-operated. It was unclear if there were any Iranians actually at the site at the time. As is commonly the case, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to confirm or deny that any of these strikes even occurred. However, “let me reiterate Israel’s policy. We will not allow a regime [Iran] hell bent on the annihilation of the Jewish state to acquire nuclear weapons,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in part of a taped address that authorities released on Dec. 2, 2017. “We will not allow that regime to entrench itself militarily in Syria, as it seeks to do, for the express purpose of eradicating our state.” The Israeli prime minister had taped the remarks on Nov. 30, 2017 and Israeli authorities said they would present the full speech as part of think tank Brookings’ annual Saban Forum in Washington, D.C., which occurred on Dec. 3, 2017. Earlier in November 2017, Netanyahu had insisted that Israel could not and would not allow Iran to establish a military presence near his country’s border, a sentiment other members of his cabinet have echoed recently . Though the release of the statement was not officially tied to the reported strike, it seems hard to believe the two events were unrelated. After the incident, experts and observers quickly obtained satellite imagery that appeared to show heavy damage to a suspected Iranian-run site in Al Kiswah. In November 2017, the private U.K.-based McKenzie Intelligence Services first released analysis suggesting the facilities were part of an expanding Iranian presence near Damascus. Based on satellite imagery from October 2017, the analysts identified several barracks and other buildings, as well as additional structures under construction. We don’t know whether the site was complete and occupied at the time of the reported attack in December 2017. It is possible that Iranians, Iranian-backed fighters including Hezbollah personnel, or a mixture of both were situated at the facilities at the time. The Times of Israel , citing Lebanon’s Al Mustaqbal television and Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya, reported that 12 members of Iran’s powerful paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which operators in Syria overly to train and advise Syrian and other local forces, had died in the attack. Syria claimed to have shot down two of the incoming missiles over Al Kiswah and an amateur video, widely available on social media, appeared to show one of them exploding in mid-air, but there has been no independent confirmation of the intercepts. Assad has threatened to retaliate against Israel over previous strikes and has attempted to intercept attacking aircraft during past attacks, though his forces have not been able to successfully shoot down any of them. It is possible that Israel could have decided to use ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles in this instance in light of Syria’s increasing attempts to knock down its aircraft . Israeli ground forces would be able to hit Al Kiswah from within the country by using the EXTRA GPS-guided artillery rockets , which have a range of more than 90 miles. Since at least 2016, the IDF has also reportedly been considering purchasing a short-range, semi-containerized tactical ballistic missile, such as Israel Military Industries’ Predator Hawk or Israel Aerospace Industries’ Long Range Artillery (LORA) system, both of which would have more than enough range to hit targets in Syria from within Israel. Israeli Dolphin -class submarines almost certainly have a submarine-launched cruise missile capability, but these are reportedly part of the country’s unacknowledged nuclear deterrent rather than tactical weapons. Still, employing air-launched stand-off cruise missiles while flying over Lebanon would have given Israeli aircraft a degree protection from Syria’s aging, if still threatening air defenses. There has been no evidence that more advanced Russian S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems , which are officially linked to the main Syrian air defense network, have engaged Israeli forces. None of these defenses were apparently enough to dissuade Israel from reportedly launching an earlier air strike against facilities linked to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Researchers Center, responsible for the country’s ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs, near Masyaf further north of Damascus in September 2017 . A test launch of IMI’s Predator Hawk., IMI Regardless of the weapons Israel used in the strike, and though it would be broadly in line with its earlier strikes in Syria, directly attacking Iranian forces would mark a significant escalation in the campaign. Since Syria descended into civil war in 2011, Israel has repeatedly launched punitive attacks into the country. The ostensible goal of this has largely been to prevent the transfer of significant amounts of advanced weaponry, including ballistic and anti-ship cruise missile technology, to the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah . Hezbollah has been fighting on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, establishing itself more fully inside the country.  Iran has been supporting both parties, as well as a number of other militias, as well as deploying its own forces to help defeat the anti-regime insurgency. Israel has steadily expanded its aerial campaign in Syria to include both regime or Iranian targets, with the September 2017 strike on the Syrian Scientific Studies and Researchers Center site already marking an important escalation in the size and scope of the operations. The main reason for this shift appears to be the success that Iranian forces and their allies have had in establishing a land route that would link Tehran with its Shia Muslim partners in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, which has incensed Israel. An Israeli F-16 during a training exercise., IAF As the threat of ISIS terrorists has waned in both Iraq and Syria, Iran and their regional partners have been able to consolidate these gains . Underscoring this increased Iranian influence and cooperation in the region, in August 2017, ImageSat International (iSi), another private satellite imagery and geospatial intelligence firm, published analysis of a reported ballistic missile site in Syria. Based on the imagery, iSi suggested the Iran was either helping Syria expand its own ballistic missile facilities or was setting up its own sites in the country as a way to disperse its own program and protect it from international scrutiny and attack, or both . Either way, both the Syrian government and Hezbollah had to the potential to benefit from the new developments. In the meantime, Russia, another of Assad’s principle allies, has made various attempts to broker a deal to either stop or at least slow Israeli strikes. Though Syrian forces and their partners have in principle agreed to respect a buffer zone along the border with Israel, Netanyahu’s government has indicated repeatedly indicated that this is still unacceptable. There have also been numerous sporadic clashes in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights region throughout the course of the Syrian civil war, though it has been unclear in many cases what particular party to that conflict has been responsible. In October 2017, Israeli tanks fired into Syria after a mortar round exploded on open ground near their position. An Israeli Merkava Mk 4 tank., Zachi Evenor via Wikimedia “We do not accept spillovers,” Netanyahu’s said according to an official statement at the time. “If they hit us we return fire – and it doesn’t take much time.” At the same time, Israel has been steadily seeking to grow its ties with both traditional allies and even past opponents over shared a shared interest in containing Iran. Whether or it was an air- or ground-launched strike, the attack on Al Kiswah came just weeks after the IDF hosted dozens of fighter jets from, officially seven countries, including the United States, France, and Germany, for an exercise called Blue Flag 2017 . It was the first time the latter two has taken part in the biennial drills, which began in 2013. A German Eurofighter Typhoon emerges from a hardened aircraft shelter at Uvda Air Force Base in Israel during Blue Flag 2017., USAF An eighth military, Jordan, apparently quietly sent its own F-16 fighters to join the event, too. The Hashemite Kingdom has a long-standing security relationship with the Israelis, even before the two signed a formal peace deal in 1994. Since then, the two have discreetly trained together on numerous occasions. In 2015, an Israeli Air Force KC-707 tanker helped refuel Jordanian Vipers as they made their way to the United States for one of the U.S. Air Force’s major Red Flag exercises , underscoring a growing level of cooperation. Jordan has also been an important, but quiet part of the American-led counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan , Iraq, Syria , and elsewhere , and has come out publicly against Iran’s expanding influence in the Middle East and beyond. A pair of diplomatic incidents earlier in 2017 threatened to upend Israeli-Jordanian relations. The Israelis briefly restricted access to part Jerusalem’s Old City that Jordan acts as the custodian of and an Israeli embassy guard in the Jordanian capital Amman killed two Jordanian citizens . The diplomatic wounds remain open , but both countries appear to be committed to maintaining their defense and security ties in the meantime. “There are some strategic problems that Iran is involved in in our area,” Jordan’s King Abdullah II told The Washington Post in an interview in April 2017. “But here, again, is an opportunity: bringing Israel and the Arabs closer together.” Israel seems to have recognized this itself and appears to be in the process of conducting significant outreach elsewhere in the Arab world, especially to Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. In November 2017, IDF Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot gave an unprecedented interview with Saudi online newspaper Elaph , in which he suggested Israel would be willing to share intelligence with the Kingdom regarding Iran. This was first time any senior Israeli military officer had given an interview to a Saudi media outlet of any kind, according to Israel’s Haaretz . Israel does not have diplomatic relations with the government in Riyadh, which itself does not official recognize the legitimacy of the Jewish state. IDF Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot, Sipa via AP There are reports that this could change as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman continues to oversee a historic purge of his political opponents and consolidate power in the country. Commonly known as MbS, experts see the royal heir as being the driving force behind new Saudi domestic and foreign policies, which heavily focus on containing Iran’s influence . He had previously been in charge of directing the country’s controversial intervention in Yemen , where, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are seeking to establish control. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have also been broadly supportive of closer cooperation between Israel and various Arab states to form a cohesive front against Iran. In October 2017, Trump announced his own new hard line policy toward the Iranian regime, designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization, seeking to redefine the controversial deal over Tehran’s nuclear developments, and calling America’s allies to join with the new push. Trump has also overseen increased sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia and other American partners in the Middle East, as well as the establishment of an official permanent U.S. military base in Israel, and is reportedly in talks to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The latter decision could potentially up-end the Israel-Palestinian peace process, as both parties claim the city as their exclusive capital, but would underscore the administration’s support for the Jewish state. However Israel’s diplomatic ties develop throughout the Middle East, it seems that the country’s government feels it either has increasing political leeway to expand its punitive actions in Syria or that it simply must act to prevent Iran from becoming anymore entrenched, or some combination of both. These strikes, whether they are from air or ground platforms, will almost certainly continue in the near term at least, and they look to be steadily expanding in both size and scope.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 9, 2019","F-22s, F-35s Join Hundreds of US and South Korean Jets in Drill as Fears of War Rise","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States and South Korea have kicked off a massive aerial exercise in and around the Korean Peninsula featuring hundreds of fighter jets , multi-role combat aircraft, and other supporting planes in yet another significant example of the two countries’ resolve to stand together following another major North Korean ballistic missile test . Not surprisingly, the Communist regime in Pyongyang has reacted with furor and it’s not clear if the drills will send an effective message amid confusing and conflict signals coming from President Donald Trump , his administration , and other senior American politicians. On Dec. 4, 2017, military aircraft the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, along with the South Korean Air Force, began flying mock missions from eight air bases in South Korea – Cheongju, Daegu,  Gwangju, Jungwon, Kunsan, Osan, Seosan, and Wonju. The event, nicknamed Vigilant Ace 2018, is the latest iteration of an annual exercise, but this is the first time six U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptor and six F-35A Joint Strike Fighter stealth fighters, as well as U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs , will take part. Those additions come after months of provocative North Korean ballistic missile tests, including the fearsome demonstration of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November 2017, as well as the country’s reportedly successful test of a thermonuclear weapon two months earlier. “The threat here on the peninsula is very real, and countering that threat needs to be in the forefront of our minds,” U.S. Air Force Colonel William Betts, head of the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan Air Base, told the service’s reporters. “My biggest expectation for the Wing is to remove any ‘exercise’ mindset from the equation and maximize the realism of every response. We will ensure we have no regrets if we find ourselves executing contingency operations.” A US Air Force F-22 takes off from Gwangju Air Base during Vigilant Ace 2018., Yonhap via AP Approximately 12,000 American personnel will take part in the exercise. In addition to the F-22s and F-35s, the U.S. Air Force says it will contribute F-16C/D Viper and F-15C Eagle fighter jets and A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft, while the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy will send F/A-18 Hornet or Super Hornet multi-role fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. South Korea’s F-15K Slam Eagles and KF-16 Vipers, along with is aging F-4E Phantom IIs , will join the mock air war. Aerial refueling tankers , E-3 Sentry airborne command and control planes, and various intelligence platforms are undoubtedly also part of the 230 total aircraft taking part in the drills. USAF F-16CMs taxi for departure with full combat load of live weapons. , DoD The U.S. Air Force says the event will focus on realistic scenarios centered on the kind of missions the two countries would have to fly together in order “to deter, and if necessary defeat, a rapidly evolving threat” on the Korean Peninsula. This could include practicing for coordinated, limited strikes against North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear weapons infrastructure or important regime targets, as part of a so-called “ decapitation strike .” Other training missions might focus on suppressing North Korea’s aging, but dense air defense networks and conventional artillery formations in support of such an operation in response to a surprise attack. Four of the six USAF F-35As at Kunsan Air Base for Vigilant Ace 2018 prepare to take off together., USAF Including the Air Force’s F-22s and F-35s in the exercise roster is particularly notable, since the aircraft would likely be an essential part of the opening waves of any pre-emptive strike. In particular, these jets, as well as would be key in neutralizing surface-to-air missile sites in order to pave the way for follow-on strikes by non-stealthy jets. Electronic warfare aircraft such as the EA-18G could help suppress enemy air defenders who escape the initial round of attacks and American and South Korean aircraft could use stand-off cruise missiles and other weapons to attack those sites while still staying as far away from the threat area as possible. After the Hwasong-15 launch, South Korea quickly made a demonstration of one of these capabilities by scrambling a KF-16 to drop an Israeli-made Spice 2000 glide bombs , which has a range of more than 35 miles, into the East Sea off the coast of the Korean Peninsula. A common feature on Israeli air-to-ground munitions , Spice uses uses a combination of electro-optical and GPS guidance, which gives the launching aircraft the ability to employ it at a stand-off range, but still directly control the weapon via a data link near the end of its flight, greatly increasing its accuracy. South Korea is also in the process of fielding the German-Swedish built Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. Of course, shows of force toward North Korea are hardly new and Marine F-35s have already taken part in a number of pre-planned and snap drills. Since January 2017, in light of North Korea’s provocations, the United States and South Korea both have launched an increasing number of such events in general, both in the air and on the ground , and have been surprisingly vocal about the various military options – including a nuclear strike – available to deter or destroy the regime in Pyongyang. This latest iteration of Vigilant Ace is well in line with this strategy. At the same time, as we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly , this has run the risk of simply fueling the North Korean propaganda machine and making the country’s premier Kim Jong-un more paranoid about his survival and that of his regime. Both sides undoubtedly know that a conflict would be disastrous for everyone involved, but there seems to be an increasing risk for miscalculation if the United States and North Korea in particular feel the other is inevitably heading toward a first strike. https://youtube.com/watch?v=g-ludwFGDaY North Korea consistently describes U.S.-South Korean drills as simply a prelude to a military invention. Kim himself has said that exercises and other shows of force have only vindicated his decision to develop and expand his country’s nuclear arsenal and delivery capabilities. The latest Vigilant Ace exercise has already begun to play out in typical fashion, unsurprisingly prompting a fierce response from North Korean authorities. In it, they underlined their consistent argument that the country’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles are essential to protecting it from the threat of an American-led attack. An A-10 Warthog prepared to take off from Kunsan Air Base during Vigilant Ace 2018., USAF “The Trump team is begging for nuclear war by staging an extremely dangerous nuclear gamble on the Korean peninsula,” a spokesperson for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement to the country’s tightly controlled state media. “The latest developments clearly prove once again that peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world can be maintained only when an effective balance of force is established between the DPRK and the U.S.” Officially, the United States presently remains committed to using diplomatic and economic pressure to coerce North Korea to abandon its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs and return to negotiations with the international community about the future of the Korean Peninsula. After the Hwasong-15 launch, Secretary of Defense James Mattis remained particularly adamant about this point. “I’m not willing to say that diplomacy has not worked,” he told reporters on Nov. 30, 2017, during a shared press conference with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Serraj at the Pentagon. “We will continue to work diplomatically.  We’ll continue to work through the United Nations – the United Nations Security Council and we will be unrelenting in that.” Secretary of Defense James Mattis speaks during a press conference in November 2017., Kalle Parkkinen/Newspix24/Sipa USA via AP “The world recognizes what a regional and global threat North Korea is, that North Korea presents,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said during her daily briefing on the same day. “So many countries in the world are on board with this campaign, on board with the maximum pressure campaign.” There had already been hope that this “maximum pressure” policy was paying off as North Korea had gone more than two months without test firing a ballistic missile prior to the Hwasong-15 launch. Joseph Yun, the U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea policy had said in October 2017 that if the reclusive regime went 60 days without a provocative test, it could signal a willingness to negotiate. A F-16CM loaded for the SEAD/Counter-air role with live ordnance taxis during Vigilant Ace.  , DoD This, of course, turned out not to be the case. Experts noted that the testing halt in North Korea was likely due a combination of domestic factors , including the need for the military to aid state-run collective farms with the harvest and the need for the troops to prepare for other, annual exercises, rather than any particular change in policy. And despite the statements coming from the Pentagon and the State Department, North Korea is almost certainly paying attention to what seems like an increasing sense of inevitability among U.S. government officials about a possible conflict on the Korean Peninsula. After the Hwasong-15 launch, President Donald Trump simply said “I will only tell you that we will take care of it.” Other senior officials have been increasingly suggesting that there is no way to deal with North Korea diplomatically. National Security Advisor U.S. Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who had insisted in August 2017 that Cold War-era deterrence concepts simply wouldn’t work against the regime in Pyongyang, made similar comments in an interview on Fox News on Dec. 3, 2017. “I don’t think you or anybody else is willing to bet the farm, or a U.S. city on the decision-making – rational decision-making of Kim Jong Un,” McMaster told Fox News’ Chris Wallace . “Its intentions are to use that weapon for nuclear blackmail, and then, to, quote, you know, ‘reunify’ the peninsula under the red banner.” DoD Lindsey Graham, a long-time Republic Senator from South Carolina, made even more striking comments that day. With increasingly little ambiguity, he suggested possibility of a violent confrontation might be far more realistic that many might think or hope. “We’re getting close to military conflict because North Korea is marching toward marrying up the technology of an ICBM with a nuclear weapon on top that can not only get to America, but deliver the weapon,” Graham told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Dec. 3, 2017. “So I want them [the Pentagon] to stop sending dependents and I think it’s now time to start moving American dependents out of South Korea.” South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham., Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP In his comments in October 2017, U.S. Special Envoy Yun made it clear that the United States has no formal line of communication with North Korea. As such, the regime in Pyongyang would have to rely heavily only these various public statements, plus anything it might get through back channels or espionage, in order to determine the U.S. government’s policy positions and plans. On the one hand, North Korean authorities hear policy prescriptions centered on a “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and shows of military force to deter it from any hostile actions. On the other, it sees well-connected American officials discussing a steady march toward war. They also see the United States preparing for the possibility of a North Korean nuclear strike on its own territory, which Kim and his regime would be almost certain to try in the event of a pre-emptive strike. Authorities in Hawaii have begun monthly tests of Cold War-era alert sirens to warn of an incoming attack and members of Congress are talking about plans to try and rapidly expand missile defenses. North Korean premier Kim Jong-un and other officials celebrate after the launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM., KCNA With all this in mind, it seems unlikely that exercises such as Vigilant Ace will give the North Koreans any additional pause in proceeding with their own plans. It may actually prompt them to demonstrate their own resolve and defiance in increasingly more provocative ways. We at The War Zone have already written in detail about the political and practical reasons why North Korea might go ahead with an unprecedented atmospheric nuclear test in order to prove its capabilities beyond a doubt. Some experts are now increasingly concerned that such a test might be in the works, especially as earthquakes continue to damage the North Korean nuclear site at , which has reportedly resulted in the release of deadly testing by-products . The increasing danger is that, in their respective drives to ensure the other side understands just how serious they are, the United States and North Korea may find themselves in a rhetorical trap where the only way forward is conflict.  Hopefully Vigilant Ace will actually get across a message of the need to de-escalate the situation rather than contributing to an air of inevitability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 29, 2018",The US Army Is Issuing Its New M17 Pistols to Many More Troops Than Its Predecessor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has finally begun to issue its new sidearm, the 9mm M17 pistol , also known as the Modular Handgun System, or MHS. In a significant departure from previous policies, the service will issue these weapons to many more troops, including the fire team leaders in infantry squads, who will “dual carry” the guns along with their standard M4 carbine . The 101st Airborne Division, the first unit to get the new guns , received 2,000 M17 and M18 pistols on Nov. 17, 2017 and began inspecting and test firing them on Nov. 27, 2017. The M18 is a compact member of the MHS family that the Army will issue to general officers and possibly individuals with a need to carry concealed . In January 2017, the service selected the two variants of the Sig Sauer P320 pistol as the winners of the MHS competition and it expects to purchase nearly 300,000 of them to replace older Beretta M9s. “It is easier to fire and simpler to operate,” U.S. Army Sergeant Matthew Marsh, a member of the 101st’s 1st Brigade Combat Team told Army reporters. “The pistol felt very natural in my hand. I am excited to take my experience back to my unit and share it with my soldiers.” It may also be faster to draw, thanks in part to a new holster from The Safariland Group that troops will get along with the guns, according to Military.com . The shooter can release the locking mechanism with just their thumb and offers a variety of ways soldiers can attach it to their gear. The Army may have to adopt another design soon given potential plans to buy a combination light and aiming laser to help soldier engage targets, particularly at night. “The last thing I want them to be able to have to do is draw a loaded weapon and put a light or a laser on it while it’s loaded under fire,” Daryl Eastlick, the deputy of the Lethality Branch at the Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Bragg, North Carolina told reporters on Dec. 1, 2017, Military.com reported . “Probably not the best idea, so we need a holster that will hold the weapon system that is enabled and already ready to use.” But the existing combination of the pistol and holster all make perfect sense, since one of the MHS program’s main objectives was to find a new sidearm that was more ergonomic and easier to operate that the older M9. When Sig Sauer beat out the last competing entry , from Glock , in January 2017, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway highlighted these and other important features of the underling P320 design, writing : “The Modular Handgun System sought to find one platform that could be adapted to a whole slew of missions, with different barrels, grip sizes, safety configurations, trigger groups, slide lengths, and even frame sizes, to be available under a common overall design. For instance, for a general issue sidearm, a standard length barrel, manual safety, combat trigger group and full sized frame could be provided and the user could customize the weapon’s grip to best fit their hand size. For special operations, a threaded barrel for mounting a suppressor, a double action trigger group with lighter trigger pull and no manual safety can be fitted, as well as raised tritium night sights and extended capacity magazine. For concealed carry, a subcompact frame version of the P320 with either trigger group and safety setup could be configured. The bottom line is that not only are main components interchangeable, as are some calibers—such as 9mm, 40S&W and 357Sig—but the manual of arms is universal. “One of the most notable features of the P320, and many of its MHS competitors, is that it’s a polymer framed pistol, which is a massive deviation from the steel and aluminum M9 and the all-steel 1911s that came before them. Polymer pistols have become the norm not the exception in the handgun industry over the last three decades, offering extreme durability, reduced maintenance, lower-cost and especially less weight than their metal-framed cousins. The P320 is also striker fired, and does not feature a traditional hammer.” After Sig Sauer won the MHS deal, the P320’s particular striker system came under scrutiny after reports that it could activate if the shooter dropped the pistol, causing an accidental discharge. Glock had already accused the Army of making its choice unfair and before all the testing was finished, a protest that the U.S. government dismissed . In August 2017, Sig Sauer announced a voluntary recall of commercial P320 pistols, but insisted that the M17s did not need the replacement parts. One of the 101st’s first M17s., US Army The entire episode had shades of the service’s controversial competition that settled on the M9 in the first place in 1986. Quality control issues with the initial Berettas led to the pistol’s slide breaking off on at least 14 occasions between 1985 and 1988 , leading to four injuries. In 2015, another soldier suffered a similar incident during a training exercise. The Army found that somehow that particular gun had escaped the mandatory upgrade program, outlined in an official Modification Work Order, or MWO, for some two decades. After that debacle, the Army, sometimes in concert with other services, tried and failed three times to pick a replacement sidearm. It has now succeeded on its fourth try with the M17. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps , and Navy are now considering whether to follow suit and adopt a new sidearm. An irate M9 from a public service announcement the Army released after one of the guns suffered a catastrophic failure in 2015., US Army And soldiers like Sergeant Marsh will definitely be sharing their experiences with more members of the Army than ever before. At present the, the Army generally issues M9 pistols on a very limited basis at the lower echelons of infantry units. One of the services typical light infantry companies has less than 10 of the guns spread out across more than 130 soldiers, the bulk being in the hands of individuals manning crew-served M240 machine guns as a backup weapon. Over the course of the MHS program, the Army experimented with doling out the pistols in a number of different ways. At one point, based on the experiences if special operations units such as the 75th Ranger Regiment , the service even considered giving every infantry soldier an M17, no matter what their rank is or role. Special operators across the U.S. military generally carry a sidearm in addition to their primary weapon. “We looked at dual arming the entire infantry particularly dismounted infantry soldiers, engineers, [and] scouts,” Eastlick, the deputy of the Lethality Branch at the Maneuver Center of Excellence told reporters. “What we concluded was the 75th Ranger Regiment – being the premiere infantry regiment in the world – they also have a different training regimen than the big Army infantry battalions do.” A member of the 101st test fires a new M17 in November 2017., US Army But the Army did find a distinct benefit to issuing pistols all the way down to the two team leaders in each of its infantry squads. The four-man fire team is the service’s smallest maneuver element, consisting of the leader, a grenadier carrying an M4 carbine with a 40mm grenade launcher , an automatic rifleman armed with a belt-fed M249 Squad Automatic Weapon , and a rifleman with another M4. “There is no real need for us to dual arm the basic rifleman, but having our team leaders armed with both the XM17 and the M4 allows them to better control their teams … where ever the fight takes them,” 1st Lieutenant Andrew Borer, from the 101st’s 1st Brigade, who spoke to reporters with Eastlick via conference call. “When I need to go into a confined space, negotiate some battlefield task where one of my hands is busy, I need something I can engage the enemy with one hand,” Eastlick added. With conventional forces continuing to deploy on so-called advise and assist missions, which have them close to the front lines of conflicts in places such as Iraq , Syria , and Afghanistan , among other hot spots, the Army may get to see how much this change actually impacts operations sooner rather than later. Earlier in 2017, the 101st had troops in Afghanistan , and in April, members of the division also made a brief deployment to Somalia to train members of that country’s national army. “It’s more useful to have a handgun on your side than a rifle trying to low crawl under tight quarters,” U.S. Army Corporal Jory Herrmann, a team leader in the 101st’s 1st Brigade, added by phone to the Dec. 1, 2017 roundtable with the press. “I think it is going to add a whole new dynamic to close quarters combat.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Here’s What You Need to Know About the US Military’s New Cluster Munition Policy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon says it is indefinitely delaying plans to stop using certain cluster munitions because it needs more time to develop adequate alternative weapons. The policy change exposes the difficulty the U.S. military has had in finding replacement bombs , rockets , and artillery shells that both meet its legitimate operational needs and take humanitarian concerns in account. On Nov. 30, 2017, Reuters was the first to obtain and report on a copy of the new memorandum. The new policy rescinds the previous requirement for all branches of the U.S. military to dispose of any cluster weapons in which the individual bomblets or grenades inside fail to function properly more than one percent of the time by Jan. 1, 2019. It also says that weapons that do not meet this one percent threshold, but have a system to disarm or self-destruct within 15 minutes, will now be acceptable, as well. Then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates first formalized the earlier plan under President George W. Bush in June 2008. Why cluster munitions? Cluster munitions are “legitimate weapons with clear military utility,” Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan wrote in the memo, according to Reuters. “Although the Department seeks to field a new generation of more highly reliable munitions, we cannot risk mission failure or accept the potential of increased military and civilian casualties by forfeiting the best available capabilities.” Under the most basic definition, cluster munitions are bombs, rockets, artillery shells, and other projectiles that, when fired, subsequently release a number of smaller weapons. These submunitions are most commonly high explosive charges or land mines, which are types covered by various international treaties including the Convention on Cluster Munitions , which we will return to in detail later on. In addition, there are numerous examples of special purpose clusters can consist of smoke generating chemicals to mark targets or hide friendly forces, bundles of metal filament or similar materials to confuse radars or knock out power transformers, flares, or even propaganda leaflets . In the past, the U.S. Army has even experimented with artillery rounds full of foul-smelling bomblets as a non-lethal weapon. These weapons are inherently best suited to attacking large, concentrated, and mobile enemy formations, especially if they appear suddenly and threaten to overwhelm smaller friendly positions. It’s also a more practical option for engaging hostile forces when they are on the move and their exact position Not surprisingly, the bulk of the U.S. military’s approximately 1.5 million forward deployed cluster munitions are in and around South Korea, according to The New York Times . There, an American force and its South Korean allies face the ever present prospect of hundreds of thousands of North Korean troops, backed by largely dated, but still threatening tanks and artillery , launching a sudden attack across the demilitarized zone . Those concerns have undoubtedly only become more pronounced in 2017 in light of North Korea’s dramatic ballistic missile and nuclear weapon developments , which it has coupled with a steady flow of bellicose rhetoric . The situation in Europe, where a revanchist Russia has been increasingly flexing its own military muscle , is also increasingly worrisome . It is unclear whether there have been any significant changes to the rest of the prescriptions Gates’ outlined in his 2008 memorandum. The previous policy required the top officers running the U.S. military’s five regional warfighting commands to sign off on requests to employ cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than one percent in any areas under their respective purview. If this remains the case, the head of U.S. Pacific Command would still need to authorize U.S. troops on Korean Peninsula to use many of the weapons during a crisis . A member of the US Air Force prepares to load a cluster bomb on an A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft in Korea during an exercise., USAF Cluster munitions are hardly perfect But despite their military utility, cluster munitions have always been far from perfect. Just due to their size, submunitions rely on small and often complex mechanical or electrical systems to function properly, components that also have to survive the shock of flying out of an artillery piece or falling from a fast-moving aircraft. The bomblets and grenades routinely fail. One U.S. Army study in 2000 found that Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions, or DPICM – submunitions inside artillery shells and rockets that both had shaped charges to break through armor and a fragmentation liner to kill troops in the open – wouldn’t work up to 14 percent of the time. These duds, still full of explosives and with fuzes that might still go off, become a threat to both friendly troops and innocent civilians, even years after a conflict ends. “This was a hard choice, not one the department made lightly,” Tom Crosson, a Pentagon spokesperson, told CNN on Nov. 30, 2017. “The new policy remains committed to the same end-state of the 2008 policy: acquiring safer and more reliable weapons that ensure both effectiveness on the battlefield and minimal risk of noncombatant and friendly casualties.” This has, so far, proven to be an elusive combination, which appears to be the key factor in the Pentagon’s decision to delay its plans to scrap many of its existing, potentially unreliable weapons. The U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and U.S. Navy have all been scrambling, amid budget cuts and caps, to find alternative options that either meet the new standards or attack the problem for an entirely different direction. Submunitions from a US Air Force Sensor Fuzed Munition cluster bomb explode over test targets during a training exercise., USAF Technical challenges The simplest and perhaps most obvious of these projects have focused on developing a single “unitary” warhead that creates the same effects across a wide area as a cluster munition. The Army has already begun purchasing 227mm artillery rockets with these so-called “ alternative warheads ,” that create an especially deadly cloud of shrapnel when they go off. The difficulty with these weapons has been producing a sufficiently multi-purpose and wide-area effect. The Army’s alternative warheads are also fine when attacking troops in the open or even behind cover, as well as unarmored trucks, but are of limited use against tanks and other armored vehicles. The GPS-guided rockets also focus their fire on a much tighter area than older cluster munitions, meaning artillery units would have to spend more time and fire more rounds in total to neutralize the same target sets. The Air Force has considered a similar solution for air-dropped weapons, known as the Cast Iron Ductile Bomb. In 2015, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway explained in detail how precision guidance and improvements in the transfer of information between a releasing aircraft, its sensors, and the weapon itself might help mitigate the loss of immediate, wide area effects. He wrote : “If the Cast Ductile Iron Bomb replacement for a traditional cluster bomb ends up having a smaller effective blast area then its counterparts, and if larger areas are needed to be attacked – say a spread-out formation of infantry moving across the battlefield – more weapons can be used to offset this handicap. With more accurate guidance then its WCMD counterpart and with proper integration into an aircraft’s targeting and mission computers, a pilot or weapon system officer could select an area they would like to “cover” and then assign proper coordinates and fusing information to multiple guided Cast Ductile Iron Bombs. Thus achieving a similar affect as a traditional cluster bomb, which is really just a dispenser for bomblets, without the cluster bomb’s political or moral baggage. “The basic Cast Ductile Iron Bomb would most likely be akin to a general purpose bomb body made out of iron and possibly scored for an evenly dispersed fragmentation upon detonation. There are multiple requests for this type of weapon being tendered by the DoD today, and there is even one for the Small Diameter Bomb which could give any combat aircraft a standoff area affects weapon. In the future, more elaborate designs could be put into service, including ones with a complex array of pre-separated individual projectiles and advanced fusing options.” Of course, none of this would change the fact that a single cluster bomb could cover more area at once and that cluster munitions would give the pilot the potential to attack more targets during a single sortie. Miniaturized, precision guided munitions could similarly alleviate some of these issues, allowing aircraft in particular to carry more of them at at time, but the smaller they get, the more they would invariably start looking like traditional submunitions. OrbitalATK’s Hatchet, a miniaturized precision guided bomb that might offer an alternative to cluster munitions., Joseph Trevithick “Smart” cluster munitions Many of the same issues apply to advanced, “smart” cluster munitions loaded with submuntions that use infrared sensors, radars, or other means to detect and home in on particular targets. The Swedish-designed Bonus and German-made SMArt155 , both 155mm artillery projectiles, each have just two sensor-fuzed bomblets. As part of a larger program , called the Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munition (C-DAEM), the Army is investigating, called Praxis , contains four similar payloads. A typical 155mm DPICM artillery shell has nearly 90 individual grenades. A notional concept of operations for employing the future Praxis shell., US Army The same goes for air-launched weapons. The Air Force’s CBU-105/B and CBU-115/B Sensor Fuzed Weapons, 1,000-pound class air-dropped cluster bombs, both have 10 individual BLU-108/B submunitions with infrared sensors, while older cluster bombs have hundreds of bomblets. You can read all about this particular weapon here . There’s also a cost factor with many of these “smart” air-dropped and artillery-fired cluster munitions. Multi-mode submunitions may be more reliable, but they’re also significantly more expensive. So, at the same time, there have been efforts to build more reliable versions of the existing submunitions or add in new capabilities to ensure the grenades or bomblets self-destruct if they fail to hit a target. The Navy is working on a High Reliability DPICM in which a single electrical current runs through all the grenades in an artillery shell, arming them all simultaneously and making the whole system more reliable, at least in theory. The Army has its own artillery shell effort, called DPICM-XL , which is seeking to craft an updated, self-contained system with multiple fuzing options and self-destruct timer. A GPS guidance kit would help keep the munitions limited to the intended target area. Both remain in the research and development phase. A notional concept of operations for employing the future DPICM-XL shell., US Army Humanitarian concerns Still, it’s hard to deny that there is a growing international push against cluster munitions in general. In addition to the dangers of unexploded ordnance, critics contend that the weapons are inherently indiscriminate and therefore illegal under international law for countries to use in many cases, as a military force would be unable to properly take steps to limit collateral damage and civilian casualties . In February 2008, dozens of countries agreed in principle to eliminate these weapons from their arsenals and by the end of the year, the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was ready signatures. At present, there are more than 100 signatories to the CCM, which prohibits parties from using, producing, or selling cluster munitions as the treaty defines them, or otherwise supporting those activities anywhere else. The Pentagon “[is] perpetuating use of an indiscriminate weapon that has been shown to have high failure rates,” Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who has long championed arms control and human rights issues, told Reuters after learning of the 2017 policy change. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who had joined Leahy in proposing a ban on funding for cluster munitions that did not meet the one percent requirement in April 2017, called the decision “unbelievable.” Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy, left, and Dianne Feinstein, confer during a hearing in 2016., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Secretary of Defense Gates’ 2008 policy memo was a clear attempt to find some sort of middle ground, though, for a country that has not signed or ratified the CCM. The result has, in many ways, been an oddly confused jumble of policies and political considerations. For one, it’s important to note that the CCM has substantial loopholes in its definitions of what is and isn’t a cluster munition. Systems that do not dispense high explosive submunitions or land mines aren’t subject to its provisions. Any projectile with less than 10 grenades or bomblets, each with a sensor to attack a particular target, a self-destruct feature, and weighing more than nine pounds, simply doesn’t count. This is why Germany and Sweden, who are both treaty members, are still building the SMArt155 and Bonus shells. There is no stipulation in the CCM about how reliable exempted submunitions have to be whatsoever. Its worth noting, again, that these would not necessarily meet the U.S. military’s requirements for a weapon to quickly and effectively engage large formations of enemy troops. Hard choices Rather than seek workarounds within those guidelines, the United States voluntarily offered up the extremely difficult proposition of meeting a one percent reliability goal. This has put the U.S. government in the uncomfortable and somewhat embarrassing position of having to walk back its own, self-imposed plan. In addition, under the 2008 policy, the U.S. military had only been able to transfer cluster weapons that did not meet the one percent threshold to foreign countries on the condition that they would not use them after Dec. 31, 2018. We don’t know if that policy has changed now, either. The United States had faced significant international criticism for sales of these munitions, especially with regards to Saudi Arabia , which has subsequently employed them over the course of their controversial intervention in Yemen . Observers on the ground used evidence from that conflict to challenge the U.S. military’s specific assertion that the Sensor Fuzed Munition in particular met the one percent goal, as well. A cut-away of a Sensor Fuzed Munition cluster bomb on display with one of the submunitions in front, at left., Texcoco via Wikimedia Responding to broad international pressure, President Barack Obama halted the sale of any additional cluster bombs to the Saudis temporarily in May 2016. The House of Representatives voted against a more formal legal restriction on those transfers in June 2017. And that political debate has been seeping into the industrial base, as well. In August 2016, Textron said it would halt production of the Sensor Fuzed Weapon entirely, citing reduced U.S. military demand and increasing difficulties in obtaining approval to export the bombs overseas. In its new 2017 cluster munitions policy, the Pentagon says that there are presently no weapons in production at present in the United States that meet the one percent reliability requirement. Alternative weapons could still be years away from being viable, but at the same time defense contractors are facing increasing pressure to refocus their efforts. Immediate purchases of domestically or foreign designed “smart” cluster munitions that are actually CCM compliant might still not meet the one percent reliability requirement, calling that entire end goal into question. Without these types of weapons, its equally hard to imagine the U.S. military not being at a disadvantage in any future, large scale conflict, including against near peer adversaries, such as Russia or China . The United States relies heavily on the firepower that cluster munitions offer to offset the significant manpower advantages that many potential opponents, including North Korea, could commit to a fight – though cliche, it is still true that sometimes quantity can have a quality all its own. How the United States chooses to proceed from here could easily prove both technically and politically complicated. At the same time, American commanders will continue to have a legitimate requirement for the kinds of effects that these weapons create.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","Well Within Range of North Korean Missiles, Hawaii Turns to Cold War Air Raid Sirens","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the same day North Korea test fired its Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which very likely has the ability to hit anywhere within the United States, state authorities in Hawaii announced plans to resume monthly tests of air raid sirens on the islands. The idea probably now seems even more reasonable and could portend something of a renaissance for the rest of the country’s crumbling civil defense infrastructure. Shortly before noon on December 1st, 2017, Hawaii’s Statewide Outdoor Warning Siren System will go off in a test that the state government will combine with a more typical one for the Emergency Alert System. The sirens will sound a steady “Attention Alert Signal” tone for one minute, followed by another minute of a wailing “Attack Warning Signal.” A number of areas near Campbell Industrial Park on the island of Oahu will then hear a separate “whooping” sound, which, in actual emergency, would indicate a hazardous materials incident. The Emergency Alert System test will then give residents the “all clear” on their radios and televisions. Further tests will occur every month. “There will be no exercise or drill on this day,” an official press release added about the December 2017 siren blasts, suggesting that there may be such events in the future. According to Reuters , this is the first time these Cold War-era sirens have gone off since the 1980s. A separate report by Atlas Obscura says that Hawaii stopped testing of the systems entirely in the mid-1990s. The video below features the sounds of wide array of different models of warning sirens and has examples of both the steady and wailing tones. In announcing the plan on Nov. 28, 2017, Hawaii Governor David Ige said that the tests reflected a “new normal” in light of North Korea’s dramatic ballistic missile developments since the beginning of the year. In July 2017, the North Koreans demonstrated their first ever intercontinental ballistic missile (IBCM), the Hwasong-14 , which experts estimated could reach Hawaii, Alaska, and California, at the very least . “A possibility of attack today is very remote,” Ige added. “But we do believe that it’s important that we be proactive, that we plan and are prepared for every possibility moving forward.” The U.S. military’s “Pacific Command would take about five minutes to characterize a launch, where the missile is going, which means the population would have about 15 minutes to take shelter,” Vern Miyagi, the administrator for Hawaii’s own Emergency Management Agency, said at the shared press conference. “It’s not much time at all, but it is enough time to give yourself a chance to survive.” You can watch the entire press conference regarding the siren tests by Governor Ige and the other Hawaii state officials below. This projection is based, at least in part, on the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency’s assessment that a single North Korean missile carrying one 150-kiloton nuclear warhead exploding over Pearl Harbor – a major military target that could be the actual focus of such a strike – would kill 18,000 people instantly and injure another 50,000 to 100,000 across a miles wide blast radius. However, this does not take into account the possibility of multiple, simultaneous or near simultaneous impacts, or that the Hwasong-15 looks like it could accommodate a much larger multi-megaton thermonuclear weapon or more than one smaller warhead. The HS-15 is truly a monster of a missile, and its broad and blunt nose cone could eventually carry multiple warheads and decoys, or one larger nuclear device., North Korean State Media It is possible that U.S. military could intercept some of these incoming missiles during an actual attack. Unfortunately, as we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly , the United States’ multi-part ballistic missile defense shield has yet to prove it can reliably take out incoming threats and has never had to go up against anything approaching a real world target . At a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee in September 2017, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford said that U.S. ballistic missile defenses could protect Hawaii . However, he made sure to add the caveat that his assessment was in regards to a “limited” IBCM attack and based on what the U.S. military then knew about North Korea’s capabilities. It is entirely possible his view of the situation has changed with the appearance of the Hwasong-15. The “chance to survive” would be subject a host of other fact, as well. Hawaii’s civil defense infrastructure itself has no kept up with the continued growth of the islands’ population, leaving entire neighborhoods lacking even the limited comfort of an officially designated fallout shelter, according to CNN . Hawaiian authorities have not announced any plans to expand these facilities or add new ones to go along with the reactivation of the sirens. Below is an old U.S. Civil Defense film about how to build your own family fallout shelter. The state’s predicament is likely no worse than the situation across the rest of the country, either. This underscores the issues that the United States as a whole might face if it decides to reintroduce large-scale civil defense measures in light of a the potential for a North Korean nuclear attack. After the end of the Cold War, as the threat of a nuclear conflict seemed to recede, federal, state, and local governments saw no need to maintain fallout shelters, bunkers, and other similar infrastructure. In 2006, the United States retired the old “Civil Defense” symbol and replaced it with a new “Emergency Management” logo for state and local emergency management organizations. In October 2017, Robert Blakeley, who created the official fallout shelter sign while serving with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, died at 95. The old Cold War-era “Civil Defense” logo., via Wikimedia The post-2006 Emergency Management logo., Covington County Emergency Management Robert Blakeley iconic “Fallout Shelter” sign design., Federal Highway Administration Even before the Soviet Union collapsed, authorities demolished or sold off hardened facilities as advances both in early warning technology and enemy weapons rendered them obsolete. Many Americans alive today still remember dubious “ duck and cover ” drills that were almost certainly more of a panacea than anything else. What money has gone into maintaining and modernizing such sites has focused largely on specialized facilities to shelter the president of the United States, their advisers, and other senior leaders in order to maintain a “continuity of government” in the event of a nuclear attack and preserve America’s ability to launch a potentially world-ending retaliatory strike. You can read about those plans in detail in The War Zone’s own extended chat with Garrett Graff, author Raven Rock: The U.S. Government’s Secret Plan To Save Itself While The Rest Of Us Die . You can watch one of the famous Cold War-era “Duck and Cover” public service announcements below. The lack of interest in maintaining these warning systems and shelters extends to air raid sirens, which officials in many cases have left to rot and rust away. The poor state of equipment is so widespread and well known that the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) official manual on “National Warning System Operations” doesn’t mince words in its instructions about how to operate the equipment. “FEMA recognizes that there has been a reduction in the number of active siren systems throughout the warning community,” the handbook states bluntly. “However, for those communities that still operate sirens as well as other systems, the following apply to warn the public to take immediate action.” The guide has sections detailing both the standardized attention and alert and attack warning signals that Hawaii will use in their upcoming test. In 1955, the United States government discontinued the use of a third “all clear signal.” Officials determined that nuclear fallout would make it dangerous for anyone to come out of their shelters even after the attack was over and instead recommended the use of a radio to receive further instructions. Even in cities with sirens still in place, they may be non-functional. After 9/11, many jurisdictions went to test these systems only to find out that they had fallen into disrepair, or worse. A badly weathered warning siren in Marshfield, Wisconsin in 2009., JustInn014 via Wikimedia “Since 9/11, a lot of cities are revisiting their old systems,” Ed Wise, an Atlanta-based funeral-home director with a side business selling and restoring sirens, told The Baltimore Sun in 2004. “A lot of times, they try to crank them up after 40 years and they just catch on fire.” Hawaii, which is often at risk of severe natural disasters, such as typhoons and tsunamis, appears to have maintained and upgraded much of its siren infrastructure, to help alert residents in those situations. There are readily available pictures of solar-powered siren towers on Oahu and elsewhere in the state. Depending on how the new, regular siren tests go in Hawaii, and if state officials end up adding in actual preparedness exercises or drills, other states could decide to follow suit and implement their own plans. With the Hwasong-15 out in the open, its no longer just the Hawaiian islands that are in range of North Korea’s missiles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 19, 2019",Jaded Thunder Exercise Trains Elite Troops to Call in Almost Any Sort of Fire Support,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this year, Marines aviators and their F/A-18C/D Hornets touched down at the unassuming Salina Regional Airport in Kansas, where they joined personnel from other branches of the U.S. military, the National Guard, and foreign troops for a two-week exercise known as Jaded Thunder. Less well publicized was that the secretive Joint Special Operations Command , or JSOC, runs the show, which is one of at least two domestic events – the other known as Bronze Ram – that focus on training to work closely with other special operations, conventional, and allies forces. In February 2017, JSOC held one of the most recent Jaded Thunder exercises in and around the Kansas Air National Guard’s Smoky Hill Weapons Range, part of the Great Plains Joint Training Center, situated near the town of Salina. Approximately 1,300 American and foreign military personnel took part, including the fliers from Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron Two Two Four, or VMFA(AW)-224 . The February iteration was “the largest and most successful Jaded Thunder exercise to date,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Tim Smith, commander of the Kansas Air National Guard’s 184th Regional Support Group, which manages the Smoky Hill Range, wrote in a blog post in March 2017. “The event is becoming more frequent due to its popularity with our warfighters as an effective training venue.” A draft document the command released in October 2017 on FedBizOpps , the federal government’s main contracting website, confirmed that JSOC not only takes part in, but runs both Jaded Thunder and Bronze Ram. There is virtually no other information readily available about the latter, beyond a pair of brief mentions on Facebook about one of the events that occurred at the U.S. Army’s National Training Center, situated in California’s Mojave Desert at Fort Irwin, in 2013. SOCOM However, from other publicly available information we know that Jaded Thunder serves as an opportunity for JSOC joint terminal air controllers, the individuals charged with calling in air strikes and other fire support, to practice with a variety of both special operations and conventional forces. It’s a live fire event that also gives the supporting personnel a chance to train as part of a large and complex force, similar to the kind they might find in an actual conflict zone, such as Afghanistan , Iraq, or Syria . Jaded Thunder has occurred routinely since at least 2011 and there are multiple iterations of the exercises each year, likely in part to rotate JSOC personnel through the courses before or after operational deployments. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) declined to provide any additional details, including the frequency of the exercises, where they occur, or how many personnel have generally taken part. One of VMFA(AW)-224’s F/A-18D Hornets at Salina Regional Airport during Jaded Thunder 2017, USN According to the Kansas National Guard , JSOC chose Salina as one of the venues in 2013 after automatic budget cuts in the 2011 Budget Control Act, a process known as sequestration, forced it to seek alternative training locations. Since then, Jaded Thunder events have continued in Kansas, but have also occurred at National Guard facilities in Florida . The special operators had made use some portion of the sprawling training space in and around Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada on at least one occasion in 2011. At the time, U.S. Air Force personnel gave a public briefing about the exercise to officials and citizens in the nearby city of Pahrump, which you can watch below. But the sheer diversity of assets that have supported Jaded Thunder in the past four years underscores Colonel Smith’s comments about the expanding popularity of the exercise and the event’s apparent importance. The full scope of special operations aircraft have taken part, including AC-130 gunships , from Air Force Special Operations Command and AH-6 Little Bird light attack helicopters from the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In addition to the attackers, specialized intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Air Force’s MC-12Ws and U-28As , have supported the exercises, according to annual reports from the Kansas National Guard. In the past , CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors have participated to fly ground teams around the fictional battlefields. Unspecified drones, which could include small tactical types, such as the Scan Eagle or RQ-21 Black Jack , or larger, armed examples, such the MQ-1C Gray Eagle and MQ-9 Reaper , have been involved in Jaded Thunder, as well. In 2013 and 2014 both, the pair of OV-10G+ Broncos , which the Navy borrowed from NASA and heavily modified as part of light attack aircraft experiment, flew missions during Jaded Thunder exercises. In 2015, the aircraft went to Iraq for a limited field trial where they hunted ISIS terrorists, which you can read about in more detail here. In June 2015, Gawker’s now defunct Phase Zero made a post on Twitter suggesting that Jaded Thunder has also included some of JSOC’s most shadowy elements, including its own internal aviation component, the Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AVTEG). This organization oversees covert “black” special operations units such as the Air Force’s 66th Air Operations Squadron and 427th Special Operations Squadron, which I wrote about in detail in a previous feature . Among other aircraft, observers have linked a number of modified CASA CN-235 surveillance aircraft to the 427th, which plane spotters often track using online software flying at various locations in the United States. We at The War Zone took an in depth look into these particular planes after one appeared in the skies near Seattle in August 2017 for a still mysterious training mission . There is substantial evidence that JSOC personnel, and private contractors supporting their operations, fly or have flown a variety of other discreet reconnaissance aircraft with civilian style paint schemes, including twin engine Beechcraft King Airs and four engine de Havilland DHC-7s . The special operations components are just a part of the aerial armada that takes part in Jaded Thunder, though. As already mentioned, Marine Corps units have regularly brought their F/A-18C/D Hornets to the exercise. Active and Reserve Air Force A-10 Warthog squadrons similarly make routine appearances and B-1 bombers have flown missions during the event at least once. The U.S. Navy, Marines, and Army National Guard in various states have sent various types of attack, scout, transport helicopters – including UH-60 Black Hawks and HH-60 Seahawks , OH-58D Kiowa Warriors , and AH-64 Apaches – to help shuttle personnel around and support the training events, too. During Jaded Thunder 14-2, the second iteration in 2014, participating aircraft of all types flew more than 230 sorties and JTACs on the ground were able to call in almost 550 mock support requests. And on the ground, Army artillery units have brought M109 155mm self-propelled howitzers on at least two occasions to provide a different kind of fire support. The Kansas National Guard says that Jaded Thunder 2013 was actually the first time ranges near Salina had hosted any live-fire artillery training since World War II. All of this makes perfect sense, of course. Though its activities are generally classified, JSOC relies heavily on conventional forces , including reservists and national guardsmen , to conduct its operations in the field. There are often simply not enough special operations assets to meet the demand for airlift and other transportation, as well as fire support, during regular and often short-notice missions. On top of that, special operations units do not include long-range artillery or the breadth of strike aircraft available in the conventional force, which is often the best option for attacking particular targets. It is essential that JSOC’s operators know how to work seamlessly with their conventional counterparts. A pair of US Army OH-58D Kiowa Warriors sit at Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida during a Jaded Thunder exercise in 2011., US Army In Iraq and Syria, this type of cooperation has already been particularly visible, with conventional howitzer and rocket artillery units deploying to remote forward locations to support local forces conducting missions in close coordination with American and other allied special operators. In 2015, The Washington Post reported that special operations forces in Afghanistan had been working closely with Army elements armed with the 227mm High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS , to conduct targeted strikes against particular terrorists. The truck-mounted launcher and its GPS-guided rockets, which have a range of more than 40 miles, has continually proven to be a valuable and easily deployable tool, something we at The War Zone have discussed numerous times in the past. During the 2013 and 2015 iterations of the Air Force Special Operations Command’s own capstone exercise, Emerald Warrior, an MC-130 special operations transport plane practiced dropping off a HIMARS launcher as part of a simulated raid. This illustrated the ability of both conventional and special operations elements to try and get the weapon into position quickly to respond to actionable intelligence about fleeting, time-sensitive targets, such as meetings between terrorist leaders. The U.S. military has recently begun to signal that the fighting in Iraq and Syria against ISIS is beginning to slow. On Nov. 30, 2017, Combined Joint Task Force-Operational Inherent Resolve, the main American task force leading the effort, announced that Marine artillery troops were on their way home from Syria after having supported the intense campaign to liberate the city of Raqqa. But at the same time, special operations-led activities in Afghanistan appear to be ramping up. There similarly expanding counter-terrorism campaigns in both Somalia and Yemen , among other places , too. As such, Jaded Thunder – and likely whatever the Bronze Ram training involves – looks set to continue to be an important component of JSOC’s training regimen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 11, 2019",The USAF Is Rebuilding World War II-Era 40mm Shells for its AC-130U Gunships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is rebuilding tens of thousands of World War II-era cannon rounds specifically for the 40mm cannons on its AC-130U Spooky II . Though the service has long been looking to finally retire this particular part of the gunship’s arsenal, which has increasingly become a logistical nightmare, the aging guns have so far proven too effective to get rid of completely. In November 2017, the U.S. Air Force revealed that the 780th Test Systems Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida had been testing the upgraded 40mm high explosive ammunition, known as the PGU-9D/B, earlier in the year. The new version combines decades old components with a fuze that is safer and more reliable than the original model. Some of the brass cartridge cases had production date stamps dating to 1944. In all, the service plans to rebuild approximately 80,000 older rounds into the new configuration. The 780th developed the process to modify the existing ammunition and build a number of prototype rounds, but it is unclear whether the unit, which handles various munitions testing duties, will perform the rest of the work or how long the process might take in total. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) controls all of the service’s AC-130 gunships, which include the Us, as well as newer AC-130W Stinger IIs and still in development AC-130J Ghostriders. The project does speak to the continued importance of both the AC-130U and its 40mm Bofors cannon. To give a sense of the demand for the aircraft, according to an official Air Force history , seven of the Spooky IIs assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron flew nearly 4,000 combat hours between November 2013 and June 2014. The planes and their crews spent more than 1,175 days deployed to conflict zones during that time. Members of the 780th Test Systems Squadron load a PGU-9D/B round into a test gun during testing., USAF In October 2017, members of the crew of one of the 4th’s AC-130Us, which had gone by the callsign Spooky 43, received Distinguished Flying Crosses and other medals for valor for one particularly intense mission over Afghanistan in 2016. The gunship beat back insurgents who had ambushed a team of U.S. Army Special Forces personnel from three sides, having to fire both 40mm shells and rounds from the aircraft’s larger 105mm howitzer dangerously close to friendly troops. At present, the Spooky II is the only system of any kind left in the U.S. military to use the weapon in any capacity. In addition to the PGU-9 rounds, gunners can fire high explosive-incendiary, armor-piercing shells, or a mixture of all three types, depending on the target set. An AC-130U Spooky II gunship., USAF The United States first adopted the Swedish-designed guns during World War II for anti-aircraft use at sea and on land. Chrysler built some 60,000 of them in the United States under license. The last of these air defense weapons were out of service at least by the end of the 1970s, if not earlier. However, in 1969, the Air Force had begun to acquire some of the weapons for an entirely different purpose . At that time, its AC-130A and AC-119K gunships were flying up and down the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos attempting to stem the flow of personnel, weapons, and other supplies from North Vietnam into South Vietnam. Despite the trail moniker, the North Vietnam military had turned many sections into a functional highway. Dense anti-aircraft defenses, including 37mm and 57mm guns, defended the route, quickly became a significant threat to the Air Force’s low and slow flying modified cargo aircraft. With a pair of 40mm cannons in place of two of the four 20mm Vulcan cannons on earlier versions, AC-130 crews could fly higher and further from enemy air defenses and still accurately hit trucks and personnel below. The new armament turned out to be so successful that the Air Force refitted the earlier A model gunships with more powerful guns and converted more powerful C-130Es to the same standard. The Air Force eventually replaced one of the 40mm Bofors with an even larger 105mm howitzer on later E versions, an armament configuration that became a feature on later AC-130H and AC-130U gunships. The service retired the last of the H variants in 2015, leaving just the U types with the older guns, which continue to fly combat missions in war zones such as Afghanistan. In 2007, the Air Force did experiment with replacing the Spooky II’s 40mm gun, as well as its 25mm GAU-12/U rotary barrel cannon, with a pair of 30mm weapons. Those tests did not produce the desired results, with the service complaining about a lack of accuracy, the aircraft returned to their original configuration the following year. The 30mm gun has become a standard weapon on the newer AC-130W and will be part of the AC-130J’s armament package, too. As we at The War Zone reported in October 2017 , there have continued to be issues with the accuracy and reliability of the weapon’s ammunition, though. At the same time, after more than seven decades of steady service and nearly 50 years as a gunship weapon, the Bofors cannons have only become more difficult to maintain. The Swedish firm, now a division of the U.K.-headquartered defense contractor BAE Systems, still builds 40mm guns, but the its more recent versions does not use the same ammunition as the older American variants. The bottom of one of the new PGU-9D/B rounds, showing the 1944 date stamp., USAF The older rounds are increasingly hard to come by, as evidenced by the Air Force’s project to rebuild existing surplus, but the issues go beyond just finding more ammunition to feed the Air Force’s needs. The cannon barrels, among other components, do not last forever, with heavy use wearing down the rifling and their basic structure, making them increasingly less accurate and even dangerous to use. By 2013, the Air Force was essentially having to custom order new barrels at a price of $1.3 million each . The year before, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) sent a team Greece to see about buying up a stockpile of old barrels that the NATO member had in storage after it retired the last of its versions in 2005. In the end, the service managed to pick up nearly 140 barrels and other rare parts on the cheap to keep its own weapons in working order, saving a total of $14 million in the process. Bill Walter, right, inspecting a 1950s production 40mm barrel still in its original packing crate in Greece in 2012. , USAF “I spent two days combing through several arsenals searching for 40 mm parts,” Bill Walter, then a program analyst at AFSOC’s Strike Requirements Branch, said at the time. “It was just like going into a museum. I just felt awestruck. It was like I stepped into another time, like stepping back 50 or 60 years.” This increasingly complicated situation may not be an issue for much longer. In 2015, the Air Force retired the first AC-130U . The service expects to continue sending members of the fleet to the boneyard through 2018 as it gets closer to achieving an initial operating capability with the new AC-130J. When the last Spooky II leaves service, it will mark the end of both the aircraft’s own impressive career and the final retirement of the Bofors cannon after what will be at least 75 years in service with the U.S. military.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 6, 2018",China Says It’s Building a “Ghost Imaging” Satellite to Detect Stealth Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Chinese scientists claim they are working towards building an advanced spy satellite that could use something of a physics trick to spot stealth planes from space. This complex “ghost imaging” camera is the latest in a string of reportedly “game changing” developments in China to counter low-observable aircraft , all of which have significant limitations and face serious developmental challenges. On Nov. 26, 2017, the South China Morning Post reported that scientists at multiple research institutions were working on a ghost imaging sensor that would work on a satellite. Gong Wenlin, the director of research at the Key Laboratory for Quantum Optics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, said he expected his team to build a prototype by 2020, test it in space by 2025, and have a finalized, operational design ready by 2030. “We have beat them [the United States] on the ground,” Gong boasted, noting that the U.S. military was working along similar lines . “We have confidence to beat them again in space.” The basic principles behind ghost imaging is well established and researchers around the world have been looking into the technique for more than two decades now. At its most basic, the concept is in many ways the reverse of a traditional camera, with a pair of sensors coupled with a computer algorithm working together to essentially look for what isn’t there rather than what is. The complete arrangement looks for subtle differences in the interaction between two distinct sets of photons, particles of light, that otherwise operate identically regardless of how far they are apart, a phenomenon called quantum entanglement . The video below offers a detailed, scientific explanation of how ghost imaging and quantum entanglement work. In a traditional camera, photons of light will bounce off an object, pass through the lens, and then land on either a strip of physical film or a digital sensor. In experimental ghost imaging cameras, there are two beams of laser light split from a single source emitting particles at the same speed, with one passing over an object before hitting a “bucket” that records the impact. The other beam goes to a regular camera. A computer program looks at both data sets, but only records only the photons that hit both the bucket and the camera at the same time, creating a silhouette or “ghost” of the object in question. One key goal of research into such a system for more widespread field use is to develop optical cameras that can see through clouds, smoke, dust, and other obscuring particles. This is a particular issue for electro-optical imaging satellites, where overcast skies and other environmental factors can easily blur or block the desired view. Presently, the alternatives include synthetic aperture radar and laser imaging, both of which can produce relatively detailed images at long ranges. These systems are both limited to producing still imagery. An “ghost image” of a toy soldier from a US Army test., US Army The same principle could, at least in theory, provide an option for monitoring the movements of stealth aircraft, even under the added cover of darkness, giving extra notice of potential attacks. But as simple as this might sound, turning this concept into a viable sensor is easier said than done. Putting the system on a satellite could impose significant limitations from the start. Many spy satellites by their very nature follow regular orbits and it can take a long to reposition them. This could result in significant expenditure or resources to build a broad constellation covering a wide area. But such a system is more likely to be placed in geostationary orbit, providing persistent coverage over a certain region of the globe. American surveillance satellites, including infrared missile warning systems like SBIRS , use a similar concept. Since a ghost imaging system still relies on optical cameras and light sources, it is possible that an opponent could try and blind or otherwise confuse the sensors with their own laser beams or other photon emitters. China itself has tested a number of anti-satellite ballistic missiles. These already include physical interceptors, but reports suggest that various countries, including Russia and the United States , are developing small autonomous mini-satellites that could either repair or destroy space-based assets. Electronic warfare and cyber attacks against any associated ground-based infrastructure, especially data links from the satellite to ground control stations and other communications nodes, could slow or halt the distribution of any ghost imagery. CNN’s War In Space special, which you can watch in full below, remains one of the better explainers available on the growing potential for conflict in that domain. https://youtube.com/watch?v=j-ZBLFhb_lg This in turn would delay the ability of command centers, air defense headquarters, or other elements to examine the information and initiate an appropriate response. And these are just the systems we know about . But perhaps most importantly, the underlying science remains largely theoretical. Xiong Jun, a professor of physics who studied quantum optics at Beijing Normal University, told the South China Morning Post that a space-based ghost imaging sensor relying on natural light would need to scan the entire target area in nanoseconds to create an accurate picture. If it used a laser as in typical laboratory setups, the system could need a substantial amount of power to make sure the beams of light could even reach the target area from orbit, he added. A B-2 bomber seen from almost directly above., USAF The same issues could apply to a ground-based system using similar physics principles. In September 2016, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) claimed it had developed a so-called counter-stealth “ quantum radar .” A traditional radar emits a beam of electromagnetic energy, which then bounces off the target, registering their position. A quantum radar does the same thing, but with streams of quantum entangled photons, which existing radar absorbent materials and low observable features would not be able to defeat. In theory, the light particles might even be able to record other aspects of the object, including the density of its component materials. Again, even Chinese researchers were skeptical about the practicality of such system outside of a laboratory environment. “[I have] not seen anything like this in an open report,” Ma Xiaosong, a physics professor at Nanjing University, told the South China Morning Post at the time. Though it would not be impossible to build such a system, Ma said basic physics issues could be difficult to scientists and engineers to overcome. The biggest issue is the tendency of photons to break free of their quantum entanglement at long distnace, another physics phonemenon known as “decoherence.” A B-2 bomber., USAF On top of that, fixed-position, land-based ghost imaging sensors and quantum radars would be a prime target during the opening salvos of an enemy attack. A time-sensitive strike using hypersonic weapons , another area of steady advancement both in China and elsewhere , or even more traditional stealthy cruise missiles could neutralize these defenses before they could come into play. Any ground-based system linked to a networked air defense system would be susceptible to electronic warfare and cyber attacks just like a satellite, too. And many of these same limitations apply to low frequency radars, which the Chinese , along with the Russians and the Iranians , have increasingly touted as anti-stealth tools. The large arrays have limited if any mobility and present largely static targets for stand-off attacks. The long wavelengths may be able to detect the presence of a stealth aircraft within a broad area, but would not necessarily be able to plot a particularly accurate position to make the information useful yet alone provide an engagement quality radar track of the target, either. China’s JY-27A, a low frequency radar it says can readily detect stealth aircraft., Imaginechina via AP Even with the low frequency modifications they made to their targeting radars, the Serbian air defenders who shot down an F-117 Nighthawk – a stealth design dating to the 1970s – over Serbia in 1999 only claimed they could detect the plane when its bomb bay doors opened. In addition, they insisted that they had intercepted communications transmissions that allowed them to position their surface-to-air missiles in the best possible locations to intercept the aircraft. The B-2 bomber, which Gong, the research director at Key Laboratory for Quantum Optics, told the South China Morning Post , would be a key target of the future ghost imaging system, has a stealth shape and low-observable features that Northrop Grumman devised in the 1980s. As the firm’s top secret B-21 Raider stealth bomber will undoubtedly incorporate new technological advances to reduce the aircraft’s radar, infrared, acoustic, and other signatures even more. Still, “the theory of ghost imaging has been well established and understood,” Xiong, the physics professor at Beijing Normal University, noted to the South China Morning Post . “The speed of application very much depends on the [Chinese] government and the amount of money it’s willing to spend.” But the U.S. Air Force expects to have the first operational B-21 unit ready by the mid-2020s. Gong says that even if everything goes according to his plan, China’s prototype ghost imaging satellite will still be in testing at that point.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",B-52s Are Dropping Hundreds of Dumb Bombs in Afghanistan to Literally Shape the Terrain,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military recently highlighted a series of air and artillery strikes against Taliban drug labs in Afghanistan as a visible indicator of Americaâ€™s new strategy to defeat insurgents and terrorists in the country and elsewhere in the region. At the same time, though, the U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and other aircraft has been conducting a less publicized and more grueling kind of air war to literally shape the terrain, blasting away mountain passes and potential cover to limit where and how militants can operate. Reporting from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Aviation Weekâ€™s Lara Seligman was the first to get a hint of these operations, noting that Air Force B-52s had flown â€œterrain denialâ€ missions over Afghanistan loaded with dozens of 500-pound class Mk 82 â€œdumb bombs.â€ But in an Email to The War Zone, an U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT) spokesperson explained that this part of the aerial campaign was far more widespread and complex, involving manned and unmanned aircraft and unguided and guided munitions. â€œArea denial missions can range from shaping enemy force maneuvers to denying key terrain to the enemy,â€ the public affairs officer said. â€œThese terrain denial strikes are useful in enabling freedom of maneuver for our forces, elimination of cover and concealment by enemy forces, an [sic; and] affecting enemy pattern of life in such a way that allows us to gain invaluable intelligence on their networks.â€ In short, the sorties are a deliberate and coordinated effort to strip away actual terrain features â€“ narrow mountainous paths, rock-topped ridgelines, and even buildings and other man-made structures â€“ that militants might use to move without being seen or ambush friendly troops on the ground in the future. It also attempts to funnel the insurgents and terrorists into particular areas or operating habits, which might make them easier to observe, isolate, and neutralize. B-52s bombers at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in June 2017., USAF The Talibanâ€™s use of hard cover has been a long-standing issue for American and other coalition troops in Afghanistan, as well as their Afghan allies. Recently, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps began purchasing hundreds of the Swedish-made Carl Gustav recoilless rifles specifically to give small infantry units more firepower against dug-in enemies. These operations are not new, either, and AFCENT has employed various aircraft in this role. According to the public affairs official, the very first of these missions in support of the U.S. militaryâ€™s Operation Freedomâ€™s Sentinel and the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission â€“ the names given to the refocused and officially non-combat Â advisory efforts in Afghanistan in December 2014 â€“ Â occurred in June 2016 and involved F-16C Viper multi-role fighter jets. Since then, F-16s, B-52s, and even MQ-9 Reaper drones, have flown terrain denial sorties. Though the unguided Mk 82 remains the weapon of choice for this task, aircraft have dropped a variety of laser- and GPS-guided munitions , as well. These include 500-pound class GBU-12/B Paveways, GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and GBU-54/B Laser JDAMs, and 2,000 pound class GBU-31/B JDAMs . An F-16C loaded with JDAMs at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. , USAF The B-52s with their cavernous bomb bays definitely have an outsized capability in this regard. Since July 2016, B-52s have flown more than 225 strikes over Afghanistan and dropped approximately 1,050 munitions of all types, including standard Mk 82s, during area denial missions specifically, according to AFCENT. Until November 2017, when the Conventional Rotary Launcher became available to deployed B-52s, the lumbering bombers at Al Udeid were not even able to carry precision guided weapons internally, limited instead to lugging a maximum of 18 of those munitions on external pylons . The revelation about area denial strikes thus helps explain earlier, conflicting reports about the BUFFs flying with as many as 30 bombs on individual sorties. This is, of course, hardly the first time the United States has employed these tactics. From World War II through Desert Storm, the U.S. military employed carpet bombing, in which aircraft, especially heavy bombers, dropped strings of unguided bombs across wide areas. During the Vietnam War, the American aircraft famously did this repeatedly over the Ho Chi Minh Trail that snaked from North Vietnam south through Laos. The United States also saturated the area with small landmines , irritating chemicals , and even a powder that was supposed to create permanent, made-made â€œmudâ€ to slow down enemy personnel and vehicles. More infamously, the U.S. military sprayed copious amounts of toxic herbicides , including a mixture called Agent Orange , to deny cover to insurgent forces. Early in the U.S. militaryâ€™s campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, B-52s famously flew similar missions to bombard enemy positions in a mountainous part of the country near the Pakistani border known as Tora Bora . That campaign ultimately failed to keep key leaders, such as Osama Bin Laden, from escaping into Pakistan. Â Itâ€™s not clear how effective these new sorties have actually been in stemming the Talibanâ€™s resurgence and the emergence of new threats, including ISISâ€™ Afghan franchise , ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K. It does beg the questions about the ability of Afghanistanâ€™s own military and their coalition allies to reliably exert authority in and provide security for large portions of the country. The situation was â€œabout the same as last year in terms of territory and population control,â€ U.S. Army General John Nicholson, head of American and coalition forces in Afghanistan told reporters on Nov. 20, 2017. â€œWe didn’t see the enemy attempt to take cities like they did previously.â€ Still, in October 2017, a complex Taliban attack nearly wiped out an Afghan military garrison in Kandahar Province. There have also been growing reports about the insurgent groupâ€™s elite elements using increasingly advanced equipment, including night vision goggles , to launch unsettling surprise attacks on government security forces even near larger population centers. It also calls into question just how limited American forces have actually been in their ability to conduct air strikes. Now, both Nicholson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis have publicly stated that before President Donald Trump and approved the easing of various rules and restrictions, U.S. aircraft could only fly missions against insurgents and terrorists who were in close proximity to American personnel. We donâ€™t know whether or not any of the area denial missions have been in direct support of nearby friendly forces on the ground, but AFCENT categorizes them as separate and distinct from close air support missions. â€œI need to say these new authorities give me the ability to go after the enemy in ways that I â€“ that I couldn’t before,â€ said during the November 2017 press conference, though he declined to elaborate. At the time of writing, the Resolute Support Mission public affairs had not responded to a request to clarify how these new authorities, which have been in place for less than three months, changed the situation. In addition, AFCENT spokesperson stressed that these new area denial missions shouldnâ€™t be considered carpet bombing and underlined the commandâ€™s stated objective of seeking to minimize collateral damage and avoid potential civilian casualties as much as possible in all of its operations. â€œFactoring in release angle, aircraft speed, winds and other variables, our aircrew are expertly trained to deliver unguided munitions in such a manner that they often hit a target with nearly the same degree of accuracy as a guided munition,â€ they explained. It is hard not to wonder whether these area denial efforts have contributed to a significant increase in reports of civilians being caught in the path of American air strikes in Afghanistan, though. This is especially true given that AFCENT had acknowledged that area denial missions include the practice of dropping bombs near inhabited buildings in order to chase people out before another strike flattens the structure. â€œWe may drop munitions near a structure to cause occupants or people nearby to flee,â€ the spokesperson for the command noted. This tactic is specifically â€œto avoid causing non-combatant casualties when we hit the structure in a follow on strike,â€ they added. That being said, this type of mission can only invite comparisons to Russia’s air war in Syria, which routinely involves Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers indiscriminately dropping strings of unguided bombs in and around populated centers. If nothing else, it suggests that the United States has adopted a far more aggressive tactics against the Taliban and other Afghan militant groups than it has previously acknowledged, which would be in line with other details emerging about the state of the fighting. ğŸ¤” pic.twitter.com/piILZL8lXs — Joseph Trevithick (@FranticGoat) November 7, 2017 Earlier in November 2017, The New York Times published one such deep investigation, questioning the U.S. militaryâ€™s process for investigating and accounting for potential civilian casualties in Afghanistan, but no mention was made of area denial missions in particular. This followed years of other reporting highlighted the limited resources the United States had available to accurately assess the impact of strikes, though. In October 2017, the United Nations had already reported that there had already been a 50 percent increase in civilian casualties from both Afghan and U.S. aerial attacks over the previous year. Then, in November 2017, U.N. officials said that 10 innocent bystanders had died in Kunduz Province, contradicting U.S. government claims that the strikes had not resulted in any collateral damage. A B-52 lands at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in 2016., USAF It is important to note that there is no evidence whatsoever that suggests that the U.S. military targets civilians or acts with reckless disregard for their safety in war zones such as Afghanistan. The U.S. militaryâ€™s efforts stand in stark contrast to those of the Russian and Syrian Air Forces in Syria or the Royal Saudi Air Force in Yemen , where there is considerable evidence to point to active and deliberate strikes on civilians and civil infrastructure. â€œThe Russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign [in Syria],â€ U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the American-led coalition fighting ISIS, said earlier in November 2017 after the Kremlin accused the United States of supporting the terrorists in Iraq and Syria. â€œI think that is a reason for them to start, you know, coming out with their latest barrage of lies.â€ But in conflicts such as the one in Afghanistan, perception can make or break the overall effort and errant bombs can give the enemy valuable propaganda victories. It can also give opponents elsewhere, such as the Russians, an opportunity to deflect attention from their own actions. As such, transparency is always paramount. As American involvement in Afghanistan intensifies yet again, and the air war expands anew, it seems likely that area denial operations will continue to be an important tool in containing the Taliban and other militants. At the same time, the U.S. military will have to be especially careful to ensure these and other air strikes are not doing more harm than good.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 16, 2019",Award Reveals USAF Rivet Joint Spied on Iranian Forces During 2016 Hostage Crisis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As 10 U.S. Navy sailors sat in the custody of Iran’s quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Farsi Island on the night of Jan. 12, 2016, they had no idea what to expect. By the next day, though, a U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signals intelligence plane was orbiting nearby, listening in on the Iranian’s communications and eventually making sure they followed through with the deal to free the Americans. The crew of that aircraft, which had the callsign Python 72, won the 2016 General Jerome O’Malley Award for the best reconnaissance crew in the United States Air Force. The independent Air Force Association gives out this honor each year and presented it to the crew during its main yearly convention in September 2017. The exact reason for the distinction remained obscure until the Omaha World-Herald obtained a copy of the official, unclassified nomination letter from U.S. Air Force Colonel George Reynolds, who had commanded the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska at the time. “This crew demonstrated superior airmanship and tenacity while conducting sustained combat support operations in support of coalition forces,” Reynolds explained in one utterly boilerplate description of the mission, according to the World-Herald . The officer made clear elsewhere in his letter, though, that Python 72’s sortie was anything but ordinary, even by the standards of an aircraft that spends its time quietly spying on enemy troops. Packed with various systems to spot, track, and record communications transmissions, the 17 Rivet Joints spend their time forward deployed around the world flying various patrols in both active conflict zones, including Iraq and Syria , and near potential opponents, such as North Korea . In 2016, another RC-135V/W crew from the 55th, which went by the callsign Python 71, won the O’Malley Award for a mission against ISIS in the Iraqi city of Fallujah the previous year. The Wing controls all of these aircraft, along with the three RC-135S Cobra Ball and two RC-135U Combat Sent aircraft, both of which are configured to gather other types of electronic intelligence. The events that led to the flight remain controversial. On Jan. 12, 2016, a pair of Riverine Command Boats (RCB) assigned to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet set out on a routine transit between Kuwait and Bahrain. During the trip, one of the craft broke down and drifted into Iranian territorial waters near Farsi Island, at which point IRGC forces surrounded the Americans and detained them. A subsequent U.S. Navy investigation uncovered a series of missteps on the part of the two crews both during their planned operation and when the Iranians intercepted them. The review also placed blame on leadership within Fifth Fleet for rushing ahead with the transit in spite of obvious risks from the outset. Lastly, the service faulted Iran for failing to respect international law and detaining the crew, despite their obvious lack of hostile intent. https://youtube.com/watch?v=c5VVXfJFj3c Critics of the response, including then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , accused President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, and the rest of the administration of taking a deferential stance toward Iran, not being more forceful in their response to the incident, and allowing the government in Tehran to humiliate the United States on the world stage. Kerry did obtain the release of the sailors after they had spent 15 hours in detention without concessions and the U.S. government denied issuing an official apology for the incident. However, the Navy’s review noted that after learning Iran had captured the sailors, the Commander of Fifth Fleet, then U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan, “directed a military response” in coordination with the Chief of Naval Operations, U.S. Central Command’s leadership, and the State Department. We now know this eventually included Python 72’s mission. At the time, the Rivet Joint was forward deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The Air Force had originally planned for the Rivet Joint to fly a mission over Afghanistan, where the crew would likely have been zeroing in on and monitoring communications from the Taliban and other militant and terrorist groups. An RC-135V/W Rivet Joint at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in July 2017., USAF On Jan. 13, 2016, though after getting word of the developing situation on Farsi Island, officials at the base requested permission to send the aircraft into the Persian Gulf instead. U.S. Central Command gave the green light and the RC-135V/W and its crew of 19 headed for the crisis area. On board were signals analysts and linguists who could find Iranian transmissions, listen in, and translate what they heard for any word of the captives. Though both the Air Force and the Navy routinely conduct surveillance missions against Iran while passing up and down the Persian Gulf in international waters – a boundary route one Air Force report referred to simply as “the black line” – getting close to Farsi Island called for an atypical orbit, Colonel Reynolds explained in his letter, the World-Herald reported. But the information the RC-135V/W was scooping up turned out to be invaluable. A grainy scan of an image showing “the black line” route along Iran’s coastline., USAF via FOIA Thanks to a suite of powerful data links, the Rivet Joint was sending new information and updates to the Pentagon’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency and the State Department in near real time. Secretary of State Kerry reportedly used some of the information to improve his negotiating position with the Iranians. More importantly, after Iran did agree to release the sailors, bad weather forced the IRGC to keep shifting the drop off location. U.S. officials were concerned that the changes were a stalling tactic or, even a worse, a ruse to lead them into a trap. Python 72’s linguists were able to determine that the Iranians were telling the truth about the situation, averting further conflicts. Even after the sailors were safe and sound, the RC-135V/W continued to orbit in the area, monitoring Iranian activities. Colonel Reynolds said the crew was able to gather an “unprecedented” amount of information on IRGC tactics and standard operating procedures during the operation, which could be invaluable in the future. An RC-135V/W Rivet Joint takes off from Al Udeid Air Base in October 2016., USAF As we at The War Zone described in detail before , American sailors routinely find themselves squaring off against Iranian ships, forced to make split second decisions that could cause a major international incident. In this case, thanks in no small part to the crew of Python 72, a potentially more serious confrontation never occurred. It’s quite possible that there are still more important details yet to emerge about this incident, as well. Thanks to one of our own Freedom of Information Act request, we at The War Zone know that a C-40A Clipper passenger plane from the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Five Eight (VR-58) criss-crossed ten countries between Jan. 22 and 24, 2016 in order to bring the crews of the two RCBs back to the United States. USN via FOIA That mission reportedly took 45 hours and covered 11 time zones in total. Vice Admiral Donegan included these details, but did not name any of the countries involved, and lauded the crew of this aircraft in an official letter dated Feb. 11, 2016, the bulk of which we have reproduced above. As time goes on, perhaps more details about the U.S. military’s response to this controversial incident will continue to emerge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2019",Armed UN Little Bird Helicopters Are a Big Deal for Peacekeepers in Mali,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nicknamed the Little Bird or Killer Egg, the fast and nimble MD500 series of helicopters has long proven its worth as a scout and light attack platform . Amid limited resources, a small team from El Salvador has been using the chopper’s capabilities to fly armed patrols, provide overwatch for forces on the ground, and even evacuate casualties in support of United Nations mission in the West African country of Mali, which has become one of the most deadly peacekeeping efforts in the world. Three MD500Es from the Air Force of El Salvador first touched down in the Malian city of Tumbuktu in May 2015, joining what is formally known as the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, or by its French acronym MINUSMA . The contingent represents nearly half of the country’s entire fleet of MD500Es and is one of its military’s most significant international deployments since taking part in coalition operations during the occupation of Iraq from August 2003 through January 2009. It is the first time Salvadorian forces have operated independently of any direct support from any other country as part of a U.N. operation. The Little Birds in Mali are armed with a combination of a 7.62mm Minigun and a seven-shot 2.75-inch rocket pod. This is an older configuration that came with the helicopters when El Salvador acquired them in the 1980s. Crews also have AR-15/M16-type carbines and M60 machine guns for self-defense. It is the same setup the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment used on its initial AH-6Cs in the 1980s. That unit subsequently acquired more powerful versions of the helicopter and transitioned to a multi-purpose weapons mount , or “plank,” fitted in the aircraft’s main cabin. It’s hard to overstate the importance of helicopters to MINUSMA’s operations as a whole. The Malian government has limited capacity to exert its authority across the country and outside population centers, terrorists, including those affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS, and organized crime groups can often operate with near impunity. Helicopters provide essential mobility to monitor the situation and critical support to counter militant attacks in a country with very limited road infrastructure. With their high speed and weaponry, the Little Birds are an ideal choice for racing ahead of convoys to spot ambushes and rushing to help beat back an attack already in progress. Forsvarsmakten Though in no way built for the role, MINUSMA has pressed the choppers into the casualty evacuation role, as well. Their ability to get peacekeepers back to base for urgent medical care has apparently outweighed the fact that the aviations have to strap the wounded troops to the side of the helicopter, according to an official blog of the Swedish Armed Forces, or Forsvarsmakten , which also has personnel in Mali. “The cooperation with El Salvador has initially been very successful for both parties,” the Forsvarsmakten explained in the August 2015 post. “Hopefully the small attack helicopters become a common feature in the air above Swedish patrols.” A member of El Salvador’s MINUSMA contingent pulls a 2.75-inch rocket from a protective tube before loading it onto an MD500E in Mali., MINUSMA Unfortunately, as obviously important as the Little Birds are to MINUSMA’s mission, they also highlight the mission’s chronic shortage of resources and international support, despite being the third largest international peacekeeping mission in the world at present. The United Nation’s kicked off the effort in 2013, taking over for French and African forces, the latter of which had been operating under a mandate from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional political and economic bloc. The two parties had intervened in Mali the year before, with American support , after an insurgency by ethnic Tuareg nomads and Islamists terrorists led to the collapse of the country’s government and the ouster of long-time president Amadou Toumani Touré. Those same groups continue to challenge the central authorities, and now an ISIS-linked group, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), has entered the mix. Experts and observers widely believe that ISGS was responsible for a deadly ambush on American troops in neighboring Niger in October 2017. Members of the Salvadorian contingent with MINUSMA clean their M60 machine guns at the UN base in Tumbuktu., MINUSMA With no true final settlement to the conflict, the mission has become increasingly dangerous for the more than 13,000 peacekeepers spread across the country. There have been more than 130 significant attacks on United Nations personnel since 2013, 30 of which have occurred just in 2017. Nearly 150 members of the international force have died and over 500 have gotten wounded over the course of the mission, with more than half of the fatalities being the result of enemy action, an unusually high tally for a mission that does not involve direct combat with a hostile actors. The situation has been hard even on developed countries who are contributing forces and equipment. In July 2017, a German Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter crashed while supporting MINUSMA forces, an accident that killed both pilots . Critics had already complained about the high maintenance requirements to operate those choppers in Mali’s challenging environment, including high heat, sand, and dust, all of which can cause serious wear and tear on both fixed and rotary wing aircraft. There are likely similar concerns the ability of the Salvadorian Little Birds to withstand the elements in the region, but we don’t know whether or not the environment in Mali has limited their availability. There have also been reports from Afghanistan describing serious operational issues with the more powerful 530F model in that country’s hot-and-high climate. A Salvadorian crew in Mali prepares for a night time mission., MINUSMA In 2016, the U.S. Army did announce it would be purchasing spare parts of the MD500Es to support El Salvador’s contribution to MINUSMA. It was not clear whether or not this was due to any unusually high maintenance requirements, though. “The [pre-deployment] instruction was focused on how work is done in the desert and a  survival course for crew members in case of accidents,” Colonel Juan Ricardo Palacios Garay, who acted as the chief of staff for the initial contingent bound for Mali, explained to Dialogo magazine in March 2015. “The maintenance specialists concentrated on what  preventive care the aircraft will need because of the sand, desert  elements, and the temperature.” However, we do know that the Little Birds lack an on board, turreted night vision or infrared camera, which can only limit their ability to patrol at night when militants are most active. At present, Salvadorian pilots do conduct night time missions, but only with night vision goggles. The aircraft also do not have any type of precision munitions, such as laser-guided 70mm rockets , which would increase their effectiveness against insurgents who often ride in pickup trucks armed with heavy machine guns or other weapons. Such a capability would be useful for accurately taking out mortars and rocket launchers that fighters use to bombard United Nations camps.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2018","Despite a String of False Reports, Time Is Running Out To Find Missing Argentine Sub","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a dozen ships and over a dozen more aircraft from ten different countries are still busily searching the South Atlantic off the coast of Argentina for any sign of the Argentine Navy’s Santa Cruz -class submarine ARA San Juan . A steady stream of possible leads, including possible satellite phone calls, unknown underwater sounds, a infrared “spot,” distress flares, and more, have provided only false hope and the boats 44 crew members are now likely on the verge of running out of air. Argentinean authorities last had contact with San Juan on Nov. 15, 2017. Since then, a growing armada of military and civilian rescuers, including warships, survey vessels, and specialized rescue ships, have been scouring the seas while submarine hunting and maritime patrol aircraft, as well as scientific research planes, have flown overhead. If the submarine has indeed become stranded underwater and has not been able to replenish its air supply, the sailors on board could begin to tragically suffocate to death as early as November 22nd, 2017. “This phase of search and rescue is critical,” Argentine Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Nov. 21, 2017, according to CNN . “This is why we are deploying all resources with high-tech sensors. We welcome the help we have received to find them.” An official infographic from Argentina’s Ministry of Defense detailing the search area and the multi-national force looking for ARA San Juan as of Nov. 20, 2017., Argentina MoD The U.S. military in particular has surged specialized support assets into the region. Since Nov. 19, 2017, U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy cargo aircraft have flown 26 sorties to the region and deployed approximately 830,000 pounds of equipment, as well as more than 80 passengers, including members of the U.S. Navy’s Undersea Rescue Command, Navy Times reported . The cargo has included unmanned underwater vehicles to help expand the area rescuers can search at any one time and the Submarine Rescue Chamber , which American personnel could use to rescue the trapped sailors and get them safely to the surface. The U.S. Navy underwater drone in question are the Bluefin-12D , a modular design that can carry various sensor packages, such as sonars and video cameras. These are similar to the Bluefin-21s that took part in the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 in the Pacific in 2014. On Nov. 22, 2017, the U.K. Royal Navy announced it had sent elite Submarine Parachute Assistance Group (SPAG) to Argentina, as well. The unit can be ready to deploy within six hours and is trained to make parachute jumps right into the water above a stricken submarine, along with small boats and other equipment, to recover and provide first aid to sailors escaping from below. A member of the Royal Navy’s SPAG jumps into the Bay of Gibraltar during a training exercise., Crown Copyright This is particularly notable, since the two countries fought a brief war in 1982 over control of the Falkland Islands , which the Argentinians refer to as the Malvinas. Though U.K. authorities continue to claim ownership of and administer the islands and their British inhabitants, the formal dispute persists to this day and continues to major source of diplomatic friction. The two have clearly been able to put aside their differences in light of the situation. Rough seas, cold weather, and a broad search area have already made the response effort more complicated. “The search area is two times the size of Buenos Aires,” the Argentine Navy spokesman Balbi said, referring to the country’s capital city , which occupies an area of approximately 78 square miles. There have been some glimmers of hope, but all have unfortunately turned out to be false alarms, so far. On Nov. 20, 2017, it became clear that earlier reports of unusual underwater noises and possible satellite phone calls were not from the San Juan . Then, on Nov. 21, 2017, the Argentine Navy tempered reports about the possible sighting of white distress flares by noting that the submarine would only have been carrying red and green ones. Ships and aircraft had previously spotted rafts and other debris and a U.S. Navy P-8 patrol plane detected a “heat stain,” but these potential leads similarly proved to have no link to the sub. The exact state of the San Juan also remains entirely unknown, though Argentinean authorities have denied initial reports that the submarine had suffered a fire . The boat’s captain had reported an apparent short circuit in the electrical system and a possible battery failure, before all communication stopped. Even without power, there are ways the crew may have been able to get more air, though. If the submarine has been able to maintain a position close enough to the surface it might be able to manually extend its snorkel and at least replenish the on board oxygen supply. “The seven days [until they run out of air] is not dogmatic,” Argentine Navy spokesman Balbi acknowledged, according to the Associated Press . “It varies according to the circumstances.” ARA San Juan and her sister ship ARA Santa Cruz at the Mar Del Plata Naval Base in 2007., Martín Otero via Wikimedia Still, a boat-wide loss of power might explain why the ship has not been able to activate any emergency transponders or other electronic signally equipment since it went missing. One would imagine that those types systems would have separate backup power supplies, though, raising the possibility of further break downs after San Juani left port. We have no way of knowing at this point, though, and the boat could have suffered one or more entirely accidental, but catastrophic failures. Argentina’s submarine force is small, with just three boats in total. The country’s economic crisis in the 1980s prompted the government to scrap plans to buy a total of six of the German-designed Santa Cruz -class submarines, also known as TR-1700s, even with the other four already in production . The Argentine Navy picked two of those apart for spare parts, while the other pair languished, half-finished. In 2010, the Argentine government conducted a study and found it would take approximately $60 million to finish the semi-complete Santa Fe , but does not appear to have acted on that proposal. But unless the San Juan ’s crew has been able to surface or put some portion of the boat above water, the window for a successful rescue is still closing. Experts have suggest that the submarine will almost certainly have run out of oxygen by the 10th day. The big question then will be how long to continue to look for the boat at all and how many countries, Argentina included, would be interested in expending the time and resources to continuing the search and to what degree. So, for now, the search continues. We will be sure to update this story or otherwise follow-up if, and when new information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019","Now in the Public Eye, American Troops in Niger Celebrate Thanksgiving","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A deadly ambush in Niger that resulted in the deaths of four American troops in October 2017 continues to fuel debate about whether American personnel there have adequate resources to perform their mission. One thing is clear, no matter how austere their bases might be , U.S. forces in the West African country will be celebrating the Thanksgiving Holiday as they would on almost any other deployment. In an Email to The War Zone, Samantha Reho, a spokesperson for U.S. Africa Command, confirmed that mess halls within the U.S. military facilities in the Nigerien capital Niamey and the more centrally located city of Agadez would serve a special Thanksgiving menu. It is unclear whether personnel at any of the half dozen other sites that host American forces in Niger would have similar options. At the time of writing, the U.S. Air Force had not responded to a separate request for similar information. “In any deployed environment across the globe, the respective Services section assigned to the location make holidays, like Thanksgiving, as special as they can to build morale and provide a bit of comfort from home,” Reho explained. “Additionally, U.S. troops have the option of participating in a Turkey Trot 5K and other recreational games during the day.” These services do not necessarily reflect the growing size and scope of U.S. military operations in Niger. American troops enjoyed the same comforts in 2016, with U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Richard Clark, the commander of the 17th Expeditionary Air Force, even helping serve Thanksgiving meals in Agadz during a stopover as part of a larger tour of various bases in Africa and Europe. US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Marlyce Roth, in hat, then the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron commander, serves Thanksgiving meals in Agadez in 2016., USAF Every year, the Defense Logistics Agency makes sure to distribute massive amounts of appropriate food items to American forces around the world. In 2015, DLA said it had shipped out nearly 34,800 pounds of turkey, 21,450 pounds of ham, and more than 9,000 pounds of stuffing mix, among other things, to help U.S. military units celebrate the holiday. At present, the United States has approximately 800 troops in the country, a little over 500 of them being members of the Air Force as of September 2017, according to official Pentagon statistics . That service’s 409th Air Expeditionary Group, and its subordinate units, oversees the bulk of day-to-day operations in both Niamey and Agadez. But U.S. personnel are probably grateful for an additional respite during their deployment to Niger, which has many of them in remote and potentially dangerous areas . This is particularly true for troops in Agadez, situated in the desert scrub of the Sahel, the transitional strip of the African continent that separates the Sahara and North Africa from the true sub-Saharan regions. Though attached to facilities associated with the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aerienne 201, which shares Manu Dayak International Airport’s single runway, the American camp is remote and looks foreboding. In September 2017, the U.S. Air Force released a timelapse video shot from inside a Humvee conducting a routine patrol around the site’s perimeter, which you can see below. Throughout most of the clip, the only light is from the truck’s headlights or those of other passing vehicles. Even in the main camp, there is little illumination. This offers a window into the challenges Staff Sergeant Brady Little and other personnel faces when trying to determine whether or not a speeding convoy of vehicles heading toward the base in April 2016 was hostile or just lost. The Air Force only publicly revealed this potential terrorist attack , which thankfully ended without incident, had occurred earlier in November 2017. In addition, Air Force Security Forces teams at the site have limited enough resources that they were apparently more than happy to enlist the help of members of the U.S. Army’s 411th Military Police Company, even if only temporarily, in September 2017. The soldiers were in Agadez as part of a separate training mission, but helped guard the camp before heading home to Fort Hood, Texas. Beyond that, there are simply a lot of environment challenges, “be it the 40 mile an hour winds that we’re kind of suffering through now, the 110 degree heat, or just the crushing rain that we get, which almost is worse that it is helpful,” U.S. Air Force Colonel John Meiter, head of the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron in Agadez, explained in an official video interview in April 2017. “Everything is much harder here. This marked the official first year anniversary of an American military presence in the city. Since at least 2015 , however, the United States has been working to build a new, larger facility in Agadez to support expanded operations. Notably, the base will eventually host unmanned aerial vehicles to fly surveillance missions over Libya, Mali, and other hotspots in the region. This work was supposed to be done by the end of 2017. Unfortunately, the weather and the difficulty of getting building materials and supplies to the site have pushed that date back until sometime in 2018 . In the meantime, U.S. Air Force drones continue to fly from the American base in Niamey. American personnel at the base will probably enjoy having a taste of home with the special meal, but the weather might make the Turkey Trot less of a “fun” run. A huge thanks from The War Zone to all our men and women in uniform serving away from home this Thanksgiving.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S.-led United Nations Command in South Korea has released dramatic video footage of a North Korean defector’s recent escape into South Korea. In a scene straight out of a Grand Theft Auto video game, the clips show the North Korean soldier as he desperately raced to cross the heavily patrolled border, pursued by loyal troops attempting to kill him and then images of South Korean military personnel crawling to rescue him. The incident occurred on Nov. 13, 2017 near the U.S.-South Korean at the Joint Security Area . The site in Panmunjom serves as a location for official meetings between North and South Korea where representatives from both sides enter from their respective sides of the demilitarized zone . It is also become a popular, if somewhat atypical tourist attraction on the front lines of the ongoing conflict. In the ensuing chaos, North Korean border guards shot at the the defector more than 40 times, with some of the bullets flying across into South Korea, and hit him at least five times. The escaping soldier collapsed into a pile of leaves and lay there until South Korean troops recovered him and evacuated him to Ajou University Hospital. Doctors performed a five hour operation that saved his life, but discovered a host of serious medical conditions, including chronic diseases and infestation of worms , and ultimately conducted a second surgery to fully stabilize him. He did not regain consciousness until Nov. 21, 2017. Life in the insular and notoriously repressive country has apparently made the individual fearful that he might not actually be safe even after making it into South Korea. Hospital staff have reportedly hung a South Korean flag in his room and have been making sure he has access to popular music and television , as well as actual psychotherapy. Now that he is awake and communicating, it is likely that more details about the circumstances of his defection and his life in North Korea will begin to emerge. Given the steadily increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, his escape and survival could prove to be especially significant. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 11, 2019",Japan Is Looking At Developing its Very Own Land Attack Capable Cruise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan is reportedly looking into developing its own stand-off cruise missile that aircraft, warships, and land-based launchers all might be fire at hostile targets both on land and at sea. The decision comes amid growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula , as North Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapon and missile capabilities , and a long-running dispute with China over ownership of a remote island chain in the East China Sea. On Nov. 20, 2017, The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the Japanese Ministry of Defense would research adding a land-attack capability to an unspecified existing anti-ship missile development programs. Research and development would start some time during the 2018 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2017, but the newspaper did not give a timeline for when the missile might be ready for tests or enter service. Yomiuri ’s report did not offer any other details about the weapon’s estimated range or capabilities, or whether it would be a clean sheet design or a derivative of a type already in development, but described it as a “Japanese Tomahawk” in reference to the American-made Tomhawk Land Attack Missile, or TLAM. The latest Block IV TLAMs have a range of approximately 1,000 miles and the manufacturer, Raytheon, is working with the U.S. Navy on an anti-ship subvariant . The existing Tomahawks can only attack static targets , but can receive instructions mid-flight to strike a different position. The Block IV missiles can loiter over a specific area, as well, and provide a limited view of the battlefield with their on board camera, before dropping onto the enemy. The future Maritime Strike Tomahawk version will have the ability to attack moving ships. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wluabEE1ls8 A Japanese missile with similar range and a combination of these features would give the Japan Self-Defense Forces an important boost in overall capability. In May 2017, there were reports that the country might be interested in just buying Tomahawk missiles from the United States to quickly field this type of weapon. However, a Tomahawk-like weapon would be far too large for any multi-role combat jet, such as Japan’s F-2 , to carry. At present, the only stand-off weapons the F-2s can carry are two types of anti-ship missiles, the ASM-1 and ASM-2 . The longer range ASM-2 can only engage targets approximately 100 miles away. The land-based Type 88 anti-ship missile and the ship-launched Type 90 version both have similar ranges. A Type 88 land-based anti-ship missile launcher., The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP The still-in-development supersonic XASM-3 , which will replace the existing air-launched weapons, will still have a maximum range of less than 125 miles. That being said, a new, multi-platform missile that could reach targets even four or five as far away, such as Lockheed Martin’s Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range ( JASSM-ER ), would give the country’s aircraft, warships, and ground forces more flexibility to respond quickly and accurately to regional crises. This class of weapon has significantly longer range over Japan’s existing missiles and would help any launch platform – aircraft, ships, or land-based launchers – avoid the threat of enemy defenses and counter-attacks. Another option could be to use an air-launched drone, similar to the Kratos XQ-222 , to carry existing weapons closer to the target. Since the late 1990s, Japan’s Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI), analogous to the U.S. military’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), has been experimenting with a small, turbofan-powered, multi-purpose drone from Fuji, commonly known by its Japanese acronym TACOM. Though it has been more commonly seen with a sensor package for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, it could possibly serve as the a basis for semi-reusable unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). It might even be a useful starting place for a more conventional cruise missile and the Japanese have already tested TACOM with an F-15J fighter jet acting as the launch platform. With a high speed or low-observable features, and networked with near-real time intelligence from forward-deployed radars and other sensor nodes, as well as possessing its own decision making ability and passive sensors, the final missile or drone design itself could be more survivable and better able to respond to fleeting, time sensitive targets. This latter point is particularly important with regards to the steadily escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In 2017 alone, North Korea has successfully test fired a number of new road-mobile ballistic missiles that can hit Japan and may be able to carry a miniaturized thermonuclear warhead or chemical weapons . In August 2017, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that the country would respond firmly after the North Koreans fired a ballistic missile over the country’s home island of Hokkaido. In September 2017, North Korea responded with a threat to nuke Japan and sink it into the ocean, saying it “is no longer needed to exist near us,” and fired another missile across the country. Japan has since taken part in a number of shows of force with U.S. military forces in the region. Its F-2 fighter jets have flown with U.S. Marine F-35B stealth fighters and U.S. Air Force B-1 bombers . More recently, earlier in November 2017, the Japanese helicopter carrier Ise sortied out to join a rare and massive U.S. Navy exercise involving three full carrier strike groups . The Japanese helicopter carrier Ise sails alongside a U.S. Navy Nimitz -class carrier during a massive exercise in November 2017., USN But with its present capabilities, if a conflict with North Korea were to break out , Japan would have to rely almost entirely on its allies for any actual strikes, especially before any initial strikes neutralized most of the country’s aging, but dense air defense network . With a cruise missile of their own, the Japan Self-Defense Forces would be better positioned to directly contribute to any such campaign or conduct strikes independently in the face of an imminent threat, most notably by hitting missiles while they are in their vulnerable launch position. The Japanese could integrate any new long range cruise missile with the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense architecture they are also planning to buy or look to buy Tomahawks for those sites as a supplement to its own development. A missile with a 500 to 600 mile range would still put these land-based launchers well within striking distance of targets in North Korea if they were situated in the country’s home islands and the weapons would offer a standing and visible deterrent. Any missile that could fit into the Aegis Ashore would also work with the Mk 41 vertical launch systems, found on many of Japan’s destroyers , too. At present, the country’s post-World War II constitution still limits how pro-active the Japanese government can be militarily, but that could be changing, as well. In 2014, Japan said Article 9 of the constitution, which prohibits offensive military action, would not apply to “collective self-defense,” or coming to the aid of an ally under attack. In May 2017, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for an extensive review and revision of the article no later than 2020 , ostensibly to make sure the law accurately reflect the state of affairs in East Asia and the world as a whole. China and South Korea, both of which suffered greatly under Japanese occupation during World War II, have long opposed any attempt by Japan to re-militarize. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in 2016., Kyodo News via AP But it appears that Japan increasingly feels it has little choice, not just because of North Korea, but because of increasing Chinese provocations in the East China Sea. Authorities in Toyko and Beijing have long disputed the ownership of a chain of uninhabited islands that the Japanese call Senkaku and the Chinese refer to as Diaoyu. In 2013, China announced the creation of a so-called “ Air Defense Identification Zone ” over the area, demanding that military and civilian aircraft passing through inform Chinese authorities of their flight plan and follow any instructions. The United States, Japan, and a number of other Asian countries have largely rejected China’s authority to set these rules or have said they will ignore them. Unfortunately, the islands are closer to mainland China than to Japan’s home islands. Japanese authorities have long been concerned that Chinese troops could rush into the area and land on the islands in an attempt to physically seize control before the country’s own military would have a chance to challenge the move. China has been steadily expanding their expeditionary naval capabilities, including, but not limited to new aircraft carriers , amphibious ships , and a number of large Zubr -class hovercrafts . The Zubrs could make it from the Chinese mainland to the Senkakus in just four hours without any support. The Chinese could decide to preposition them closer to the area ahead of an actual operation, though, and they have already conducted tests with one of the hovercrafts operating from the Donghaidao , a semi-submersible logistics vessel that could potentially function as a small sea base akin to the U.S. Navy’s much larger Mobile Landing Platform ships . As such, the new Japanese cruise missiles could provide an anti-access/area denial type capability, possibly forcing the Chinese to reconsider any of these military options to assert authority over the islands. Coupled with the aforementioned forward-deployed sensors nodes or aerial patrols, the Japan Self-Defense Forces would be able to not only better monitor China’s activities in the East China Sea, but present a deterrent to them, as well. In 2016, Japan positioned a mobile search radar on the nearby inhabited island of Yonaguni to improve its situational awareness in the area. There were also reports that year that the country was looking into developing a ballistic missile system to defend its territorial claims, though this could have been an error of some sort and instead been a reference to a desire for a stand-off cruise missile. Tit-for-tat air and naval patrols and shows of force between Japan and China both in and around the Senkaku islands and in East Asia more broadly have become increasingly routine. Just between April and June 2016, Japanese jets intercepted nearly 200 Chinese military aircraft in and around the island chain. In March 2017, the Japanese announced they would send the helicopter carrier Izumo on a three month patrol in the South China Sea , where China also claims large swaths of territory . Then, in July 2017, the Tianlangxing , a Chinese Type 815G spy ship, made a provocative trip through Tsugaru Strait, which runs between Japan’s home islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. Earlier in November 2017, Chinese H-6K bombers , as well as various electronic warfare and signals intelligence aircraft, made flights over the Miyako Strait , which separates Okinawa from the Miyako islands in the East China Sea. These Japanese-controlled islands are less than 150 miles southeast of the Senkakus. Japanese F-2s scrambled to intercept and monitor the Chinese aircraft. And with regards to these increasing security concerns both on the Korean Peninsula and in the East China Sea, a long-range cruise missile would offer a relatively cheap and simple means of giving the Japan Self-Defense Forces more flexibility. The basic technological requirements of such a system are well established and it is likely that the Japanese could still secure the aid of the United States in developing a relatively advanced indigenous design. “The prime minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should,” U.S. President Donald Trump said during a shared press conference with Prime Minister Abe in Tokyo during a state visit earlier in November 2017. “It’s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan.” The Japanese are already heavily involved in the development of Raytheon’s SM-3 ballistic missile interceptor . It is possible the company might just offer to co-develop an actual Japan-specific Tomahawk derivative with a domestic defense contractor to meets the country’s final, particular requirements. It seems clear, though, that one way or another, various elements of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces will have a new and pronounced stand-off capability sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 3, 2022","Bristling With Antennas, Russia’s A-100 Is Likely More Than Just A New Radar Plane","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first prototype Beriev A-100, set to be Russia’s newest airborne early warning and control aircraft, has made its first flight, with the Russian Air Force hoping to get the first examples by 2020. In addition to its prominent radar dome on top, antennas cover significant portions of the plane, suggesting that United Aircraft Corporation, or UAC, is moving ahead with reported plans to make the design a multi-purpose command and control, electronic warfare , and intelligence gathering platform. On Nov. 18, 2017, the initial A-100 prototype made its maiden flight from the Taganrog Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex (TANTK), situated near the Sea of Azov that sits between Russia and Ukraine. UAC used an existing Il-76MD-90A transport aircraft to create this “flying laboratory,” referred to specifically as the A-100LL , which will serve as test bed make sure the various antennas and fairings are aerodynamically sound and that the various radars and other systems work as intended.  The production versions will reportedly use new build Il-76MD-90A airframes, also known as the Il-476, and will replace Russian Air Force’s existing A-50M and A-50U Mainstay radar planes. “This is one of [the] priorities of the current arms procurement program,” Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov said of the aircraft in March 2017. In September 2016, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had boasted that the A-100 would be “superior to its foreign equivalents.” In an official press release , UAC said the A-100s would be able to detect both air and surface targets at long range and help direct fighter jets and strike aircraft to their targets in the air, on land, and at sea. In the past, Russian officials have said that the new design will be able to spot and track nearly any enemy, including low-flying cruise missiles and stealth aircraft. The A-100LL prototype., UAC We have no way of confirming these claims, but the new A-100s will definitely be a significant improvement over the older A-50 types. The most widely reported upgrade is the replacement of the old, mechanically-scanned with a new Vega Premier faster scanning active phased array radar (APAR). Vega Premier manually scans in azimuth, but electronically in elevation and gives the A-100 the ability to detect and track multiple targets at longer ranges and with greater precision. Russian officials say the system can spot aerial targets more than 370 miles away and warships nearly 250 miles from the aircraft, according to Jane’s 360 . https://youtube.com/watch?v=IykVfNOG2s8 Whether it has the ability to detect low-observable aircraft or not, the A-100 will still be another important component of Russia’s anti-access/area-denial arsenal as it offers an inherently flexible means of monitoring potentially contested air space, such as over the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea . The Russian Air Force’s existing A-50s have already gone to Syria to challenge the ability of aircraft belonging to the U.S.-backed coalition fighting ISIS to operate over that country with impunity. Linked together with fighter jets in the air and integrated air defenses on the ground, an A-100 might further improve their ability to defend against complex threats, including enemy stand-off attacks using low flying cruise missiles, such as the U.S. military’s Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile strike against Syria’s Shayrat Air Base in April 2017 . In 2015, the Russian Air Force said that four MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors had successfully knocked down a Kh-55 cruise missile during a test with the help of an A-50. In using the Il-76MD-90A as the starting point, the A-100s will be easier and cheaper to operate than the A-50s that used older Il-76 airframes, as well. The MD-90A variant has four PS-90 high-bypass turbofans, which make it more fuel efficient and give it more flying time, allowing it fly longer distances or loiter over a certain area of the battlefield for a longer amount of time. The latter capability is particularly important for an airborne earlier warning and control aircraft managing operations. It is possible that this updated aircraft will also offer better altitude performance, allowing for longer radar horizons. The A-100 will also have an aerial refueling capability, a feature already present on the A-50M and U models. On top of that, the new aircraft will have new avionics, mission systems, and work stations to help reduce the workload for the flight crew and systems operators. The standard Il-76MD-90A cargo plane already featured a “glass” cockpit with six large multi-function displays and other enhancements. But a closer examination of the A-100LL prototype shows a number of other striking features that the Russian Ministry of Defense and UAC have declined to highlight, notably antenna farms on the top of the forward fuselage, on the wheel well sponsons, and across the tail, as well as what appear to be satellite communications domes, some of which seem extraneous to an airborne early warning and control mission. Signals intelligence and radio relay and data-link i nformation fusion aircraft more commonly have this type of configuration and it could be that the A-100 will be able to perform a number of different roles. Even a tertiary electronic warfare mission isn’t implausible considering Russia’s focus on these tactics as of late. “The aircraft is also said to have advanced signal intelligence for greater independence and electronic warfare capabilities for protection,” Russian media outlet RT, which is nominally independent, but receives significant funding from the Kremlin, reported in August 2016 , citing unnamed sources. “An A-100 reportedly may be used as a fully-fledged flying HQ [headquarters] for the military.” Below are a series of cropped images of the A-100LL prototype focusing on the various antenna arrays. UAC UAC UAC A tactical airborne command center capable of rapidly passing large amounts of information back and forth between other aircraft and troops on the ground could increase Russia’s ability to deploy relatively quickly and support operations in places where it would otherwise have limited military communications infrastructure. And like the U.S. Air Force’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), an A-100 operating a central operational hub could just help speed up the flow of important information and extend the ranges at which various units could talk to each other and share vital data. This in turn would improve commanders’ overall understanding of the battlefield and how best to respond to what might be rapidly evolving situations. Having the A-100 able to take on this mission would be a boon to the Russian Air Force, which at present only has a handful of Il-80, Il-82 , and Tu-214 command post aircraft . In addition, these are existing planes are dedicated strategic communications assets, not tactical battlefield management aircraft available for routine, conventional military operations. The Il-80s and Tu-214SRs in particular are highly specialized “Doomsday” planes able to ferry the Russian president and his closest advisers around during a nuclear attack and are analogous to the U.S. Air Force’s VC-25A Air Force One and E-4B Nightwatch National Airborne Operations Centers (NAOC). One of Russia’s Il-80 “Doomsday” planes., Vitaly Kuzmin The Russian Air Force has a larger, but aging fleet of aerial electronic warfare and signals intelligence platforms, primarily consisting of a number of aging Soviet-era Il-20 and -22 Coots . As with the A-50s, these aircraft have already been flying over Syria , helping forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and Russian forces support him locate and engage rebel groups. Another variant of the Tu-214 was supposed to replace those older aircraft, but so far the Kremlin has been able to acquire just two of these Tu-214R. These planes are multi-intelligence platforms that reportedly carry signal snooping gear, imaging radars, and multi-spectral cameras. Underscoring their importance to Russian operations, in February 2016, the Russian Air Force reportedly deployed one in an apparent field test and returned it to the country later in the year after it officially entered service . One of the Russian Air Force’s new Tu-214R spy planes., Rimma Sadykova via Wikimedia After the A-100LL’s first flight, Russian Ministry of Defense’s internal Red Star newspaper also reported that there were plans to use the platform to control unmanned aerial vehicles. Since the Russian military relies on line-of-sight control for its unmanned aircraft, this could dramatically extend the range and scope of its drone operations. Russian troops have already made significant use of unmanned surveillance drones in Syria and Ukraine to spot targets, adjust artillery fire, and assess the aftermath of air, sea, and land-based artillery and missile strikes. With this capability, the A-100s could free these pilotless planes from the tether of control stations on the ground extend their reach further deeper into enemy controlled areas. It could also give commanders on the ground and in the air the option of adding drones into additional types of missions or open the door for more complex unmanned operations in the future. Again, adding even a limited electronic warfare or signals intelligence capability to the A-100 could add additional flexibility during limited deployments. With the ability to track, monitor, or even possibly jam enemy radars or communications nodes, just one of the planes could be a huge force multiplier. Another possibility is that the aircraft could use sharply focused beams of electromagnetic radiation from either the Vega Premier or a separate active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar system to disorient or even disable targeting radars, protecting the aircraft or a larger force package en route to a target area. The Russian military’s steadily increasing focus on electronic and cyber attacks and information warfare means that it is possible, if not probable, that the new aircraft could carry specialized equipment to block or spoof satellite navigation signals , launch cyber attacks , or pump out propaganda messages . As we at The War Zone have noted many times in the past, taken together, these capabilities could easily allow Russian forces to disrupt enemy military operations, sow confusion, or sap troops’ morale. When it comes to attacks on the GPS network specifically, this could impact not only a U.S. military force’s ability to navigate, but also their ability to feel confident in employing certain precision guided munitions . And though we don’t know this will be the case for sure, as already noted earlier, turning the A-100 into a multi-role platform with diverse capabilities would be well in line with Russia’s interest in new systems to readily deny opponents access to certain areas. It is also possible that the A-100LL could end up being a test bed for modular electronic warfare or signals intelligence packages that will fit on other Il-76 cargo aircraft. The Russian Air Force has more than 100 Il-76s in service and has already experimented with turning some of those aircraft into bombers . How effective a cargo plane carrying a few unguided bombs would actually be is debatable at best, but having the ability to quickly turn them into electronic attackers or intelligence platforms, in to a limited degree, could be significantly more useful. A member of the Russian Air Force attaches a P-50T practice bomb to a modified Il-76 transport during a test in 2015., Kirill Naumenko via Wikimedia The U.S. Air Force has already demonstrated how valuable such modular kits can be on the C-130 airlifter. For the Russian military, it would offer a distinctly low-cost way to add additional specialized aircraft in the face of shrinking defense budgets and competing priorities . As we at The War Zone have noted many times before, the Kremlin has repeatedly struggled to field a number of advanced military systems as a result of the country’s flagging economy and international sanctions in response to its active support of armed separatists in Ukraine. By combining a number of functions into the A-100 or using it to test more limited modifications for other aircraft, the Russian military might able to squeeze more value from the program overall. With all this in mind, and from the modifications already visible on the prototype conversion, it seems likely that the Vega Premier on top of the A-100 will only be one small part of the final design’s overall capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 28, 2018",The US Air Force Has Taken Another Step Toward Re-Engining its B-52s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force appears to be moving ahead with plans to finally replace the engines on its aging B-52H Stratofortresses on a one-for-one basis, which could give the iconic bombers extra time over the battlefield or additional overall range, all while cutting the costs to fly them per flight hour. Though the project could help the BUFFs remain relevant for decades to come, the service will still need to find the necessary funding and other resources as it struggles to keep other major modernization programs on track and deal with a worrisome shortage of pilots. According to an announcement Air Force Materiel Command posted on FedBizOpps , the federal government’s main contracting website, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s (AFLCMC) B-1 and B-52 Bomber Division will host meets with industry representatives at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma on Dec. 12 and 13, 2017. The notice stresses that this “industry day” is presently just for market research purposes, but that there is something of a formal plan specifically to buy “commercial” replacement engines. “The B-52 Re-engine program will replace current B-52 engines with new, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) engines for the entire 76-aircraft fleet ,” associated contracting documents explains. The Air Force’s present overarching plan is to award two separate contracts for the engines and the modifications necessary to attach them to the bombers’ wings. There is nothing in the existing contracting language prohibiting a single company from securing both deals. The service did not publicly release any firm performance or cost metrics along with the announcement, though contractors interested in the modification contract will have to supply a detailed cost assessment and potential technical risks in any proposal. However, in August 2017, Boeing released a promotional video outlying the benefits they felt the planes would get from a re-engine effort. An airmen poses for a picture inside one of the B-52’s engine nacelles before getting to work., USAF The Chicago-headquartered plane maker, which first built the B-52s more than five decades ago, suggested that BUFFs with new engines could be approximately 30 percent more fuel efficient, giving them some 40 percent more flying time, reducing the number of tankers necessary for each sortie, and essentially eliminate the need for costly overhauls. Though it’s hard to confirm these claims without knowing the exact metrics, we do know that the Air Force overhauls each TF33 every 6,000 flight hours as a rule, a process that costs $2 million per engine . This, on top of fuel costs and more routine maintenance issues for an engine that Pratt & Whitney first produced in 1959, is one major reason why it costs the service more than $70,000 per hour to fly the B-52, making it one of the most expensive aircraft for it to operate. The Air Force has also not made it clear how extensive it expects the modifications will have to be in the end, either. The initial “statement of objectives” does strongly imply that it is interested in a one-for-one replacement of each of the B-52H’s eight existing Pratt & Whitney TF33 rather than an entirely new configuration. At present, the Air Force wants potential engine makers to be ready to supply 20 engines at a firm, fixed price in order to modify just two BUFFs and their 16 combined powerplants. This would leave 4 in reserve in case of failures or other issues. Airmen work on one of the B-52H’s engine pods., USAF This could potentially offer cost saving benefits if the contractor in charge of modifying the aircraft keeps a significant amount of the plane’s existing architecture intact. The B-52s design has the eight engines in four pods, two under each wing. As we at The War Zone have noted many times in the past, the arrangement of the engines, the angle of the bomber’s wings, and other design features, have been a major impediment to previous attempts to re-engine the B-52. In January 2017, our own Tyler Rogoway wrote : “The last time the USAF researched what it would need out of an engine program was 2014, when it concluded that new powerplants would need to save between 10-25% in fuel consumption, and would have to go 15-25 years before the first deep overhauls of the engines are required. The question of which engine would best fit this requirement remains, as well as whether four large engines or eight smaller ones (even six, under some concepts) would be best. “One area of concern is if new pylons would be needed to accommodate powerplants mounted in new locations under the BUFF’s wings. Such a requirement could result in a costly re-engineering of the B-52’s wings. With four larger engines, such as GE’s CF6 (called the F138 on the C-5M) or engines similar in size to the Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (the F117, in use aboard the C-17A) wing height and rudder authority for engine-out operations remain a question. As as result, costly flight control and avionics upgrades might be needed to accommodate their use, beyond the need for potential structural upgrades to the B-52’s wings. “With this in mind, probably the easiest option is eight compact high-bypass turbofans fitted to the aircraft’s existing pylons in re-contoured dual-nacelle pods. The Rolls Royce BR725 powering the Gulfstream 650 is one contender, as is GE’s Passport 20 found on the Global Express 7000 and 8000. If the Air Force decides to push forward with an official RFP for an engine swap on the B-52, other entrants will surely emerge.” The Air Force’s proposed plan could still leave the door open for offers to simply rebuild or otherwise upgrade the TF33 engines. This is something that Pratt and Whitney has, unsurprisingly, suggested as a possible course of action in the past. Any company going that route would likely have to make its pitch based on an offer of extreme cost savings through minimal modifications to the bomber’s airframe over competing proposals involving more efficeitnt all-new engines, though. Regardless, these basic details point to the potential for a very lucrative deal for whatever company or combination of firms gets the final contract. A one-for-one replacement plan would involve the purchase of at least more than 600 engines just to upgrade each of the Air Force’s 76 B-52H bombers. This would not include spares – at least two per aircraft, or 152, based on the initial purchase plan of 20 engines for two aircraft – and other support services. US Air Force ground crew members wash the insides of a B-52H’s engine pod., USAF Contracting wise, the Air Force is still working how exactly it might proceed in the acquisition process, though. In the past, senior Air Force officials have suggested they could seek a more complicated, but cooperative public-private partnership with the contractors involved, whereby the company or companies would get paid later as extra funding becomes available from the reduced operating costs. This could enable the project to be effectively cost neutral, but would require a significant leap of faith on the part of the contractors who take part in the program. But the Air Force did not make any direct mention of this type of contracting process in its November 2017 announcement. At present, it says it is exploring three possible “courses of action.” The service could review proposals for the modifications at the same time as it reviews possible engines through either a one- or two-step procurement process. The other option would be to let the contractor making the changes to the B-52s just choose the motors that best suit its particular integration proposal. The latter process is notable in that it closely mirrors the controversial method the Air Force chose when it set about upgrading its EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft. Over the protests of a number of aircraft makers who felt they would not get a fair chance to pitch their particular planes, the service allowed L3 to pick the actual airframe that would carry the jamming equipment. However the Air Force proceeds, funding is likely to remain an issue. Any B-52 re-engine program will be competing with a host of other costly modernization efforts, including, but definitely not limited to continued development and testing of the service’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter , work on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber , continued delays with the KC-46A tanker , and new intercontinental ballistic missiles , and advanced nuclear-capable cruise missiles . Airmen move a TF33 engine., USAF On top of that, the service is still suffering from an unprecedented shortage of pilots . Most recently, it has begun offering expanded monetary incentives to try and retain aviators, with minimal success . What is clear is that the B-52s could greatly benefit from new engines and the costs to operate the TF33s will only keep increasing. Without something like the aforementioned public-private partnership deal, any re-engining could prove to be a costly affair, too. But if the Air Force realistically intends to continue flying the bombers through 2040, or beyond, it will need to find find a solution to the problem sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 7, 2019",US Threatens Its Own Treaty-Busting Missile Development in Response to Russian Violations,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government appears to be pushing ahead with plans to at least look into what it would take to build a new ballistic or cruise missile that would violate the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF. The ostensible goal of the program is to goad Russia back into compliance with the Cold War-era agreement, but it could simply reinforce the Kremlin’s argument that the deal has become increasingly irrelevant. On Nov. 17, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reporte that U.S. military had started researching a missile that would fit the parameters expressly  prohibited under the INF. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the treaty in 1989, which banned the possession of any land-based conventional or nuclear-capable missile of any kind that had a maximum range of between 310 and 3,420 miles. The United States is already of the view that Russia has violated the deal by deploying a new long-range cruise missile – known variously by its Russian nomenclature 9M729, the U.S. military designation SSC-8, and the NATO nickname Screwdriver – that experts believe has a range of more than 1,000 miles and maybe even more than 1,500 miles. A version of the existing road-mobile 9K720 Iskander transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) is the launch platform for the weapon. In February 2017, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed U.S. government officials, that the Kremlin had two full battalions armed with this weapon, one of which was an operational unit. The Russians swiftly denied the report . In developing a complementary system, “the idea here is we need to send a message to the Russians that they will pay a military price for violation of this treaty,” an unnamed U.S. government told The Wall Street Journal . “We are posturing ourselves to live in a post-INF world … if that is the world the Russians want.” The video below shows Russian troops reloading an Iskander-M TEL equipped to fire the older INF-compliant 9M728 cruise missiles. Before the INF came into force, both the United States and the Soviet Union operated a variety of missile systems within its range parameters. In complying with its terms, the U.S. Army eliminated its remaining Pershing Ia ballistic missiles in storage and its operational Pershing II systems. The U.S. Air Force scrapped the BGM-109G Gryphon Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) version of the iconic Tomahawk cruise missile . GAMAs at RAF Molesworth , England. 4 GAMAs, 1 per flight, each holding 16 missiles, total 64 missiles. Molesworth was completely reconstructed between 1981 and 1985, being transformed from a largely abandoned World War II Eighth Air Force B-17 base to a modern NATO facility., DoD Technically, it would likely require minimal effort for the U.S. military to develop, build, and field a new system that matches the basic capabilities of the Pershing II or Gryphon. These are well understood systems at their most basic level. At the same time, the United States is already in the process of developing new close-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), as well as air-launched cruise missiles , and related technology to make them more less vulnerable physical countermeasures and cyber attacks and more reliable overall. A US Air Force trailer-mounted GLCM launcher in operation prior to the signing of the INF., USAF One relatively easy course of action would be to simply have defense contractor Raytheon increase the range of the DeepStrike missile it is already developing for the U.S. Army for use in its tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and wheeled M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) launchers. This weapon will already have the maximum allowable range allowed under the INF and will replace the older Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Another possibility would be to either expand the U.S. Air Force’s Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) cruise missile program to include a ground-launched configuration or plan a parallel project to develop a land-based derivative. At present, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin are competing to build this weapon. LRSO’s specific range requirement is classified, but as an air-launched system it is already not subject to the INF. Raytheon The United States could also choose to research and develop a sufficiently long-range land-based missile and hold that information in reserve if it ever decided to abrogate the INF itself. It is the position of the U.S. government that simply studying the design for such a weapon or even conducting developmental work does not violate the treaty. Congress appears to be entirely on board with this plan. The most recent version of the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year includes $58 million in funds to both develop defensive countermeasures against the SSC-8, but also to establish a program of record for what it describes as an “INF Range Ground-Launched Missile System.” “The conferees note that the INF Treaty prohibits testing and deployment of ground-launched intermediate-range missile systems, but it does not prohibit research and development,” the conference report notes . “The conferees do not intend for the United States to enter into a violation of the INF Treaty so long as the treaty remains in force, and nothing in this provision should be construed to force the United States into a violation of the treaty.” But therein lies one of, if not the central issues at play. For more than a decade now, Russia has made it abundantly clear that it no longer feels the missile treaty serves its interests and has in many ways already suggested that it is living in a “post-INF world.” The Iskander TEL is modular and can carry 9M728 cruise missiles, left, or 9M723 short-range ballistic missiles, right., Russian MoD In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin openly questioned the future of the treaty and said his country would pull out of the deal if the United States went ahead with plans to install Ground-based Mid-course Defense (GMD) ballistic missile interceptors in Europe. The U.S. government changed course and adopted a plan to deploy sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and land-based Aegis Ashore systems instead. At the same time, though, the Kremlin had noted that other countries were not restricted by the INF and the treaty’s existence had not slowed world-wide proliferation of missiles that fit its range requirements. The only other party to eliminate part of their arsenal after the arrangement came into force was Germany, which destroyed its Pershing 1a missiles voluntarily in 1991. This was a relatively easy decision on their part, as the United States was no longer positioned to help support and maintain these weapons and with the reunification of East and West Germany and end of the Cold War, there appeared to be little need for the missiles anyways. The rest of the world has apparently taken a different view. The list of countries that have or are working on weapons that would be banned under the INF is long and includes, but is not limited to China , India , Iran , Israel , North Korea , Pakistan , and South Korea . In a particularly odd juxtaposition, earlier in 2017, the U.S. government offered to help its South Korean counterparts develop new longer-range ballistic missiles that American forces would themselves be unable to employ. On top of that, Russian authorities have long criticized the eastward expansion of NATO to include numerous former Soviet Republics and countries that were once part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Also in 2007, Russian Vladimir Putin announced that his country had put a “ moratorium ” on its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, or CFE, which limited the number of troops the Kremlin could position directly along its western borders . In 2015, Putin’s government announced it had completely abandoned the arrangement . This followed Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region the year before and coincided with increasingly active support for a separatist insurgency in that country’s eastern Donbass region. Putin subsequently adopted an overarching military doctrine that labeled the United States and NATO as threats. More recently, the United States has begun to accuse Russia of abusing the terms of the Open Skies Treaty , which allows member states to fly limited surveillance missions with prior notice over each others’ territory. The principle is that by allowing foreign countries to observe one’s peacetime military movements and strategic posture, they are less likely to fear that a sneak attack could be in progress, helping to promote stability. Under the agreement, signatories are limited to relatively low-fidelity cameras since the missions are for monitoring, not intelligence gathering purposes. Russia has especially irked the United States by making formal requests to upgrade the sensor packages on its Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft. Critics of the plan had called for curtailing or ending the deal on the grounds that the Russians are exploiting the goodwill inherent in the deal. The Kremlin denies it is doing anything besides upgrading obsolete equipment and advocates for the treaty say that the United States could easily follow suit and increase its own overflights of Russian territory. Russia’s controversial Tu-214ON Open Skies observation aircraft. , Oleg Belyakov via Wikimedia Beyond the camera issue, Russia has outright violated Open Skies basic tenants by restricting flights over its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea. As with INF, the United States similarly chose to attempt to coerce the Kremlin into complying with Open Skies by announcing its own restrictions on Russian observation sorties over Washington, D.C. and parts of Alaska in September 2017 . The latter are is likely to be more important to the Russians, since it is home to GMD ballistic missile defense interceptors at Fort Greely, which they see as a threat to their nuclear deterrent. It is into this world that Russia has deployed the SSC-8, which fits with a broad “ anti-access/area denial ” strategy of attempting to limit its opponents’ ability to challenge its revanchist foreign policy moves, especially in Europe. Though some have questioned why the Russian military would even need an INF-breaking weapon given its significant ICBM and air-launched cruise missile capabilities, relatively cheap, road-mobile systems offer greater flexibility and might, in some ways, present a more immediate threat. In February, amid reports that SSC-8 had become operational, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway wrote : “Russia, which has become an adept player at using their easily deployed missile systems— namely their S-400 air defense system , Iskander short-range ballistic missile system , and Bastion coastal defense system —as strategic “anti-access/area denial chess pieces in Syria , Crimea and in Europe. Yet all these systems have a range of less than 300 miles, treaty defined or not, giving them formidable but still limited reach. “If the SSC-8 were deployed among these systems, Russia could strike targets across entire continents, not just across a border or two. Considering Russia’s missile-heavy foreign policy playbook, you can see why such a capability would be attractive, especially in an effort to level the playing field against a coalition with advanced airpower and naval systems like NATO. … “If Russia could deploy large numbers of these missiles, possibly both conventionally and nuclear armed, along their western border, as well as in the enclave of Kaliningrad and in Crimea, it would give Moscow a massive precision strike capability that can range across Europe, something that by and large Russia’s tactical air forces continue to lack. “Fielding large quantities of road-mobile, conventionally armed land-based cruise missiles is also a relatively cheap proposition, at least in terms of the alternative. After the initial acquisition cost of the missiles and their transporter-erector-launchers (TELs), upkeep and training is just a tiny fraction of the cost of a high-end combat aircraft. And even those are not as survivable and do not possess the range of land attack cruise missile.” In addition, there have been reports that the Kremlin is increasingly willing to entertain the use of limited nuclear strikes to try and dissuade opponents from getting involved in or escalating a future crises in Europe or elsewhere, an idea commonly referred to as “ escalating to de-escalate .” And though experts have disputed just how heavily invested the Russians actually are in such a strategy, a nuclear-capable SSC-8 would certainly mesh well with the concept. As such, it’s hard to see how an American threat to violate the same treaty the Russians have already decided to ignore would necessarily upend this calculus. Whether real or imagined, the Kremlin’s decision to field the SSC-8 appears to be a direct response to the threats it sees arrayed around its borders. This weapon isn’t the only such system in the works, either. Since at least 2011, Russia has been testing the RS-26 Rubezh , a truncated version of the larger RS-24 Yars , which it says is also an ICBM and therefore not subject to the INF. However, the Kremlin has reportedly conducted at least two tests at ranges covered under the treaty, implying that the Russians are obscuring its true capabilities . Given what has already happened with Open Skies and the CFE, the U.S. government has become increasingly worried that this steady eroding of INF could lead to similar Russian actions toward other significant arms control agreements, especially those limiting nuclear weapon stockpiles and delivery platforms. There is some indication that this has already occurred with regards to the RS-24 Yars ICBM itself , which the United States disputes is an all new design. Under the provisions of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), Russia and the United States are limited in how many nuclear warheads can be associated with ICBMs and could not increase the total number of weapons on existing missiles. Though almost certainly just a subvariant of the earlier RS-12M Topol-M, Yars features so-called “multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles,” or MIRV configuration, with multiple warheads. An RS-24 Yars ICBM, controversial in of itself. The RS-26 Rubezh is a truncated derivative of this missile., Vitaly Kuzmin There is still the possibility that the relative proximity of an American INF-violating system, even a conventional one, forward deployed in Europe, could drive them back to working within the deal’s parameters. Experts largely understand the threat of a prompt conventional strike on Moscow to have been one of the key reasons for the creation of the treaty in the first place. “Moscow is most worried about conventional strike systems, particularly intermediate range systems that could decapitate its leadership,” Elbridge Colby, then the Robert M. Gates fellow at the Center for New American Security, posited in 2014 , shortly after Russian takeover in Crimea. “It won’t hurt to remind Moscow that it agreed to the treaty because it feared the U.S. deployment of intermediate range systems that could reach Moscow in only a few minutes.” In May 2017, Colby received an appointment to become Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development. The Pentagon now seems to increasingly have a view that this course of action has a good chance encouraging Russia to change its mind on the SSC-8. “We have a firm belief, now, over several years, that the Russians have violated the INF,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters during a meeting of senior NATO defense officials in Brussels earlier in November 2017. “And our effort is to bring Russia back into compliance.” Since it refuses to officially confirm it has abandoned the INF treaty, denies it has fielded the SSC-8 at all, and insists that the RS-26 is an ICBM, Russia could easily decide to step back from its current plans without losing face politically. At the same time, though, it would have decide it is worth trading these capabilities for an American threat that may or may not even come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 20, 2019",The Navy Says “Fly Before Buy” When It Comes To Its New MQ-25 Drone Tanker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it is looking to buy as many as 72 MQ-25 Stingray tanker drones , which it plans to fly off its existing Nimitz – and future Ford -class aircraft carriers . But the service will only buy four prototypes of the winning design initially and wants the chosen contractor to then show it can meet the programs demands before handing out any larger production deals. This appears to be an attempt to avoid another “buy-before-you-try” debacle, as has happened with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Earlier in November 2017, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mark Darrah, the program executive officer for unmanned aviation and strike weapons at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) detailed the plans in an interview with Aviation Week . At present, Boeing, General Atomics , and Lockheed Martin are still competing for the initial development contract. The Navy wants the three companies to submit their final proposals in January 2018 and hopes to select a single winner by the end of the summer. In October 2017, Northrop Grumman unexpectedly announced that it was withdrawing from the competition. “We want to go as fast as we can and get them out there as quickly as we can,” Darrah told Aviation Week. “We’re incentivizing [the contractor] to do well in the engineering and manufacturing development phase.” To do that, the Navy says it will link the winning company’s performance during that phase to whether or not it gets any subsequent production contracts. The service has made it clear it wants the contractor to prove it can not only deliver a design that meets the functional requirements for the MQ-25, but can also do so on time and within the firm, fixed budget laid out for the Stingray program. Lockheed Martin’s “concept art” of its MQ-25 proposal., Lockheed Martin This definitely makes a certain amount of sense. There is no shortage of examples in recent memory of major U.S. military modernization programs that have seen significant cost overruns and delays , both in development and operational testing. The Navy itself has seen the price of its F-35C Joint Strike Fighters grow even as the timeline for their initial entry into service has continued to slip amid continued concerns about jets’ real combat capabilities and the progress of the program as a whole . Unlike the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps, the service does not expect to declare an Initial Operational Capability, or IOC, for its F-35 variant until 2018 at the earliest. The main issue with the F-35 program has been the process known as concurrency , whereby the U.S. military purchased significant numbers of aircraft under the premise that the larger orders would drive down production costs. The planes would then receive modifications either at depots or on the production line “concurrently” as problems emerged and got fixed during the development phase. This has turned out to have been an almost entirely flawed concept and the Air Force and Marines are now considering not upgrading many existing Joint Strike Fighters in order to try and stem ballooning costs. One of the US Navy’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighters., Lockheed Martin On top of that, the entire stated point of the MQ-25 program is to take over aerial refueling duties from F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and their pilots. This in turn would both free up those fighter jets for combat missions and provide an opportunity to reduce the strenuous demands on the two manned aircraft. In October 2017, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, the service’s top aviation officer, revealed that only half its Super Hornets were even flyable at any one time and that barely more than 30 percent were combat ready. “The readiness level for [the Super Hornet] community has been on a declining trend for the last few years,” Shoemaker told members of Congress earlier in November 2017. “We’ve been forced to take risks in maintenance and production and, as a result, our ability to fix and produce up aircraft and therefore train aviators has suffered.” The Navy also wants the MQ-25 to enhance the Navy’s “mission tanking” capabilities in order to help extend the overall combat range of Hornets and Super Hornets. Initially, the main focus of the Stingray program was on less intensive “recovery tanking,” which takes place nearer to the carrier itself. Per U.S. Navy documents the author previously obtained via FOIA, the full MQ-25 “system” will include four drones, a control station linked to the carrier’s existing networks, and modifications to the ships to accommodate the Stingrays and their specific equipment. The initial contract appears to cover one single package. A full fleet of 72 aircraft would cover 18 total systems, which would allow the service to assign one to each of its nine carrier air wings, while holding additional packages in reserve in case of a maintenance issue, the need to deploy additional groups during a crisis, and for training and testing purposes. An F/A-18E Super Hornet launches from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in 2016., USN As such, slips in the MQ-25’s schedule could delay a key part of the Navy’s plan to mitigate the worrisome and potentially dangerous situation within its Hornet and Super Hornet communities . The service has already made it clear it is interested in proposals that make heavy use of mature technologies and commercially available systems and has insisted that any potential Stingray design use its existing Cobham “buddy store” refueling pods in order to speed up work on the Stingray. But at the same time, there’s no clear indication of what would happen if contractor doesn’t deliver during the engineering and development phase. Rerunning the competition, or canceling the program outright and starting over, could only cause significant delays in getting the desired capability to carrier air wings. And though the prospect of production contracts for dozens of drones would definitely be attractive to any contractor, the Navy’s present plan requires companies to invest a significant amount up front without a guarantee of a future deal. This could help explain why Northrop Grumman decided to opt out of the project and likely refocus its efforts elsewhere, such as its B-21 Raider stealth bomber or other top secret projects . The company will almost undoubtedly reap some benefits of having been involved in the project to begin with and is still getting paid for work on its proposal under an earlier set of risk reduction contracts that each of the four competitors received, which run through March 2018. It’s also unclear whether or not the Navy may decide, yet again, to change its requirements for the MQ-25 at some point in the future. We at The War Zone explored the saga of the Stingray’s shifting mission set, which has morphing from a stealthy penetrating strike and reconnaissance platform to a non-stealthy tanker, in detail many times, some of which you can find here , here , and here . Between 2011 and 2015, the service was actively working on the assumption that it would add an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) to the carrier air wing, before changing course and dropping this requirement entirely. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B, which had served as a demonstrator for a proposed carrier-based penetrating strike and reconnaissance drone., USN In his interview with Aviation Week, Rear Admiral Darrah confirmed previous reports that the present requirements call for the drones to have a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras and provisions for an unspecified surface search radar. When asked about whether the unmanned aircraft would ever carry weapons, the officer said that the tankers would not, but that future designs might have an armed capability. It is entirely possible that the Navy could trim the overall size of the MQ-25 fleet if it decides to reverse its present course and pursue UCAVs for a second time. Budget cuts and other changing priorities are always a factor, as well. Once again, this means that the winning contractor not only has to put up significant resources without the assurance of production deals to offset those costs, but that they have to do so knowing for sure if the Navy will follow through with a full 72 aircraft purchase order. It’s worth noting that, so far, only General Atomics has released concept art showing its full proposal, which it derived from its existing Sea Avenger concept . Boeing and Lockheed Martin have only shown more cryptic promotional material focusing almost entirely on the Cobham pod. It is possible that one or both firms could decide to follow Northrop Grumman’s lead and shift resources to other major military contracts and opportunities. At present, Boeing is still struggling to deliver the first KC-46A tankers to the Air Force and Lockheed Martin remains heavily invested in the F-35 program , which could expand soon to include additional foreign buyers, such as Germany , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . “We’re going to move forward with our strategy,” Rear Admiral Darrah insisted to Aviation Week. “[We] feel  we’re in a good position with whoever remains behind to give us a proposal.” With the deadline fast approaching for the final MQ-25 submissions, the Navy won’t have to wait much longer to see whether or not its plan has paid off and offered an actual an incentive to the prospective contractors.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019","Russia Rolls Out New Tu-160M2, But Are Moscow’s Bomber Ambitions Realistic?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation, or UAC, has rolled out the first prototype of its upgraded Tu-160M2 Blackjack at its plant in Kazan. The Russian Air Force insists that this design will be a key component of the country’s strategic, nuclear capable bomber force, along with its Tu-95MS Bears, but persistent budget shortfalls , limited industrial capacity , and other issues could easily stymie the modernization program. On Nov. 16, 2017, the same day as the roll-out, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin announced that flight tests of the aircraft would begin in 2018, low rate production would start a year later, and serial deliveries would start in 2023. At that point, UAC hopes to be delivering two or three Tu-160M2s each year. In 2015, the Kremlin first announced the project, which it said would involve restarting the Blackjack production line. “Everything is fine, just perfect,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said upon getting the update on the program from Rogozin, according to state-run media outlet TASS. “I congratulate the aircraft builders and I think we will deliver good news to the Defense Ministry.” We still don’t know the complete scope of the Tu-160M2’s improvements over the previous Tu-160M upgrade, which UAC first delivered to the Russian Air Force in 2014. In the past, Russian officials have stated the M2 aircraft would share approximately 60 percent of their components with the small fleet of original Tu-160 Blackjack bombers. It’s also not clear whether or not the M2s will be truly new production planes. UAC acknowledges that the initial prototype is a conversion of an existing airframe, but the Russian military says it wants at least 50 of the bombers and only has 16 Tu-160Ms in total. Based on the images UAC released of the first prototype, it appears that much of the airframe remains unchanged from its original swing-wing design. The development of the Soviet-era Tu-160, which the Russians nicknamed the Beliy Lebed or White Swan, began in the 1970s and it first flew in 1981. The aircraft did not see combat until 2015 , when Russian crews first fired air-launched cruise missiles at targets in Syria. The M2s will reportedly have new NK-32 02 Series engines, also known as the NK-32 Tier 2. The original low-bypass NK-32 is already among the most power turbofans ever built, with each generating approximately 55,000 pounds of thrust in afterburner at its maximum setting. By comparison, the General Electric F101s on the U.S. Air Force’s B-1 bomber have an output of just under 31,000 pounds at full afterburner. The Tu-160 is significantly larger than the B-1 too, though. Engine-maker United Engine Corporation (UEC) has said the 02 Series is significantly more efficient and will make the Tu-160M2 less thirsty than its predecessor, and in doing so it will reportedly add more than 600 miles to the jet’s operational range. These engines, or another variant thereof, are also supposedly going to be used on Russia’s PAK-DA stealth bomber project. Tests of the engines began in October 2017 , but it is not clear if the initial M2 prototype has them installed. In addition, Russian officials say the aircraft will feature an entirely new suite of avionics, expanding on the substantial improvements reportedly found on the Tu-160M. The M models already featured a number of enhancement in this regard, but UAC has hinted at the possibility that the M2 will have a fully digital “glass” cockpit. The front cockpit of an original Tu-160 Blackjack., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia In June 2017, Vladimir Mikheyev, the First Deputy CEO of Radio-Electronic Technologies Group, also known as Concern Radio-Electronic Technologies or by its Russian acronym KRET, told TASS that the Tu-160M2 would carry a variety of new electronic systems. The state-operated firm builds radios, navigation systems, radars, and intelligence gathering equipment for civil and military customers. Mikheyev said that the new Blackjacks would have, among other things, improved inertial navigation, satellite navigation, and astro-navigation equipment. The latter system was particularly notable as it offered an important backup in the event that the navigation satellite constellation – likely Russia’s GLONASS GPS-equivalent satellite network – failed or suffered an attack. The Russian military has been actively developing its own GPS jamming and spoofing systems , as well as anti-satellite weapons , and would be well aware of the potential threat. According to Russian media reports, the Tu-160M2s will have a fast-scanning active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. This will allow crews to detect targets and potential threats at longer ranges and with greater precision. The Tu-160M2 prototype at UAC’s plant in Kazan., UAC Perhaps more importantly, the new White Swans will supposedly carry a powerful new defensive system that the KRET executive boasted could “protect against all possible types of missiles.” Neither Mikheyev nor TASS offered any specific details about this particularly system, but there are number of possibilities. At the time, I wrote : “The executive did not offer any additional details on how the new system or systems for the bombers might defeat incoming threats. TASS’ did add a definition for “defense system” that covered detecting and classifying incoming weapons, as well as destroying them. It is possible and perhaps likely that he could have been referring to a completely new suite of equipment that included optical, infrared, and radar-linked early warning sensors along with jamming gear, lasers able to deflect certain types of missiles, and traditional dispensers loaded with flares and chaff. “Many of these types of systems, such as direction infrared countermeasures , already exist, but KRET could improve any or all of them by extending the range at which they first spot possible dangers, as Mikheyev alluded to, as well as how fast and actively defenses respond to the threat. The gear could involve more revolutionary technology, such as electrically-powered solid-state lasers or other systems that actually knock down incoming missiles. Another option might be to use highly focused beams of electromagnetic radiation to confuse or even destroy targeting radars or the seekers inside individual weapons. A conformal active electronically scanned radar (AESA) could do double duty in this role and Russia has already begun flying conformal arrays on their T-50 fighter jet prototypes.” In 2005, President Putin famously tagged along on a mission aboard a Tu-160. The White Swan is a seen as a symbol of nation pride in Russia. , VLADIMIR RODIONOV/AFP/Getty Images We don’t know exactly how elaborate this new defensive suite will actually be, but it is also the possibility the Tu-160M2 could one day also feature a so-called “hard-kill” arrangement that uses a physical interceptor to knock down incoming missile. In June 2017, American defense contractor Northrop Grumman patented the design of just such a system for stealth and other aircraft. The new Swans could conceivably have a combination of various types of defensive gear based around a single sensor system, which would give the bombers layers of protection against a variety of threats. The Tu-160M2 will still perform the same strategic and conventional missions as the older Tu-160Ms, according to Russian officials. Without any new, advanced low-observable features on the M2s, long-range, air-launched, conventional Kh-101 and nuclear Kh-102 cruise missiles that crews can fire at a stand-off distance to try and avoid enemy integrated air defenses will likely continue to be the primary weapon for the new bombers. But, as with all Russian advanced defense projects, fluctuations in the country’s economy could very well limit the scope of the M2’s final capabilities and the overall size of the fleet. As already noted, the Kremlin says it plans to purchase at least 50 Tu-160M2s in total. It’s not clear how many prototypes, conversions, or pre-production aircraft this figure includes. We don’t know how many spare, unfinished airframes UAC may have access to or what sort of condition they might be in, either. Under the Soviet Union, Tupolev, now part of UAC, only ever made a total of 35 Tu-160s, 19 of which were situated in Ukraine when it became independent. Eight of those aircraft came back to Russia in the early 2000s as payment for Ukrainian debts, with the rest apparently being scrapped. With 16 Tu-160s operational, it is possible that eight idle airframes are available for rejuvenation into Tu-160M2 configuration in addition to the 16 jets in service. UAC would need to have 26 more airframes available in some for or another to avoid having to restart production of all-new planes, which could be a costly proposition. Regardless of where the aircraft come from, if the company delivers two or three of the bombers starting in 2023, as it has planned, it could still easily take more than a decade for the Russian Air Force to get the final examples. Still, the country has already had to curtail a variety of defense programs in recent years due to the low price of oil, an important Russian export, and international economic sanctions in response to Moscow’s interventions in Ukraine and Syria. The flagging economy had a particularly visible impact on the PAK FA stealth fighter project. The Kremlin originally planned to have 150 of the planes in service by 2020. After more than seven years of flight testing, the Russian Air Force has less than a dozen aircraft, which is the extent of its present purchase order. The service is still hoping to take delivery of the 10th and 11th pre-production aircraft by the end of 2017, but the ninth jet only arrived in September . The Kremlin has already acknowledged that the decision to pursue the Tu-160M2 allowed it to “reschedule” – that is delay – the PAK DA stealth bomber program. UAC has yet to even release any official concept art of that aircraft. The M2 work will be competing for resources with both that project and routine maintenance and major overhauls of the existing 16 Tu-160Ms. At least the aircraft maker had the presence of mind to turn down a request for an unnamed Russian oligarch to try and turn one of the Swans into a high-speed luxury jet. Workers at UAC’s facility in Kazan overhaul one of Russia’s 16 Tu-160Ms in 2016., Maksim Bogodvid/Sputnik via AP Of course, it is likely that UAC, as well as other Russian defense companies, will be able to leverage significant portions of the work it has done on the new Blackjacks to support the PAK DA and help shorten development times and save money. As noted, the two designs will reportedly share the same engine. It might be possible to port over advanced defensive systems and other electronic components from the Tu-160M2 to the all-new bomber with a minimum of effort. But if the Tu-160M2 really does make it deep into new production, it is unlikely the PAK DA will become a reality anytime soon. New or upgraded Swans would already offer a cheaper path to improving and expanding Russia’s strategic capabilities compared to a costly and complex clean-sheet stealth design. The M2 modernization plan appears to have already suffered their own delays, though. In 2016, Colonel General Viktor Bondarev, head of the Russian Air Force, told state-run news outlet RIA Novosti that serial production was supposed to start in 2021 , not 2023. Photo by Marina LystsevaTASS via Getty Images In speaking with Putin in November 2017, Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin insisted flight Tu-160M2 flight tests would begin in February 2018, as well. At the same time, TASS noted that Bondarev had earlier said only that this “might” happen by then. This isn’t taking into account the costs the Russian military would incur in sustaining a fleet of 50 Blackjacks of any kind, either. This is more than three times the number of Tu-160s the Russian Air Force presently has to maintain and it isn’t clear how many of those White Swans are actually operational at any one time. Russian authorities have made clear that modernizing the country’s strategic bomber fleet is a major defense priority, but that may still not be enough to ensure the aircraft arrive on schedule or with the full list of promised features.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 20, 2019",SpaceX Is About to Launch A Mysterious Northrop Grumman Spacecraft Called “Zuma”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Space launch firm SpaceX is preparing to boost a Northrop Grumman spacecraft , code named Zuma, into low earth orbit from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But what the payload actually is, what it’s supposed to do and for how long, and what U.S. government agency or agencies are involved in the project all remain a mystery. SpaceX originally scheduled the Zuma launch aboard one of its partially reusable Falcon 9 rockets for Nov. 15, 2017, but delayed the mission a day for unspecified reasons. According to its website, the California-headquartered firm says there are two additional back-up launch windows on Nov. 17 and Nov. 18, 2017. “Both Falcon 9 and the payload remain healthy,” a SpaceX spokesperson told Space.com. “Teams will use the extra day to conduct some additional mission assurance work in advance of launch.” The launch itself seems entirely routine. After blasting off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center and putting the craft into orbit, the reusable Falcon 9 booster will attempt a landing at SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1 at the U.S. Air Force’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, also in Florida. The company has been steadily increasing the number of its launches since the rocket’s first flight in 2010. But there is virtually no information about the payload itself. The entire mission remained out of the public eye until NASASpaceflight.com first noticed that SpaceX had filed documents with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to get a “special temporary authority” for radio communications associated with the launch, which the request described only as “Mission 1390.” Follow-up reports from numerous outlets uncovered the existence of Northrop Grumman’s Zuma spacecraft and that the company was on contract to an unspecified U.S. government agency. The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor had previously made a deal with SpaceX for space launch services in 2015, but did not publicly schedule any associated missions. With all the formalities involved, and how hard it would be to keep that information secret, it seems as if this latest launch has been running on a truncated timetable. So far, though, no U.S. government entity has officially claimed ownership of the payload. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which manages America’s spy satellites, told Aviation Week that it had no connection to this particular mission. NRO routinely announces its launches, even if it generally declines to provide any specific details about the payloads. On May 1, 2017, another one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9s lofted the classified NROL-76 spy satellite into orbit. In September 2017, the firm launched the U.S. Air Force’s shadowy X-37B space plane on its latest mission, known as Orbital Test Vehicle 5 (OTV-5). “The Zuma payload is a restricted payload,” Lon Rains, the communications director for Northrop Grumman’s space systems division, told Space.com in a statement. “The event represents a cost-effective approach to space access for government missions. As a company, Northrop Grumman realizes that this is a monumental responsibility and has taken great care to ensure the most affordable and lowest risk scenario for Zuma.” There are some potential clues as to the nature of the craft in a series of official U.S. Air Force notices and alerts that the service published to warn the public of areas of potential danger. This is to help civilian aircraft and boaters avoid potential hazards during the launch. Using these documents and other available information, Spaceflight101.com offered some educated guesses as to the nature of the Zuma craft itself. The site noted that the closure areas were very similar to that of NROL-76, suggesting that the mission would involve an extremely high lofted trajectory to get the craft into orbit. This would involve the rocket flying on a more vertical flight path that would keep the first, reusable stage very close laterally to the landing area. Combined with reports that the rocket will not burn all of its fuel during the launch, this could indicate a lighter weight payload that requires less time and energy to get up to the appropriate speed and altitude. A map of the launch hazard area for the Zuma mission as scheduled for Nov. 16, 2017., USAF Airspace closures for the Zuma mission as it was scheduled on Nov. 15, 2017., USAF This doesn’t offer any particular indication one way or another as to the craft’s mission or actual capabilities, though, and there’s little concrete information to go on from other available sources. At first glance, there isn’t much to glean from the official mission patch, which often contain cryptic symbols relevant to the particular launch. The only spacecraft the artwork depicts is the Falcon 9, along with its company logo, a blue star marking the launch site in Florida, and an American flag waving in the background. A four leaf clover that appears at the bottom of the heraldic shield, a device that appears on many other SpaceX mission patches, is one of the only other symbolic elements and it’s unclear as to its significance. The official Zuma mission patch., SpaceX But there is one potentially more interesting feature. A constellation of six twinkling stars is at the top left, making up a significant portion of the patch. Top secret “black projects” developed at or operating in relation to the Area 51 test site at Groom Lake have long used a similar obscure motif, with the markings acting as an abstruse statement, standing for “5+1” or “51.” Although we can’t say with any certainty that this payload is connected to the secretive base and the myriad projects that are underway there, there have been reports that the legendary facility in Nevada has supported the development of experimental motherships used to haul payloads or small spacecraft into orbit or on suborbital flight profiles. In 2014, construction began there on a massive new hangar that could possibly house such a vehicle . The U.S. Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has since publicly announced that they are actively working on developing this capability , but more on that in a moment. Unit Patch via Trevor Paglen’s book I Could Tell You but Then You Would Have to Be Destroyed by Me Northrop Grumman is known to be especially active in the classified domain and has its own connections to Area 51, having worked there on the Tacit Blue stealth demonstrator – there is even see a six star symbol painted in its cockpit – during the 1970s and 1980s and certainly many other flying programs since. The top secret facility is likely where the company developed its top secret high-altitude surveillance drone, known as the RQ-180 , and may have or continue to host development of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber or its technology demonstrator predecessors. Again, however, numerous other SpaceX mission patches, including those for launches supporting public civilian projects, use similar star arrangements. The entire patch design actually shares a significant number of features – the Falcon 9 and company logo, a highlighting of the launch area in Florida, an American flag motif, the clover, and the six stars on a black background – with the one for the earlier NROL-76 mission, which is itself interesting given that NRO’s insistence that it has no relationship to the Zuma spacecraft. At the time of writing, SpaceX had not responded to questions about the symbolism. NRO’s art for NROL-76, left, and SpaceX’s patch, right., NRO and SpaceX Zuma could still be linked to other agencies within the U.S. Intelligence Community. In its analysis, Spaceflight101.com noted that, at least contracting wise, having Northrop Grumman make its own arrangements with SpaceX mirrored the procedure that the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency used to quietly launch the “PAN” and “CLIO” satellites in 2009 and 2014, respectively. Documents Edward Snowden released to The Intercept provided the first publicly available details of these craft and that they were signals intelligence platforms. In filing its forms with the FCC, SpaceX described the “nature of service” as “experimental.” As such, the payload may just be a technology demonstrator of some kind rather than a production sensor or other equipment package. The craft could be an experimental payload intended for the U.S. military’s aforementioned future two stage to orbit space launch system. In May 2017, DARPA hired Boeing, which was also responsible for the X-37B, to build this reusable space plane , which it has already designated the XS-1. The main goal of the overall project is to develop a way to rapidly deliver payloads into low earth orbit. In addition to Boeing, Lockheed Martin is also on contract for a variety of space-related developments for the U.S. government. And as we mentioned earlier there could easily be a parallel sub-orbital payload delivery system in the works on the top secret side. It’s also worth noting that the Zuma mission revelation came shortly before Northrop Grumman abruptly pulled out of the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone program . The company also suddenly dropped out of the USAF’s new training competition last winter, even after its prototype had already flown . It is possible that the firm is self-funding a part of this spacecraft project as a proof of concept for this mysterious U.S. government customer. Northrop Grumman invested privately in a variety of advanced technologies ahead of submitting its proposal for the B-21 bomber. Regardless, in making the announcement that the firm would not longer compete for the MQ-25 contract, CEO Wesley Bush told reporters that its drone projects were still “broadly doing well” without offering any specific details about those programs. With regards to Zuma specifically, Spaceflight101.com noted that Northrop Grumman’s Eagle-3 is the only space craft the company publicly offers that needs a rocket such as a Falcon 9 to get into low earth orbit and is therefore could be a likely basis for Zuma. This scalable satellite bus can accommodate payloads of 2,500 pounds or more and has an on board power supply that can keep it running for a typical lifespan of seven years. Northrop Grumman This could be longer or shorter depending on the exact equipment the customer installs inside it, but it would still offer a modular and highly adaptive test bed with a long service life that whoever the actual customer is might be able to service in orbit in the future. The satellite could conceivably carry antenna arrays to pick up electronic transmissions, electro-optical or infrared sensors, communications nodes, radar systems and the data links necessary to beam any information back down to control stations on the surface. The U.S. military has also publicly announced its own tests of small repair craft that can rapidly service other satellites in orbit, which would be yet another payload option. Of course, there is also the suggestion that these kind of maneuverable miniature spacecraft could also attack hostile objects in space. There have been reports in the past that Russia is experimenting with this concept . Zuma could be an experimental “ killer satellite ” that an intelligence agency is exploring as a way to tap into or disrupt an opponent’s space-based assets. Such a spacecraft might even have the ability to launch a localized cyber attack on the target object. These are just a few of the more exotic notional purposes for the Zuma launch and we have to stress that its mission could be something far more mundane. We just don’t know. Once Zuma enters orbit and begins to move around, or not, its basic characteristics and mission may become clearer. You can be sure we’ll be keeping an eye on its progress.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",What We Learned From Congress’s Latest Review of the President’s Ability to Use Nukes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the threat of a nuclear conflict at its highest point in decades, Americans and their representatives in government have become increasingly concerned about what checks and balances there are on the President of the United States’ ability to use the most deadly weapons in the United States’ arsenal. In a public hearing, U.S. Senators have unfortunately found that it’s as difficult as ever to present a credible deterrent threat and impose meaningful restrictions on the Commander in Chief’s sole authority to approve a potentially world-ending strike . On Nov. 14, 2017, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee spent more than two hours discussing the matter with retired U.S. Air Force General C. Robert Kehler, who formerly headed up U.S. Strategic Command, former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Brian McKeon, and Duke University Professor of Political Science and Public Policy Dr. Peter D. Feaver. The last time legislators took up the issue in public was in 1976, when what was then the House Committee on International Relations specifically explored the legal underpinnings of a nuclear first strike. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republic and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that this would be the first in a series of such gatherings that would fully explore the president’s authorities with respect to armed conflict and entering and withdrawing from international agreements. “Only the president, the elected political leader of the United States, has this authority” to order a nuclear strike, Corker stated in his opening remarks. The senator later insisted that the hearing was “not specific to anybody” and that a general review of the authorities and protocols was “long overdue.” Below is a video of the hearing in its entirety. But it is impossible to separate the debate over the use of nuclear weapons from President Donald Trump and his many public threats , particularly those directed at North Korea. Trump has repeated alluded to the possibility of employing them against the reclusive country and its leader Kim Jong-un. “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Trump said in August 2017 in what are now particularly infamous remarks . “He [Kim] has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire and fury and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.” Then, when speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017 , Trump said Kim, who he called “rocket man,” was on a “suicide mission.” “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” Trump said to audible gasps from the assembled world leaders and diplomats. Most recently, during a state visit to South Korea earlier in November 2017, Trump continued to issue rhetorical challenges to the North Korean regime. In a speech before the South Korean National Assembly, the country’s parliament, he described the North as a “hell that no person deserves.” “Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us, and do not try us,” Trump declared. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.” Since January 2017, the North Koreans have responded in kind with their own threats, including suggesting they might be planning an unprecedented atmospheric thermonuclear weapon test . In July 2017, the Hermit Kingdom successfully test fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Two months later they set off their first hydrogen bomb . “Let me pull back the cover for a minute from this hearing,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said during the November 2017 hearing. “We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests.” In October 2017, Corker himself said that Trump could be setting the United States “on the path to World War III.” “He concerns me,” the Senator continued. “He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.” Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP At present, the United States maintains what it calls the “nuclear triad” – bombers capable of carrying nuclear bombs and missiles , land-based ICBMs , and submarines packed with nuclear armed ballistic missiles – to deter other countries from launching their own such strike. The basic principle of this posture is that no opponent would have any reasonable chance of knocking out America’s nuclear arsenal in a first strike and escaping an apocalyptic retaliatory attack. The U.S. military is in the process of a routine nuclear posture review that could lead to changes in this doctrine. Despite earlier comments to the contrary , Secretary of Defense James Mattis has said that he believes the final decision will be to retain all three legs of the triad, though. The U.S. Air Force and Navy are also in the midst of a multi-billion dollar effort to modernize their nuclear capabilities, which includes programs to develop and procure new B-21 stealth bombers , nuclear capable cruise missiles , ICBMs , and ballistic missile submarines . Earlier in November 2017, the Congressional Budget Office calculated it would cost more than $1.2 trillion to both improve and maintain America’s nuclear triad over the next three decades. Even with that hefty price tag, the Air Force has said it isn’t happy with how fast the work is coming along and is looking to congress for help in speeding up the process . “My sense is that we’re in a good place right now in terms of how we’re working with industry going forward,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein told Defense One in an interview. “The question I’ll continue to have is: How do I move it left. How do we get this capability earlier. Because if you can actually get it faster, you can get it cheaper sometimes.” Many of the exact authorities and procedures for actually using those weapons are understandably classified. However, in order for the deterrent to be credible, some key details have to be public so as to communicate the risks to any adversary. Perhaps most importantly, the United States does not have a policy of “no first use,” reserving the right to employ its nuclear arsenal in response to an equally threatening or destructive conventional attack. According to the U.S. military’s official nuclear war plan, the president can send the order “in the event of a hostile act or intent.” We obtained this document through the Freedom of Information Act and though heavily redacted, it offered many important details about how the United States would go about authorizing and launching a nuclear strike. You can find our full analysis here . “There is nothing in this [OPLAN] that indicates a constraint on potential nuclear use, except that strikes have to comply with the Law of Armed Conflict, etc,” Hans Kristensen, head of the Federation of American Scientists’ Nuclear Information Project, told The War Zone in April after review the documents. “The implication is nuclear use only in extreme conditions,” Dr. William Burr, in charge of the nuclear history documentation project at the National Security Archive at The George Washington University, also explained to us at the time. “I would say that in such a circumstance, the decision would be left to the president and his advisers. One size would not fit all so to speak.” President Donald Trump talks to reporters during a state visit to South Korea in November 2017., Sipa via AP The assumption has long been that giving the president full decision making powers regarding the use of nuclear weapons is essential in making sure the order goes out, if necessary. Ballistic missiles fly so fast that the commander in chief could have 30 minutes or less to make a decision after the U.S. military detected a launch and determined whether or not it was threatening. The fear has been that imposing a requirement to consult congress or hold an official legislative vote could easily prevent American nuclear forces from responding in time. Even giving another senior official or officials, such as the Vice President or Secretary of Defense, a formal say in whether or not to launch the strike could slow down the process to a dangerous degree. Robust plans to maintain a so-called “ continuity of government ” in a crisis, something we at The War Zone have previously explored in depth , means that even if something happen to the president or other senior officials, this sole authority is always in the hands of a single individual. A mechanism known as the National Command Authority (NCA) does require the Secretary of Defense to confirm the order, but does not allow them to actively veto it. As such, the president can continue to fire and designate individuals to perform that function until someone approves the strike. The longer officials might attempt to dissuade the command in chief, the less time they would have to react to any incoming threats, though. And with these procedures in place, specialized command centers and flying command posts such as Air Force One and the E-4B Nightwatch aircraft assure that whoever is in the role of commander in chief, they are always in contact with America’s nuclear forces. Above all else, the U.S. has developed and built trillions worth of communications and other command and control infrastructure over the last 70 years to support the president or a designated representative’s ability to rapidly order a decisive nuclear strike before they themselves are destroyed. Other nuclear powers have created similar measures for the same reasons. The established protocol essentially accepts the lack of any real check and balance beyond the president asking for and accepting the counsel their closest advisers as necessary for the United States to offer a realistic threat of massive retaliation. At the same time, though, American military commanders are supposed to have the inherent right to refuse any orders they feel are unlawful. As already noted, the official U.S. military nuclear attack plan makes it clear that the strikes have to be in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict, which requires any military action to be proportional to the hostile threat and to take all reasonable steps to avoid civilian casualties. During the hearing, retired General Kehler said that had he received the order to launch a nuclear strike, but believed it to be lacking in legal justification, that he would have consulted his own advisers as to how to proceed. But since the United States is the only country to have ever used the weapons in anger and has only done so twice, there is no precedent whatsoever for how this might play out in an actual crisis. “Then what happens?” Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican asked Kehler to try and clarify the hypothetical chain of events and understand if the retired officer was truly implying he might have actually disobeyed the command. “I don’t know,” Kehler said to nervous laughter from the assembled Senators. An individual commander’s decision might not even matter. Bruce Blair, a co-founder of Global Zero, which advocates for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons around the world, and a former U.S. Air Force missile launcher offer, told the Associated Press that the orders would go to officials like Kehler and the crews in missile silos, aboard submarines, or flying bombers simultaneously. If U.S. military officer felt that the order was illegal, they would have to try and countermand the launch procedures already in progress. By then, “it would be too late,” Blair said. Tennessee Senator Bob Corker., Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP During the hearing former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy McKeon challenged the notion that any president could simply decide to launch a nuclear strike absent a clear and imminent danger. “Article II does not give him carte blanche to take the country to war,” he said, referring to the part of the U.S. Constitution that establishes the Executive Branch of government and outlines its main authorities. All three witnesses said they shared the view that without some clear instance of hostile intent for another country, the president would have to seek congressional approval for a nuclear attack. However, as we have noted, this stipulation does not appear to be formalized based unclassified portions of the Pentagon’s own nuclear operations plans. In addition, there is already a separate ongoing debate about just what sorts of military action the Executive Branch can and cannot order without Congress formally declaring war – almost certainly something that Senator Corker intends to address in a future hearing. And this of course isn’t the first time there have been concerns about whether the present system gives the president too much latitude. After North Korea shot down an American spy plane over international waters in 1969, the U.S. military dutifully drafted a set of possible responses for then President Richard Nixon, which included a limited nuclear strike. It is very possible that delays in communicating the details to the White House let tempers cool and prevented a potentially devastating exchange. “No problem is presently more paramount than that of curbing the terror of nuclear weapons, particularly when one considers that their use could result in the devastation of modern civilization,” Clement Zablocki, a Wisconsin Democrat and then Chairman of House Committee on International Relations, said in 1976. “Such was the concern that prompted various members of congress to introduce legislator which would renounce the first use-first strike of those weapons as part of U.S. strategic policy.” North Korean Premier Kim Jong-un, KCNA As we noted, the United States did not and still has not adopted such a policy in spite of repeated pressure to do so. In the 2010 nuclear posture review, the U.S. government did adopt language stating that it would not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear nations that have signed the international Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and are in compliance with their obligations under that agreement. In 2003, North Korea withdrew from the NPT, which it had never been in full compliance with despite having first acceded to the deal in 1985, becoming the first and only country to do so to date. But there have long been concerns about Trump’s particular grasp of the implications of using nuclear weapons and his understanding of the triad in general. In August 2016, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough claimed that the then Republican presidential candidate had repeated questioned why the United States even had deadly arsenal if the president couldn’t really use it . Combined with Trump’s clear misunderstanding of the efficacy of the U.S. military’s missile defense shield, concerns have only continued to grow about whether he might initiate a nuclear attack believing it to be somehow consequence free for the United States. Even if that were true, the impact on our allies is still likely to be immeasurable . At the November 2017 hearing, Senators also raised the question about whether publicly debating the president’s authority might itself undermine America’s deterrent credibility. “Every single word that’s been uttered here this morning in this hearing is going to be analyzed in Pyongyang, and they are going to look very carefully at how we, the American people, view this,” Senator James Risch, a Republican from Idaho, noted. Idaho Senator James Risch., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP This is undoubtedly true. It has long been clear that the North Koreans are inclined to take official U.S. government pronouncements, including Trump’s off-the-cuff remarks, very seriously. They, in turn, have stressed that the United States should do the same. Any potential adversary is likely to be on the lookout for any public changes to America’s nuclear doctrine in order to analyze them for vulnerabilities. The U.S. government would have to weight any significant reforms to the highest echelons of the U.S. military’s command and control structure against the knowledge that hostile powers would immediately look to exploit weaknesses in the new procedures. What, if anything, will come of the hearing is unclear though. The discussion seemed to mainly underscore the difficulties in balancing the ability of the president to wield a realistic nuclear threat with policies that would limit them from deciding to use that power on a whim. “I do not see a legislative solution today,” Senator Corker told reporters afterwards. “That doesn’t mean that over the course of the next several months one might develop.” The U.S. government, its foreign allies, and opponents such as North Korea are certain to be watching how this debate evolves. More than four decades ago, though, American lawmakers decided that the present system was the least worst option to control the country’s nuclear arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",US Air Force Reveals There May Have Been Another Attempted Terrorist Attack in Niger,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a month after a deadly ambush in Niger left four U.S. Army soldiers dead, the U.S. Air Force has revealed the existence of a second, possible terrorist attack in the country near the central city of Agadez. The details of this incident underscore the increasing risks American forces are facing while supporting largely unknown U.S. military missions from remote locations throughout North and West Africa. On the night of Apr. 20, 2016, Staff Sergeant Brady Little, a U.S. Air Force Security Forces airman from an unspecified unit, along with his comrades at the American base in Agadez successfully dissuaded a group of potential attackers who were approaching the site in three pickup trucks and semi-truck. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein posted an account of the incident on Twitter on Nov. 13, 2017, which the U.S. military does not appear to have acknowledged until now, ostensibly to highlight Little’s fast thinking. The service’s top officer combined the post with the hashtag “#MondayMotivation.” According to the official narrative, the vehicles and their occupants appeared to be preparing for a complex attack. The semi-truck came to a stop less than 200 feet from the perimeter fence, while the three pickup trucks raced toward the facility’s only entry point. Since at least September 2014, the U.S. has been working to create a new airstrip and associated facilities adjacent to the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aerienne 201, itself attached to Agadez’s single-runway Manu Dayak International Airport. The 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron manages day-to-day American activities at the site. Security Forces airmen, such as Little’s “Close Precision Engagement” team support convoy operations connecting the site with the Air Force’s main base in Niger, which is situated in the country’s capital Niamey more than 450 miles to the southwest. Twitter As the convoy of potentially hostile vehicles approached, Little had ordered other personnel to “move the most capable weapons” into a blocking position – possibly referring to up-armored Humvees with mounted .50 caliber M2 machine guns, which have appeared in official photographs from the base – and the American forces prepared to open fire. There is no mention in the Air Force’s account about the presence of Nigerien forces or private contractor security personnel during the incident. The Air Force’s account says unequivocally that this hasty defense would not have been enough to prevent the trucks from getting into the compound. “With the vehicle’s approaching, Little instructed all responding forces to activate their visible laser aiming devices mounted on their weapon systems as the final effort to halt the vehicles,” the Air Force said in its summary of the events. “Upon seeing the lasers, the approaching trucks immediately halted, reversed course, and retreated 1,000 meters [approximately 3,280 feet] from the base for a span of twenty minutes before departing back into the local village closest to the base.” Below is a copy of the full, official narrative of the incident that occurred near Agadez, Niger in April 2016, presented here in case the U.S. Air Force deletes down the the original social media post for any reason. USAF The review does not say whether or not American or Nigerien forces ultimately pursued or detained any of the individuals involved in the incident. It remains unclear whether or not this was actually a coordinated assault or a potentially deadly misunderstanding. Terrorists aligned with Al Qaeda and ISIS do routinely launch attacks in the country and a group presently known as Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, or ISGS , was likely responsible for the ambush on a combined U.S. and Nigerien patrol near the village of Tongo Tongo in October 2017. At the same time, smugglers and other organized crime entities similarly exploit weak government institutions and the limited reach of state security forces both in Niger and throughout North and West Africa as a whole. The semi-truck could have been carrying illicit drugs or trafficking migrants . It is equally possible, though, that the individuals were legitimate traders or other civilians who had simply lost their way. It’s not easy to tell the difference in many cases, especially in the dark, and mistakes do happen. Migrant laborers pile on to a semi-truck in Agadez before heading to the gold mines in Niger’s Djado Plateau., Désirée von Trotha/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP In a particularly notorious incident in Iraq in 2005, American troops opened fire on a car they felt was speeding threateningly toward a road block near Baghdad International Airport. It later turned out that the vehicle was carrying Italian military intelligence personnel and journalist Giuliana Sgrena , who they had just rescued from kidnappers. U.S. troops killed secret agent Nicola Calipari and wounded Sgrena, sparking an international incident. But what is clear is that the airmen in Agadez had limited options available to respond to the approaching convoy. Little and his fellow security forces personnel would also undoubtedly have been aware of the limited support available to American troops in the country, especially access to emergency medical care, in response to crises in general. This only serves to underscore the questions and concerns that have emerged following the ambush in October 2017 about whether or not U.S. forces deployed to the region have adequate resources. At I have explained in detail in the past, the United States policy of having a “ light footprint ” militarily in Africa, which is primarily due to a number of complicated political issues , in many ways precludes the establishment of a more robust presence, for better or worse. Airmen move building materials around the American base in Agadez in April 2016., USAF The threats are real, though, and potentially growing. Before the terrorist attack that killed four Americans near Tongo Tongo, the Nigerien government had already declared a state of emergency in the same area. Much about the October 2017 incident remains unknown, as well, but the details that continue to leak out have increasingly painted a picture of limited resources and conflicting operational priorities. What started out as a routine patrol may have morphed into a larger mission to try and kill or capture Abu Walid al Sahrawi, leader of ISGS. Multiple U.S. government investigations are still underway to determine exactly what happened when the force came upon a group of at least 50 terrorists near Tongo Tongo. Earlier in November 2017, The Washington Post reported, citing interviews with locals, that terrorists might have captured and executed U.S. Army Sergeant La David Johnson, who died some time after getting separated from the main force, or at least mutilated his body. Johnson was missing for two days before Nigerien civilians apparently found his remains and alerted authorities. It’s unclear what, if any, new precautions the U.S. military took to prepare for possible future attacks in and around its facilities in Agadez following the 2016 incident. In May 2017, the Air Force announced it was in the market for five armored watchtowers to help bolster its defenses in Niger, but at the base in Niamey. US Air Force Lieutenant General Richard Clark, Third Air Force commander, stands in a guard post at the American base in Niamey in 2016., USAF In its review, the Air Force said that “outside-the-wire patrols” did not occur until after the 2016 incident and that there is now a “base security zone” that extends more than 80 feet out from the physical perimeter. Staff Sergeant Little received the Air Force Achievement Medal, which the service awards “for outstanding achievement or meritorious service rendered specifically on behalf of the Air Force,” for his actions in 2016. We do know, that as of April 28, 2016, members of the U.S. Air Force’s 435th Contingency Response Group, including the 435th Security Forces Squadron, were at Agadez to help prepare the base for unspecified “follow-on forces,” though this influx of personnel may have had nothing to do with the possible attack. The 435th is a rapid response element situated at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and is on-call for various short-notice support missions, including local security and military construction, both in Europe and Africa. Earlier in November 2017, the service told to Stars and Stripes that construction work at the austere base had suffered delays due to difficulties in obtaining necessary supplies, sandstorms, and extremely high temperatures. There was no indication from that report that terrorist attacks or the threat thereof had hampered logistics convoys to or from Agadez or prompted the need for additional defensive bulwarks. At present, the plan is for unmanned surveillance aircraft to begin flying missions from the new airstrip some time in 2018.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 28, 2018",Night Vision Goggle-Wearing Taliban Are Terrible News for Afghan and US Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New reports suggest that the Taliban are increasingly using Russian-made night vision equipment, underscoring the group’s increasing sophistication relative to Afghan government security forces. This could even threaten historical advantages that American and other coalition elements have enjoyed at night, especially as they renew closer cooperation with Afghanistan’s troops in the field, part of still largely undefined strategy to finally break the insurgents after more than 16 years of war. On Nov. 13, 2017, Afghan officials told The New York Times that night-vision equipped Taliban, aided by an insider, had murdered at least eight policemen as they slept at their station near the city of Farah, capital of the province of the same name in Western Afghanistan. It is one of the latest in a string of bold and deadly attacks by the insurgents on government outposts in traditionally secure areas that began in October 2017. “Night-vision equipment is used in ambushes by the insurgents and it is very effective,” Afghan Major General Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for the country’s defense ministry told The Times . “You can see your enemy but they cannot see you coming.” Understanding this advantage, the U.S. military has long seen the value of light-enhancing night vision and infrared equipment and developing improved gear has been a priority since World War II. It wasn’t until the first Gulf War that the technology had caught up with the desire to make night vision systems a piece a common kit for even the most lowly infantryman. At present, American combat units have these systems at all levels in order to continue “owning the night.” The slick video below shows a U.S. Marines and U.S. Army special operations forces training together to conduct operations in low-light conditions at the Marine Corps base at Twentynine Palms, California and gives a good sense of American troops’ nighttime capabilities. Despite more than a decade American support, the same cannot be said of Afghan troops and paramilitary police. These units routinely lack sufficient night vision systems and what equipment they do have is often in disrepair. This became particularly apparent after President Barack Obama initiated plans for a significant draw down of forces in Afghanistan in 2011 following an initial surge of personnel. U.S. troops had positioned their outposts and bases and designed their defenses with extensive night vision capabilities in mind. Taliban fighter in Helmand with Russian made night vision and American made weapon. pic.twitter.com/aj53Fz7mEh — sten reimann (@stenreimann) November 14, 2017 When Afghan forces who lacked those capabilities took over, they almost immediately found themselves unable to properly maintain those sites against persistent Taliban attacks. In 2012, The Washington Post described how bad things had gotten at one combat outpost in the Jalrez Valley. “Troops patrolling the area near the base return before dusk because the Afghan army has no provision for night-vision goggles, which the troops borrowed from the Americans when the base was shared,” the newspaper explained. “The patrols – adapted from U.S. counterinsurgency theory – are not as common as they once were, and Afghan soldiers say they are of little consequence.” Afghan Uniformed Police during an operation in 2013., USMC The Jalrez district of Afghanistan’s eastern Wardak province was still the site of routine and deadly insurgent attacks three years later. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times noted that the area “includes 12 of the most perilous miles of roadway in the country.” The night vision issue, or finding some other means for Afghan forces to reliably operate at night when insurgent activity is often most pronounced, is just one of the many hurdles the United States and its allies have to overcome in their latest attempt to help the country’s authorities break the Taliban insurgency. At present, Afghan special operations units, including its special forces, commandos, and the shadowy and elite Ktah Khas battalion , do have ready access to night vision equipment. Unfortunately, this probably also explains why this small proportion of the country’s overall military has reportedly ended up being responsible for nearly 70 percent of all offensive operations across the country. The problem is bound to become even more glaring as the United States moves to dramatically increase the number of advisory personnel accompanying Afghan units on actual combat operations in order to be better positioned to call in air strikes and precision artillery fire . In the past, American troops, especially special operations forces, have employed infrared strobes to mark their positions for friendly aircraft and other supporting forces. In June 2014, a U.S. Air Force B-1 bomber accidentally killed a number of U.S. Army special forces soldiers when it mistook them for Taliban troops. In its investigation, the U.S. military determined that one of the major factors in what remains the deadliest friendly fire incident involving Americans in Afghanistan was the inability of the bomber’s targeting system to detect those blinking lights . And while the report says the bomber crew didn’t know their targeting system couldn’t see infrared strobes, & that “the capabilities were not specifically covered…in sniper academics,” the Air Force General who wrote it also faults the controller and the Green Berets. (2/2) pic.twitter.com/Z1LLZ3gY9Z — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) November 13, 2017 Now, the Taliban may be able to spot those beacons and use them to zero in on U.S. and coalition personnel and their Afghan partners. On top of that, Joint operations with Afghan units who have limited situational awareness after dark can only put their American advisers in a riskier position in general, no matter what support is on call. By 2018, there could be almost 16,000 U.S. personnel in country in total. For years, U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, including special operations forces, have been relying heavily on contractors for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Private firms are presently supplying small Scan Eagle and similarly sized drones, small manned surveillance platforms such as the Beechcraft King Air-based Night Eagle , and tethered aerostats with electro-optical and infrared sensor packages, among other assets to provide persistent surveillance in the country, especially at night. Underscoring the issues with monitoring the Taliban after the sun goes down, unlike more complex systems using the same airframe, Night Eagle has an infrared-capable full-motion video camera as its only sensor. There is also the suggestion that there is such a concern about Taliban infiltration of Afghanistan’s institutions – in many cases lead to deadly insider attacks – that the United States and its coalition partners are often reluctant to share this information with their Afghan counterparts. One draft U.S. Air Force contract document, dated November 2016, regarding drone surveillance, said that “the contractor shall also provide imagery with all meta-data removed that can be releasable to Afghanistan.” The NATO-led coalition did not respond to a request for clarification about the nature of routine intelligence sharing with Afghan government elements. USAF At present, the Afghan military lacks any significant number of its own such persistent surveillance systems. The Afghan Special Mission Wing does have a number of Pilatus PC-12s with turreted infrared cameras, similar to the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command’s U-28A, but the regular Afghan Air Force’s A-29 Super Tucanos appear to fly many missions without their own sensor turrets. In 2018, the United States hopes to help deliver three AC-208 Combat Caravans, a modified Cessna C-208, with a turreted infrared camera, as well as the ability to fire 70mm laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rockets. The U.S. military has already facilitated the delivery of similar aircraft to Iraq and Lebanon. “That’s going to be their reconnaissance bird. They don’t have any reconnaissance right now,” U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Phillip Stewart, the American officer commander in charge of NATO’s air training mission Afghanistan, told Defense News . “That’s going to be a gamechanger for them.” It’s not clear how soon the Afghan Air Force would be able to put that capability into action, though. As we at The War Zone have written about in detail before, the service has a long standing shortage of qualified aircrews across the board and has historically had difficulty maintaining more complex systems without significant help from private contractors. It’s unclear how easy it would be to increase the distribution of night vision goggles and similar systems to regular Army troops, as well, given routine reports of units selling their equipment on the black market to make up for lost or stolen paychecks or just to make some additional money in country where the individuals commonly make less than $500 a year. One of Iraq’s AC-208 Combat Caravans with the sensor turret visible below the fuselage. Afghanistan’s aircraft will be in a similar configuration., USAF At the same time, it is clear that the militants and their allies are only getting more sophisticated in their capabilities, which only makes the night-time threats more pronounced and immediate. In addition to the night vision goggles, the group itself claims that it has acquired and is using infrared aiming lasers on their rifles and machine guns, just like American forces, as part of expanding night time operations. “Usually we are using laser weapons and night visions on night attacks,” Qari Yusuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesperson who the The Times ’ reporters spoke to via cellphone, said, referring to the laser aiming devices. “We definitely used night visions and laser weapons for that attack [near Farah] as well.” A US Army special forces soldier holds a weapon fitted with an infrared aiming laser in Afghanistan. , US Army In August 2017, the group released a slick, 70-minute long propaganda video highlighting its “special forces,” who clearly were aping the style and look – at least according to popular media – of elite American special operations forces. Though these forces are almost undoubtedly less capable their U.S. military counterparts, the presentation did suggest there is increasing level of training and competency among at least some portions of the organization’s forces. American weapons and equipment, which fighters often take as spoils of war after attack Afghan or coalition units, featured prominently in the video, too. In October 2017, the Taliban nearly wiped out an entire Afghan Army base in a complex attack that featured two captured Humvees the fighters had rigged up as massive suicide bombs, also known as vehicle-based improvised explosive devices or VBIEDs – a separate tactic that has also proven to be especially deadly in the fighting against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Taliban special forces, also known as Sara Khitta, or “Red Group” in the Pashto language, are among those elements that have begun employing night visions systems, as well. Afghan government special operations forces reported seeing the fighters with the gear as early as August 2016 , but the attack in Farah appears to be the first clear confirmation that the group is actively using the equipment. The exact source of the goggles is less clear. Naser Mehri, a spokesman for governor of Farah province, told The Times that the goggles appeared to be Russian in origin. Major General Waziri said that there was no indication that they had come via the Russian government and posited that the Taliban had likely purchased them on the black market in neighboring Pakistan. Despite a host of reports earlier in 2017 indicating that the Kremlin might have started actively supporting the Taliban, there has so far not been any conclusive evidence to support this accusation. Russian weapons and other military equipment are not particularly difficult for militants and terrorists to obtain in the region for a variety of illicit sources. “I want to see more evidence about how deep the support is,” U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told legislators during a hearing in October 2017. “I need more definition on what is coming out of Russia. I can’t figure it out. It doesn’t make sense. But we’re looking at it very carefully.” Explosive ordnance disposal technicians from one of Afghanistan’s commando units sweep for improvised explosive devices during a nighttime operation., NATO Determining the origins of the equipment is likely to be part of a larger regional effort to try and identify and neutralize trans-national sources of support for the Taliban. In announcing his new administration’s overarching strategy for improving security in Afghanistan and South Asia, U.S. President Donald Trump highlighted the long-standing issue of the terrorists being able to operate with apparent impunity in Pakistan. “No, I haven’t seen any change yet in their behavior,” U.S. Army General John Nicholson, who commands all American and coalition troops in Afghanistan, told reporters earlier in November 2017 after a meeting of senior defense officials from NATO member states in Brussels, Belgium. “The United States has been very clear about the direction we want to go and we hope to see some change in the coming weeks and months.” The United States has been hoping to pressure the Pakistani government to do more on this issue, but it not clear if they are either willing or able to do more to challenge militant groups in their semi-autonomous northwestern tribal regions. Clearing up whether there is an actual link between Russia and the Taliban would also give U.S. officials different leverage to try and upend any active coordination between the group and the Kremlin. In the meantime, though, the Taliban are increasingly using night vision equipment and despite more than 16 years of American support, it’s just as clear that Afghan units often lack any similar capability. The United States and its allies will have to figure out a solution that they can implement now or run a growing risk of losing ownership of the night to the insurgents.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin continues to look at expand sales of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, with Germany , the United Arab Emirates , and now Saudi Arabia expressing an interest in buying the fifth generation aircraft. At the same time, though, there are increasing concerns that the aircraft’s centralized computer brain, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), could pose threats to the capabilities and national interests of individual operators. On Nov. 12, 2017, Defense News reported that Saudi Arabia is now seeking entry into the F-35 club. At the 2017 Dubai Air Show, American and Emirati officials have also confirmed that the UAE is in discussions with the United States about buying as many as 24 Joint Strike Fighters. These announcements followed reports earlier in November 2017 that Germany sees the stealthy fighter jet as the “ preferred choice ” to replace its aging Panavia Tornados. “We in the UAE already live in a fifth generation environment,” Brigadier General Rashed Al Shamsi, deputy head of the country’s Air Force, explained at air show. “So acquiring the F-35 fighter jet is only a step forward to cope with the fifth generation mindset.” It’s not entirely clear what Shamsi was referring to. At present, Israel is the only country in the Middle East that is part of the F-35 program and the only one actively seeking to acquire a fifth generation aircraft of any type. A US Air Force F-35A., Lockheed Martin Shamsi was most likely referring to the increasing proliferation of advanced surface-to-air missiles, especially the potential spread of Russia’s S-400 system , and long range radars throughout the region. Iran, the UAE’s principle regional rival , continues to be actively seeking to improve and expand its integrated air defenses. These assets could pose a danger to late fourth generation fighter jets in a conflict, especially given the proximity of the two countries and the relatively small air spaces between them. Even older road mobile systems, such as the S-300 , which Iran could move from one location to another relatively rapidly, could be real real. Whatever specific concerns Shamsi has in mind, it is likely that the Saudis share them, as well, driving their own interest in the F-35. We at The War Zone have long noted that any serious discussions between the United States and UAE would almost certainly prompt a similar request from authorities in Riyadh. The overall security situation already prompted the U.S. Air Force to begin rotational deployments of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to Al Dhafra Air Base in in the UAE. Both the Emiratis and the Saudis may feel that their existing fleets of advanced fourth generation aircraft simply aren’t enough to counter the growing threats. Rebuffed for years in its attempts to join the F-35 program, authorities in Abu Dhabi have, in the past, said they considered development of a fifth generation fighter jet important enough to entertain cooperating with Russia on such  project. At present, the UAE’s Air Force’s fighter jet fleet includes a mixture of Lockheed Martin F-16E/F Desert Falcons, as well as older French-made Mirage 2000s. The Saudis have recently has received F-15SA Advanced Eagles from Boeing to join their existing F-15S aircraft and Eurofighter Typhoons . One of the UAE’s F-16E Desert Falcons based in the United States for training purposes and wearing a US Air Force tail code., USAF At the Dubai Air Show, the UAE also announced a $1.6 billion deal with Lockheed Martin to upgrade its Desert Falcons. This will likely incorporate the new mission computers, navigation systems, digital multifunction displays, Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) transponders, and the Link-16 tactical data links associated with the F-16V configuration . However, the E/F variants already feature a active electronically scanned array radar, which is the centerpiece of the V model upgrades for other countries . With Joint Strike Fighters, the two Gulf countries could present a significant deterrent to any overt Iranian military action in the region. It would allow them to more readily consider limited, punitive air strikes, as well, without having to consider a larger aerial campaign to destroy air defense threats. On top of that, with their advanced sensor suite, the F-35s could potentially serve as important intelligence gathering platforms , even just during normal patrols in and around the Persian Gulf. “As you look here in the Middle East they share common threats and so we’re looking at options on who we share those [F-35s] within the Gulf,” U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Stephen Wilson told reporters at the air show in Dubai. “So the discussions are ongoing now with the new administration on selling F-35s to partner nations that need them and require them.” But whether or not the needs and requirements of potential Gulf operations align with those of the United States, or could be expected to remain in sync for the foreseeable future, is much more of an issue that with previous combat aircraft given the inherently interconnected nature of the F-35 program as a whole. The ALIS computer system and its associated cloud-based network are central to the day-to-day operation of the Joint Strike Fighters. Lockheed Martin has designed the system as single point of access for each aircraft’s digital information. As such, it is constantly gathering data about each plane and whether it might be in need of certain maintenance. It’s also serves as the load gate for packages of operational data, containing detailed mission routes, details about potential threats and hazards, and other information. When the F-35’s software needs a patch, it comes down to individual units through their on-site ALIS terminal. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor has been particularly guarded about the ALIS system. In October 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps F-35 units still did not have complete manuals and troubleshooting guides for their Joint Strike Fighters because American officials had not yet reached a final deal about sharing technical data with the plane’s manufacturer. The most obvious concern, as we at The War Zone have noted many times before, is the threat of a cyber attack that could quickly hamper or shut down F-35 operations. I have outlined a worst-case scenario in the past: “The nightmare scenario would involve an opponent causing a disruption during an actual crisis by either actively feeding bad information into the ALIS system or otherwise disabling some portion of it or its overarching architecture. The interconnected nature of the arrangement might allow a localized breach to infect larger segments of the F-35 fleet both in the United States or abroad or vice versa. It’s not hard to imagine the time and energy needed to sort out real inputs and outputs from fake ones hampering or halting operations entirely under the right circumstances. Given the jet’s low-observable characteristics, advanced defensive systems, and other sensors, a cyber attack would be an attractive option for any enemy force. Why would an enemy use a $500,000 air-to-air or surface-to-air and put their personnel and equipment at risk in an attempt to down an F-35 when a simple worm may be able to do the same to a whole fleet of F-35s? It could also do so with plausible deniability, something kinetic weapons are far less adept to.” As the aircraft’s user base has expanded and more countries have moved closer to putting their jets into service, new and more complicated problems have emerged. In particular, a number of America’s partners on the program have begun to raise concerns that ALIS threatens their national sovereignty by making too much operational information available both to other countries and Lockheed Martin. “Italy, in [this] specific case, wants to preserve its sovereignty on some information, avoiding any unnecessary disclosure,” an unnamed Italian Air Force spokesperson told FlightGlobal at the Dubai Air Show. “In order to do so, like other partners do, Italy took some actions to grant an effective use of the weapon system, without disclosing some data that are deemed sensible.” Italy, along with Australia and Norway, among others, have begun to push for some type of gateway for each nation that limits the flow of information back into the ALIS cloud and the main hub at Lockheed Martin’s facility in Texas. Reportedly the company has agreed to let countries modify the system to protect sensitive information and Italy and Norway now jointly operate a software laboratory at the U.S. Air Force’s Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, which serves as  a central point for multi-national F-35 testing and evaluation. “Ultimately, there will be a standard gateway off of the program that we can all work with, but in the interim we’re thinking for each nation to bring a gateway along and have that integrated,” Royal Australian Air Force Air Vice Marshal Leigh Gordon, head of that country’s portion of the F-35 program, told FlightGlobal. “We expect the gateway will allow us to inspect and decide when information gets passed.” The only problem is that no Joint Strike Fighter operator, with the sole exception of Israel , will be able to utilize an alternate system to ALIS, at least at present. Whether or not individual countries can limit the outflow of data doesn’t free them from their reliance on the software and network for the host of functions we mentioned earlier. It also doesn’t change the fact that each country will possess a number of local ALIS terminals that are connected to this world-wide infrastructure. So, among the concerns about adding additional partners, such as the UAE or the Saudis, to the program, is adding additional access points that will need protection from malicious actors. An F-35A for the Royal Australian Air Force takes off for its inaugural flight from Lockheed Martin’s facility in Texas., Lockheed Martin That both of these Middle Eastern countries are seeking closer cooperation with Russia, which the United States sees as a hostile actor that doesn’t share its policy goals in the region or elsewhere, only adds additional complexity to the matter. In another interview with FlightGlobal at the Dubai International Air Chiefs Conference ahead of the air show, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigian, head of Air Forces Central Command, noted that it would be difficult if not impossible to develop a mechanism for F-35s to safely and securely share its wealth of information during operations with advanced Russian fourth generation aircraft, such as the Su-35S Flanker E , or a future fifth generation design, such as the Su-57 . “Frankly I’m not sure it’s doable,” Harrigian said. “You can figure out a way to do it but we’re protected with what’s coming off the F-35… To try and introduce it into something that we don’t operate it with is not some place I would expect we’re going to go.” And though he was ostensibly talking about the technical difficulties of operating mixed fleet of American and Russian aircraft, he alluded to broader issues of keeping the ALIS system and its terminals secure in such an environment. Letting the UAE and the Saudis into the F-35 program can only add additional nodes for hostile actors to attack the larger, overall network. “There’s a whole litany of things that would impact beyond just the policy problem you’re going to have,” Harrigian noted. “At the end of the day, it’s protecting our capabilities so that if your son or daughter is in that airplane, we haven’t given something away that an adversary could use against us in the future.” Of course, the very nature of ALIS means these concerns go both ways. As we have noted previously , the network gives the United States an unprecedented level of active export control over any Joint Strike Fighters that ultimately arrive in the UAE or Saudi Arabia. In addition to just cutting off access to future software upgrades and other data, American officials could seek to use the system as a vector for a cyber attack to completely disable the jets. At the moment, the UAE and Russia both say they are continuing to talk about a possible Su-35 sale for the Emirati Air Force. It is possible that the United States could make accession to the F-35 program conditional on ditching those plans, as well as any future cooperation with the Kremlin on a fifth generation design. For its part, though, UAE officials have stressed they’re interested in keeping all the options on the table. This includes possible purchases of Eurofighter Typhoons or French Dassault Rafale fighter jets. It is very possible that the country could look at adopting a two-track plan to replace its F-16E/Fs with F-35s and its Mirage 2000s with a separate, fourth generation European design. “Nothing is finalized, we are talking to all,” Ishaq Saleh al Baloushi, executive director of Defense, Industry and Capability Development at the ministry of defense, told Reuters. “The technical team is working on this.” You can be sure we’ll be keeping an eye on how the UAE and now the Saudis progress through negotiations to finally join the F-35 program and just what types of stipulations the United States – or any other existing member of the project – insists upon in order to guard against various security concerns.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 17, 2020",Blue Flag Exercise Has Dozens of Foreign Fighter Jets Over Israel Training For War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The skies above the Negev Desert in southern Israel have been especially active as of late, as the country hosts largest ever iteration of its premier multi-national aerial exercise, nicknamed Blue Flag. The event is showcasing the capabilities of the Israeli Air Force, as well as those of its allies, at time when tensions in the region are running high, including, but not limited to, a unprecedented crackdown in Saudi Arabia , the ongoing crisis in Yemen , talk of a war between Saudis and Lebanon , widespread instability in Syria, and ongoing concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile programs . Blue Flag 2017, which began on Nov. 6, 2017, is the third iteration of the biennial gathering and by far the largest in both size and scope, with more than 1,000 personnel in attendance. Seven countries – France, Germany , Greece, India , Italy , Poland , and the United States – have sent nearly three dozen aircraft to join their Israeli counterparts at Uvda Air Force Base. The Greek, Polish, and U.S. air forces all sent F-16 fighter jets of various types – five, six, and seven aircraft, respectively – while the French dispatched five Mirage 2000Ds , the Germans contributed six Eurofighter Typhoons , and the Italians deployed five Tornado IDS . The Indian Air Force sent only a single C-130J Hercules transport plane and a contingent of special operations forces. Israel’s own F-15 and F-16 fighter jets are both taking part. So far, “we started with simple missions to get used to the local area, working together, and the administrative coming and going from the airspace,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Freeborn, commander of the 510th Fighter Squadron, which is forward deployed in Italy, told the service’s own reporters earlier in November 2017. “Then we are continually layering complexity onto these simple missions.” The Israelis have modeled the exercise on similar massive American aerial training drills, such as Red Flag and Green Flag , which helps explains their own chosen nickname. This latest version involves aerial operations based around the requirements of a fictional war between Falcon Land, the friendly side, and Nowhere Land, the enemy territory. Much of the dogfighting, air strikes, electronic warfare activities, and other maneuvers are simulated, the base commander at Uvda, who the IAF only identified by his first name Colonel Itamar, explained to journalists. The drills do include live-fire attacks on mock ground targets, though. Additional F-16 fighter jets from the IAF’s elite 115 Squadron, also known as “ Red Squadron ” or “Dragon Squadron,” are providing opposing aircraft to challenge the participants throughout the exercise.  Created in 2005, its since become a world class aggressor unit mimics aerial threats with its F-16s and just traded in its F-16A/Bs for newer F-16C/Ds in April 2017. IDF Beyond flying “hostile” fighter jets, the unit’s personnel can also simulate other enemy forces, including surface-to-air threats, electronic warfare attacks, and challenges to friendly space-based assets. The squadron is almost certainly piloting the drones that are reportedly supporting “Nowhere Land” forces during Blue Flag 2017. In addition, Colonel Itamar said he hoped that Israel’s F-35I Adir stealth fighters would be operational and able to join in the next Blue Flag. By then, the U.S. Air Force could decide to bring its own F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . Four F-16s from the US Air Force’s 510th Fighter Squadron on the ramp at Uvda Air Force Base during Blue Flag 2017., USAF Regardless, the event remains beneficial for the participants as it gives them a chance to work and share lessons with various foreign forces, which often have their own ways of doing things, and over areas they are less familiar with. Major events like Blue Flag are also an opportunity for unit commanders and pilots alike to fly missions within a large, multi-national coalition, something that has become increasingly the norm for actual military operations , such as the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. “The ranges they have here are nothing like we have back home in Italy,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Freeborn added. “[The Israelis] have very realistic targets and surface threats that we can train against.” The overall scope of the event has dramatically changed since the first Blue Flag in 2013. That exercise only had participants from Israel, Greece, Italy, and the United States. Poland joined the event in 2015 , but the 2017 drill is the first time French, German, and Indian personnel are taking part. A private contractor is also helping with logistics, something that hasn’t been necessary before, because of the increased size of the event. An Israeli Air Force F-16 takes off for a mission during Blue Flag 2013., USAF The IAF stressed the significant of having Luftwaffe fighter jets flying over Israeli skies for the first time. Relations between the two countries have been steadily growing closer for decades, but always under the constant shadow of the Nazi regime and the Holocaust . “Seeing the Luftwaffe airplanes entering our hangars – it’s something I’ll always remember,” the IAF’s Colonel Itamar said, according to The Times of Israel . “It’s sensitive. It’s emotional. The past can’t be changed.” A Luftwaffe Eurofighter Typhoon touches down at Uvda Air Force Base for Blue Flag 2017., AP Photo/Ariel Schalit It’s also the first time that actual Israeli Patriot surface-to-air missile systems have been employed as a surrogate threat. In the past, equipment such as the U.S. military’s Joint Threat Emitter , or JTE, which can reproduce the kind of threatening transmissions associated with various types of anti-aircraft systems,  would have provided this capability. It is possible that the United States has also deployed JTEs to Blue Flag 2017 to expand the range of simulated threats available during the various scenarios or that the Israelis are employing their own, similar systems. The Israeli Patriot crews themselves will simulate attacks, but not actually fire missiles during the exercise. Notably the unit involved is normally tasked with defending the airspace around Dimona , an area that is also home to Israel’s Negev Nuclear Research Center , and they say they’ve been proving to be more than a match for the aircraft flying above. “[We have been] very successful in the amount of interceptions we’ve had,” the battery commander said, according to The Times . As of the second day of the drills, “everything we’ve been allowed to target, we’ve knocked down.” An Israeli Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher on display to press during Blue Flag 2017., Sara Lemel/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Israel insists that Blue Flag is intended to improve ties between the country and its allies, promote exchanges between the participants, and help them train to operate together in the future, rather than as a signal to any particular country in the Middle East or elsewhere. It’s hard not to see it in that context, however, given the present state of affairs throughout the region. There are number of geopolitical crises brewing, most recently prompted by major political upheaval in Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the Kingdom has been making i ncreasingly hard line statements toward Iran, Lebanon, and the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah , which the government in Tehran actively supports. The regime in Riyadh has not effectively accused Iran of directly enabling a Yemeni ballistic missile attack on the Saudi Capital after years of supporting Houthi rebels in that country. The United States has now joined the fray, suggesting there is evidence to support that claim. One of the Israeli Air Force’s uniquely modified F-15C Bazs sits inside an hardened aircraft shelter at Uvda Air Force Base during Blue Flag 2017., Sara Lemel/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP In October 2017, the United States announced its own major policy changes with respect to Iran, decrying its provocative ballistic missile developments in particular. In September 2017, the U.S. military formally opened its first ever permanent base in Israel, as well, which appears to be linked to increasing ballistic missile defenses against a potential Iranian attack. The IAF itself has been conducting a steady stream of punitive attacks against the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad, which is also receiving support from Iran and Hezbollah . Many of these operations have been focused specifically on attacking shipments of advanced weapons bound for Hezbollah , which continues to threaten Israel . But in September 2017, Israeli jets reportedly attacked the Syrian Scientific Studies and Researchers Center in Masyaf, which is in charge of that country’s chemical weapons and ballistic missile programs. Israel’s air defenders have been hard at work too, even intercepting a surface-to-air missile the Syrians launched during one of the air raids. In the midst of all of this, Blue Flag 2017 is “without a specific target or mission, but is based on friendship,” Colonel Itamar said. “Our aim is not to win or lose, but to learn.” But the lessons from a major event like this would undoubtedly be valuable in any real world crisis that might erupt in the Middle East or beyond.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Declassified Document Shows Reagan Had the NSA Monitor Vietnam for Details on POW/MIAs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a simple coincidence, U.S. President Donald Trump will spend Veterans Day 2017 in Vietnam, underscoring just how much the relationship between the two countries has changed in more than four decades. If anything, he is likely to laud the Vietnamese for their help in resolving the long-standing and controversial issue of American prisoners of war and those still listed as missing in action during the fighting in Southeast Asia . But while there is absolutely no evidence to support the idea that there are still any U.S. POWs alive in the region, declassified documents show that the United States put the full power of the intelligence community to work for years so as to be absolutely sure this was the case. In the Summer 1984, as he campaigned for a second term, U.S. President Ronald Reagan personally ordered the National Security Agency and other elements of the U.S. signals intelligence community to gather as much information as possible about the potential status of Americans MIA in South East Asia. In response, U.S. Army and Air Force personnel at the Field Station Kunia listening post in Hawaii dutifully tuned their equipment toward targets in Vietnam. “For a period of 6 months, USM-2 was assigned the mission of searching out and exploiting Vietnamese communications that might contain information on the issue,” a heavily redacted annual history of the U.S. Army’s Intelligence and Security Command for the 1985 fiscal year explained. “Upon receipt of the message, USM·2 and its Air Force counterpart, USA-32, organized a Joint task force of 39 Army and 50 Air Force operators and 22 Army analysts.” A private individual obtained a copy of the historical review through a Freedom of Information Act Request. Government transparency website GovernmentAttic.org posted a copy online in October 2017. US President Ronald Reagan salutes supporters at the 1988 Republican National Convention., Arnie Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP “USM-2” and “USA-32” are known as Signals Intelligence Activity Designators, or SIGADs, which are codes for specific elements within a particular field station, which could be a fixed base on land or a spy ship. These abbreviations are used by intelligence agencies in all the members of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence bloc, which includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. When one activity shuts down, agencies are free to reuse the SIGAD again. The Army’s USM-2 operated from a site in Petaluma, California until 1971. In 1980, it stood up again at Kunia, as did the Air Force’s USA-32. The USA-32 element had actually been inside South Vietnam previously, situated within the American base at Da Nang until 1973, according to a declassified and heavily redacted internal NSA news item . U.S. President Jimmy Carter had ordered the expansion of signals intelligence capabilities in response to a number of growing worldwide security concerns, including the crisis in Iran and Communist insurgencies in Latin America. After taking office in 1981, Reagan had pushed for more funding to further improve their capabilities. The Kunia facility itself dates back to World War II, when the U.S. military decided to build a massive, bomb proof underground bunker following Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Originally known as the Kunia Tunnel , it subsequently became Field Station Kunia, and then the NSA’s Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC). The U.S. Navy took over management of the site in 1995. A view of the entrance to the KRSOC “tunnel” in 1998., USN via Cryptome According to the INSCOM history, in July 1985, Kunia began using a new intelligence collection and distribution system, the name of which remains classified. This allowed the site to expand its capacity and take on additional missions – one of which would have been what the Army described as the “Southeast Asia Development Mission,” regarding the POW/MIA issue. That Reagan personally initiated the intelligence operation in 1984 isn’t particularly surprising. At the time, it remained a hot button issue . This was true especially within veterans communities, who were skeptical of the U.S. government’s insistence that no one had gotten left behind as the country had extricated itself from a messy and unpopular war. In 1983, the President had first proclaimed National POW/MIA Recognition Day, which the United States now observers every year on the third Friday in September . Politicians and activists were still publishing accounts from anonymous sources describing active prison camps in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia full of U.S. troops. US Air Force Technical Sergeant James Cook salutes the flag from his stretcher as he is carried aboard a C-141 tranport during Operation Homecoming, the repatriation of US prisoners of war from North Vietnam in 1973., USAF There has never been any confirmed evidence that these reports were true, but conspiracy theories remain widespread about the fate of hundreds of still missing American military personnel. So, turning already expanding intelligence resources to look into the matter, even if briefly, undoubtedly seemed liked a good idea to Reagan, who would go on to declare the final accounting of the living and the dead at one point as “ the highest national priority .” That listening posts as far away as Hawaii can pick up high frequency transmission from as far away as Vietnam is itself down just to physics. To work at all, these long-range communication systems bounce radio waves off of the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere. As a result, intelligence agencies can build huge antenna arrays on the ground to stand ready to collect those signals as they come flying back down to earth. Some of the most notable of these were the eight AN/FLR-9 systems the United States put in place across the Pacific and Europe. An undated aerial shot of the AN/FLR-9 “Elephant Cage” at Field Station Augsburg in Germany., US Army The United States has steadily dismantled these antenna farms , nicknamed “ Elephant Cages ” because of their large and odd appearance, as signal scooping satellites and spy planes became more powerful and available. In 1997, authorities in the Philippines turned the setup at the former U.S.-operated Clark Air Base into an amphitheater . From Kunia, Army and Air Force intelligence specialists listened in on Vietnamese communications for any indication that there might be Americans alive, but MIA somewhere in the region.  As with efforts before and after, it failed to produce any actual details about prisoners or missing individuals. “The [high frequency] manual Morse collection provided by Field Station Kunia against Vietnamese targets exceeded all expectations,” the Army reported in its 1985 history. But “no POW/MIA-related communications were isolated during the period of the project.” Despite the continuing lack of evidence, the belief that American POWs and MIAs remained alive in Southeast Asia persisted and the theme was especially prevalent in entertainment at the time. Popular action television shows like Airwolf and Magnum P.I. wove Vietnam POW and MIA storylines into their overall narratives. Most notably, in 1985, Sylvester Stallone starred in Rambo: First Blood Part II , with a plot that revolved around a government cover up of the issue. At the same time, however, the U.S. government was pushing for improved relations with Vietnam and increased cooperation in locating remains of American service members. The Reagan Administration sent a POW/MIA special envoy, U.S. Army General John Vessey, on various rips to the region, beginning in 1987 . In 1991, under President George H.W. Bush, the United States opened an American satellite office for MIA affairs in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. A year later, the U.S. government began conducting large-scale recovery efforts in coordination with authorities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, which continue to this day. Most recently, in September 2017, the Pentagon’s dedicated Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA, announced it had released the remains of U.S. Air Force Colonel Martin R. Scott, who died when North Vietnamese forces shot his F-4C Phantom II down in 1966, to his family for burial. American and Vietnamese personnel had first begun recovering the remains in 2014 and then finished delivery of them for laboratory tests in 2016. In July 2017, DPAA said it had identified the remains of U.S. Air Force Captain Robert E. Holton, the pilot of an F-4D Phantom II that went down in Laos in 1969. He is the most recent individual the organization has accounted for from the Vietnam War. DPAA is responsible for such work broadly and continues to identify the remains of American personnel who died during World War II and the Korean War, as well.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 26, 2018",Marines Are Buying “M007” Glocks For Special Agents And Its Elite Helicopter Unit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Marine Corps criminal investigative special agents and members of the service’s highly specialized Helicopter Squadron One , which provide support to the President of the United States and other top officials, are getting new Glock 19M 9mm pistols . The Corps says it is issuing the guns specifically to personnel who have the need to carry a concealed weapon and has named them, in an homage to a certain fictional secret agent , the M007 Concealed Carry Weapon. But beyond the concealed carry requirement, the type is becoming increasingly popular throughout the service. The Marine Corps System Command first got the requirement for the pistols in April 2016 and began distributing them to the appropriate personnel in May 2017. In February 2015, the service had approved the Glock 19 as a sidearm option for individuals assigned to Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). By that point, various other special operations forces, including, but not limited to U.S. Army Special Forces, Navy SEALs, and special operations Airmen, were already carrying the pistols. Compared to the M9 Beretta, which is still the standard sidearm for Marines, “the M007 has a smaller frame and is easier to conceal, making it a natural selection to meet the … concealed carry weapon requirement,” U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Brian Nelson, who is in charge of the pistol project, said in a statement . “The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that of the two, for the concealed carry handgun mission, the Glock is a better tool for that,” U.S. Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 5 Christian Wade, a “gunner” or weapons expert with the 2nd Marine Division who advises senior leaders about such decisions, said separately, according to Marine Corps Times . A Generation 4 Glock 19, similar to the Generation 5-based Glock 19M., Glock With an overall length of just under 7.4 inches and a width of less than 1.2 inches, a typical Glock 19 is more than an inch shorter overall than the M9 and more than three tenths of a inch narrower. Thanks to its lightweight polymer frame, the gun weighs less with a full 15-round magazine than the Beretta does when it’s empty. These features make it an ideal alternative for an individual who has a requirement to carry a weapon concealed under their clothing but still needs substantial firepower. The 19M version has improved ergonomics, ambidextrous features, and a special magazine well with a flared opening to make it easier to reload under stress. Picking up the Glocks makes good sense for U.S. Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division, or USMC CID , which has approximately 300 personnel. In addition to traditional law enforcement roles, the agency provides special agents for personal protective details and other duties that might necessitate having a discreet weapon. Marines train with the service’s standard Beretta M9 pistol., USMC It’s less clear which members of Helicopter Squadron One, also known as HMX-1, would necessarily have a need of a concealed weapon. The unit does have a particularly specialized mission , being responsible for transporting the President of the United States, their family, and their top advisors around in its iconic white-topped VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters . It also shuttles around other VIPs and aides, secret service members , and members of the White House press pool around in a fleet of “green top” MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors and performs test and evaluation functions, as well. HMX-1 also has its own specialized, rapid response security component, which consists of personnel able to perform a variety of specialized law enforcement and counter-terrorism type roles in support of the unit’s mission. These individuals receive training at U.S. military police schools, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other law enforcement entities. But when the President climbs aboard one of the helicopters, which then takes on the callsign “ Marine One ,” the secret service is there to provide close protection. And there would be no apparent need for the uniformed Marine aviators, aircrews, and security team members to carry a concealed sidearm. It is possible that HMX-1 had a need for a compact  weapon for their day-to-day duties or planned to evaluate it as a standard pistol for aircrews as part of their test and evaluation mission. The Marine Corps may have decided  this was a similar enough requirement to the USMC CID’s actual  concealed carry need and lumped the two together when it went out to buy an appropriate pistol. A Marine Corps law enforcement agent, carrying an M1911-type pistol, watches a hallway during a joint training with members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., USMC Whatever the case, the purchases continue a trend of U.S. military units buying relatively small numbers of Glocks for elite and specialized elements. The Glock 19 had already quietly become a favorite among special operators over both the M9 and other so-called “non-standard” options, including modernized versions of the venerable .45 caliber M1911 pistol . The Glock 19’s utility for concealed carry situations and other discreet operations is well established and it is also well established that the M9 is not well suited to such use. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Army began buying compact Sig P228 9mm pistols , which it designated the M11, as an alternative for law enforcement special agent and other services followed suit. It’s interesting to note that Glock lost out in both the M9 and M11 competitions. US Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel train with M11 pistols., USN Special operations forces in particular have long been fond of the Austrian design. The U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has bought a significant number of Glock 19s over the years for various units as part of a program dubbed the Family of Low Visibility Concealable Pistols. But it hasn’t always been easy to find available funds to buy the guns. In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security agreed to transfer 2,500 Glock 19s to SOCOM, which it ostensibly wrote off as a cost cutting measure . In 2015, after MARSOC decided to begin issuing the pistol, the Marines made their own arrangement with the Army, which had been buying Glocks of various types on behalf of American allies overseas. To speed up this latest acquisition, the Marine Corps was able to team up with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a joint purchase . Glock 19s were already a standard sidearm within the Bureau and is popular among American Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in general. A US Army soldier assigned to the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center’s Sniper School fires a Glock 19 during a competition., US Army This latest buy appears to be the first time a U.S. military service has given a Glock an official nomenclature, albeit a decidedly non-standard one – we at The War Zone are unaware of any other U.S. military designation, past or present, using an “M00X” format. It remains to be seen if calling them M007s will help expedite future purchases. Chief Warrant Officer Wade stressed to Marine Corps Times that the pistols are only an interim solution until the service can decide on a new standard sidearm across the board. In January 2017, the U.S. Army chose a variant of the 9mm Sig P320 , rejecting an offering from Glock, as its new standard handgun, which will be known as the M17. There will also be a compact M18 version for general officers and other select soldiers. The Marines have yet to make their own decision. The US Army’s new M17 pistol., US Army With the M007 entering even limited service and the guns already in the hands of MARSOC operators, the Glock 19 may have an edge in any future Marine pistol competition. In addition, the service has approved Wade’s request to arm Marines deploying to Afghanistan with the guns. Once in country, those personnel will be conducting advisory missions, which may call for them to be situated within command centers or other smaller headquarters or offices. Insider attacks against foreign troops are unfortunately common and a more compact sidearm would easily be a worthwhile weapon to have close at hand. If the guns develop enough of a following from this relatively limited use, it might push the Marines to adopt the guns more broadly. This is something we’ve already seen with regards to the Heckler and Koch 416 rifle , which the Marine Corps is now looking into adopting as a standard service weapon after issuing it initially only to certain members of infantry squads. It may not be long before even more Marines start carrying “007s.” We’ve also reached out to HMX-1 to see if the unit can give us any more information about its particular requirement and we will be sure to update this story if we hear back.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 31, 2019",Three Navy Carriers Will Train Together Amid Concerns About Overall Readiness,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To coincide with the end of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tour of Asia, the U.S. Navy will conduct a rare, massive naval exercise in the Western Pacific region involving three aircraft carrier strike groups . Undoubtedly a show of force aimed America’s regional opponents and rivals, chiefly North Korea and China , the drill comes amid concerns about the service’s overall readiness and news that seven of its 11 carriers, including the still in testing USS Gerald R. Ford , are presently at sea. Beginning on Nov. 11, 2017, at which time Trump will be in Vietnam, the carriers USS Nimitz , USS Ronald Reagan , and USS Theodore Roosevelt , along with their air wings and escorts, will train to perform a variety of tasks, including, but not limited to defensive air combat and ship-based air defense, maritime surveillance, close-in coordinated maneuvers, and replenishing supplies at sea. This is the first time three strike groups have joined together for drills in the Pacific since Exercise Valiant Shield 2007 off the coast of Guam. “It is a rare opportunity to train with two aircraft carriers together, and even rarer to be able to train with three,” U.S. Navy Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in a statement . “Multiple carrier strike force operations are very complex, and this exercise in the Western Pacific is a strong testament to the U.S. Pacific Fleet’s unique ability and ironclad commitment to the continued security and stability of the region.” The U.S. military has stressed that, officially , the maneuvers are not targeted at any particular country in the region, such as North Korea. The United States has been locked in a steadily escalating war of words with the reclusive communist regime and its premier, Kim Jong-Un, over a series of increasingly provocative North Korean ballistic missile launches and the test of a thermonuclear weapon earlier in 2017. USS Nimitz , USS Kitty Hawk , and USS John C. Stennis sail together with other ships underneath a formation of US Navy and Air Force aircraft during Valiant Shield 2007., USN That being said, the Navy did note that similar gatherings in the past were specifically to demonstrate the service’s ability to bring together a large force “in response to any regional situation.” And this formality notwithstanding, it is impossible to see the exercise any other way. Trump himself highlighted the carriers among America’s military capabilities in the region that could respond to a crisis on the Korean Peninsula in a speech to South Korea’s National Assembly on Nov. 7, 2017. “Currently stationed in the vicinity of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets,” the American president boasted . “I want peace through strength.” It is important to note that the Navy has not yet begun to field its F-35C fighter jets and none of its carriers presently have Joint Strike Fighters on board. The F/A-18C/D Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet continue to be the backbone of the service’s carrier air wings. The U.S. Air Force and the Marine Corps do have their F-35A and B models , respectively, situated in Japan. F/A-18C Hornets fly in front of the USS Theodore Roosevelt as she sails in the Pacific Ocean in October 2017., USN Though largely antiquated, North Korea’s dense air defenses mean that stealthy aircraft would likely conduct any air strikes in the opening stages of any military intervention on the Korean Peninsula. The sheer volume of airpower three carriers could bring to bear would still be important over the course of any such operation, though, especially since the carrier strike groups have significant stand-off strike capabilities. Non-stealthy Hornets and Super Hornets could use Stand-Off Land Attack Missile (SLAM) variants of the AGM-84 , as well as the unpowered AGM-154 Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bombs to attack targets from a safer distance. Escorting cruisers, destroyers, and submarines could all launch Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles from off shore, as well. In October 2017, Ronald Reagan made a scheduled visit to South Korea’s port city of Busan, also underscoring America’s commitment to that country and its allies in the region in the face of continued North Korean threats. In March 2017, the USS Carl Vinson had made a stop there, as well. Putting three Nimitz -class aircraft carriers together, each with a crew of approximately 5,500 and more than 60 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, is a significant statement no matter how one looks at it. This isn’t counting the escorts, either. A typical carrier strike group includes a Ticonderoga -class cruiser , two or three Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , and a Los Angeles -class attack submarine . Logistics ships will also be present for the replenishment at sea drills. Other services may take part, as well. During Valiant Shield 2007, Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and B-52 bombers joined the carriers. The USS Carl Vinson in formation with American and South Korean ships in March 2017., USN America’s regional allies are also expected to be present in some form for the major event. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force’s Murasame -class destroyer JS Inazuma is among the foreign ships that will join the exercise, according to Reuters , citing anonymous Japanese officials. As such, the exercise could also send a message to China, which has been steadily working to enforce its vast maritime claims, including in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. At present, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy only has one carrier in total, the Liaoning , though the country is in the process of building a second . The government in Beijing has, however, been steadily fielding other, increasingly capable surface ships and submarines , as well as improving the military capacity and defensive capabilities in and around various man-made islands in the South China Sea. Some of these bases now host bombers capable of carrying stand-off anti-ship weapons and land-based anti-ship missiles . It is worth noting that President Trump did not bring up the issue during public appearances with Chinese President Xi Jingping. It was undoubtedly a conversation behind closed doors, though, and will be an important topic of conversation during the upcoming stops in Vietnam and the Philippines . Both of those countries have significant disputes with the Chinese over claims in the South China Sea. In 2016, China categorically rejected a ruling by an international court that upheld Filipino challenges to Chinese claims. China’s upcoming second aircraft carrier, as yet unnamed, after its launch in April 2017., AP On top of sending messages to potential adversaries, putting the three carriers together in the Pacific right now can be seen as the Navy showing that it is still capable of performing its duties and responding to regional crises. Earlier in 2017, two separate and deadly collisions , which resulted in the deaths of a total of 17 sailors, underscored a dangerous readiness crisis within the service, especially among the ships it has forward deployed in Japan. In September 2017, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer and U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson went before the Senate Armed Services Committee to testify about the situation. Among the details that emerged from those discussions was that the service could only meet 40 percent of the demand for surface warships at any given time , in no small part due to a lack of personnel and budget shortfalls. It later emerged that there was at least a $5 billion maintenance backlog that threatened to keep ships and submarines sidelined for inordinately long periods . Though America’s top naval officials have promised to conduct a major review of operations and implement a host of fixes, it’s unclear how long it will take to get things moving in the right direction. The demand to have ships at sea has not slowed. At the beginning of November 2017, seven of the Navy’s 11 carriers were under way, including the three in the Western Pacific. The Nimitz -class USS Carl Vinson and USS John C. Stennis were conducting training or other tests in the Eastern Pacific, while Nimitz-class USS Abraham Lincoln and the new, first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford were doing the same in the Atlantic. According to USNI News , the last time this occurred was in 2004, when the Navy sent out seven carrier battle groups specifically to demonstrate its ability to “surge” ships in response to a crisis. In 2016, the service had six flattops at sea, which Admiral Richardson called a “milestone event” at the time. Two years earlier, the Navy had announced plans to implement a new, standardized deployment schedule for its carriers, centered on an eight month operational deployment within a total 36 month cycle of maintenance, training, deployment, and downtime. This would have effectively reduced the number of carriers deployed at any one time from the typical three or four to just two. The idea behind this so-called “Optimizing the Fleet Response Plan,” or O-FRP, was specifically to produce more dwell time between deployments to ease the strain on crews, while also attempting to mitigate the impact of budget cuts. Unfortunately, the demands of the campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and other contingencies only increased the demands on the carrier fleet. When the USS George H.W. Bush returned home in November 2014, she had been at sea for nine months, sailed more than 73,000 miles, and performed a host of missions in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. Having Nimitz , Ronald Reagan , and Theodore Roosevelt sailing together, along with members of other American services and foreign allies, will undoubtedly be another impressive display of American military might. At the same time, though, it is another indicator of trends that are likely to become increasingly unsustainable, at least in the near term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 7, 2018","Navy Trims New Missile Sub Cost to $7.2B, But Struggles to Keep Existing Subs Operational","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it had gotten the average cost of each of its future Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines , or SSBNs, down to almost $7.2 billion and that the project is on schedule. The latter point is especially important since the service remains concerned about whether shipyards can deliver boats on time while its existing subs are also struggling to meet operational demands due to a major maintenance backlog. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Michal Jabaley, who is the Program Executive Officer for Submarines made the announcement at the Naval Submarine League’s annual conference earlier in November 2017. The service is planning to buy 12 Columbia -class boats in total to replace the bulk of the Cold War-era Ohio -class, with the lead ship entering service in 2031 if everything continues on schedule. “Through innovative legislative authority and contracting techniques, we’ve already reduced cost by $80 million per hull, to bring [average procurement unit down to $7.21 [billion],” Jabaley said. “So that was a combination of missile tube continuous production … and advance construction, which is pulling key construction activities to the left. Really the focus of that was to reduce the risk of not delivering on time, but it had an added benefit of savings as well.” The special authorities the rear admiral was talking about include Congressional approval of certain procurement plans and the creation of a unique funding stream, known as the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund. Jabaley said he hoped the experience would convince legislators to sign off on additional, non-traditional purchasing mechanisms to help drive the unit cost below $7 billion. The estimated cost of the boats in 2010 was a little more than $6 billion and the program has a unit cost cap of $8 billion. The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Alabama , one of the boats the Navy plans to replace with the Columbia -class., USN The U.S. Navy is already buying missile tube “quad packs” for the Columbia -class at a constant rate. In the past, the service had purchased them only when the construction of the submarine itself reached the appropriate point, leading to small, irregular, and costly orders. In addition, it is sharing the contracts with the United Kingdom, which is using the same launch tubes on its up-coming Dreadnaught -class SSBNs. Both American and British ships will be armed with the Trident D-5 missile . USN Jabaley’s office has saved money by using as many systems as possible from the Virginia -class attack submarine and the Ford -class aircraft carrier on the Columbia design. Congress was therefore amendable to buying these components in cheaper, larger purchases. The special fund has proven more controversial. In order to try and make sure the new missile boats didn’t take money and resources away from conventional surface ships and submarines, Congress created an entirely unique budget line for the program. Shipbuilding, as a general rule, is a time intensive affair that needs significant upfront investments in both infrastructure and a skilled workforce, something that goes double for submarines, which are typically more complex than surface ships. Once the shipyards get going on a particular class, though, it’s easier for them to sustain production and steadily reduce costs, as long as there is demand and adequate funds. So making sure Columbia didn’t disrupt other shipbuilding programs made sense, at least in theory, but only if it came along with an increase to the overall defense budget, which it did not . Lawmakers had historically rejected this kind of budget trickery , which only serves to redirect existing money into different projects, and there were reports that senior Navy officials, including Admiral John Richardson, the present Chief of Naval Operations, the service’s top officer, might have illegally lobbied for its creation. Workers stand inside the tubes of a “quad pack” destined for a Columbia -class boat., General Dynamics Electric Boat Without any extra money in the budget overall, the fund effectively diverted funds to the Navy, while imposing cuts on other the services. As such, there are increasingly serious concerns about the service’s shipbuilding plans and the ability of American shipyards to meet those demands. In September 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a video presentation exploring the worrying decay of Navy shipyards. The top Congressional watchdog noted that the Navy used to have 13 of its own shipyards for shipbuilding and maintenance functions, but now only has four, which is completely inadequate to sustain a modern naval force. The service’s dry docks are, on average, 89 years old and simply not built to handle the needs of modern ships. The situation had already created at least a $5 billion backlog in repairs and it could take decades to create new and appropriate infrastructure. This lack of propriety capacity in turn put more pressure on private contractors to make up for the shortfalls while also building new surface ships and submarines. So it’s not surprising that, in an interview with USNI News on the sidelines of the 2017 Naval Submarine League conference, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral David Johnson strongly implied that the industrial capacity issue would impact whether or not the Columbias arrive on time, independent of other factors. The vice admiral presently serves as the principal military deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition and has previously been in charge of the Virginia -class attack submarine program and head of the Program Executive Office for Submarines. The officer stressed that getting the total time it takes General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding to build Virginias down to 60 months – not counting three months of routine testing and another three months of pre-delivery checks – will be absolutely critical for the service’s submarine production plans. “We have to achieve that if we’re actually going to do Columbia on time and even have anybody want to discuss potentially adding a third ship that’s a Virginia -class.” When the Navy started buying Virginias , the scheduled was one delivery each year. In 2011, the service moved expand this to two a year and there is a hope that shipyards might be able to bump this number up three boats annually the future. The Virginia -class USS Minnesota under construction in 2012., Newport News Shipbuilding This might not be as much of a stretch as one might imagine. The Virginia -class has been a model program, both in terms of efficiency and cost. But that doesn’t mean it’s been immune to the larger shipbuilding issues. The USS Washington entered service behind schedule in October 2017. The future USS Colorado was supposed to be ready in two months earlier, but will now arrive some time in 2018. The decision to try and acquire two of the submarines each year has put a noticeable strain on both shipyards and the subcontractors who supply the necessary components. To keep up with this pace, the Navy has also been pushing steadily toward that 60-month goal for total construction time in its contracting requirements. “Both shipbuilders hired additional people to account for the increase to two submarines per year,” Rear Admiral Jabaley told Defense News in March 2017. “As a result, obviously when you bring in an influx of new people your level of experience goes down.” That sort of experience gap can lead to mistakes, which turn into schedule slips. With the production plans so tightly packed already, even minor issues have the potential to snowball into larger problems. On top of that, General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding are gearing up to start production of both Block V Virginia -class production in 2019 and the Columbias in 2021. The Block V boats will have the so-called Virginia Payload Module (VPM), an additional section with four more missile tubes, each one able to accommodate seven Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles. USN The addition will add nearly $400 million to the price tag for each one of the attack subs and at least some amount of additional work, even though the systems involved are fully mature. This is undoubtedly why Vice Admiral Johnson is so adamant about getting the existing production schedule down to 60 months, since the Virginias could experience new, unforeseen delays when work on Block V starts up, which could possibly cascade down into the separate Columbia production schedule. The new SSBNs are almost certain to hit snags of their own, something that is almost unavoidable when developing and building new ships. In addition, the goal is for the Block V boats to be able to take over for the four conventionally armed Ohio -class guided missile submarines , or SSGNs, specifically to free up the Columbia -class from having to perform this mission. The new missile boats could conduct conventional missions in addition to their nuclear-armed deterrence patrols, but it would put additional strain on the proposed 12 ships – something the Navy could, of course, mitigate, by expanding the size of the class and adding conventionally SSGN armed variants. The service is already working on a conventional, hypersonic boost glide weapon for the Ohio-class that could easily end up ported over to the new missile boats and increase their overall flexibility. There are presently 18 SSBN Ohios in service, including the four conventional SSGNs. Each SSBN has 24 missiles tubes compared to the 16 on the forthcoming Columbias . The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland fires a Trident D-5 ballistic missile during a test in 2016., USN The potential for trouble doesn’t stop when the ships enter service, either. In October 2017, Breaking Defense reported that 15 Los Angeles – and Virginia -class attack submarines had been sitting idle due to a growing backlog of scheduled maintenance work, underscoring the worrying reality GAO had described a month earlier. The subs had been out of action for a combined period of 177 months . The USS Boise had spent the longest time pierside, with the Navy expecting her to be laid up for a total of 31 months. “If you have a submarine that’s tied up in the shipyard, then obviously they’re not operating,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Tofalo, the service’s top submarine officer, told Breaking Defense at the Naval Submarine League conference. “It’s probably most manifest in our ability to surge in time of crisis. We meet our … demand on a day to day basis, but the impact would be, if there’s a crisis, then your surge tank is low.” The Navy as a whole has been beset by shortages of ships, manpower , and other resources, contributing factors in a spate of deadly accidents earlier in 2017 in the Pacific region. Tafalo stressed to Breaking Defense that this readiness crisis was far less pronounced in the submarine community and that submarines were very close to the expected average length of a patrol, which is six months. The service is looking to mitigate these issues and has announced a major review of operations in the wake of the aforementioned mishaps, which resulted in the deaths of a total of 17 sailors. Budget caps and cuts, though, continue to play a major role in limiting what the Navy can do to improve the situation. GAO has already said it thinks the service’s $5 billion estimate of the cost of the maintenance backlog is low and that its suggestion that it would take nearly two decades to reestablish appropriate organic naval shipyard infrastructure is optimistic. Congress is working to pass a new defense budget , but it is likely to take more than one fiscal cycle to begin moving things in the right direction. At the same time, the Navy will have to make sure it keeps its existing submarine production and maintenance as close to the planned schedule as possible, so as not to incur additional costs and delays, which would in turn require even more additional funds. Having an adequate number of submarines ready to go in a crisis is exceptionally important, as well, given their overall flexibility and ability to operate largely unseen for protracted periods of time. This makes them capable of striking time-sensitive targets with less warning than many other platforms – something President Donald Trump has been particularly keen to emphasize with regards to a possible confrontation with North Korea . A test fixture to send and receive radio and missile telemetry data is all that’s visible of the Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Tennessee during a test in 2012., USAF “Currently stationed in the vicinity of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world,” the American president boasted to South Korea’s National Assembly during a speech on Nov. 7, 2017. “In addition, we have nuclear submarines appropriately positioned.” The Navy seems to be doing its best to make sure that stays the case both in East Asia and around the world. Unfortunately, the situation is likely unsustainable unless current trends change dramatically. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 26, 2020",Germany Says the F-35 is the “Preferred Choice” to Replace its Tornados,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite a plan to jointly develop its own fifth generation fighter jet with France, Germany is still very interested in joining the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, is looking hard at the American jet as it presses for purchases of an already in production or development design to replace its aging Panavia Tornado swing-wing combat aircraft. The F-35 is the “ preferred choice ” on a shortlist of aircraft the Luftwaffe is looking at to replace its approximately 85 Tornados, a “senior service official” speaking anonymously under the Chatham House Rule , told Jane’s 360, according to a report on Oct. 8, 2017. In May 2017, Reuters revealed that Germany’s air arm had received a classified briefing on the Joint Strike Fighter as part of the plan. “The Tornado replacement needs to be fifth-generation aircraft that can be detected as late as possible, if at all. It must be able to identify targets from a long way off and to target them as soon as possible,” the German official told Jane’s. “The German Ministry of Defense is looking at several aircraft today, including the F-35 – it is commercially available already, has been ordered by many nations and is being introduced into service today, and has most of the capabilities required.” Based on these requirements, it’s hard to see any alternative to Lockheed Martin’s F-35. China and Russia are the only other countries with flying fifth generation designs, which are simply not realistic options for NATO member Germany. A US Air Force F-35A., Lockheed Martin If the Germans were to join the Joint Strike Fighter Program now, given the advanced state of the project, they might be able to escape paying a significant amount for the aircraft’s continued development . In addition, the Luftwaffe would be able to benefit from expanding infrastructure to support the jets in Europe. The Netherlands is working to build an engine test and maintenance depot , while the Italians already operate the only final assembly and checkout (FACO) facility on the continent, which is already delivering aircraft to that country’s military. A pair of German Tornados during a training exercise., Bundeswehr These are important considerations as the German military seeks to modernize and otherwise improve its readiness across the board. The functional capabilities of the country’s armed forces had been in steady decline after the end of the Cold War seemed to transform the geopolitical landscape in Europe. Russia’s revanchist foreign policy, which became fully visible when it took over Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, has stood this calculus on its head. The Luftwaffe’s desire for a fifth generation Tornado replacement is likely at least in part based on concerns about the growing scale and range of the Kremlin’s integrated air defenses, which include long-range surface-to-air missiles and associated radars situated along its western borders, in its Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea , and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. In response, Germany has moved to revitalize its armed forces. The country upped its annual defense spending by 2 billion Euros in 2017 – just more than $2.32 billion at the rate of exchange at the time of writing – and expected that to rise to almost $40 billion Euros – nearly $4.65 billion – by 2020. But this has to cover a wide array of new equipment and improvements to existing systems. And the Luftwaffe needs a replacement for the Cold War-era Tornados, an Anglo-German-Italian joint development, as soon as possible. In 2014, Der Spiegal , citing a leaked government report , said only 66 of the aircraft were airworthy at all and that less than 40 were combat ready. A year after that, Deutsche Welle obtained another review that showed the fleet’s readiness has slipped even further, with only 29 available for actual operations. The state of the jets has been on full display since the Luftwaffe started flying the aircraft on reconnaissance missions against ISIS terrorists in Iraq in January 2016. Germany initially deployed six of the planes to Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base, but a political spat forced it to move the contingent to Jordan in October 2017. By that point, the total number of Tornados on hand had dwindled to just four . Previous reports have suggested that the Germans were looking to retire the old swing-wing jets no later than 2035, but the official stressed to Jane’s that this was the estimate for when the last aircraft would have to head to the bone yard and that the process would have to start much earlier. “The timeframe suggests we need to start introducing successor in about 2025 to cover the Tornado retirement in 2030 – we need a five-year transition phase,” they explained. “That is only seven years away, and so it is very unlikely that industry could develop and introduce an entirely new aircraft type that fulfils the functionalities that we require.” This assessment isn’t wrong, especially with regards to fifth generation fighter jets. As we at the War Zone have noted in the past, the development cycles for this type of aircraft have proven to be long, complex, and almost prohibitively costly for many countries. Though the Germans announced they would be working with the French on a clean-sheet design in July 2017, this aircraft wouldn’t likely arrive until sometime between 2030 and 2040 at the earliest. This is when European consortium Airbus estimated it would be able to deliver on a fifth generation concept in response to an earlier German-Spanish requirement, which it dubbed Future Combat Air System (FCAS), according to a public presentation the company made in 2016. Airbus Airbus is now pushing ahead with FCAS in response to the new Franco-German plan. The proposal incorporates both manned and unmanned components, all linked together, sharing information back and forth, as well as draw additional information from separate platforms in the air, on the ground, or in space. As such, the European aviation consortium says the proposed stealth fighter jet component will include powerful sensors and data links, easy to upgrade software that makes use of artificial intelligence to aid in decision making, the necessary cyber security protections to prevent hostile actors from breaking into the overarching network . There are even plans to add a directed energy weapon, though Airbus has not made clear if this would be an offensive or defensive system . Just getting the aircraft is only one part of the picture, though. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has repeatedly highlighted , the high costs associated with operating and maintaining fifth generation aircraft. The F-35 in particular has already shown itself to have particularly complicated maintenance and logistics chains. This is in no small part due reliance on Lockheed Martin’s Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which is both at the core of the Joint Strike Fighter’s internal computer brain and is the basis of the cloud-based network that supports the jets and their operations. In October 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a scathing report on this sustainment infrastructure as it applies to American F-35s, having found that at any time, on average, more than 20 percent of the existing U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps jets were not flyable at all because of a lack of appropriate spare parts. All of this begs the question of whether any F-35s the Luftwaffe might acquire would be truly combat ready by the time it needs them to take over for the Tornados. And with the parallel plans to replace its Eurofighter Typhoons with an Anglo-French fifth generation fighter jet, Germany could be looking at having to manage the combined costs of supporting two distinct types of highly advanced aircraft. On top of that, unless France and Germany were to find additional partners, they would be stuck with the entire bill – almost certain to be in the 10s of billions of dollars for research and development alone – for the fifth generation Typhoon replacement, which could easily require most of, if not all of Berlin’s planned defense budget growth. The F-35 program has been a supremely costly endeavor even with more than a dozen countries contributing already. A Luftwaffe Tornado during testing of the Taurus long-range cruise missile., Bundeswwehr Though its hard to understand why Germany would need two fifth generational designs, Scrapping the Franco-German arrangement could be politically problematic, as well. France’s decision to back out of the Typhoon project and pursue the Dassault Rafale, had long provoked the ire of the remaining parties. By the time any new clean sheet design would be available, it’s not even clear that a manned fighter jet would be the best option. Unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) are advancing at a steady pace and might offer a more cost-effective alternative for various mission sets. As noted, Airbus’ own concept, now known as the Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS), already included a significant pilotless component. All of this could make the German Ministry of Defense hesitant to go with the F-35 as a replacement for its Tornados in the near term, despite any particular service preferences. An in production late fourth generation type, such as the French Rafale , the Swedish Gripen E , Boeing’s F-15 Advanced Eagle , or Lockheed Martin’s own Block 70 F-16 Viper , could be a more attractive option. With regards to the Tornados and their primary air interdiction mission, the F-15 with its heavy bomb load might be the best analogue. Boeing also says it is looking to offer limited low-observable features on its Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which might present another avenue to a more affordable stealthy capability. And though less advanced than the F-35, these aircraft – likely also on the shortlist of options – would offer a significant increase in capability over the Tornados now and would be more than able to support Germany’s immediate domestic and overseas needs. It could even allow the country to expand its ability to take on NATO air policing duties , a job that only its Eurofighters are able to do at all credibly at present. Combined with long-range stand-off weapons, a fourth generation multi-role combat aircraft could still provide an important service in a potential high intensity European conflict , in which Germany would unlikely be operating outside of a coalition of other NATO members, including the United States. German Tornados are already capable of carrying the German-Swedish KEPD 350 Taurus cruise missile. The Germans will have to make a decision one way or another soon, since the Tornados are rapidly heading toward the end of their service lives whether a replacement is ready or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 25, 2019",The Presidential Motorcade Is on Full Display as Trump Tours Asia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When the President of the United States travels abroad, they never do so alone, but rather in the company of a massive security entourage at the ready in case a crisis erupts and America’s commander and chief and other top officials need to rush to a safe location. With tensions on the Korean Peninsula at their highest point in decades , President Donald Trump’s major visits throughout Asia haven’t been any different, with the impressive presidential motorcade in particular on full display. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway previously wrote a special feature breaking down the various components of the motorcade in great detail, which you can find in full here . Trump kicked off the trip with a visit to the state of Hawaii on Nov. 3, 2017. He then moved on to Japan on Nov. 5, 2017, before touching down in South Korea two days later. There are scheduled stops still to come in China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Both the Japanese and South Korean governments, the two American allies right at the forefront of the ongoing crisis with North Korea, rolled out figurative and literal red carpets for the American president. On his first day in South Korea, Trump and the rest of the motorcade drove through the capital Seoul with a large police escort. Reuters’ journalist James Pearson caught the spectacle on video from a great vantage point above street level, which you can see below, as the president passed by what he said were a crowd of supporters of former president Park Geun-hye and protesters, who police kept away from the main thoroughfare. South Korea’s National Assembly impeached Park, who, had taken a hard line stance toward the North and focused efforts on modernizing the country’s military, in December 2016. At least some of her supporters reportedly have a positive view of Trump, who they see as having a similar policy vision. They definitely good a good view of the motorcade. In Pearson’s video, seen below, you can identify most of the key vehicles, as well. You can see the police “sweepers” on motorcycles and patrol car moving ahead of the bulk of the procession, followed by the lead American cars. Behind that, there are the two highly modified presidential limousines, nicknamed “The Beast,” one of which is carrying Trump and other acting as a backup and decoy. The Secret Service refers to the one with the president as the “Stagecoach” and the other as the “Spare. Tyler Rogoway’s earlier feature on the motorcade has a detailed description of the almost James Bond-esque capabilities of these vehicles to make sure they can protect the president, as well as their limitations, including: “The Beast’s defense capabilities include top-level ballistic armoring, night vision/infrared driving systems , a sealed cabin with an independent air supply capable of enduring a nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) attack, and even a supply of the President’s blood type. Other rumored features include infrared smoke-screen and oil slick deployment capability, as well as tear gas dispensers, and, frankly, just about anything you or Tom Clancy can think of. All of this is in addition to a state-of-the-art communications connectivity system, including internet and secure telephone communications. “The Beast,” which was introduced in 2009 during President Obama’s inauguration, has an imposing stance, and looks like the offspring of a Cadillac STS and an MRAP . For all its obvious benefits, this cool-looking Presidential hauler has its detractors . The limousine is more of an armored assault truck than a car, yet it does not benefit from an assault truck’s ground clearance. It can be tricky to maneuver on tight city streets, is said to be extremely heavy, and has broken down while on high profile missions abroad. To be fair, the older model was not immune to breaking down either. After that, there is the armada of black SUVs carrying the president’s own personal security detail, a rapid reaction Counter Assault Teams (CAT), command and control elements, the communications vehicle dubbed “Roadrunner,” intelligence personnel, and even a countermeasures vehicle with various defenses, including an electronic warfare jamming system to help disrupt roadside bombs and small drones. Not immediately apparent is the large work truck carrying the Hazardous Materials Mitigation Unit, which often accompanies the motorcade. There is an additional white van, likely an ambulance, a bus with the press pool, and a number of silver SUVs that could be carrying specialized South Korean security forces, presidential aides, and some of the press pool. As you can see, its not a small affair. On Nov. 4, 2017, the Secret Service Tweeted out about their support for the Asia trip, underscoring the size and scope of just the motorcade. “With #POTUSinAsia we couldn’t very well leave The Beast behind!” the agency’s official Twitter account declared. There were two photos of at least 10 vehicles, including a pair of the hardened presidential limos, inside a massive U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport, attached to the post. Missing were some of the larger trucks, such as Hazardous Materials Unit, which would have been traveling along in another military cargo plane. Even more transports would have been been necessary to ferry helicopters and other equipment essential for the trip to Japan and then on to South Korea and beyond. In Japan, the U.S. Marine Corps’ VH-3D presidential helicopters , more commonly known as Marine One , flew Trump around to various meetings and engagements. In South Korea, the President, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Army General Vincent Brooks, in charge of all American personnel in the country, made use of one of the Marine’s VH-60N “White Hawks.” The Marine Corps’ Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) is in charge of flying these aircraft at home and abroad. President Donald Trump, along with Rex Tillerson and U.S. Army General Vincent Brooks prepare to board a VH-60N “White Hawk” in South Korea., The White House Trump is, of course, flying throughout the region on Air Force One, the common name for one of two VC-25A when the President in on board, both of which are highly modified presidential aircraft . Notably, the other aircraft has been accompanying the president, which reporters have spotted flying in loose formation with its sibling, in order to provide a spare in case of a maintenance issue or some other emergency. And it doesn’t stop there, the full weight of the U.S. military, as well as federal law enforcement, routinely supports major president trips at home and overseas, something we have explored in detail many times. In December 2016, Tyler Rogoway explained : The truth is that when the President travels, regardless of the aircraft her or she is in, so do a pair of Marine One helicopters via C-17, and the Presidential motorcade via C-5 or a series of C-17s. This is for every stop, everywhere. If the Marine One helicopters being used instead of the motorcade, MV-22 Ospreys also either self-deploy to the location or get airlifted by heavy transport. On top of this, many other people associated with the White House and Secret Service fly commercial or on other government aircraft. A spare command and control aircraft, usually a C-20C, also is deployed to an airfield nearby. With all these moving parts, each leg of each mission costs many hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, just in air transport costs alone. When flying overseas, this aerial ballet turns into a flash mob, with an entire Air Force traveling alongside Air Force One. These aircraft include multiple C-5s, C-17s, MV-22s, VH-3Ds, VH-60Ns, C-20s, C-32s, C-37s and E-4Bs. Even E-6B Mercuries support these missions. Many of these aircraft are kept out of the public’s line of sight. International trips can cost many millions of dollars per-leg. So Air Force One, even with its brutally high operating costs, is just one piece in the larger—and much more costly—Presidential airlift puzzle. Especially given the tense situation simmering over North Korea’s provocative missile launches and hydrogen bomb test , it was not surprising to see an E-4B Nightwatch command and control aircraft shadow Trump to Asia. The jet landed at Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa to support the President’s mission. The E-4B never lands at the same airport as the President and is usually located at within a few hundred miles of the primary visit location. It is likely that more aircraft are on standby at various locations throughout the region in case of a crisis during the trip, as part of long-running so-called “ continuity of government ” protocols, as well as to support routine contingency plans . Other aircraft also tag along with the President’s aerial armada while in the region, such as C-40s and C-32s, used to carry extra White House staff, security, press, and key players from around the region. President Donald Trump waves before getting into “The Beast” in Hawaii., The White House Noting that the propaganda value of doing so could be huge, officials and independent experts have suggested the North Koreans might conduct one or more provocative weapons tests during Trump’s trip to the region. There would also be a significant risk of touching off an actual conflict. So far, thankfully, Kim has not decided to flex his military muscles. The American president missed his own opportunity to make a personal show of force when he had to turn back from a planned visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two countries due to bad weather on Nov. 7, 2017. In April 2017, Vice President Mike Pence went to the DMZ famously looked sternly across the border. Hopefully, the rest of the trip, which wraps up on Nov. 14, 2017, will be as uneventful and we won’t have to see the full capabilities of the motorcade or the rest of the security apparatus supporting the Asia tour in action.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",China Shows Off Hypersonic Vehicle Test Model After US Navy Weapon Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Chinese state media has shown what appears to be the first ever images of a physical test object associated with the design of the WU-14 hypersonic glide vehicle, also known as the DF-ZF. Though the two events did not appear to be related, this followed the U.S. Navy’s official disclosure that it had successfully test fired a hypersonic missile design of its own that could fit inside the standard launch tube on an Ohio -class submarine . On Oct. 8, 2017, state-run broadcaster China Central Television, or CCTV, aired a special that dealt in part with the country’s JF-12 hypersonic wind tunnel . This is the largest testing setup of its kind in the world and can produce air speeds up to Mach 9 thanks to its pulse detonation engine. Interestingly, visible at one point in the presentation was a test shape that looks very similar to artist’s renderings and mockups of the DF-ZF hypersonic vehicle , which is likely the first time the Chinese government has shown an actual test article associated with the program. There are also computer-generated renderings of what appears to be a blended wing body aircraft or drone and a clip of technicians work on what could be a reentry vehicle, or a representative test shape of one, for a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. On Twitter, Raymond Wang, a graduate research assistant at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who was among the first to spot the object, noted that the narrator never specifically mentions the DF-ZF or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles at any point. Wang also highlighted that the wind tunnel appeared to have significantly sharper angles than any known mockup of the Chinese design. The DF-ZF has likely been in development since at least 2013. In January 2014, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced a successful test of a hypersonic vehicle for “scientific” purposes. Since then, there have been at least five more launches, with the most recent event reportedly occurring in April 2016. The Chinese have never officially disclosed the exact purpose of the vehicle, but it could have a wide range of both strategic and tactical applications. We at The War Zone touched on these various capabilities when we examined the potentially game changing nature of hypersonic weapons – which fly at speeds five times the speed of sound or faster, by definition, and don’t have a largely predictable trajectory like most long-range, ballistic missiles – in depth, which you can find here . Below is the CCTV clip with the images in question. You can fast-forward to the 7:38 mark to see them if the video does not automatically start there. https://youtube.com/watch?v=54Xd3RonFC0 For China, hypersonic craft could help make sure the United States’ ballistic missile defense shield doesn’t undermine the credibility of the country’s nuclear deterrent. Such a design could also present a short- or no-notice conventional threat to an opponent, even in a more remote area, such as the South China Sea . Like maneuvering ballistic missiles , many have suggested a Chinese hypersonic design could be a legitimate challenge to the power of American aircraft carrier strike groups and other surface warships in various parts of the Western Pacific. These characteristics would makes this class of weapon ideal for strikes on mobile targets that can rapidly reposition themselves, as well as for other time sensitive attacks, too. A hypersonic vehicle could conceivably upend established notions of how long it takes a military force to go from identifying a threat to engaging it, even at extremely long distance, allowing for response times measured in minutes rather than hours. This means that it would be easier for China, or anyone else with such a weapon, to turn actionable intelligence about very precise targets, such as leaders of a hostile regime or small groups of high-ranking terrorists, into a conventional stand-off strike. At present, it can take hours, if not days, to get conventional, long-range weapons into position, by which time the window of opportunity for an attack is likely to have closed. An artist’s depiction of the DF-ZF hypersonic boost-glide vehicle., via Wikimedia And while the DF-ZF was an unpowered boost-glide vehicle, essentially a hypersonic glider, experts saw it as a clear stepping stone to an operational weapon system . Though there haven’t been any reported tests of this specific design since 2016, it’s hard to imagine the Chinese military has lost interest in the concept. “I’m concerned about Chinese and Russian hypersonic weapons development, and I expressed those concerns in the right places,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, told American legislators in May 2017. “What we can do is to develop our own hypersonic weapons and improve our defenses against theirs.” The U.S. military has been actively working on hypersonic boost-glide vehicles and powered designs since at least 2003, when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Air Force teamed up on FALCON , or Force Application and Launch from Continental United States, a technology demonstration project. Even earlier experiments date back to the 1960s . In 2017 along, however, there has been a flurry of American hypersonic developments. In May 2017, DARPA hired Boeing to begin work on a potentially revolutionary hypersonic spacecraft called the XS-1. In theory, a large rocket will launch the reusable, plane-like first stage to get it up to speed in the upper atmosphere in order to toss a detachable payload vehicle – which could contain a satellite or a weapon – fully into orbit. Then, in July 2017, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) led the latest test in the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation, or HIFiRE , which also includes representatives from the Australian government and various defense contractors. That same month, the Air Force put out a market research request to gather information about potential extant air-launched hypersonic weapons or associated technologies. The next month, Generation Orbit Launch Services said it was preparing to conduct a number of captive-carry flight tests of its GOLauncher 1 hypersonic test bed. The company has received funding from both the Air Force and NASA to continue its developments. There has also been a lot of talk about larger manned or unmanned hypersonic aircraft . Below is a video of an earlier flight test of Generation Orbit’s Flight Experiments Testbed (FET). But most notably, earlier in November 2017, the U.S. Navy’s Strategic Systems Program (SSP) revealed it had test fired a hypersonic vehicle from the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. Though the service offered few details about the experiment or the craft itself, it is almost certainly a prototype conventional weapon rather than a purely research design. “I’m very proud to report that at 0300 on Monday night SSP flew from Hawaii [Pacific Missile Range Facility] … the first conventional prompt strike missile for the United States Navy in the form factor that would eventually, could eventually be utilized if leadership chooses to do so in an Ohio -class tube,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Terry Benedict, director of SSP, said on Nov. 2, 2017, according to USNI News . “It’s a monumental achievement.” Pentagon spokesperson U.S. Navy Commander Patrick Evans confirmed the test, formally called Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike Flight Experiment-1 (CPS FE-1), to USNI. “The test collected data on hypersonic boost-glide technologies and test-range performance for long-range atmospheric flight,” he explained, suggesting this new vehicle could be another unpowered glider. The Navy will now take that data to help in future ground testing, as well as for modeling and simulating hypersonic flight characteristics. Evans said the design could potentially fit in with a wide array of unspecified “Conventional Prompt Strike concepts.” These would likely be the kind of time-sensitive situations we have previously discussed, including critical enemy facilities, specific weapon systems, or even a specific individual or group of individuals. The Ohio -class guided-missile submarine USS Florida ., USN Arming an the Ohio -class submarine, which can stay largely hidden underwater for weeks at a time, with this type of weapon would only make it more flexible and harder for an opponent to detect and react to the strike. One obvious scenario for one of these hypersonic weapon-armed subs would be as part of the opening salvo of any attempt to neutralize North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities in the event of an actual conflict on the Korean Peninsula. The fast-flying weapons could take out wily ground-mobile ballistic missiles as they are being fueled for launch or air defense sites ahead of sorties by B-2 bombers carrying the GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrators that would be necessary to actually have any chance of hitting at the primary targets, which the North Koreans have buried deep underground , from the air. One of the Ohio -class guided missile boats, the USS Michigan , made a visit to South Korea’s port city of Busan in an apparent show of force in October 2017. It’s unclear whether the Navy is planning to make the hypersonic weapon an option for the four Ohio -class boats configured as conventional missile submarines or for the class as a whole, including the nuclear-capable members. At present, of the legs of the U.S. military’s nuclear triad, only the U.S. Air Force’s strategic bombers have this dual capability mission . Critics have long argued that a hypersonic boost glide vehicle, which requires what is essentially a ballistic missile to get up to speed, could be a destabilizing weapon. Their main concern is that a peer state competitor would detect the launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile and would be unable to distinguish it from a nuclear first strike , and would be likely respond as if it were. Smaller countries with limited deterrent capabilities might feel especially threatened and be likely to adopt a worryingly aggressive alert posture to launch a retaliatory strike just upon detecting a potentially hostile launch, according to a report the RAND Corporation released on the topic in September 2017. The think tank argued broadly for international nonproliferation agreements between countries developing such weapons, akin to nuclear weapons. Using the Ohio -class as the launch platform is only likely to increase these fears, since the conventional-only and nuclear-armed types are virtually indistinguishable, especially to someone tracking them via a long-range sensor at extreme distances, such as with an early warning satellite or underwater sonar network . A counter argument might be that similar fears exist about dual-purpose, long-range cruise missiles, but that the U.S. military has employed conventional types in combat without any dangerous confusion. It certainly hasn’t stopped the United States from pushing ahead with such projects. “We know hypersonic warfighting is here,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Colin Tucker, the military deputy to deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for science, technology, and engineering, told Aviation Week in July 2017, explaining that the service was building a hypersonic weapons roadmap. “We know we have got to get there, and we know we have to get some transition strategies to go forward.” With SSP, there are now three publicly known hypersonic projects in progress. The other two are DARPA’s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG), a successor to FALCON in which Lockheed Martin is seeking to turn those lessons learned into a tactical weapon, and the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon (HAWC). As of July 2017, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin were competing for the latter program, which DAPRA and AFRL are running as a follow-on to tests of the X-51A Waverider hypersonic vehicle that occurred between 2010 and 2013. All of these developments are likely to spur further work in China, as well as other potential near-peer competitors to the United States, such as Russia. It seems likely that we will only continue to see more hypersonic vehicle tests, and reveals of existing technologies, in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 3, 2019",USAF Hires Lockheed Martin to Build a Laser Cannon to Defend Its Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has awarded Lockheed Martin a contract for work on a compact, high-energy laser as part a larger program to develop a directed energy defense system for fighter jets, with tests set to begin in 2021. The Maryland-based defense contractor is already working on a separate airborne laser weapon program for the Missile Defense Agency. On Nov. 6, 2017, Lockheed Martin announced it had received the contract award , valued at more than $26 million, from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The deal appears to cover only the Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments (LANCE) component of the larger Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program. The project also includes development of a turreted beam control system to aim the energy weapon, SHiELD Turret Research in Aero Effects (STRAFE), and of a self-contained pod that will attach both items to the aircraft, called Laser Pod Research & Development (LPRD). “Lockheed Martin continues to rapidly advance laser weapon systems and the technologies that make them possible,” Dr. Rob Afzal, a senior fellow of laser weapon systems at Lockheed Martin, said in a company press release. “The development of high power laser systems like SHiELD show laser weapon system technologies are becoming real.” Beginning in 2021, AFRL plans to put the final SHiELD system through three phases of tests, according to a December 2016 briefing we obtained via The Freedom of Information Act. All of these will include both ground and flight test components. The US Air Force’s broad timeline for laser weapon development, as of 2013., USAF The first phase has three objectives, two of which Air Force censors redacted from the briefing citing their right to withhold sensitive technical information. We do know the final goal is for the system to be able to spot, track, and lock on to “relevant, dynamic targets.” At this point in the program, AFRL does not expect the LANCE laser weapon to be available and will use a surrogate system, which might be a lower power laser that will serve as a pre-targeting pointer. At that stage, the available systems will still go into a fully flight qualified pod with beam and system controls, power source, and cooling equipment. The Air Force again redacted two of the four objectives for the second phase, but it will include a full-up pod with the LANCE system and tests to make sure this works properly with the beam targeting equipment and has adequate power from the on board batteries. Perhaps most importantly, the trials will determine whether or not the laser might dangerously overheat and need additional “thermal management.” An overview of the LANCE portion of the SHiELD program., USAF via FOIA The description of the third phase in the briefing was entirely blacked out, but would likely involve more strenuous testing in an operationally representative environment. In the briefing, AFRL said it hoped to have matured the SHiELD technology to the point where it could support further work on “short- and mid-term capabilities to meet present and emerging [Air Force] needs.” Solid state lasers – which do not rely on liquids or gasses to help produce the beam – have already been shrinking in size and increasing in power for years. In June 2017, Raytheon announced it had successfully demonstrated just such a weapon inside a pod on a U.S. Army AH-64 Apache gunship helicopter. The potentially revolutionary nature of a compact solid-state laser defense system on a fighter jet is clear. At present, fighter pilots rely on a combination of electronic warfare systems , a limited number of expendable countermeasures, and low-observable characteristics , the latter of which is not a feature on all designs. The laser would be an ideal replacement for the countermeasures, since it effectively has a bottomless magazine. On larger aircraft, it could supplant directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM), which can only confuse infrared-guided missiles, as well. It is also a much more focused system, with the beam zeroing in straight on the incoming missile instead of simply throwing out electronic “noise” or physical distractions in its general direction, though DIRCM turrets have a similar targeting capability. A directional infrared countermeasures system underneath a KC-135 tanker., USAF Depending on the final beam control design, it is possible that the pilot may be able to cue the weapon with a helmet-mounted sight or even switch it into an automated mode where it spots, tracks, and destroys threats all by itself. Either way, it could help reduce pilot workload in what would have to be an especially tense situation. The Air Force has not said what fighter jets it is interested in integrating with any such system, but a self-contained, podded unit would allow the service to install quickly it on various aircraft. Self-contained and compact, the system would be an perfect addition for future unmanned combat air vehicles . It’s not hard to imagine the Air Force porting the final design over onto other aircraft, such as bombers, aerial tankers, and cargo planes, either. It might help mitigate the increasing vulnerability of these platforms relative to the growing number of stealth aircraft they’re supporting during actual operations . Potential near-peer adversaries such as Russia and China are fielding ever improving long-range air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles , along with their associated search and targeting radars, that could threaten these large, decidedly non-stealthy planes even if they’re flying far away from the primary battlespace. A turreted laser would be far easier to adapt to these existing designs than some sort of add-on low-observable features or other notional “ cloaking devices .” The defensive system could serve as a stepping stone for offensive air-to-air and air-to-ground directed energy weapons, too, something the Air Force has already expressed an interest in for the future. For close air support tasks in particular, the ability to have an aircraft on station for an extended period of time with a “bottomless” magazine and the ability to focus fire on a very small, precise target area could be invaluable, especially for troops dangerous close to the enemy or nearby innocent civilians. US Air Force art depicting a future dogfight with laser weapons., USAF The fact that Lockheed Martin won this contract is not necessarily surprising either, given the company’s extensive work on such systems in the past. In its press release, the firm was quick to point out that it had already delivered a 60 kilowatt-class laser to the U.S. Army to mount on an unspecified ground vehicle earlier in 2017. That service has already conducted numerous tests with a five kilowatt-class directed energy weapon fitted to a modified 8×8 wheeled Styrker armored vehicle, known as the Mobile High Energy Laser (MEHEL). More recently, in October 2017, the defense contractor also picked up a $9.4 million contract from the Missile Defense Agency to work on a Low Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD) that would consist of an advanced solid-state laser on a high-altitude drone. The goal of that separate program, which The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has been following closely , is to explore the potential of an unmanned aircraft to carry a weapon powerful enough to shoot down hostile ballistic missiles during their initial boost phase for flight. “We have demonstrated our ability to use directed energy to counter threats from the ground, and look forward to future tests from the air as part of the SHiELD system,” Dr. Afzal added in his statement. “It’s a completely new and different challenge to get a laser system into a smaller, airborne test platform.” That latter point is important, but one that doesn’t touch on the particularly complex issues of developing a directed energy defense system for aircraft faces significant hurdles. Though a promising concept, an individual laser can only engage one target at a time and a single turret will likely be unable to cover a full 360 degrees around an aircraft. The range and power of the beam is high susceptible to atmospheric conditions, such as clouds and smoke, too. It might be possible to mitigate some of these issues by coupling the final SHiELD system with with advanced electronic warfare jammers. It could also supplement hard-kill miniature interceptor concepts, like the one Northrop Grumman has patented for stealthy aircraft. In 2015, Northrop Grumman had put out concept art of a notional sixth generation fighter jet with a self-defense laser weapon, as well. Depending on how the defensive systems detect and track incoming threats, they may be able to share a common targeting system, as well. Northrop Grumman’s sixth generation fighter jet concept., Northrop Grumman Lockheed has already been working on solutions to at least some of those problems, though. In 2014, the firm tested a so-called Aero-Adaptive, Aero-Optic Beam Control system, or ABC for short , as part of a program run by AFRL and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The ABC turret could compensate for some atmospheric fluctuations, including turbulence, increasing and decreasing the laser’s power as necessary. For test purposes, a Dassault Falcon 10 business jet carried the turreted laser, but Lockheed could likely adapt the system to fit SHiELD’s requirements or in fixed spaces on other aircraft. The Air Force’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter, for example, has significant on board power capacity and significant available room in the fuselage already. The Dassault 10 ABC turret test bed., USAF The basic design makes room for the large vertical lift fan on the Marine Corps’ B model, but this isn’t present on the A variant. Since this space goes through the fuselage, engineers could conceivably create a unitary mount with defense system turrets on the top and bottom, providing a better area of coverage above and below the aircraft. There might be other trade space available by moving one of the internal fuel tanks found on both the A and the U.S. Navy’s C version, as well. A low-resolution artist’s concept of a turreted self-protection system that fits into the empty lift fan space on the F-35A., Northrop Grumman At the moment, Lockheed has only announced its deal to work on the directed energy weapon itself. It might give the company an advantage in securing the contract to work on the beam control and turret components, as well, though. We’ll be sure to keep an eye on this technology demonstration project as it develops and as it becomes clear what other companies might be involved in building the other parts of the complete SHiELD system.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 9, 2018",UAE Could Become the First Middle Eastern Country After Israel to Get the F-35,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite apparent plans to buy advanced Russian fighter jets and the United States rebuffing the requests for years, the United Arab Emirates reportedly remains interested in joining the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program . The U.S. government has had long-standing concerns that such a sale could undermine Israel’s so-called “ qualitative military edge ” in the region, but jet’s controversial and centralized computer brain, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), might actually help soothe those fears. On Nov. 4, 2017, Defense News reported that experts and insiders had made clear that the UAE had a continued desire to buy F-35s, in spite of the United States’ repeated rejections of its requests. The Gulf country has been seeking a preliminary briefing on the program since at least 2011. However, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have already approved a number of politically sensitive arms deals that the previous Administration of President Barak Obama had been inclined to delay or block outright. “The Trump team has agreed to consider the request,” an anonymous former Pentagon official told Defense News. “It’s not a ‘yes’ yet, but I’m pretty sure it’s going to happen once the dust settles.” The “dust” in this case is an ongoing and complex political dispute been a number of traditional American allies in the Middle East, including the UAE, and Qatar, which began in June 2017 and is something we at The War Zone have explored in detail previously . The United States has reportedly been working behind the scenes to smooth over the situation, which has threatened to disrupt American military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Both the UAE and Qatar host thousands of American personnel at major air bases , which are essential to the coalition air campaign against the terrorists, as well other regional counter-terrorism and security efforts . A US Air Force F-35A., USAF It’s not clear how much that dispute has really impacted American arms trade in the region, though. In May 2017, the United States announced plans for a more than $100 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia, which has since led the multi-national boycott and economic blockade against Qatar. The next month, with the crisis in full swing, Qatar confirmed it was moving ahead to buy advanced American F-15QA fighter jets. Earlier in November 2017, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of $1.1 billion support package , including military construction projects to expand the countries air bases, to go along with those aircraft. The Trump administration has made clear that containing Iran and its influence in the Middle East and beyond are among its top policy goals and the UAE is a key partner in that undertaking. Emirati F-35s would serve as a clear deterrent to any overt Iranian military action in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere in the Middle East . In addition, they could be a valuable tool for gathering electronic intelligence on Iranian air defense networks and other capabilities during even routine patrols. Instead, it is the U.S. government’s policy of doing everything in its power to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge that seems to be the real issue keeping the UAE locked out of the F-35 program. Enshrined into American law , the United States has an obligation to make sure that arms sales do not degrade Israeli military superiority over its neighbors, regardless of their relationship with the government in Jerusalem. “The way our policy works now is Israel versus all other Arab countries,” Danny Sebright, president of the U.S.-UAE Business Council, a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group, told Defense News. “But they have no negative intentions toward the Israelis and don’t see themselves going to war with them. And as such, they don’t want decisions being held up based on how other Arab countries may affect Israel’s QME.” In this case, Israel may be increasingly inclined to agree for both political and technical reasons. The UAE shares a number of foreign policy objectives, especially with regards to Iran. In addition, Emirati forces routinely take part in U.S.-led and other multinational counter-terrorism operations against Islamist extremists. And though it does not recognize Israel diplomatically , the government in Abu Dhabi has cultivated increasingly military relations with the country and participates in training exercises with Israel Defense Force (IDF) personnel in third party countries . In March 2017, the Israeli Air Force sent personnel to Greece to join their Greek, Italian, American, and UAE counterparts for an aerial drill called Iniohos 2017, as seen in the video above. But what might finally convince Israel and its political allies in the United States to finally let the UAE into the F-35 club is the IDF’s own unique relationship with the jet. In May 2017, the Israeli Air Force revealed it would be getting a one-of-a-kind Joint Strike Fighter test bed to help develop its own future modifications and upgrades largely independent of the global program’s management. On top of that, Israel is the only country to have secured the rights to conduct its own depot level maintenance, including on engine and airframe components, within the country. One of Israel’s production-standard F-35I aircraft, IAF This means that Israelis F-35Is can operate independently of the world-wide infrastructure that the U.S. military, manufacturer Lockheed Martin, and various third party countries are establishing to support other foreign Joint Strike Fighter operators. Most importantly, Israel’s aircraft will not be dependent on software updates, and the additional capabilities they might provide , that will come through the ALIS cloud-based computer network. At present, the system acts as a loading point for a wide array of data, including both maintenance information about the plane’s figurative “health” and mission planning packages, which include route mapping and the positions of potential threats or hazards. Major patches to the underlying software go into the aircraft the same way. In October 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a damning report detailing continued issues with this interconnected system , which was resulting in more than 20 percent of jets sitting on the ground in a non-flyable condition at any one time just due to a lack of appropriate spare parts. Israel secured its unique arrangement with Lockheed Martin, which may even revival the level of technical information sharing between the company and the U.S. government, after stressing concerns about what would happen if it suddenly got disconnected entirely from this network during a conflict. There is also a fear that ALIS’ centralized nature makes it especially vulnerable to potentially devastating cyber attacks, which you can read more about here . “The ingenious, automated ALIS system that Lockheed Martin has built will be very efficient and cost-effective,” one unnamed Israeli Air Force officer told Defense News in 2016. “But the only downfall is that it was built for countries that don’t have missiles falling on them.” Two of the Israeli Air Force’s F-35Is., IAF Lockheed Martin has not extended this level of access to the F-35’s design and its system architecture to any other country, including stable and reliable American allies such as the United Kingdom and Australia. It seems unlikely that the UAE would be able to extricate itself from the larger online and physical support networks. As such, if the geopolitical environment in the Middle East were to change dramatically, pitting Israel and the UAE against each other for some reason, it would likely be far easier for the United States to limit the latter country’s ability to use its F-35s. The U.S. government could quickly halt access to vital software updates and logistics support or even launch an active cyber attack on the ALIS terminals in the Emirates to try and disable the aircraft or certain core functions. To be sure, the United States does have export controls in place regarding existing types of military aircraft it allows companies to export around the world, but none offer the same potential ability to have an instantaneous impact on a foreign power’s ability to continue operations. The Iranian government has shown how it is possible to circumvent such measures, as well, developing an extensive enterprise to try and reverse engineer and illicitly obtain spare parts to keep various aging fighter jets in the air, most notably its dwindling fleet of Grumman F-14 Tomcats . Of course, how capable those planes would actually be in an conflict against an opponent with even just new fourth generation aircraft, especially advanced designs such as Saudi Arabia’s F-15SAs or Qatar’s F-15QAs , is also debatable. Of course, allowing the UAE to join the Joint Strike Fighter program would also undoubtedly prompt renewed requests from other potentially controversial American partners, both inside the Middle East and elsewhere, chiefly Saudi Arabia . The same technical issues and possible fail-safes would apply to any of those sales, though. Two of F-35Is, still wearing US military markings, head home to Israel for formal delivery in December 2016., USAF If a sale to the UAE did open up the door for an entire new tier of potential F-35 customers, Lockheed Martin could decide to create new, reduced capability “export” version of both ALIS and the aircraft’s on board software. To be sure, the jet’s low-observable features would offer a significant leap in capability for many countries, but with neutered weapon, sensor, and data fusion systems , its actual warfighting ability could be significantly less impressive . The U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps are already facing criticism about just how “ combat ready ” their jets are in reality in light of software delays and other issues . Compared to older fighter jet designs, the complicated, sensitive, and highly-controlled nature of the F-35 design means it would be much harder for a country to decide to break ties with Lockheed Martin and seek out a both willing and able third party company to take over supporting and upgrading the planes, as well. As it stands now, Israel’s F-35I seems to have a qualitative military edge built-in, even when compared to other Joint Strike Fighters. With upheaval across the Middle East and a desire to reinforce its existing partnerships , the United States may finally decide to acquiesce to the UAE’s requests on the understanding that no Emirati Joint Strike Fighter would ever really look or operate like an Israeli one.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",Saudi Arabia Puts Textron’s Scorpion Light Attack Jet Through Its Paces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Saudi Arabia continues its multi-billion dollar international arms shopping spree , it appears to have begun evaluating Textron AirLand’s Scorpion light attack jet . The firm has previously said that the Kingdom is interested in the aircraft, but growing American political opposition to its brutal and protracted intervention in Yemen might slow or scuttle actual purchases. Online flight tracking websites caught one of the Scorpion demonstrators, which presently carries the U.S. civil registration code N532TX, flying from the Royal Saudi Air Force’s King Faisal Air Base (KFAB), which is co-located with the Tabuk Regional Airport, earlier in November 2017. Though the two facilities share a larger complex, KFAB uses an entirely separate runway. Our friends at FlightGlobal, who noticed the jet zipping around in the desert, reported that Textron will almost certainly bring the twin engine jet to the annual Dubai Air Show in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which starts on Nov. 12, 2017. “The capability of what Scorpion can do makes it a very viable product for their [the Saudis] requirements,” Scott Donnelly, Textron’s CEO, said during a conference call with reporters in July 2017. Any deal was “still in its formative stages, I would say,” he added, stressing that there were no formal arrangements at that time. But the Saudis are definitely in the market for an aircraft that meets Scorpion’s description. During U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Kingdom in May 2017, the two countries agreed, at least in principle, to $110 billion in arms deals for the Saudi Arabian military. Textron AirLand’s Scorpion demonstrator N532TX., USAF The arrangements included a planned $2 billion for a fleet of “ light close air support ” planes. We don’t know what the exact requirements for these aircraft might be or how many aircraft in total the Saudis would be looking to buy in total. The proposed purchase was one a number of so-called Memorandums of Intent (MOI), which are offers the U.S. government makes in response to an ally’s expressed interest in certain “potential future defense capabilities.” The deals are not final and would still need final approval from Congress and the State Department. Textron is undoubtedly eager to pitch the Scorpion to the Saudis, as well. The company first began work on the aircraft in 2012 and flew the prototype for the first time in December 2013, but it is still looking for a launch customer after nearly three years. The U.S. Air Force had evaluated the aircraft as part of its light attack experiment, commonly known as OA-X , which ended on Aug. 30, 2017. However, the service made it clear that it did not meet the criteria to proceed to a possible second stage of that project, which has so far failed to materialize anyways. Textron says the plane, which it funded as a private venture, is both cheap to operate and maintain thanks to the use of composite materials, commercial-of-the-shelf components, and a “plug and play” modular design that would allow a customer to readily customize the configuration to their needs and install upgraded avionics and other systems in the future. A pair of readily available Honeywell TFE731 turbofans , more commonly found on commercial business jets , powers the aircraft, as well. Scorpion is also significantly larger and heavier than many potential competitors, especially single engine turboprops.These include Textron’s own AT-6 Wolverine and the ever popular Embraer Super Tucano , as well as an expanding field of even lighter single engine designs derived from crop dusting aircraft . What this means, though, is that the jet can also has a relatively large, reconfigurable mission bay that could accommodate still and video cameras, radar and laser imaging equipment, electronic warfare jammers, or other systems. The demonstration configuration also has a retractable sensor turret under the nose with electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras. The Scoprion’s six underwing pylons can accommodate a variety of weapons, including precision guided bombs and missiles and gun pods. As of June 2017, Textron had already flown the aircraft with the GBU-12/B laser guided bomb and performed a live fire test involving the 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II, or APKWS II , a laser guided rocket. The plans to make the aircraft compatible with the GPS-directed GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) family, as well as the multi-mode Brimstone missile and GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II). A Scorpion prototype fires an APKWS II laser guided rocket., Textron AirLand A Saudi Scorpion with a targeting sensor package and armed with precision guided munitions would be an ideal, low-cost option for its ongoing operations over Yemen, where it is battling Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and their allies. At present, the Kingdom is using its high performance F-15S Eagle and Eurofighter Typhoon multi-role combat aircraft, along with older swing-wing Panavia Tornados , for strikes against the militants. Unlike smaller light attack aircraft such as the AT-6 and Super Tucano, the Scorpion would carry more extensive self-protection options, making it a more viable alternative given the potential anti-aircraft threats in Yemen. While it is unclear just how capable the Houthis’ air defense capabilities are, they do have access to old Yemeni military stocks of SA-2 surface-to-air missiles – many of which they’ve turned into surface-to-surface weapons – and an apparently growing arsenal of shoulder-fired man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS). In January 2016, rebel forces claimed to have shot down a U.S. drone with an SA-2, but this incident remains unconfirmed. In October 2017, the Houthis did shoot down a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper, apparently with a MANPADS. The Saudis have lost nearly a dozen fixed wing aircraft and helicopters since the intervention began in 2015, but insist that these have all been the result of technical faults or other accidents. Most recently, a Royal Saudi Air Force Typhoon went down in Yemen in October 2017 , with the Houthis claiming to have shot it down and the Saudis again denying this was the case. The Saudi-led coalition has also disputed that enemy action was responsible for the loss of Bahraini , Moroccan , UAE combat aircraft in the country or nearby over the course of the operation. A Jordanian F-16 crashed as well, but well within Saudi Arabia . With an air or surface search radar, the Scorpion could also be useful for low-and-slow armed border patrols to guard against terrorists or criminals, including those employing small boats and drones. The aircraft already features a basic weather radar, but could likely accommodate various appropriately sized military units, including advanced pulse Doppler systems such as a member of Leornado’s Grifo family or the Elta EL/M-2032 . Saudi Arabia might particularly appreciate this additional capability, since the Houthis have conducted numerous cross border raids . On top of that, they have launched multiple attacks on coalition ships with anti-ship missiles and apparent explosive-filled remote control boats , begun laying deadly naval mines in the strategic Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, and may be building a fleet of suicidal drones able attack air defense sites and other targets. A Scorpion loaded with precision APKWS II rockets and automatic cannon pods would be a much more cost effective and flexible option to respond to those types of threats than higher performance aircraft and faster to respond than gunship helicopters or ground troops. And a fleet of the light attack aircraft could just help reduce the burden on the Royal Saudi Air Force’s higher performance aircraft or otherwise free them up for other missions, including standing watch against the country’s top regional rival Iran . As interested as the Saudis and Textron might both be in the potential deal, and as useful as the aircraft might be in regards to the present conflict in and around Yemen, politics might ultimately get in the way. There have been steady accusations that the Saudi-led coalition has either conducted itself in general disregard for civilian casualties or actively targeted population centers in Houthi-controlled areas. A Royal Saudi Air Force F-15S, one of the country’s aircraft that are presently flight missions over Yemen., Larry MacDougal/AP In the past, Saudi aircraft in particular appear to have deliberately destroyed medical facilities and other civilian infrastructure protected under international laws covering armed conflict. This has led to reports of mass starvation and horrifying cholera epidemic . As such, members of Congress, Republics and Democrats alike, have become increasingly uncomfortable with U.S. military support for the campaign, which has included aerial refueling and logistics support and increased intelligence sharing. Earlier in November 2017, members of the House of Representatives appeared to have watered down a proposed non-binding resolution on the matter, removing a call to end all U.S. military involvement in Yemen unrelated to the fight against Al Qaeda terrorists or “associated forces,” a definition that doesn’t presently cover the Houthis. The House version of the annual Pentagon defense budget, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, also contains a similar provision . The Senate version of the bill does not have that clause, though, and legislators would have to reconcile the two before the final version could become law. The aftermath of an alleged Saudi air strike that killed civilians in Yemen., Hani Al-Ansi/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP The increasingly political nature of American support of the campaign could hold up arms sales to the Kingdom, though, including any purchases of Scorpion. Though the Trump administration has reversed course on restrictions President Barack Obama had put in place regarding military deals with the government in Riyadh, it appears to have been enough to send the Saudis looking for alternatives. During King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud’s landmark visit to Moscow in October 2017, the monarch and his extensive retinue signed various agreements with their Russian counterparts, including outlining plans for possible arms deals . If the United States appears to be dragging its feet in future deals, the Kremlin could easily try and step in and offer an alternative. The twin engine Yakovlev Yak-130 combat capable trainer would be one possible challenger to the Scorpion.  The reported Saudi deals with Russia don’t include any aircraft at present, but the Kremlin has been making inroads selling advanced combat jet to other traditional American allies in the Middle East, with various sales to Egypt and a possible deal in the works to deliver more than a dozen Su-35S Flanker-E fighter jets to the UAE. Still, depending on how the test flights in Saudi Arabia go, Textron could arrive at the Dubai Air Show with an important announcement about the jet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 21, 2019",This Is All The Stuff You Can Hang Out of a C-130’s Rear Paratrooper Doors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than five decades of steady service, it’s safe to say that Lockheed Martin’s C-130 Hercules family, as well as the civilian L-100 and now LM-100J models , has proven to be an especially versatile design . Its widespread use has prompted a whole associated industry of third party upgrades and add-ons, including one modular system called the Special Airborne Mission Installation and Response (SABIR) in particular, that can turn the aircraft’s rear paratrooper doors into surveillance arrays, communications nodes, even a radio and television broadcast antennas and more. Airdyne , an engineering firm based on Calgary, Canada, has been actively developing SABIR, one of the better known systems, and expanding on what it can do since 2007. Its subsidiary, Airdyne Aerospace, handles the sales and marketing of the equipment, as well as repairs, from its headquarters in Florida. Rather than one single piece of equipment, SABIR is a modular kit that includes a new door, a retractable “arm” able to carry a store weighing up to 400 pounds, and an equipment rack and work station with a seat so a member of the crew can operate the systems now attached to the aircraft. Relatively easy and quick to install, crews can substitute the rig for either the left or right rear paratrooper doors on any C-130, or both. Airdyne’s website says it initially developed the setup for the Hercules specifically, but that it is “platform independent” and able to fit on other aircraft, though the Hercules still appears to be the primary platform. The company says that an aircraft with this rapidly reconfigurable kit could be useful in a variety of military, law enforcement , and civilian roles . Its website lists more than a dozen possible mission sets, including surveillance missions , border patrol, search and rescue, and scientific research . Airdyne Airdyne itself offers a number of modular pods that fit onto the extendable strut, the AS-4 and AS-18, both of which can accept a variety of different sensors, including electro-optical and infrared still and video cameras, imaging and surface search and surveillance radars, laser imaging equipment, and signals intelligence suites. Another option is a wide-area surveillance system that incorporates multiple video cameras to capture imagery across a large swath of land or sea. Analysts can then put imagery together in a large mosaic making it easier to spot routine patterns of enemy movement or changes to the landscape over an extended period of time. Multiple users can exploit different parts of the imagery at one time, and vehicles and even people can be tagged tracked, including “rewinding” past footage and tracing their steps over a period of time. With the retracting arm, which only takes approximately one minute to extend or fold back up, the crew can position the pod well below the aircraft’s fuselage, as well. This reduces physical obstructions and other interference that might limit the range, field of view, intensity, or other capabilities of the sensors on board. Airdyne says that the full SABIR system works with nearly 170 different sensor packages. Airdyne We at The War Zone have written numerous times in the past about the immense value of modular sensor packages, especially for cash-strapped military forces and civilian agencies who might have limited numbers of actual aircraft available, but the need to perform a wide variety of missions. In July 2017, while exploring the U.S. Air Force’s new AgilePod system specifically, I wrote : “This level of modularity makes perfect sense. If the AgilePod works as intended, during actual operations, crews on the ground could quickly swap out gear to better fir the situation at hand rather than having to prepare an entirely different aircraft or even just install a completely different pod. This would reduce the total number of aircraft a unit might need to be able to perform the different mission sets, as well as potentially speeding up the process of getting the appropriate equipment into the air. It would be especially useful for units at forward locations where existing infrastructure and resources may be otherwise limited. … “Of course, individual manned or unmanned aircraft would only be able to perform the missions that the pod is configured for at any one time. However, the multiple stations inside the AgilePod would allow it to carry more than one type of sensor during each mission, which would still provide additional flexibility over some existing configurations. ARFL already has a number of examples within the Air Force and elsewhere in the U.S. military it can look to for evidence of the benefits of similar modular architecture.” So it’s not surprising that SABIR is already in service across the U.S. military, including with the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, as well as U.S. Special Operations Command and the Air National Guard. A number of other countries around the world also operate the system. The Air National Guard in particular has been steadily exploring the versatility of the concept to handle less typical missions. In 2006, the New York Air National Guard turned to Sandia National Laboratories to develop an X-band radar for its LC-130H Hercules, already specially configured to support U.S. government activities in extreme cold weather locales such as Greenland and Antarctica . The 109th Airlift Wing had suffered a number of accidents when crews tried to land on what appeared to be stable ice, only to have the aircraft run into a hidden crevasse . An LC-130H sits snagged in the ice in Antarctica after hitting a hidden crevasse during a landing in December 1998., USAF With the X-band radar, crews could see beneath the top sheet of ice and make sure their impromptu runway was safe before touching down. The 109th used SABIR to attach the equipment to the aircraft. Afterwards, in cooperation with the National Science Foundation and Colombia University, the unit began helping test the “IcePod,” which could carry the radar, along with various other sensors for research purposes. The final design had multiple visual and infrared cameras, radars, and a GPS navigation system, and was able to gather data on ice depth and density and air and surface temperatures, among other information. The IcePod on one of the 109th’s LC-130s., USAF The Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 193rd Special Operations Wing also had a unique requirement, but one that didn’t involve sensors at all. The unit flies the EC-130J Commando Solo variant, a psychological warfare platform that can beam out propaganda radio and television broadcasts over warzones, urging civilians to avoid certain areas or implore them to give up any support they might be giving to the enemy. The only problem was that the Commando Solo conversions were complicated, costly, and would only ever apply to a small fleet. In 2008, the U.S. military decided to trim back the planned fleet from an already paltry six aircraft, down to just three. This left the 193rd with three “slick” C-130 airframes, plus an additional spare, that it suddenly had no idea what to do with. The unit subsequently combined SABIR carrying a pod with a version of a U.S. Army psychological operations broadcasting system. The cost-effective combination meant that these EC-130J aircraft, though less complex than the Commando Solos, could still transmit FM radio, analog and digital television, and even SMS text messages. One of the 193rd Special Operations Wing’s “slick” C-130s with SABIR system., via ThinkDefence The psychological warfare mission highlights SABIR versatility beyond just modular sensor packages. Along with the broadcast equipment, the arm could just as easily accommodate a communications or data sharing hub to help pass information between friendly forces on the ground and in the sky. This could be an especially important capability for smaller militaries that cannot afford to field dedicated aircraft for this mission, such as the U.S. Air Force’s fixed wing E-11 or EQ-4B drone, both of which carry the powerful Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN). Off the battlefield, this capability could be especially useful for more civilian authorities, in particular during a natural disaster that disables a significant amounts the communications infrastructure, including emergency assistance hotlines , or knocks out large portions of the power grid in a particular area. A C-130 flying an orbit with a communications relay could provide a quick substitute system to get first responders and larger government disaster relief agencies back in regular contact with each other so that they can best direct their efforts and quickly share critical information about the overall situation. The possible uses of SABIR as a datalink or communications node., Airdyne With its 400 pound load capacity and a standardized bomb rack, the system could theoretically carry small munitions or other types of stores, as well. In a pinch, a C-130 with SABIR might be able to double as an attack platform or release swarms of small drones able to conduct their own myriad missions . For maritime surveillance and anti-submarine work, Airdyne already offers a sonobouy launcher that fits into the new door. This doesn’t impede the ability of the system to carry other equipment, meaning that crews could have that capability plus a surface search radar for long range patrol operations over the open ocean just on one side of the aircraft. A second SABIR setup on the other size could carry additional sensors. Airdyne According to Airdyne, that same dispenser can accommodate other manually dropped payloads, too. These include the GBU-44/B Viper Strike lightweight glide bomb and small, expendable drones . It could also likely drop research probes, such as the dropsondes storm chasing aircraft drop into hurricanes and other extreme weather patterns to gather data on temperature, wind speed, and various other data. It’s not the first time the U.S. military in particular has explored what it can do by simply swapping out the C-130’s rear paratroop doors. The U.S. Air Force Reserve flies two types of unique aerial spraying C-130s, both of which utilize that space. In the 1970s, the Air Force first started using the Modular Airborne Firefighting System, or MAFFS , consisting of five pressurized tanks than can hold 2,700 gallons of fire retardant chemicals or water. The system fits inside the the main cargo area of a C-130 and dispenses the liquid over large forest and other wildfires through nozzles that poke out through the rear paratrooper doors. In 2007, the Aero Union delivered the first improved MAFFS II, which replaced the five individual tanks with a single unit that also had a large 3,000 gallon capacity. In addition, the new system included two air compressors on board the aircraft, allowing the crew to pressurize the system themselves without the need for a separate piece of ground equipment. In addition to MAFFS, the Air Force Reserve also has a small number of C-130s fitted with the Modular Air Spray System (MASS). This configuration includes spray nozzles fitted in modified paratrooper doors and under the wings. Unlike the fire-fighting MAFSS, MASS crews primarily spray chemicals to control harmful insects or invasive plants. https://youtube.com/watch?v=x5w1VojBD70 In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the aircraft headed to Texas to help control a potentially dangerous explosion in the mosquito population. The planes have have also gone to work after other natural and man-made environmental disasters, including spraying oil dispersing chemicals in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in 2010, which you can see in the video above. In the 1980s, the Air National Guard began flyingh C-130s with a special signals intelligence system called Senior Scout , as well. While, the bulk of the equipment fit inside a container that slides into the main cargo bay, new paratrooper and landing gear bay doors held the antenna farm necessary to spot and monitor enemy emitters. Replacement doors bristling with antennas on a C-130 fitted with the Senior Scout system., via ThinkDefence Ground crews could relatively quickly install all of the equipment onto any C-130 or remove it to put it back to work as a regular airlifter. The modular nature of the system meant that the Air Force built up a few versions, called Senior Warrior, for the U.S. Marine Corps to use on its KC-130 tanker transports during the first Gulf War. The Air National Guard appeared to have retired its remaining Senior Scout systems by 2013. More recently, the U.S. Marine Corps added a new paratrooper door to its KC-130 fitted with the Harvest Hawk weapons kit . Nicknamed the “Derringer Door” for its two weapons launch tubes, crews could fire various lightweight precision guided munitions, include the GBU-44/B and the AGM-176 Griffin missile , from inside the aircraft. Earlier Harvest Hawks had a larger launcher on the rear cargo ramp, but that meant the crew had to depressurize the main cargo compartment in order to use it. The inside of the Derringer Door on a KC-130 Harvest Hawk., Lockheed Martin A Harvest Hawk could conceivably expand its capabilities by using SABIR to combine the stores release capability with a sensor or other additional equipment. At present, the gunships use a modular sensor turret system that fits onto the rear of one of the aircraft’s under wing drop tanks. SABIR could also offer a quick, bolt-on electronic warfare capability , especially when combined with something such as the U.S. Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger precision jamming pod. Many of these systems can double as electronic intelligence suites since they have to be able to locate and monitor enemy signal sources. Intrepid Tiger itself makes use of so-called “open architecture” software that will allow engineers to quickly install upgrades and add new capabilities as time goes on, including potentially radar jamming and even the ability to launch cyber attacks . In June 2017, Lockheed Martin unveiled a special operations configuration for the C-130J, the C-130-SOF. The concept art the company showed included a 30mm cannon firing through the left-side paratrooper door. This is a simpler, more modular arrangement than the purpose-built gun mount in the forward fuselage on the U.S. Air Force’s AC-130W and AC-130J gunships. You really can hang a lot of stuff out of those rear paratrooper doors. More than six decades after its first flight, the C-130 is still going strong and it seems unlikely we’ve seen everything  you can do with that space.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 6, 2019",No One Seems Sure What’s Been Holding up Drone Strikes in Niger,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Weeks after a deadly incident that led to the deaths of four American troops, the United States and Niger appear to be steadily moving towards an agreement that would see armed American unmanned aircraft flying missions from the West African country. Both parties have been subtly deflecting responsibility for not reaching this arrangement sooner, but the factors at play could be just as much functional, having to do with things such as the need for more personnel to load munitions and places to store those weapons safely, as they are a product of the political sensitivity of drone strikes. On Nov. 1, 2017, Reuters published an interview with Nigerien Defense Minister Kalla Mountari, in which he seemed to make clear that his country’s government had no objection to American drone strikes, especially in light of deadly ambush near the village of Tongo Tongo in which militants killed two U.S. Army special forces soldiers and two other American support troops. Since 2013, the U.S. Air Force has been flying unarmed MQ-9 Reapers from a base attached to the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aérienne 101, itself collocated with Diori Hamani International Airport in the capital Niamey. “I asked them some weeks ago to arm them [the Reapers] and use them as needed,” Kalla Mountari insisted to Reuters. He declined to say whether the U.S. government had or would be accepting the offer, saying only that “our enemies will find out.” More details continue to emerge about the ambush on Oct. 4, 2017 near the village of Tongo Tongo, including new reports that American commanders ordered the team to proceed despite concerns that the situation was more dangerous than anyone had initially thought. Ever since the incident, there have been continued debate about whether or not the group had adequate resources and whether the U.S. military’s original assessment of the mission as “low risk” was accurate. An MQ-9 Reaper, USAF Whether there were any drones available to support the troops once they came into contact with the enemy, reportedly members of a group presently known as Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, or ISGS , has been a persistent talking point, despite air support of any kind not being a given in many U.S. military operations. The Pentagon has disclosed that an unspecified drone was flying in the area in support of separate element, reportedly under the direction of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command, and moved into position to observe the firefight. American officials have not officially disclosed whether or not that it was carrying missiles or bombs or if the pilots had authorization to conduct a strike even if it was. “As soon as they asked for help, within minutes it [the drone] was re-tasked to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance – full-motion video, one of the capabilities right over the scene of the troops in contact,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford told reporters on Oct. 23, 2017. “I’m not going to talk about what our capabilities are in the region, but that particular capability that was there within minutes did not strike.” Kalla’s remarks would seem to conflict with subsequent reports about that incident that suggested the Nigerien government had not approved American air strikes using manned or unmanned aircraft within their borders. It also begs the question as to why, if this is the case, that American forces have not yet launched some form of reprisal against those responsible for the ambush near Tongo Tongo. On Oct. 26, 2017, NBC News reported that the U.S. officials had been “pressing” their Nigerien counterparts to agree to let American forces fly armed drones. On Oct. 27, 2017, The Wall Street Journal , citing anonymous sources, described a convoluted command structure for approving such a strike “that snakes through the Pentagon.” State Department officials also told the newspaper that the diplomatic corps hadn’t denied any requests to allow American personnel to fly armed drones in the country, going so far as to say that they had no authority to block requests for such operations anywhere in Africa – something experts have said would be “unprecedented if true.” As such, it remains unclear what the present arrangement the United States has with Niger regarding the status of its forces in the country and what it allows in regards to air strikes. There would definitely be a political dimension to any decision by the Nigerien government to limit or outright block such operations. More so than air strikes by manned aircraft, American drone operations around the world have long been a lightning rod for criticism. Opponents of the missions argue that the strikes are illegal acts of war that often violate the sovereignty of the countries they occur in. In addition, given the heavy reliance on the narrow “ soda straw ” view from unmanned aircraft’s sensors for these strikes, there is a debate about whether or no they are inherently less accurate or more likely to kill innocent civilians . The U.S. government’s past use of so-called “ signature strikes ” against individuals or groups who met a broad criteria for being terrorists or militants, as well as the tactic of positively identifying an individual through the use of a particular cell phone , have been particularly controversial. More broadly, the presence of foreign troops, especially westerners, throughout Africa can be difficult for average citizens to separate from the dark legacies of European colonialism on the continent. Many African governments, which one might charitably describe as “less-than-democratic,” are therefore happy for U.S. military personnel to operate discreetly within their borders, if not insistent that they do so. Reuters reported that a demonstration in Niamey on Oct. 29, 2017, ostensibly focused on grievances with the central government, included chants decrying the presence of outside military forces, as well. But there could also be technical issues slowing or possibly even preventing the U.S. military from getting an armed drone mission up and running in Niger, at least in the immediate aftermath of the ambush in October 2017. Though they have become integral to American military missions, drones, especially larger armed types such as the MQ-9, require significant infrastructure on the ground to support their operations. The War Zone Make sure to check our updated interactive google map showing the U.S. military’s posture in Africa that posture in Africa In 2013, the U.S. Air Force’s 27th Special Operations Wing established a drone operation in an undisclosed country, very possibly in Africa, in just three weeks . This was a demonstration of various new techniques that significantly reduced the previous typical deployment timeline, which had been approximately seven weeks. Though definitely impressive, this deployment consisted of just a single MQ-1 Predator, a single clamshell hangar, and a small number of tents to house an operations center, repair shop, and living spaces for personnel on the ground.  This drone conducted unarmed surveillance flights via the so-called “ remote-split operations ” method in which airmen or contractors actually in the country are responsible for taking off and landing, while other pilots situated remotely at bases in the United States fly the actual missions. An armed drone mission would have required additional infrastructure to safely store munitions before missions along with additional personnel trained to assemble those weapons and then load them onto the aircraft. This in turn requires more a larger physical and force protection footprint – you don’t want hazardous explosives too close to living areas for instance – and additional basic resources – food, water, and so on – to support the overall operation. All of this takes time to put in place. American personnel break down a Quonset hut at the present American base in Niger following an exercise in September 2017., USAF In Niger, The French Air Forces does operate armed fixed wing combat aircraft from its own base attached to Diori Hamani International Airport. These Mirage 2000 multi-role jets were part of the response to the ambush in October 2017. The French also plan to arm their own MQ-9s situated there in the near future. It is possible that the U.S. military could reach an agreement to use that country’s arms storage facilities, but it could be a complicated arrangement and would still take time to work out the protocols and procedures. It’s unclear how often the French fly armed operations from Niamey or intend to do so in the future, as well. The Nigerien authorities at Diori Hamani could easily raise concerns about mixing additional armed aircraft with commercial air traffic at the airport, which has only one runway. There is a poor public perception of the reliability of American drones, as well, earned or not, which might add weight to those concerns. Fears about armed unmanned aircraft smashing into nearby residential neighborhoods and business districts was a significant part of why the government in Djibouti forced the U.S. Air Force to move its Predators and Reapers out of that country’s main international airport in its capital to the more remote Chabelley Airfield in 2013. The United States is already in the process of a $100 million construction project in the central Nigerien city of Agadez to effectively create an entirely new air base with its own separate runway. The status of that work is unclear, but it could be that both U.S. and Nigerien authorities are waiting for that facility to be fully operational before actually expanding the size and scope of the American drone operation. A satellite imagery showing work on a new US base in Agadez, Niger as of April 2017. Construction of a new runway can be seen at top right., DigitalGlobe/Google Earth The construction effort has reportedly suffered delays to the challenges of working in such a remote location and the harsh environment, including regular dust storms. The U.S. military says it doesn’t expect the site to be up and running until at least the middle of 2018, according to Stars and Stripes . “Logistics are the biggest challenges by far,” U.S. Air Force Maj. Carsten Stahr, director of operations for the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron, which manages day-to-day American activities in Agadez, told Stars and Stripes. “We’re in the Sahel,  so we deal with anything from daily temperatures over 100 degrees, long  shipping times for supplies, little to no infrastructure nearby, malaria, etc.” On top of all that, every drone flying an armed reconnaissance mission is one that might not be available for other surveillance activities, too. Adding more aircraft again requires more infrastructure and supporting forces and could put more strain on the Air Force’s already overworked drone community. To underscore that point, in 2013, the U.S. Air Force’s 3rd Special Operations Squadron, part of the 27th Special Operations Wing, was flying three drones in support of U.S. military operations in three different geographic regions from multiple bases overseas, according to one official history. It’s worth noting that the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and its MQ-1C Gray Eagles are or at least were for a time at the core of the drone surveillance operation in Cameroon, to the east of Niger, possibly reflecting the lack of other available units that would be able take up such a mission in an austere location. Nigerien police patrol a waterway near the capital Niamey., Britta Pedersen/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Whatever the issues are or were, it does seem clear that Nigerien authorities have become increasingly comfortable with the idea of an American armed drone operation in their country. This is no doubt a product, at least in part, of increasing threats spilling over from long-running conflicts in neighboring Mali and Nigeria, home to slew of different terrorist and militant groups, including ISIS-affiliates such as ISGS. On Oct. 13, 2017, terrorists killed more than a dozen Nigerien police in roughly the same area as the ambush involving American forces earlier that month. Despite the Pentagon’s insistence that there was little risk to their mission, locals have dubbed the area the “ Red Zone ” due to high levels of both terrorist and criminal activity, including kidnapping and smuggling rings. Armed drones coupled with persistent surveillance capabilities could help monitor this and other similar areas and strike groups of fighters when appropriate. It could also just as easily inflame tensions given that many regional militant organizations blend together extremist Islamist religious ideologies with other more mundane grievances and have close ties to various ethnic minority communities. There are reports that villagers may have tipped off ISGS fighters to the presence of the U.S.-Nigerien patrol ahead of the ambush in October 2017. But before any American drone strikes occur, the United States and Niger still have to figure out whatever political and technical hang-ups are apparently still holding up the final agreement.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 15, 2019","Iran Says It’s Limited How Far Its Missiles Can Fly, but Also That it Doesn’t Matter","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has announced that the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has limited the range of its ballistic missiles to a maximum of approximately 1,240 miles. The move seems intended to reinforce the Iranian government’s claim that the controversial weapons program is for defensive purposes only, but seems unlikely to mollify its top international critics, including the United States and Saudi Arabia , especially since the Iranian government has already suggested it could quickly reverse course and drop the restrictions. Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), disclosed the range limits during a conference in Tehran entitled “A World Without Terror” on Oct. 31, 2017. The IRGC, which the United States formally labeled a terrorist group earlier in October as part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s new Iran policy, is a powerful quasi-military and economic entity that answers directly to Khamenei and leads the country’s ballistic missile efforts. “There is the capability to increase this range, but it is sufficient for now as the Americans are present within … [this] radius around the country, and would get a response in the case of any invasion,” he added. “The Americans fear the consequences of a war with Iran, and are well aware that they would be the losers if such a war breaks out.” Jafari almost certainly singled out the United States in his comments in response to the Trump Administration’s hard line stance toward Iran. On Oct. 13, 2017, the U.S. government unveiled a new policy agenda aimed at Iran, which, along with designated the IRGC as a terrorist group, specifically called out Iran’s ballistic missile efforts. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, center, and IRGC Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, to his left, in 2014., Sipa via AP “We will address the regime’s proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation,” said in a speech detailing his administration’s plans. “I urge our allies to join us in taking strong actions to curb Iran’s continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior, including thorough sanctions outside the Iran Deal that target the regime’s ballistic missile program.” Iran’s missiles have long been a major point of contention between the country and the United States. Opponents of the Iran Deal over the country’s nuclear program, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have long criticized that arrangement for not including any provisions specifically aimed at curtailing those developments. President Trump describes his new Iran policy on Oct. 13, 2017., Al Drago/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP During the campaign and after winning the election, Trump has repeatedly slammed the deal personally, calling it “one of the most incompetently drawn deals I’ve ever seen” in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity earlier in October 2017. “The Trump Administration will not repeat these mistakes,” a fact sheet the White House released to go along with his Iran policy speech stated bluntly . The United States says that continued missile tests are inherently provocative and therefore violate the “spirit” of the deal, which was supposed to promote “regional and international peace and security.” In January 2017, Iran tested its latest design, called Khorramshahr , which has elements that appear similar to North Korea’s BM-25 Musudan and reportedly has a range that meets the official limitations, before officially revealing it to the public nine months later. Iran has already developed a host of other, shorter range ballistic missiles and large, hardened tunnel networks to protect them from attack . In June 2017, Iranian forces launched four smaller Zulfiqars into Syria, nominally in retaliation for ISIS attacks in Tehran , but also as a clear demonstration of the capability to other potential opponents. https://youtube.com/watch?v=g1-pzkLjeE0 Iran counters these complaints by insisting its missile development program is purely defensive in nature , helping guard against the aggression of its opponents, chiefly the United State, Israel , and Saudi Arabia . Jafari’s comments in October 2017 effectively reiterated and added additional weight to this position. In line with the Trump administration’s new Iran policy, Congress did approve additional sanctions targeting the country’s ballistic missile development efforts earlier in October 2017. The Iranian government swiftly and unsurprisingly slammed the decision. There are United Nations Security Council Resolutions that do specifically prohibit Iran from developing and testing long-range ballistic missiles, but specifically in the context of work on a delivery platform for a nuclear weapon. In 2005, however, Iran formally announced that Ayatollah Khamenei had forbidden the development or production of these weapons of mass destruction in a fatwa , an official Islamic decree. As such, Iranian authorities say that it is impossible for anyone to claim that their missile developments are tangentially related to a nuclear weapons program, covert or otherwise. The United States and its allies have implicitly disagreed, arguing that long-range ballistic missiles, especially inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBM), have little to no value absent a nuclear warhead. Iran’s Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missile., Ebrahim Noroozi/AP It is unclear whether or not Khamenei’s new missile range restrictions, which would limit Iran to what the international community defines as Medium Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM), came in the form of another fatwa or how long they have been in place. Jafari was right to point out that these limits don’t prevent the IRGC from holding all of Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as American military bases throughout the region, at risk. “It is a political decision,” Michael Elleman, the senior fellow for missile defense with the International Institute for Strategic Studies told Voice of America after the announcement. “I think with the supreme leader saying it, it takes on a little more significance.” But however official, there is no indication that these self-imposed restrictions will make the United States or its regional allies any more inclined to be conciliatory. Even in announcing them, Jafari was quick to essentially point out that Iran could increase the range of its missiles if it decided to do so. Experts already believe that Khorramshahr has a range that exceeds these limits. North Korea’s BM-25, which it successfully test fired for the first time in June 2016, has an estimated range of approximately 2,500 miles. “It will be interesting to see how Iran reconciles this Khorramshahr missile with the supreme leader’s dictate,” Elleman added. “Iran may say, ‘Well, we’re fitting it with this big warhead so we’re not exceeding this limitation,’ but the modification is very simple.” On top of that, critics have argued that the fatwa on nuclear weapons has not prevented Iran from conducting advanced research on that topic short of active development, giving it the ability to rapidly produce such a device if and when the country’s government deems it to be necessary. The same criticism could easily apply to missile development work. Just because Iran isn’t building missiles that can fly farther than 1,240 miles, there’s nothing to suggest it wouldn’t be developing the requisite knowledge base to rapidly do so in the future. There’s also the possibility that it might use proxies to continue that development or even production. There is already significant evidence that Iran has been sharing ballistic missile technology with the Syria regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. And the United States has already accused the Iranian government of using its nascent space program and work on space launch vehicles as a cover for research and development into ICBMs. We don’t know for sure, but it seems unlikely that Khamenei’s missile dictum would apply to that nominally civil work. This all begs the question of why Iran would necessarily decide to make this pronouncement at all. Earlier in October 2017, President Hassan Rouhani had already categorically dismissed the threat of additional sanctions and other U.S.-led efforts to pressure it into giving up its missiles and renegotiating the terms of the JCPOA. “We will build, produce and stockpile any weapons of any kind that we need in order to defend ourselves and the territorial integrity of our beloved nation,” Rouhani said in a speech to the Majlis, Iran’s parliament, on Oct. 29, 2017, hard line remarks that legislators greeted with chants of “Death to America.” “We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, second from right, speaks ahead of the start of the 2017 Sacred Defense Week military parade., Ebrahim Noroozi/AP This new announcement does add extra weight to the claims of a defense-focused missile project. As we’ve already noted, the United States and its allies already routinely allege Iran is saying one thing when it comes to advanced weapons programs, but actually is doing another in secret . It could help Iran position itself as the most restrained, rational actor, especially with regards to Suadi Arabia, which is in the middle of a massive international military shopping spree . These multi-billion dollar deals include the purchase of a huge missile defense shield centered on the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) system and its long-range AN/TPY-2 radar , which the Kingdom wants specifically to guard against Iran’s growing long-range arsenal. At the same time, Saudi officials have announced their own plans to begin a controversial nuclear power generation effort, which some fear could be a prelude to regional nuclear arms race . At a conference organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Oct. 30, 2017, Hashim bin Abdullah Yamani, head of the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE), discussed plans to both enrich and process fissile material inside the country. A model of the THAAD interceptor, in the foreground, which the Saudis expect to buy 360 of for their ballistic missile shield., Joseph Trevithick “Regarding the production of uranium in the kingdom, this is a program which is our first step towards self-sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel,” Yamani explained. “We utilize the uranium ore that has been proven to be economically efficient.” On Oct. 31, 2017, Iranian authorities themselves broke ground on two new reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant complex, which they say are to help expand the country’s nuclear energy capacity. The U.S. government could easily see as a new provocation, further undermining any efforts to reduce tensions over the country’s missile programs. Russia, which has long assisted with Iran’s nuclear power projects, is providing assistance for this new work. Iran hopes the first new reactor will go critical in seven years, with the second coming online two years after that. This timeline just so happens to coincide with the possible sunset of various nuclear sanctions against Iran built into the Iran Deal. In 2023, whoever is President of the United States is obliged to ask Congress if it is appropriate the end US sanctions on various Iranian nuclear enterprises. In 2026, additional restrictions on Iran’s ability to enrich and process fissile material could end. With the Trump administration adamant about “fixing” the Iran Deal and Iranian authorities insisting this proposal is a non-starter, it seems unlikely that these self-imposed limits, which Iran says it can back out of at any time, will have a major impact on the geopolitical landscape.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 8, 2021",US Effort to Find Those Behind the Benghazi Attack Nets a Second Suspect,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A team of Navy SEALs and FBI agents has quietly captured a second suspect, Mustafa Al Imam, in connection with the infamous attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in 2012. While little is known about the raid so far, it could have been part of a little known group of counter-terrorism operations across Africa and it was undoubtedly the result of persistent surveillance from a shadowy collection of intelligence gathering aircraft that have been flying over the country for years now. On Oct. 30, 2017, the U.S. government confirmed that it had launched a mission in an undisclosed location in Libya to apprehend Mustafa Al Imam in connection with the Benghazi incident. At that time, the U.S. Justice Department said that American authorities were transporting Al Imam, a Libyan national who it said was approximately 46 years old, back to the United States to stand trial. “To the families of these fallen heroes: I want you to know that your loved ones are not forgotten, and they will never be forgotten,” U.S. President Donald Trump said in a statement on Oct. 30, 2017. “Our memory is deep and our reach is long, and we will not rest in our efforts to find and bring the perpetrators of the heinous attacks in Benghazi to justice.” There is little information available about Al Imam, who U.S. officials have so far charged with killing an individual with a firearm or other deadly weapon during an attack on a federal government facility or conspiring to do the same, providing or otherwise attempted to providing material support to terrorists, and “discharging, brandishing, using, carrying and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.” US Army Special Forces soldiers detain a mock high-value individual during at training exercise., US Army According to the Justice Department, those charges have been on file since May 19, 2015, but have been under seal since then. It is likely that the charges could change and that the total number will grow before Al Imam finally appears in a courtroom. The Libyan is the second person the U.S. government has acknowledged detaining in relation to the Benghazi attack. On the night of June 14-15, 2014, another raid led to the capture of Abu Khattala, who American authorities have accused of masterminding the attack. His trial began on Oct. 2, 2017 in Washington, D.C. It is possible Al Imam’s name and connection to the attack came up during pre-trial questioning or was found among materials special operators seized when they detained Khattala. A special operator drives an all terrain out of a USAF MC-130J Commando II special operations transport during a training exercise., USAF The attack on the consulate in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, which led to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, as well as three CIA contractors – Glen Doherty, Sean Smith, and Tyrone Woods – continues to provoke emotional reactions. Both the State Department and the Pentagon did a significant amount of soul searching afterwards, leading to major changes in security protocols and the establishment of numerous rapid reaction forces around the world. An ambush of American special operations forces in Niger earlier in October 2017 has drawn comparisons to the incident, but the circumstances are almost entirely different. We have already written detailed explainers about the U.S. military presence in North and West Africa, which you can find here , as well as the circumstances that contributed to that particular event, here . There are also few details about the mission to capture Al Imam itself, such as how the American force infiltrated into Libya , or how it subsequently extracted the suspect . President Trump’s statement spoke to the involvement of the U.S. military, the Intelligence Community, law enforcement officials, and federal prosecutors in the effort. Members of the elite U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group, better known as SEAL Team Six, along with individuals from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Hostage Rescue Team, conducted the actual raid, according to The New York Times . The secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) oversaw the overall operation, which had been in the works for months. A similar inter-agency effort was responsible for bringing Khattala to justice. A US Air Force CV-22B tilt-rotor, a type of aircraft American special operators have used during raids in the past., SOCEUR On the campaign trail, then candidate Trump had pledged to fill the controversial U.S. military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with “ bad dudes .” By all accounts, however, like Khattala, Al Imam looks set to face a civilian jury. Before and after his election victory, though, he also made it clear that he favored increased military action against terrorists worldwide. Since formally taking office in January 2017, the president has approved controversial special operations raids in Yemen and Somalia . However, JSOC is widely understood to have been coordinating the hunt for so-called high-value targets all over the world , including in various parts of Africa, for years already. A team assigned to the shadowy command was reportedly nearby when the ambush in Niger occurred, as part of operation nicknamed Obsidian Nomad , a separate report from The Times noted. The U.S. military as a whole often groups together similar operations using nicknames with common so-called first and second words. As of February 2015, U.S. Special Operations Command was conducting four “Obsidian” missions – Obsidian Cobra, Obsidian Lotus, Obsidian Mosaic, and Obsidian Tower – according to a statement the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. SOCOM via FOIA Two of these missions, Obsidian Cobra and Obsidian Tower appeared in Pentagon accounting documentation starting in 2014. The latest version of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) manual says those two accounts are still active, but now lists them as linked to Special Operations Command Africa, which oversees U.S. military special operations activities across the continent. Part of a DFAS manual showing active Pentagon budget accounts as of March, 10, 2015., DFAS Part of a DFAS manual showing active Pentagon budget accounts as of Oct. 17, 2017., DFAS “Lotus” is also second word associated with operations in Libya, including the conventional military response to the Benghazi incident, Operation Jukebox Lotus , and a mission to aid the State Department in evacuating its embassy in Tripoli in 2014, Operation Oaken Lotus . Of course, it is just as likely that these four operations are entirely unrelated to the capture of either Khattala or Al Imam. What does seem clear is that a shadowy armada of U.S. military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft and drones, and contractors flying missions on America’s behalf, has been zipping around Libya since 2012, likely searching for individuals related to the Benghazi attack. In the run up to the capture of Khattala, four MQ-8B Fire Scout drone helicopters flying from the Oliver Hazard Perry -class frigate USS Elrod , flew more than 500 hours over an undisclosed portion of Africa, according to an official history the author previously received via FOIA. A MQ-8B Fire Scout drone helicopter., USN During 2014, the aircraft from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light Six Zero’s Detachment Two, were officially flying missions in support of Operations Jukebox Lotus, Oaken Lotus, and Junction Serpent , yet another intelligence gathering effort in and around Libya. The goal of at least some of these flights was to help in “developing pattern of life for U.S. Africa Command’s number one target,” the history said. In 2016, U.S. Africa Command refused to confirm or deny whether this “target” was Khattala. The Pentagon uses “patterns of life” to refer to intelligence collection activities to build up information about the routines of certain individuals or groups of individuals, to either help identify them or monitor their movements. With that information in hand, special operators can launch raids like the one to grab Al Imam when there is less of chance of them escaping or danger to nearby civilians. USN via FOIA Since at least 2016, though, terrorists and civilians in Libya have both posted pictures of mysterious de Havilland Canada DHC-7s flying over the country. These apparently contractor-operated aircraft were observed flying operations from Malta, which has served as a base for various foreign intelligence gathering flights over North Africa. Spotters caught one of the DHC-7s flying over the Libyan city of Derna, just more than 150 miles northeast of Benghazi, in January 2017. By August 2017, the two known discreet “Dash-7” spy planes were in storage at the U.S. military’s main bone yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. These aircraft appeared to some combination of wide-angle visual or infrared cameras, or a multi-optic wide-area aerial surveillance system. The latter can capture still imagery or record full motion video of large areas to track targets and help establish their routine movements, making them particularly useful for “pattern of life” type missions. Plane spotters have also tracked smaller surveillance aircraft based on the ubiquitous Beechcraft King Air flying over various locations in North Africa from a secretive base on the Italian island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean. In May 2016, CNN reported that these aircraft were supporting special operations forces in Libya aid that country’s government and militias aligned with it to fight ISIS elements in and around the city of Misrata. However, at least one of the aircraft, with the U.S. civil aviation registration code N351DY had also been seen, via online flight tracking software, flying over Tunisia, suggesting it might have been conducting more targeted surveillance. Aerial surveillance and other intelligence gathering efforts have become increasing more essential to American counter-terrorism efforts around the world, something we at The War Zone have discussed in detail many times in the past . “I am grateful to the FBI, our partners in the intelligence community and the Department of Defense who made this apprehension possible,” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in his own statement regarding Al Imam. “The United States will continue to investigate and identify all those who were involved in the attack – and we will hold them accountable for their crimes.” It’s very possible that American special operations forces, along with their intelligence and law enforcement partners, are already watching the next Benghazi attack suspect.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 30, 2019",Here’s What’s In the Navy’s Damning New Reports on Its Destroyer Collisions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of investigating the circumstances relating to two separate collisions between the Arleigh Burke -class destroyers USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain and merchant ships in the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Navy has determined both incidents were “preventable” and “avoidable,” blaming numerous officers and sailors for the incidents, which left a total of 17 Americans dead. The nature of accidents had initially seemed so bizarre that they quickly prompted a raft of conspiracy theories , but the official investigations reinforced subsequent reports that pointed instead to almost recklessly poor training and readiness standards and dangerously low morale. In an associated press release , the Navy described the mishap involving Fitzgerald and the container ship M/V ACX Crystal on June 17, 2017 as the result of “an accumulation of smaller errors over time, ultimately resulting in a lack of adherence to sound navigational practices.” When the John McCain collided with the chemical tanker M/V Alnic MC on Aug. 21, 2017, “complacency, over-confidence, and lack of procedural compliance,” were major factors in the accident. A wide-spread issue Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson, the Navy’s top officer, issued the following statement to coincide with the release of the report: “Both of these accidents were preventable and the respective investigations found multiple failures by watch standers that contributed to the incidents. We must do better. “We are a Navy that learns from mistakes and the Navy is firmly committed to doing everything possible to prevent an accident like this from happening again. We must never allow an accident like this to take the lives of such magnificent young Sailors and inflict such painful grief on their families and the nation. “The vast majority of our Sailors are conducting their missions effectively and professionally – protecting America from attack, promoting our interests and prosperity, and advocating for the rules that govern the vast commons from the sea floor to space and in cyberspace. This is what America expects and deserves from its Navy. “Our culture, from the most junior sailor to the most senior Commander, must value achieving and maintaining high operational and warfighting standards of performance and these standards must be embedded in our equipment, individuals, teams and fleets. “We will spend every effort needed to correct these problems and be stronger than before.” The public reports can only contain unclassified information about the Navy’s protocols and standard operating procedures and the equipment and capabilities of the two Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. The reviews also make clear that the Navy has no reason to suspect there is any weight to any conspiracy theories , such as those involving sabotage, cyber attacks , or other interference by foreign countries. The Navy made no determination about whether the civilian crews onboard the merchant vessels may ultimately bear some responsibility, as well, details that will likely come out in additional U.S. and Japanese Coast Guard investigations. That being said, they still describe a near total breakdown in leadership and almost deliberately poor decision making on the part of the service’s own crews. What happened aboard Fitzgerald In the case of the Fitzgerald , the ship was within sight of land and was running with only external navigation lights on when it came into contact with the ACX Crystal , a common procedure. Per the official International Rules of the Nautical Road, the American destroyer was in a so-called “crossing situation” and should have moved out of the path of the other vessel. When that didn’t happen, the container ship’s crew was supposed to do the same. USN Though aware of the situation for 30 minutes before the collision, neither ship took evasive action leading up to the mishap. Minutes before the two smacked into each other, Fitzgerald ’s Officer of the Deck and Junior Officer of the Deck, the former in charge of the ship’s safe navigation and the other there to assist, were still debating on the bridge whether or not change course. At no point did any other personnel on the bridge appear to offer substantive advice, according to the review, and the ship’s captain, who was asleep at the time, was completely unaware of what was going on, a breach of protocol, until the ACX Crystal literally smashed its way into his quarters. The destroyer’s Combat Information Center, which fuses data from the ship’s radar and other sensors, never offered information or advice to the Office of the Deck. USN At no point did personnel on the bridge sound a collision warning or otherwise alert the rest of the crew, many of whom were also in their bunks, of the impending danger. The accident caused such significant damage as to knock out the Fitzgerald ’s external communications systems, preventing the crew from quickly calling for help, and all power to the forward spaces of the ship. As we at The War Zone reported before, based on an initial release of information to the public, that the incident wasn’t worse is a testament to the courage of the ship’s crew in the immediate aftermath. Along with these latest reports, the Navy released a number of haunting hand drawn sketches investigators had sailors draw of how they escaped the flooding in the compartments. USN This description of how sailors rescued the captain from his cabin is particularly harrowing: “Five Sailors used a sledgehammer, kettlebell, and their bodies to break through the door into the CO’s cabin, remove the hinges, and then pry the door open enough to squeeze through. Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily. “A junior officer and two chief petty officers removed debris from in front of the door and crawled into the cabin. The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel. The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved the CO, who was hanging from the side of the ship.” But the Navy found a laundry list of failures just in the moments leading up to the crash. The Officer of the Deck and the rest of the team on the bridge were apparently largely unfamiliar with the International Rules of the Nautical Road, failed to take responsible action to get the destroyer out of the way in the first place, didn’t notify other vessels in the area of a possible hazard, and kept the ship going at an unsafe speed given the other ships in the congested shipping lanes. The watch team didn’t position the ship’s radar and other personnel did not appear to use civilian Automated Identification System transponder beacon information to provide the personnel on the bridge with the best picture of the situation possible and weren’t even physically watching what was going on to the right of Fitzgerald where the ACX Crystal and two other ships were sailing. Damage to the Fitzgerald after the collision., Yomiuri Shimbun via AP A near complete failure of leadership and communication before and leading up to the mishap meant that key individuals were not working together as a team for some time before hand. The Navy said that the destroyer had another near collision in May 2017, but that the ship’s command team “made no effort to determine the root causes and take corrective actions in order to improve the ship’s performance.” Oh, and beyond all that, the ship’s crew was just dangerously fatigued. The strain on the Navy to meet operational demands, often operating ships with inadequate or overworked crews, is something that has since emerged as a broad, service-wide issue in need of fixing, which you can read more about in depth here . “No single person bears full responsibility for this incident,” the Navy investigators concluded. “The crew was unprepared for the situation in which they found themselves through a lack of preparation, ineffective command and control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for navigation.” The ACX Crystal sits in port in Japan after the accident in June 2017., Haruna Usui/Kyodo News via AP The McCain collision When McCain collided with the Alnic MC nearly two months later, the circumstances were in many ways even worse. Both the ship’s captain and executive officer were on the bridge due to the “higher risk” nature of sailing in heavily trafficked Singapore Strait and Strait of Malacca. As with Fitzgerald , the destroyer was following the common procedure of sailing with just its navigation lights on even though there was near total darkness. It is possible that if the crew had responded appropriately to a possible dangerous situation that they would have turned on floodlights and other equipment to make sure other ships in the area were better aware of the destroyers presence and exact position. As the American warship entered the shipping lanes, it became apparent that the helmsman, in charge of steering the ship, was having trouble properly adjusting the vessel’s speed, while also keeping it on course. The commanding officer ordered another individual to assist, which involved that individual actually taking over some of the controls through their own console. Unfortunately, the move confused everyone. Instead of just shifting the speed controls to the other workstation, the steering functions got redirected, too. The Helmsman had no idea this was the case and thought they had completely lost control of the ship. Tugs move the McCain to a rendezvous point with the heavy lift ship M/V Treasure off the coast of Singapore on Oct. 6, 2017., USN Though this wasn’t actually the case, at that moment no one was guiding the ship. At the same time, the movement of the computerized controls between workstations placed the ship’s rudder back in the default, centered position, from where it had been, one to four degrees to the right. This caused the ship to immediately begin drifting to the left. Standard Navy protocol says a ship should immediately slow down when it suffers a “steering casualty,” as well. The assisting Helmsman, known as the Lee Helmsman, had misunderstood the controls, though, and only slowed one of the destroyer’s two screws, leaving the other running at the previous speed for more than a minute, exacerbating the leftward movement and shunting the McCain further into the path of other ships. In the three minutes it took for someone to finally realize that the ship’s steering was fine, it was too late to avoid the impact with the Alnic MC . As with the Fitzgerald ’s mishap, neither of the ships attempted to contact the other and the McCain never sounded a collision warning, even when it should have been obvious that an accident was inevitable. A map showing the approximate path of the USS John S. McCain leading up to the collision with the Alnic MC ., USN External communications failed afterwards and the impact seriously degraded the ship’s navigation equipment and caused a loss of electric power in many compartments. “Those nearest the impact point described it as like an explosion,” the official report noted. As with the earlier collision, the McCain ’s crew did heroically work to prevent the incident from being any worse. The Navy’s new report reveals additional harrowing stories about this accident, as well, such as the following: “The second Sailor was in a bottom rack in Berthing 3. His rack was lifted off the floor as a result of the collision, which likely prevented him from drowning in the rising water, and he was trapped at an angle between racks that had been pressed together. Light was visible through a hole in his rack and he could hear the water and smell the fuel beginning to fill Berthing 3. “He attempted to push his way out of the rack, but every time he moved the space between the racks grew smaller and he was unable to escape. His foot was outside the rack and he could feel water. It was hot in the space and difficult to breathe, but he managed to shout for help and banged against the metal rack to get the attention of other Sailors in the berthing space. The Sailors who entered Berthing 3 to rescue others heard this and began assisting him, but he was pinned by more debris than the first Sailor freed. “It took approximately an hour from the time of the collision to free the second Sailor from his rack. Rescuers used an axe to cut through the debris, a crow bar to pull the lockers apart piece by piece, and rigged a pulley to move a heavy locker in order to reach the Sailor. Throughout the long process, his rescuers assured him by touching his foot, which was still visible. Once freed, the Sailor was the last person to escape Berthing 3. Everything aft of his rack was a mass of twisted metal. He had scrapes and bruises all over his body, suffered a broken arm, and had hit his head. He was unsure whether he remained conscious throughout the rescue.” In its investigation, the Navy found that the McCain’s Helmsman, Lee Helmsman, and other personnel lacked of adequate training on the steering and speed controls. On top of that, several sailors on the bridge during the accident had been earlier temporarily assigned similar duties on board the USS Antietam , a Ticonderoga-class cruiser with a significantly different control layout, which led to apparent confusions and a lack of understanding of what was going on when it appears the steering had given out. USN “Multiple bridge watchstanders lacked a basic level of knowledge on the steering control system, in particular the transfer of steering and thrust control between stations,” according to the review. “The senior most officer responsible for these training standards lacked a general understanding of the procedure for transferring steering control between consoles.” Perhaps most gallingly, it seemed clear to Navy investigators that there should have been enough time, with appropriate collision warning and inter-ship communication for the McCain , the Alnic MC , or both ships to have gotten out of the way of the other. The failure to perform this basic duty on the part of the American destroyer seemed to reflect a worrisome command culture. The captain had declined to assign additional personnel to the bridge, protocol in high traffic areas, despite the recommendations of the ship’s executive officer, operations officer, and the navigator. The McCain ’s Officer of the Deck at the time had not even bothered to attend the navigation briefing about transiting the Singapore Strait and Strait of Malacca the day before. And no one even questioned or looked to see whether an error had occurred in the transfer of controls between consoles immediately when the Helmsman declared they could no longer steer the ship, which could have resolved the issue earlier. The heavy lift ship M/V Treasure carrying the McCain bound for Japan. , USN Soul searching Again, the Navy noted that “no single person bears full responsibility for this incident,” in its report. The findings clearly speak to the already much reported on widespread issues impacting the service as a whole. “These collisions, along with other similar incidents over the past year, indicated a need for the Navy to undertake a review of wider scope to better determine systemic causes,” Chief of Naval Operations Richardson noted in his cover sheet for the combined mishap reports. “The Navy’s Comprehensive Review of Surface Fleet Incidents, completed on 23 October 2017, represents the results of this effort.” It seems almost certain that these sobering findings will lead to additional soul searching on the part of the Navy’s top leadership. Exactly how they will, or even can approach the situation, remains a separate issue, which we at The War Zone have already explored in depth here . To add insult to injury, the McCain suffered a new crack in her hull while the heavy lift ship M/V Treasure was transporting the destroyer back to Japan for repairs. Treasure subsequently diverted to the Philippines so officials could inspect the new damage. It’s obvious from the reviews of these accidents, though, that the Navy simply cannot afford to continue operating as it apparently has been doing for some time now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 1, 2019","The Army Rushes 1,000 Recoilless Rifles to Troops, But What’s a “Carl Gustaf” Anyway?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. military works to implement a new strategy in Afghanistan and counter resurgent Taliban insurgents and various terrorist groups , much of the focus has been on a surge of American air power into the fight and talk of thousands more troops heading to the region. In the latter case, any newly arrived U.S. Army personnel, as well as those already in the country, along with U.S. soldiers elsewhere in the world, such as those holding the line in Europe, will likely be making use of something of a forgotten weapon in the service, the recoilless rifle. In September 2017, the Army revealed it was in the process of signing a deal with Swedish defense contractor Saab Bofors Dynamics for more than 1,100 M3E1 recoilless rifles, also known as the Carl Gustaf. In addition, the service was working on making sure that the weapons would get to units as quickly as possible thereafter. “The current system that the Army uses is the AT4, which only allows soldiers to fire one shot, and then they have to throw the system away,” Randy Everett, the project manager for Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) at the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, said at the time. “With the M3E1, soldiers can use different types of ammunition which gives them an increased capability on the battlefield.” An M3E1 recoilless rifle with a computerized sighting system., US Army The M3E1 is an 84mm recoilless rifle, meaning that the weapon allows some of the propelling gasses to escape out of the rear as it fires. These counteracting forces reduce recoil normally associated with bigger guns, though these weapons aren’t truly “recoilless.” They also have a significant and dangerous back-blast, which means troops can’t fire them indoors without specialized ammunition. At present, there is only one special “confined space” round available for the weapon, which is an anti-tank type. The weapon, which Saab also calls the M4 , uses titanium and other lightweight materials to keep its overall weight at just more than 15 pounds. It’s approximately 6 pounds lighter than the old M3 model. It’s also more compact than the previous version at nearly 3.3 feet in length. The Army’s M3E1 will use a standard telescopic sight, but could accommodate a computerized sighting system in the future. Existing units, which incorporate laser range finders and ballistic calculators, could help troops engage the enemy faster and more accurately, especially when unit different ammunition with different flight characteristics. The forward grip is wired up so troops can change the settings on certain ammunition, such as changing between an impact and delay fuze, before deciding to fire. Most importantly, the launcher is reloadable and Saab offers a wide variety of different ammunition types so that troops can quickly take on various targets with the weapon. There are anti-tank rounds with shaped-charge warheads, as well as standard high explosive projectiles, white phosphorus smoke shells, and illuminating flares. The Swedish company also makes a round specifically for busting through concrete walls and other hardened structures, as well as a “close in protection” type that fires 1,100 small metal darts, called flechettes. There’s even a thermobaric round that can be especially deadly against enemies in tight spaces, such as caves, with its large over-pressure blast. Some rounds have programmable settings, allowing certain types to explode above enemy personnel, showering them with deadly shrapnel, or delay their detonation until after the projectile has broken through a wall or other obstacle.  Saab Bofors Dynamics, in cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is also looking at the possibility of developing a precision-guided round. Various types of 84mm ammunition for the Carl Gustaf underneath a cut-away display model of the AT4., Joseph Trevithick In service with dozens of countries already, including many NATO members such as the United Kingdom, it will also make it easier for Army units to train together with allies and partners. American forces may even be able to better share logistical resources if necessary. But despite the clear utility of such a weapon, especially for troops in Afghanistan where insurgents have long been employing marksman rifles, mortars, and their own recoilless rifles to out-range American and other coalition forces, the Army has dragged its feet on the idea of buying the M3E1 in any substantial numbers for years. Much of the rest of the world, including various American allies, would probably find the idea of calling the weapon “new” almost absurd. The M3E1 is one of the latest versions of a design that dates back to the late 1940s. A Swedish state-run arsenal, Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori – literally “Rifle Factory of Carl Gustaf’s town” – made the first versions, leading many to nickname the weapon the Carl Gustaf or Carl G, a moniker that persists to this day. In 1991, Bofors bought and privatized the national company, which had existed in one form or another since 1812. In 1999, Saab bought Bofors’ parent company Celsius Group and renamed the firm Saab Bofors Dynamics, which continued to build and improve on the recoilless rifles. A Carl Gustaf M2, which entered production in 1964., Åpen dag Sessvolmoen via Wikimedia There are a number of good reasons why the Carl G has stood the test of time, mainly its durability, reliability, and versatility. Though the Swedish developed the man-portable weapon initially to take out tanks, it quickly became apparent that it could blast bunkers, buildings, and enemy forces hunkered down behind other hard cover. A standard high explosive round was effective against light vehicle and troops in the open, too. And while inspired in part by the appearance of the American M1 and M9 Bazookas and the German Panzerschreck shoulder-fired rocket launchers during World War II, the Carl Gustaf used the older recoilless principle. This meant that the weapon could send relatively large projectiles flying at far faster speeds than a rocket launcher, but still be safe for an individual to shoot, even standing up. The Korean War and Vietnam-era U.S. military M20 Super Bazooka fired rockets that had a top speed of approximately 340 feet per second. By comparison, depending on the type of ammunition, the Swedish weapon can fire rounds that travel at over 800 feet per second. Unfortunately, this power came at the price of weight. The Super Bazooka weighed approximately 15 pounds, less than a contemporary M60 light machine gun . The M3 Carl G, which entered production in 1991, was still 22 pounds after decades of work to trim down its weight. American troops had also recognized the relative benefits and many infantry units began using a recoilless rifle, the 90mm M67 , in the early 1960s. This weapon tipped the scales at more than 37 pounds. Man portable guided anti-tank missiles were supposed to settle the argument once and for all and by the early 1990s, most U.S. Army units had finally retired the M67. The service’s infantry units also had single-shot M72 Light Anti-tank Weapon (LAW) rocket launchers, until the 1980s, when the aforementioned AT4 entered service. The AT4, also known as the M136, is a recoilless rifle and is essentially a single-shot Carl G. A US Army soldier holds an AT4 single-shot recoilless rifle., US Army The Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment had kept its M67s, understanding their value as an alternative to disposable anti-tank weapons and missiles. In 1988, the Rangers had finally decided to replace these bulky weapons with the lighter weight Carl Gustav M3, dubbing it the Ranger Anti-Armor/Anti-Personnel Weapon System, or RAAWS. Other special operations forces saw how useful the recoilless rifles could be and it spread rapidly to Army Special Forces and U.S. Navy SEAL elements, ending up known as the Multi-Role Anti-Armor/Anti-Personnel Weapon System, or MAAWS . In conventional units, though, the combination of missiles and AT4s continued for more than a decade. It’s what Army soldiers had when they deployed to Afghanistan for the first decade of that seemingly never ending conflict. Most American troops also had 5.56mm M16 rifles, M4 carbines, and M249 squad automatic weapons. The 5.56mm’s limited range and stopping power at long distance is something we at The War Zone have discussed in depth before. In May 2017, I wrote : “In Afghanistan more so than Iraq, insurgents employed Soviet-era 7.62x54mm SVD rifles, RPGs, recoilless rifles, and mortars and seemed to routinely out-range American squads armed primarily first with M16s and then the shorter M4 carbine. Though handier for close-quarters combat and when getting in and out of vehicles, the M4’s 14.5-inch barrel only reduced the terminal impact and effective range of the 5.56mm bullet. “Things were bad enough that troops had taken to firing expensive Javelin anti-tank missiles at enemy fighters in order to hit them from a safe distance and get at them behind hard cover, such as rock outcroppings and earthen barriers.” The use of Javelin in particular had become so pronounced by 2012, that Jerry Schlabach, who performed operations research, modeling, simulation, and analysis for the manufacturer Raytheon, briefed the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Joint Armaments Conference on the topic. The powerpoint slides included quotes from troops who had fought in Afghanistan lauding the missile’s ability to break up ambushes, get at insurgents hiding in caves and behind hard cover, and even perform a limited surveillance function thanks to the launch control unit’s infrared optic. One of the slides from Schlabach’s 2012 briefing showing the ranges of various US Army weapon systems and how Javelin was “just right.”, Raytheon “They [the Taliban] got an 82 [mm recoilless rifle], and they like using it because they can be like, a frickin’ thousand meters away and hit almost every time, what they’re aiming at,” one individual said according to the presentation “It’s a very simple point, click heavy weapon that we have no answer to, except for the Javelin. You know what I mean?” “Once you get them backed into a cave, … you can drop 120s [120mm mortar rounds] right on top of these things, … but these dudes will come out of that just fine, later on,” another explained. “So we found out that the Javelins, you could fire straight into the mouth of a cave, …it would just blast out the inside of that cave. … and it was perfect.” Part of one of Schlabach’s slides examining Javelin’s utility against various non-traditional targets., Raytheon It wasn’t perfect, though. Far from it. There was no question that the Javelin could take out insurgents behind cover or inside caves, but every shot was costing the Army $80,000. The most expensive 84mm rounds for the Carl Gustaf cost approximately $3,000 each. The service was well aware of the situation, the need for a cost-effective solution, and its readily available options. In 2011, someone managed to dig out a number of old M67s and 90mm ammunition from storage somewhere and send it all to Afghanistan along with members of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. In what should have been a surprise to no one, troops were thrilled even with the dated weapons. They offered small infantry unit both added range and flexibility against a wide variety of targets thanks to an array of different rounds and that they weren’t single use like the AT4. Soldiers were particularly impressed with M67’s own flechette anti-personnel round. A rare, grainy photo of troops from 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Infantry Division using M67 recoilless rifles in Afghanistan in 2011., US Army Conflicting budget priorities and cuts, thanks to a process known as sequestration that came into effect after Congress passed the Budget Control Act in 2011, continued to slow the process of picking the most obvious solution, the Carl Gustav. The steady drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan, the main theater where there was an identified and immediate need for such weapons, didn’t help matters any. To give a sense of how long the Army has been considering fielding the weapon on a broad scale, in December 2011, it piggy-backed on a U.S. Special Operations Command contract to buy less than 60 of the recoilless rifles for field tests. What’s changed actually has more to do with events halfway around the world from Afghanistan. Soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division in Afghanistan, along with contractors, show off their M3 Carl Gustafs in 2011., US Army In 2014, Russian troops seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region and began lending direct support to separatists in that country’s eastern regions. The Kremlin began to adopt a more revanchist foreign policy in general and NATO responded by increasing its posture along the alliance’s borders with Russia. Since then, the Army has become increasingly concerned about its ability, or potential lack thereof, to fight a so-called near-peer opponent with a large conventional military. Modernizing the service’s anti-armor capabilities in particular, something almost entirely unnecessary for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, soon became a priority . By 2016, the Army had made clear it was finally moving ahead with the plans to field the Carl Gustav to conventional forces. But at the same time, the conflict in Afghanistan had gone in a new and worrisome direction and needs of American troops there gained renewed attention. “Our original investment of $3 million has led to an approximate $40 million procurement for the Army, which is a great return on investment,” Everett, the FCT project manager, explained in September 2017. “But, most importantly, the M3E1 can be reused so it gives Soldiers increased flexibility and capability on the battlefield.” The Army isn’t the only service that is seeing potential in the weapon, either. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has employed a reloaded rocket launcher, the Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW), since 1984, is looking to replace some or all of those weapons with the M3E1, too. Earlier in October 2017, Marines trained in Japan on the weapon system. Now the weapon finally appears to be gaining traction within the U.S. military, especially with the large, urgent Army purchase, it seems that the Carl Gustaf is set to become an increasingly important part of American infantry operations for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2019","The Army Desperately Wants A Pint Sized Tank With A Big Gun, Here’s What We Know","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is rushing ahead with its project to develop a new light tank to give infantry brigades extra firepower, especially against a near-peer opponent such as Russia. In the past, though, developing a vehicle that is both lighter than a traditional main battle tank and still survivable and useful on a modern battlefield has proven to be a difficult proposition. The Army plans to send out a final, formal request for proposals for the program, known as Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF), to interested defense contractors in November 2017 . The service then hopes to power through the contracting process and pick a winning design during the 2019 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2018. “We expect to be delivering prototypes off of that program effort within 15 months of contract award,” U.S. Army Major General David Bassett, the service’s program executive officer for Ground Combat Systems, said earlier in October 2017. The goal is “is getting it in the hands of an evaluation unit six months after that – rapid!” The Army has focused discussions of the MPF program heavily on the contracting side of things. After suffering spectacular setbacks in armored vehicle modernization with the cancellation first of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program and then of the subsequent Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), the service has been keen to stress that this effort will be different. One of the US Army’s M1A2 Abrams tanks, which are too heavy to adequately support light infantry and airborne forces., US Army Getting the vehicles to units quickly is important because the Army has identified a clear need to improve the firepower of infantry units in particular against a more traditional opponent. After more than a decade of limited, low-intensity conflicts against terrorists and insurgents, the U.S. military has become increasingly concerned it isn’t prepared for a conventional, high-intensity battle. After Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, subsequently began fighting alongside separatists battling the central government in Kiev, and adopted a broadly revanchist foreign policy, this only became more apparent . Since then, the United States and NATO members have taken up and expanded defensive posture along the alliance’s eastern flank and have experienced increasing harassment from Russian forces and intelligence services. MPF will follow a number of other similar rapid procurement efforts primarily focused on the European theater of operations, including the development and purchase of an up-gunned Stryker armored vehicle with a 30mm automatic cannon and of a turret for other variants of the 8×8 design that features both a .50 caliber M2 machine gun or a 40mm Mk 19 Mod 3 automatic grenade launcher and a Javelin anti-tank missile system . Upgunned Stryker., US Army As for the actual requirements for the MPF, the Army appears to have done its best to keep them as opened ended as possible. The design should be able to blast its way though bunkers and other fortifications, attack enemy forces taking shelter in buildings , and destroy various enemy armored vehicles , according to one official briefing. At the same time it has to be light enough – approximately 25 to 30 tons – to fit inside at least a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, and hopefully even a smaller C-130 Hercules. Since the Globemaster III can already carry a single M1 Abrams, the goal is for a C-17 to be able to deliver two MPFs straight into a combat landing zone. It should be protected against at least small arms and shrapnel air burst artillery rounds, with additional armor kits offering defenses against more powerful threats. US Army There’s no apparent stipulation that the vehicle has to be tracked rather than wheeled or what kind of main weapon it should have to do its job. Without tracks, it’s unlikely the vehicle would be able to negotiate the required obstacles or have the requisite off-road mobility – and it definitely wouldn’t qualify as a tank, light or otherwise. The Army would really prefer if you didn’t call it a tank at all though. “I don’t want to say it’s a light tank, but it’s kind of like a light tank,” David Dopp, the MPF project lead, told the service’s reporters in June 2017. “It’s not going toe to toe with a tank. …it’s for the infantry. It goes where the infantry goes – it breaks through bunkers, it works through targets that the infantry can’t get through.” Its true that from this description, it might be more accurate to call the proposed vehicle an “ assault gun ,” since its not necessarily supposed to take on enemy tanks. So far, though, the three major competitors for the program have presented designs that would look very much like tank to the average person, that is to say a tracked vehicle with a turret armed with a medium caliber main gun that is able to traverse 360 degrees. In 2016, General Dynamics debuted a vehicle called Griffin as its likely entrant for the MPF program. The design leverages a significant amount for the company’s existing experience, including the hull of the Ajax scout vehicle it is building for the British Army, a turret dervied from the one on the M1 Abrams containing the lightweight 120mm cannon it developed for the FCS project. Internally, the turret has many of the same systems and a nearly identical basic layout as the M1, too, which could reduce how much of an additional training regimen the Army would need to create to get troops qualified to operate the vehicle. The firm said the total package weighed approximately 28 tons. Then there’s the much smaller team of defense contractor SAIC and Singapore’s ST Kinetics, or STK. The same partnership has already provided 16 Terrex 2 8×8 wheeled vehicles for the U.S. Marine Corps’ Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 program. For MPF, the plan is to provide a version of STK’s Next Generation Armored Fighting Vehicle (NGAFV) armed with the 105mm-gun armed Cockerill 3105 turret from CMI in Belgium. The exact weight of this configuration is unclear. Lastly there is BAE Systems, which has put forward an upgraded version of its M8 Buford Armored Gun System (AGS), called the Expeditionary Light Tank. This vehicle, weighing in at less than 20 tons in its lightest configuration, also features a turreted 105mm cannon as its main weapon. BAE has already conducted low-level air-drop tests of this design, as well, but its unclear whether or not this is still a core MPF requirement. “What it will not be capable of is a low-velocity air drop from a C-17,” U.S. Army Major General Bassett said earlier in October 2017, according to the service’s official report. “Protection and lethality requirements will probably make it heavier than what’s acceptable for a C-17 air drop,” U.S. Army Major General Bassett said earlier in October 2017. There is always the possibility that additional competitors may submit bids after the final requirements become available. At the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual conference and exhibition earlier in October 2017, South Korean conglomerate Hanwha displayed a model of a design based on its K21 armored fighting vehicle that also uses the Cockerill 3105 turret. In theory, adding any one of these vehicles to the Army’s infantry brigades and providing it air-landed option for airborne forces could increase the capability and flexibility of those forces. At present, the largest combat vehicle available to those units is a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, or Humvee , with an M2 machine gun, Mk 19 grenade launcher, or TOW missile launcher . A model of South Korean conglomerate Hanwha’s K21-105 light tank., Joseph Trevithick These troops will eventually receive new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles , but the armament options may very well be the same. The Army is considering adding a 30mm cannon to some of these 4×4 light trucks in certain units, but this would not have anywhere near the capability to blast fortifications or take on larger armored vehicles the service expects from MPF. A Joint Light Tactical Vehicle with a lightweight 30mm cannon. , Joseph Trevithick With a larger armored vehicle, light infantry and airborne units would have a more powerful answer to enemy forces with those own similar capabilities or hunkered down behind heavy cover, especially in urban areas. Advances in programmable, multi-purpose large caliber ammunition mean that the vehicles may even be able to take on many of these targets with just one type of shell. As it stands now, these units must rely on M1 Abrams from nearby armored formations or air support to provide this type of capability, which might not always be forthcoming in a crisis. In addition, the M1 might not be able to navigate narrow streets, small bridges, or generally dense urban environments, especially those troops might regularly encounter during a conflict in Europe. The same technology that has gone into the 120mm Advanced Multi-Purpose tank round could make any future Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle even more flexible., US Army The MPF would be “essential to defeating local fortifications, point defenses, and blocking positions to maintain momentum,” the Army explained in a combat vehicle modernization white paper in 2015. “Without the combat vehicle, the infantry [brigade combat team] requires reinforcement with heavier armored vehicles for close combat against capable enemies.” More pointedly, in 2016, the RAND Corporation estimated it would take heavy armored Russian forces less than a week to steamroll over American and other NATO forces in the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This was in no small part due to the lack of available anti-tank weaponry among friendly forces or vehicles protected to any serious degree against massed artillery fire . Underscoring this potential threat, in September 2017, thousands of Russian and Belorussian troops took part in a massive exercise , called Zapad, or West, which occurs every four years. Though the Kremlin insisted it was purely defensive in nature, the goal was to demonstrate the capability of the two countries to conduct large scale operations across a wide area against a notional major opponent, which most experts assume is a stand-in for NATO . So, the requirement for a system like MPF is definitely there. The only problem is whether there is a design that truly meets the Army’s requirements or whether it will have to water down its wish list, resulting in vehicle that has limited utility on any battlefield. To drive the point home, there’s a reason why BAE Systems had a design that it could simply update in the first place. The basic MPF requirements sound very similar to those that led to the development of the original M8 in the 1990s. United Defense crafted the Buford before the Army cancelled the program ostensibly in response to post-Cold War budget cuts in 1996. In 2005, BAE bought the company. But it was never clear that the AGS concept was truly workable. When it scrapped the project, the Army was facing criticism that the M8 was too vulnerable in its lightest configuration and at the same time too heavy and bulky to be air-dropped or fit inside a C-130 with the protection offered by its heaviest add-on armor package. The M8 Armored Gun System navigates an obstacle at Aberdeen Proving Ground during tests in the 1990s., US Army By the mid-1990s, the Army had already been struggling with what it really wanted from a light tank for more than three decades. The M8 was supposed to have been a direct replacement for the last such vehicle, the M551 Sheridan , which entered service in 1969. The Sheridan itself remains a prime example of “feature creep” in weapon design, as engineers attempted to make an over-ambitious multi-purpose tracked vehicle to fill the job of an “armored reconnaissance/airborne assault vehicle” or AR/AAV for armored cavalry and airborne troops. The final M551 weighed just more than 15 tons, was supposed to be able to swim across rivers and lakes, and featured a futuristic and lightweight 152mm combined gun-and-missile launcher that was supposed to make up for the lack of space for a traditional tank cannon. To fit this into a package that the Air Force could drop from a C-130, it had exceptionally little armor and could barely withstand the recoil of its main weapon. Firing the huge cannon had an above average chance of destroying the M551’s sensitive missile targeting system, as did dropping the vehicle out of an airplane, essentially defeating the entire purpose of using the combination weapon. The vehicle had, at best, a mixed reception from cavalry soldiers who put it to use first in Vietnam. Its 152mm gun could fire a massive anti-personnel shell, but it was vulnerable to even light anti-tank weapons and had little if no real protection against land mines. In 1989, the Air Force air-dropped 10 of them during the U.S. intervention in Panama, destroying two in the process. In 1991, the 82nd Airborne brought them to Iraq during the first Gulf War, where reportedly some of them actually employed their Shillelagh anti-tank missiles for the first and last times in combat. There is no indication that any of the vehicles killed any Iraqi T-55s or T-72s. The M8 AGS was supposed to rectify the failings of the M551 and incorporate lessons learned from various experiments in unconventional vehicle design during the 1970s and 1980. During that period, the Army had explored lightweight vehicles with unmanned turrets, including that could elevate its main gun to fire from behind cover, and smaller, high velocity cannons . One of AAI’s Rapid Deployment Force Light Tank prototypes with a 75mm high velocity cannon., AAI As the AGS program progressed, though, the vehicles requirements grew and so did its size, a theme the Army ran into again with FCS and then GCV, the latter of which had ballooned to 84 tons , more than an M1 Abrams tank, before that project ended. The M8 project itself morphed into the much maligned wheeled Stryker Mobile Gun System (MGS) variant, which has weathered its own criticism of being too lightly armored, too heavy for widespread use, and unable to properly withstand the shock of firing its special medium-velocity 105mm cannon. Contractors can and are seeking to use as many existing and off the shelf components to reduce the risk of delays and keep costs down, but these efforts can’t stop the laws of physics. With the relatively open-ended requirements and the need for MPF to protect against steadily emerging threats, including, but not limited to the proliferation of advanced, man-portable guided anti-tank missiles and small drones , the Army will have to keep a close eye on the MPF development to avoid more feature creep and weight growth. With the Army already talking about add-on armor, one of the factors that doomed the Buford, protective features will be a particularly important consideration. The MPF competitors could choose to sacrifice passive armor in favor of an active protection system to help keep weight down. The Army is already buying Israel’s Trophy system for its M1 tanks and is considering lightweight versions of it, as well as other systems, for other vehicle types. The Army might not be willing to give up too much conventional protection, though, since hard-kill defenses have a limited number of shots before they have to be reloaded, something best done off an active battlefield. There’s always the danger that nearby troops could find themselves in the path of the intercepting projectiles, too. The service could always decide to accept different kinds of risk by relying more on active protection, something it has already suggested it is trying to convince tankers as part of the decision to add Trophy to its Abrams. An M1 Abrams tank with the Trophy active protection system., Leonardo/Rafael “There has to be a level of trust in whatever it is that you’re trying [to use] to displace that passive armor,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General John Murray, Deputy Chief of Staff for Resource Management, told industry representatives in March 2017. The officer wasn’t sure then that troops had real confidence in active protection. An ammo-less system such as an electronic warfare system might be a better solution, but Jammers might not have the same effect on all incoming projectiles or could block friendly communications or other systems.  Combining electronic warfare equipment with an active protection arrangement could help mitigate their individual disadvantages, but both would still have risks for nearby troops. New training and tactics could reduce the chances of any sort of friendly fire. The use of lightweight composite materials for portions of the vehicle’s construction or the employment of a similarly compact hybrid propulsion system its with reduced fuel requirements could free up trade space, as well, if the MPF final requirements call for defensive or other systems. Again, though, many of the applicable technologies are relatively young, especially in terms of their utility on an armored vehicle for use in a combat scenario. With the Army insisting on such an aggressive schedule, we won’t have to wait long to see if the prototypes stay relatively the same shape once BAE, General Dynamics, and SAIC and ST Kinetics get their hands on the final requirements.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2019",Here’s What You Should Know About Mattis and Dunford’s Trip to South Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After meetings with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the South Korean government has announced its intention to buy more “ high tech capabilities ” from the United States for its military, continue its own long-range missile development programs, and expand strategic cooperation with the U.S. military to improve the country’s defenses against North Korea. The statements came amid persisting heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula and it’s unclear as ever whether these new announcements are more likely to restrain the Hermit Kingdom or provoke premier Kim Jong-un into making new threats or taking more provocative action. South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo revealed these defense priorities at a shared press conference with Secretary Mattis in the country’s capital Seoul on Oct. 27, 2017. Mattis and Dunford had arrived in South Korea on Oct. 26, 2017 for a series of high profile meetings with their counterparts in the country, also known as the Republic of Korea (ROK) regarding how to approach the ongoing crisis on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea’s provocative ballistic missile and nuclear weapons tests and subsequent threats. Nuclear deterrence “First and foremost, the ROK and U.S. government condemn in the strongest terms the reckless provocation by North Korea, including the six nuclear tests and the multiple ballistic missile launches,” Song said through a translator. “We have agreed to continue supporting the diplomatic efforts by the Korean and U.S. governments to denuclearize North Korea and back up our government’s efforts with firm ROK-U.S. combined defense posture.” The bulk of what Song discussed in the rest of the press briefing is necessarily not new. On Sept. 4, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in spoke on the phone following North Korea’s sixth nuclear test, the detonation of a thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb. Left to right, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunford, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, and South Korean Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Jeong Kyeong-doo., Lee Young-ho/Sipa via AP According to an official White House readout of the chat, the two leaders discussed increasing their shared military capabilities, renegotiating the limits on South Korea’s missile development work, and “many billions of dollars’ worth” of future arms sales. But Song’s remarks did add new and important context. Most notably, the top South Korean defense official said that discussions about the deployment of unspecified U.S. military “strategic assets” to the country and the Pacific region as a whole included examining “the implementation of extended deterrents and commitments.” As it stands now, the United States already includes South Korea in its so-called “ extended deterrence ” posture, which places it under the protective umbrella of America’s nuclear arsenal. With North Korea rapidly expanding its own nuclear weapons capability and the necessary delivery systems, it’s understandable that South Korea would want to review the situation and make sure the threat of a massive American retaliation is as credible as ever. In addition, given the close proximities involved, it could be difficult, if not impossible for the United States to launch a nuclear response before North Korean missiles hit their targets in the South. Earlier in October 2017, the U.S. Air Force walked back a report that it was exploring the possibility of putting nuclear-armed bombers back on 24/7 alert , in part because of growing concerns over the situation on the Korean Peninsula. As such, authorities in Seoul could easily be interested in discussing just what options might exist for a preemptive or preventative strike and when it might be politically and legally possible to put those plans into action. The United States, importantly, does not have a “ no first use ” policy regarding the use of nuclear weapons, leaving open the possibility of responding with these devastating weapons in response to a conventional crisis. We at The War Zone have already written a detailed look at how the U.S. military might go about launching a nuclear strike, thanks to documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, which you can find here . However, both the United States and South Korea have denied or deflected that there are any serious discussions about the U.S. military to redeploying nuclear weapons to South Korea itself, at least on a permanent basis. It is possible that rotating “strategic assets” could include actual weapons on bombers or changes to the top secret patrol patterns of ballistic missile submarines. American officials ordered the last remaining stockpiles of nuclear weapons removed from US bases on the Peninsula in 1991. Defense Minister Song did say reintroducing the weapons was something worth looking at in Sept. 2017 and Mattis confirmed they had talked about it later that month. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo review troops., USFK Strategic assets However, there have been reports in South Korea that the U.S. military is considering deploying B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to South Korea on a rotating basis and a B-2 made an apparent flight to and from Guam while Mattis and Dunford met with their counterparts in Seoul. The U.S. Air Force has also announced plans to begin rotational deployments of the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter to Japan beginning in November 2017. These would be the kind of aircraft that would most likely fly the opening missions of any actual strike against North Korea. And unlike the B-1 Bone bombers that have been a key feature in shows of force in the region, the B-2 is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Earlier in October 2017, the U.S. Navy revealed that it would have three aircraft carrier strike groups in the Western Pacific for the first time since 2011. Aircraft carriers have long been one of, if not the most eminently visible display of American military power. The Pentagon downplayed the latest development, saying U.S. officials had made the decision to have the carriers in the region months in advance, but the message seems unmistakable . Along with the long-range attack capabilities of their air wing, they could help deliver special operations forces for “ decapaitation strikes ” against the North Korean regime, while their escort ships – which include Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , Ticonderoga -class cruisers , and Los Angeles -class attack submarines – might launch their own stand-off strikes with Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles. None of the ships have the capacity to launch a nuclear attack, though there is the possibility the U.S. Navy may add this capability to its future F-35C Joint Strike Fighters. USS Theodore Roosevelt , one of the three carriers that will be operating in the Pacific Ocean in November 2017, replenishes at sea in October 2017., USN “This was a unique opportunity for – to show that the U.S., the only power in the world that can demonstrate that kind of presence, and a unique, you know, opportunity for them to be together,” Joint Staff Director U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie said during a press conference on Oct. 26, 2017. “It does demonstrate a unique and powerful capability that has a very significant assurance effect on our allies in the Western Pacific,” he noted later in the briefing. Earlier in 2017, the Navy put the USS Carl Vinson and her strike group off the coast of the Korean Peninsula. On Oct. 21, 2017, the USS Ronald Reagan made a visit to the South Korean port city of Busan. In his own remarks from South Korea, General Dunford was also keen to stress that there are no new plans to increase the number of bombers, ships, or other assets assigned to the Pacific region and that the number of assets in the area are essentially “fixed.” “What’s not fixed is the manner in which we integrate all those … things. So when do we do it? What pattern do we show?” The USS Ronald Reagan sits in Busan harbor in South Korea on Oct. 21, 2017., USN High tech weaponry But South Korea seems intent on expanding its own long-range arsenal to hold North Korea at threat without necessarily needing American support. When asked about what “higher end weaponry” South Korea wanted to buy, Song specifically and exclusively about long-range missiles . Earlier in October 2017, the South Korean Army had unveiled a plan to launch a huge missile barrage against the North during the opening stages of any conflict on the Korean Peninsula. That concept relies almost entirely on domestically designed short-range ballistic and cruise missiles , which South Korea is developing with significant help from the United States. At present, the two countries have an deal in which South Korea agrees not to develop missiles able to fly more than 500 miles or carry a warhead larger than 1,100 pounds in exchange for technical military assistance. Trump and Moon’s have tentatively agreed to change those restrictions amid reports that the South Koreans have already started the basic development work on a new long-range ballistic missile, referred to as Hyunmoo-4. South Korean troops fire Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missiles during an exercise in July 2017., Sipa via AP There is also the very likely possibility that the South Korean Navy will include a ballistic missile capability in its upcoming Jangbogo III -class diesel electric submarines, as well as retrofit such a system onto some of its existing boats. The ability to produce longer range missiles with larger payload capacity would only give South Korea’s military more flexibility in positioning and employing any future sub-launched ballistic missile capability. And while Song did not mention it specifically, much of what is known about South Korea’s plans to respond to a crisis with North Korea rely heavily on having the best possible picture of where the bulk of North’s nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and long-range artillery are positioned at any particular time. In September 2016, the South Korean government had announced a three-tier operational concept, starting with “ Kill Chain ,” a surgical strike using land-, sea-, and air-launched ballistic and cruise missiles to try and neutralize an imminent North Korean threat. A constellation of five spy satellites, which South Korea hopes to have in orbit by 2023, along with high-flying RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, able to peer into the North from a stand-off distance using various long-range sensors, were an essential component of Kill Chain. The South Korean Air Force expects to receive its first two Global Hawks in 2018, followed by another pair the next year. Unfortunately, South Korea has also revealed that there was a massive breach of its military computer networks by North Korean hackers around the time Kill Chain – and the two other tiered responses, known as the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) and Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR) – became public knowledge. Kim Jong-un’s spies likely compromised the specifics of those plans when they stole some 235 gigabytes of sensitive military documents. But the missile attack plan the South Korean Army described earlier in October 2017 suggests that the core concept remains largely unchanged from Kill Chain. So, it is possible that Song and Mattis explored how the U.S. government could facilitate the acquisition of additional or new intelligence gathering or other assets to make sure the breach would not limit South Korea ability to respond in a crisis. It seems almost certain that discussions about cyber security enhancements for both South Korean forces and shared U.S.-ROK command and control assets would have been on the agenda. Missile defense Although Song appeared to deflect a question about ballistic missile defense, something that may have been lost in translation, the South Korean military is undoubtedly keen to expand its capabilities in this regard. Japan is already looking to purchase the Aegis Ashore system and the U.S. Army recently finished setting up its first Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) battery in South Korea. It would be hard to imagine that the Trump administration wouldn’t offer South Korea the option of purchasing its own THAAD systems, including the long range AN/TYP-2 radar, as well as becoming a bigger partner in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system’s continued development. In the past, South Korea has been wary of becoming more closely integrated in such projects for fear of responses from China , which sees the deployment of these defenses on the Korean Peninsula as a threat to its own nuclear deterrent. North Korea’s rapid development of newer and more capable ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons seem to be steadily changing that calculus for both parties . The South Koreans could opt to focus on something such as the SM-6 surface-to-air missile system, which is less capable against ballistic missile threats, but increasingly versatile nonetheless , or a similar domestically produced weapon, such as the Korean Medium Surface to Air Missile ( KM-SAM ), as lower cost and potentially less provocative options, as well. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency is also working on developing a laser-armed drone to try and destroy ballistic missiles during their initial boost phase . South Korea might be especially interested in such a capability given how close North Korea’s likely launch sites are to its own territory. Of course, both the United States and the South Koreans will have to weight their choices in implementing these new agreements against whether or not they expect their decisions are more likely to provoke Kim Jong-un to action rather than deter him. As we at The War Zone note routinely, threats, regardless of how American and South Korean officials couch them, feed into North Korea’s massive propaganda machine and confirm the pariah regime’s paranoid fears of an imminent attack or outside attempts to assassinate its leadership. “What kinds of things have proven to cause [Kim Jong-un] to be concerned? What kinds of things do we believe have actually deterred him from doing things in the past?” Dunford said during his remarks in South Korea. “What things maybe exacerbate a crisis or perhaps have, you know, been counterproductive?” Since September 2017, the North Koreans have threatened to shoot down U.S. bombers and other combat aircraft during shows of force and suggested they could launch ballistic missiles near Guam or conduct an unprecedented atmosphere nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean. North Korea’s state media reiterated its own deterrent threat in response to reports stemming from Song’s talk of extended deterrence. Kim Jong-un routinely makes propaganda visits to farms and factories to tout the country’s successes in the face of international sanctions and pressure., KCNA “The DPRK is a world nuclear power equipped with powerful capability for preemptive nuclear strike and counterstrike,” North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in an editorial. “Tragic is the fact that the U.S. does not know that its plan on ‘limited nuclear war’ for preemptive attack on the DPRK will be a self-destructive option hastening the final end of the empire of evil.” North Korea might decide to conduct another provocative missile or nuclear weapons test to coincide with Trump’s Asian tour in November 2017. The American president has already made a number of charged off-the-cuff comments about the continuing crisis, including vague threats of “ fire and fury ” and dubbing Kim “ Little Rocket Man .” “The United States does not accept a nuclear North Korea.” Secretary of Defense Mattis said himself alongside his South Korean counterpart on Oct. 27, 2017. “Make no mistake any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated. Any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response, effective and overwhelming.” With the new military cooperation agreements, the U.S. and South Korean governments have shown their resolve is as strong as ever, but so far Kim has made equally clear his willingness to defy this sort of international pressure.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2019",The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program Had A Pretty Rough Week,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Whatever you might think of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , it’s safe to say that the Joint Program Office hasn’t had a particularly good week. Reports of hypoxia , cyber security concerns , and the need for a major cost review followed the appearance of a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit, detailing significant and increasingly expensive maintenance issues, which leaked its way to the press ahead of an official public release. By far the biggest story is the GAO report , which Bloomberg was first to reveal on Oct. 23, 2017, paints a distinctly unflattering picture of the U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps abilities in particular to keep their existing F-35s flyable, breaking down its findings into five core challenges. There’s a major delay in getting depot-level maintenance facilities up and running and a massive spare parts shortage. Beyond that, the Joint Program Office hadn’t even figured out what technical data it would need to support the aircraft going forward and the U.S. Navy and Marines didn’t have vital intermediate maintenance capabilities in place to support planned operational deployments. Lastly, there were serious concerns with the status of the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), the cloud-based computer network that is central to keeping the aircraft going on a day-to-day basis. “These challenges are largely the result of sustainment plans that do not fully include key requirements or aligned (timely and sufficient) funding,” GAO explained in it’s the final public version, which it released in Oct. 26, 2017. The Pentagon “is taking steps to address some challenges, but without more comprehensive plans and aligned funding, [the Department of Defense] risks being unable to fully leverage the F-35’s capabilities and sustain a rapidly expanding fleet.” That’s an exceptionally diplomatic way of describing the findings, which the Congressional watchdog said were the result, in large of part, of a confluence of mismatched priorities and delays requiring program officials to divert already limited funds. Though this particular report did not mention it by name, GAO has in the past repeatedly criticized the policy of concurrency , in which the U.S. military began buying F-35s before the development cycle finished, requiring repeated and costly upgrades to existing airframes. We at the War Zone have discussed this issue in depth many times, most recently after earlier reports that the Air Force was considering stopping upgrading some of its exist jets to cut costs, but which would leave it with dozens of planes that would be, at best, suitable for limited training purposes in the future. A US Air Force F-35A., USAF At present, according to GAO, F-35s across the U.S. military were already ending up sidelined because of issues in the maintenance and logistics chains. Plans for an internal U.S. military capacity to perform depot level maintenance on the Joint Strike Fighter are six years behind schedule. As a result, when personnel remove parts from one of the jets for that type of service, they have to send it either to one of the depots that are operational or back to the original manufacturer. The objective timeline for getting those parts, or suitable replacements, back into the logistics chain is supposed to be between 60 and 90 days. As of May, GOA found that, due to backlogs and shortages, the average timeline was more than 170 days. GAO This had contributed to a massive parts shortage that had a direct impact on aircraft readiness rates. Between January and the beginning of August 2017, approximately 22 percent of the F-35 fleet in total across all services on average was not available specifically due to the lack of spares on hand. At some points its was 25 percent or more. In other words, this figure is not an overall availability rate, just the percentage due to lack of spares alone. Another contributing factor was the continuing lack of agreement between the F-35 Joint Program Office and Lockheed Martin on the transfer of technical data. The U.S. military had yet to even create a comprehensive catalog of all the data it felt it would need to operate and sustain the aircraft. This had trickled down in the maintenance pipeline, preventing the creation of a complete set of maintenance instructions for ground crews more than 10 years after the F-35 first took to the skies . Without a clear troubleshooting, maintainers were routinely sending parts to the depot when they could’ve made the fixes on site or at an intermediate facility. GAO Sometimes they would identify the wrong part as the problem and order a replacement only to find that the issue was still there afterwards, requirement more downtime and delays. Personnel at one depot told GAO’s investigators that nearly 70 percent of the parts they were receiving from F-35 squadrons weren’t even broken. Due to protocols, and not knowing for sure themselves, they still had to spend 10 hours testing each one. The lack of a well established knowledge base within the U.S. military itself undoubtedly helps explain why Naval Air Systems command announced a plan on Oct. 26, 2017 to award a sole-source contract to Lockheed Martin specifically to hire F-35 subject matter experts . The notice did not say how much the deal would cost, but did say that it would support the more than a dozen existing foreign F-35 customers, many of whom are likely dealing with a similar lack of information. Needless to say, these issues were sucking up time and resources and costing the government millions. This was one of the many reasons why, between 2012 and 2016, life cycle cost estimates for the F-35 fleet had grown by more than 20 percent. During the 2017 fiscal year alone, the Navy and Marine Corps spare parts costs surged from the original budget request of $261 million to more than $400 million. GAO It should come as no surprise that on Oct. 24, 2017, the U.S. announced there would be major review of the F-35 supply chain and its associated costs. The Pentagon may have hoped this announcement would have headed off the formal release of the GAO report later in the week. “Lockheed is familiar with this process because we’ve done it before with them, so this isn’t something new,” Shay Assad, the Pentagon’s Director of Defense Pricing told Defense News , somewhat tellingly noting that they had gone through this process at least once in the past. “Many of the things we’re talking about are just practices that have occurred in the past, this will just be much more rigorous. … And we’ll also lay out for them: Here’s our plan in terms of your subcontractor base, and this is what we want to do, and then get off and get the work done.” Assad specifically told Defense News that the Pentagon had a goal of further reducing the unit cost of each F-35, notably getting the price of a new F-35A model down to approximately $80 million. He did not mention the soaring sustainment costs that could easily outpace any such savings. A electronics technician removes a broken circuit board from a piece of the F-35A’s communications systems during depot-level maintenance., USAF We at The War Zone, along with many others, have warned in the past about the fallacy of focusing myopically on unit costs saving. GAO specifically noted that additional purchases above the 250 Joint Strike Fighters the U.S. military is already paying to sustain would only create more stress on the maintenance and logistics chains. And The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway already discussed how all of this could impact the Air Force’s plan to make the first operational deployment of its F-35As – which already have debatable combat capabilities – to Japan in November 2017 and the availability of those aircraft. The Marine Corps seems to be heading toward its own set of pitfalls since a lack of funds preventing the Navy from establishing adequate intermediate maintenance facilities for the jets onboard its ships. “Because a funded plan for intermediate-level maintenance is not yet in place, the Marine Corps will not have the desired level of intermediate-level maintenance capabilities for its initial shipboard deployments planned for 2018,” GAO noted. “Accordingly, it will be highly reliant on the currently challenged F-35 supply chain and depot repair capabilities for support, and will likely experience degraded readiness. In addition, without such a plan, it is unclear whether such capabilities will be available to support the Navy’s first planned F-35 shipboard deployments in 2021.” Hiding in the background of all of these issues have been delays and the potential for more slips in the development of the complex, but essential ALIS computer system, which you can read about in detail here . It seems very likely that any problems with this system, which manages maintenance data and tracks the figurative “health” of the aircraft’s components among many other functions, have only compounded the lack of information when maintenance technicians attempt to diagnose a fault on any particular aircraft. Airmen train to use the ALIS software using a virtual simulation., USAF It might even be one of the reasons why the Air Force has been so far unable to conclusively determine why aviators flying the F-35 at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona continue to report possible hypoxia , a term describing a dangerous lack of oxygen. In July 2017, the service said it was looking into refining the aircraft’s computer algorithm that determines how much oxygen the pilot receives from the onboard oxygen generation system, or OBOGS. On Oct. 24, 2017, Aviation Week reported that despite the Air Force’s decision to lift flying restrictions and get pilots back in the air, along with the computer code tweak, there had been at least another five reported potential episodes. However, Colonel Ben Bishop, head of the 56th Operations Group at Luke stressed that the Joint Strike Fighters OBOGS was always provide adequate oxygen to pilots and that the system did not immediately notice their symptoms as its programming should do. He said this pointed to possible hypercapnia, or too much carbon dioxide, as the true issue, which could be the fault of a different part of the aircraft’s life support system. “I think there might be something based on how the machine and the human are interacting that’s altering the breathing,” Bishop told Aviation Week. “So we’re obviously very interested in understanding how the valves are working and making sure our pilots can exhale comfortably.” A US Air Force pilot performs functional flight test on an F-35A in 2016., USAF In 2016, GAO chided the central F-35 program office over these issues, recommending that it develop a new plan to prioritize and address problems and risks with ALIS. They did so, but in its latest report, the watchdog found that there are still significant concerns, in no small part, yet again, due to budget shortfalls. “Emerging requirements, such as to address cyber security vulnerabilities and system obsolescence, will likely lead to changes in the Roadmap that could further delay the date when these sustainment capabilities are provided,” the report explained. “Furthermore, the requirements and associated timelines for ALIS development that are identified in this plan may not be realistic because the requirements are not fully funded in upcoming service budgets, resulting in additional risks to the program’s plan.” The issue of cyber security is one we at The War Zone have stressed numerous times before, especially since the U.S. military expects the F-35 to operate in a networked manner unlike any other previous aircraft. This concern has impacted foreign partners, as well, including Israel, which pushed hard to secure the unique right among foreign F-35 operators to tweak the Joint Strike Fighter’s computer software to its own needs. IAF In June 2017, I described what a worst case cyber attack scenario could look like for the global F-35 fleet: “The nightmare scenario would involve an opponent causing a disruption during an actual crisis by either actively feeding bad information into the ALIS system or otherwise disabling some portion of it or its overarching architecture. The interconnected nature of the arrangement might allow a localized breach to infect larger segments of the F-35 fleet both in the United States or abroad or vice versa. It’s not hard to imagine the time and energy needed to sort out real inputs and outputs from fake ones hampering or halting operations entirely under the right circumstances. Given the jet’s low-observable characteristics, advanced defensive systems, and other sensors, a cyber attack would be an attractive option for any enemy force. Why would an enemy use a $500,000 air-to-air or surface-to-air and put their personnel and equipment at risk in an attempt to down an F-35 when a simple worm may be able to do the same to a whole fleet of F-35s? It could also do so with plausible deniability, something kinetic weapons are far less adept to.” Now the U.K.’s Royal Air Force (RAF) is hiring cyber experts to look for weaknesses in the system. The RAF’s 591 Signal Unit, a counterintelligence element that has historically focused on guarding communications equipment, will manage the cyber defense effort, according to The Telegraph . It is presently advertising for contractors to help with the work. The United Kingdom has been having its own separate set of F-35 delays and cost overruns, which we at The War Zone have looked at in depth in regards to the Royal Navy’s new supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , which presently has no fixed-wing aircraft . The problems that GAO has identified with the U.S. military’s own program could easily translate to the United Kingdom or other foreign customers, will similarly have to manage the high costs of operating a stealth fighter fleet. The British are already concerned that they will not have enough of their own F-35Bs ready in time that it has signed a deal with the Marine Corps to have its Joint Strike Fighters fly from Queen Elizabeth on her first operational patrol F-35B, like those that will fly from the Queen Elizabeth , taking off from the USS Wasp ., F-35.com In the United Kingdom’s own case, the country’s flagging economy in light of its planned exit from the European Union, also known as Brexit, BAE Systems, the main U.K.-based F-35 related defense contractor, slashed some 2,000 jobs earlier in October 2017. Those layoffs that come in the company’s aviation divisions mainly involve the production of the Eurofighter Typhoon , but some will come at its facility in Samlesbury, which builds Joint Strike Fighter components. The “F-35 program is at a critical juncture,” GAO said at the conclusion of its report. The Pentagon’s “reactive approach to planning for and funding the capabilities needed to sustain the F-35 has resulted in significant readiness challenges – including multi-year delays in establishing repair capabilities and spare parts shortages. There is little doubt that the F-35 brings unique capabilities to the U.S. military, but without revising sustainment plans to include the key requirements and decision points needed to fully implement the F-35 sustainment strategy, and without aligned funding plans to meet those requirements, [The department of Defense] is at risk of being unable to leverage the capabilities of the aircraft it has recently purchased.” GAO This isn’t a particularly new assessment for us, unfortunately, with The War Zone noting that the Air Force and Navy in particularity are increasingly acknowledging, at least tacitly, that the initial plans to field hundreds of F-35s and do away with the bulk of their 4th generation fighter jets may simply not be sustainable . Just earlier in October 2017, Tyler Rogoway wrote : “I have always maintained that the most crushing fiscal aspect of fielding a predominantly stealthy manned fighter force is that the cost of operation, especially as the platform ages, will be far greater than the vast majority of the aircraft they replace. Lockheed has claimed that won’t be the case, but there are few metrics, not to mention little logic, available to support such a claim. Although the jet has revised, lower maintenance radar absorbent material coated skin, stealth aircraft have always been maintenance man hour hogs. Combine that with the complexity of the F-35, and it doesn’t take a crystal ball to realize the USAF will have to budget more money for sustainment than it already does for its existing fighter force.” The obvious hope is that the F-35 program can draw lessons it needs from its rough week, and make the changes necessary to get things back on track.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",US Marines Want Pint-Sized Rocket Artillery They can Carry in an MV-22 Osprey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After demonstrating its ability to fire artillery rockets from decks of U.S. Navy ships, the U.S. Marine Corps now says it is interested in a similar, but super-compact mobile weapon system small enough to fit inside its MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors or its future CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopters. Such a vehicle would greatly increase the capabilities of Marine expeditionary elements, but even the service itself acknowledges it might just not be physically possible. U.S. Marine Corps Major General David Coffman, presently serving as the U.S. Navy’s director for expeditionary warfare, explained the basic requirements to Military.com on the sidelines of the National Defense Industry Association’s (NDIA) annual Expeditionary Warfare Conference, which ended on Oct. 26, 2017. The officer described a weapon that would have a “competitive” range and capability compared to the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS , and its GPS-guided 227mm rockets, but on a vehicle smaller than a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), or Humvee , all of which could fit within the main cabin of an MV-22 or CH-53K. “I don’t know what’s in the art of the possible, physics-wise, to get a vehicle that can withstand the recoil of rockets firing, and be a stable enough platform, and still be light enough to be lifted in a helicopter, and all that.” He told Military.com. “So I don’t know what industry can do, whether that’s possible or not … [but] that’s what we need.” At its most fundamental, the notional requirement makes sense. The Marine Corps prides itself on being able to respond rapidly to crises anywhere in the world. Navy amphibious groups conduct routine patrols carrying so-called Marine Expeditionary Units, with the joint force able to conduct independent air and ground operations. Long range fire support for those elements comes primarily from a small number of M327 120mm mortars and M777 155mm howitzers , both of which need another vehicle to tow them around the battlefield. A Marine M1162 prime mover tows an M327 mortar during an exercise., USMC The Marines MV-22Bs or CH-53E Super Stallion can carry the “Triple-7,” but only with it slung underneath the aircraft. This extends the time it takes for Marines to get the howitzers into position, since they have to sling them up, fly where they need to go, then unhook the weapons and get them set up to fire. During an actual conflict, enemy air defenses and troops on the ground, to say nothing of complex terrain or other environmental factors, would only complicate this type of operation. The heavy external load also severely cuts down the helicopter’s combat radius. This was part of the reason for the development of the M327 in the first place. Together with the small 4×4 M1162 Growler prime mover, Marines can back the heavy mortar into an Osprey or Super Stallion and then drive it right off after the aircraft touches down. This gives Marines a much more rapidly employable fire support option. However, the M327 can only toss high-explosive mortars up to approximately five miles away, while the M777 can hit targets at nearly four times that range. On top of that, the 155mm howitzer can fire GPS-guided shells for precision attacks. The Marines are developing a long-range, precision 120mm projectile, but it will still have just half the range of the bigger guns. Coffman also told Military.com that there is guided option for the M252 81mm mortar in the works that might make the bulkier M327 increasingly superfluous. This smaller weapon is man-portable and part of every Marine infantry company, making up for its shorter range by generally being in closer proximity to forces in need of support. What Coffman is describing is a system that combines the mobility of the M327, but can lob guided projectiles beyond even the range of the M777. The Marine Corps 6×6 truck-mounted HIMARS, which the general offered as an example of the kind of capability he wanted, can hit the enemy with a GPS-directed rocket up to 43 miles away. A US Marine Corps M142 HIMARS launcher., USMC On Oct. 22, 2017, Marines had fired 227mm rockets from the deck of the San Antonio -class landing platform dock USS Anchorage as part of the Dawn Blitz 2017 amphibious warfare exercise. The test underscored the flexibility and utility of HIMARS, something the Marine Corps and the Army are both looking to expand upon further. Coffman, who previously served as deputy commander of I Marine Expeditionary Force and head of its 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade, the main Marine unit in the drill, was undoubtedly aware of this successful demonstration and its significance for the Corps going into the NDIA conference, which started on Oct. 24, 2017. He would also be well aware that small, forward-deployed artillery units , manned by both the Army and the Marine Corps crews, have been an essential part of the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria . With both HIMARS and M777 howitzers, they have provided rapid, on-call, precision fire support to local forces that might otherwise have to wait for coalition aircraft to arrive on station. This will likely be a model that appears in future limited, counter-terrorism operations, as well. An even lighter weight version would greatly expand the capabilities of smaller Marine units that might not be able to manage HIMARS, especially during limited independent missions more detached from established supply lines. The trucks themselves are far too big for even the enlarged CH-53K to carry internally or externally, requiring at least a C-130 Hercules to airlift them into a combat zone. Army and Navy landing craft can also move them from amphibious ships or sea bases to shore. Coffman’s concept could be difficult, if not impossible, to implement, though, especially if the goal remains to find a way to build a mini-HIMARS with anywhere near similar capabilities. The M327 is already pushing the boundaries of what the MV-22B can reasonably carry and is actually part of a complete Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) that requires multiple aircraft to lug around. One tilt-rotor or helicopter lugs around the M1162 and the mortar, while another brings in the similarly sized M1163 towing the M1164 ammunition trailer with 30 120mm mortars. Additional trips are necessary to keep up the supply of rounds during sustained operations. The CH-53K will be able to carry a Humvee internally, a major increase in capability in of itself, but it’s unclear if even that vehicle could handle the weight of a rocket artillery system with a range of more than 40 miles or the shock of repeatedly firing such a weapon. Whether such a truck-mounted launcher would still fit be able to fit inside the King Stallion is another important factor. There’s also the question of how fast Marines could keep up the supply of rockets for the crews once they land ashore, too. That being said, various companies may already be developing systems that Coffman might find attractive. At the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference and exhibition earlier in October 2017, Arnold Defense debuted a light-weight guided rocket system called Fletcher , which it mounted on the back of a 6×6 light vehicle chassis. The setup features a four round launcher capable of firing the laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) 70mm rocket. These weapons are already in service on fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters across the U.S. military and the guidance kit offers a cheap and easy way to turn standard versions into precision weapons. Since it slots in between the rocket motor and the payload, it means the ordnance technicians can assemble the final rounds with a variety of different warheads, including more exotic options such as anti-armor penetrators and anti-personnel variants with hundreds of tiny metallic darts known as flechettes. An artist’s conception of the Fletcher rocket artillery system., Arnold Defense The immediate issue with using as Fletcher as the basis of a design to meet Coffman’s requirements is that its a direct-fire weapon that fires a projectile that flies along a relatively flat trajectory. As such, it could be difficult to adapt it to hit targets indirectly just due to the flight profile of the rocket. In addition, its laser-guidance package means that either the vehicle itself or other personnel would have to mark the target, something Marines might be loathe to do in a firefight where they might be pinned down or otherwise sheltering behind cover. It is possible that Arnold or another firm might be able to develop a GPS- or dual-mode guidance system , but the final product would hardly match the capabilities of HIMARS. Fletcher only has a range of a little more than three miles, roughly equivalent to the M252 mortar and hardly the distances Coffman was talking about. However, the added mobility might make up for this by allow the vehicle to keep pace with Marines as with the 81mm weapon. It might be possible to develop an extended range 70mm rocket for surface-to-surface applications, too. Alternatively, the Marines might be interested in a lightweight gun. Mandus Group has developed an 105mm howitzer called Hawkeye that can fit on the back of Humvee or another similar light vehicle. This weapon can reach targets around 12 miles away using rocket-assisted shells. There are also a number of lightweight, soft-recoil mortars on the market that can fit on small trucks, such as the 120mm Spear Mk 2 from Israel’s Elbit and the Spanish EXPAL Integrated Mortar System, or EIMOS , which comes in 60mm and 81mm varieties. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4b_-VOTl7FM “If we can get a self-contained vehicle that can fire rockets, a box of rockets on a truck that fits in the back of a [MV-22B] tiltrotor or a ’53-K [CH-53K, that’s what we’re after,” Coffman insisted to Military.com. “Let’s see what industry comes up with.” It will be interesting to see how defense contractors try to meet the general’s requirements.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Official USAF Twitter Jokes About Nuclear War and Questions Santa’s Existence,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. military social media accounts can often be painfully boring, posting updates on things such as when certain base gates will be open, closures for extreme weather, upcoming morale and welfare events, and just re-posting official news. At a time when talk of nuclear weapons has come back into vogue, one U.S. Air Force Base decided to make a darkly humorous reference to nuclear war before getting into a major Twitter battle with another one about bombers, deterrence , and the existence of Santa Claus – no really. On Oct. 11, 2017, the Department of Defense’s official Twitter account posted a link to a collection of information and recent news regarding both nuclear deterrence and ballistic missile defense . This makes perfect since, for more than 10 months at that point, these had been important topics in light of North Korea’s increasingly threatening ballistic missile and nuclear weapon tests especially, but also on account of similar developments in Russia and Iran . Statements from U.S. President Donald Trump and members of his administration have also helped reignite the public debate about various aspets of nuclear arms in both the United States and elsewhere abroad. Heightened tensions and “fiery rhetoric” have a lot of people on edge. So it’s somewhat notable that two days after the Pentagon’s initial Tweet, the official account for Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota responded with “Hey @DeptofDefense, ‘would you like to play a game?’” via Twitter For those who might not know the reference, this was an obvious, if slightly incorrect callback to the 1983 movie WarGames , in which a young computer hacker unwittingly convinces a military super computer that there is an incoming nuclear attack on the United States from the Soviet Union. The teenager thinks the war plans are actually computer games and responds to the system’s prompt of “Shall we play a game?” What follows is the main character having to go toe-to-toe with the computer to convince it to abort the launch of U.S. Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), which would almost certainly touch off a nuclear holocaust. The protagonist eventually forces the machine to learn that when it comes to “global thermonuclear war,” “the only winning move is not to play,” a comment on the very nature of deterrence. At present, the real Air Force is in the process of developing its first new ICBM in decades , as well as a new long-range nuclear-capable cruise missile . The service is in charge of two full legs of America’s nuclear triad , which includes the land-based missiles , nuclear-armed bombers, and the U.S. Navy’s ballistic missile submarines.  In total, the United States has 4,000 nuclear warheads, including both gravity bombs and different types of missiles, plus another 2,000 it’s in the process of dismantling, according to a report from The New York Times’ editorial board. These are sitting at various bases and depots around the country, which often require transport in special tractor trailers full of James Bond-esque defenses. Minot Air Force Base itself is home to both the 5th Bomb Wing, with its nuclear-capable B-52H Stratofortess bombers, and the 91st Missile Wing, with its nuclear armed LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBMs. As such the joke comes off at best as darkly humorous. Especially so, since there have been multiple, real world examples of early warning systems giving a potentially devastating false report. In 1979, a glitch in the computers at the combined U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command’s (NORAD) headquarters, the Air Forces Strategic Command, the Pentagon, and the dedicated backup Alternate National Military Command Center all showed that the Soviet Union had launched a nuclear strike. In something out of WarGames , a technician had inserted a disk with a training simulation into the system without warning and set the whole network off. Thankfully, clear heads identified the source of the issue and avoided a nuclear holocaust. Then, in 1983, the same year WarGames hit theaters, Stanislav Petrov , then a Soviet Air Defense Forces officer, had to make snap assessments not once, but twice , that a space-based early warning system had malfunctioned and that the United States had not actually launched a nuclear attack. Experts widely believe that if Petrov had reported the incoming missiles as an actual attack, the Kremlin would have ordered a world-ending response, and have dubbed him “the man who saved the world.” More recently, in February 2017, U.S. personnel at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany received an urgent, automated alert about an incoming missile through their work stations. Again, thankfully, it was obvious that something had gone wrong. Unfortunately, these kind of mishaps have been terrifyingly common over the years, often triggering various parts of the United States government’s extensive system to make sure it can keep functioning during just such an apocalyptic crisis. In May 2017, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway got to have a detailed chat with Garrett Graff , author of Raven Rock: The U.S. Government’s Secret Plan To Save Itself While The Rest Of Us Die , about the full extent of these precautions and the potential for accidents. And especially with heightened tensions over North Korea’s threats to conduct an unprecedented atmospheric nuclear test , the Tweet from Minot seems in some ways both flippant and the kind of lighthearted candor one might hope from American military personnel who literally have the ability to end the world as we know it. There is a well-known motto among the service’s missileers already that “ death wears bunny slippers ,” a nod to the oddly casual nature of ICBM launch crews as they maintain their alert posture 24-hours a day, ready to respond at a moment’s notice. USAF patch But whoever’s behind the Minot’s Twitter account didn’t stop there. On Oct. 24, 2017, the base decided to engage in a bit of sibling rivalry with the team at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, home to the 509th Bomb Wing and its stealthy B-2 Spirit bombers. Seizing on a post from the main U.S. Air Force Twitter account marking U.S. President Richard Nixon’s decision to halt the bombing of North Vietnam briefly in 1972, Minot pointed out that it had been in the bomber business longer than Whiteman. What followed was an almost absurdist play of memes and juvenile insults from two central pillars of America’s nuclear deterrent apparatus, which eventually prompted the service’s central Twitter account to try and chide both parties into line, acting like a grumpy parent. via Twitter Whiteman’s Twitter account responded by pointing out the age and lack of stealthy features on the B-52, which first entered service in 1955. The aircraft is getting long in the teeth, with the Air Force looking into new and substantial upgrades, including replacing the bomber’s eight dated engines, which have become a logistical nightmare . Minot countered by noting that the B-2 reached initial operational capability in 1997 and that the Air Force is in the process of developing a new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider . That’s when the Air Force’s main Twitter account stepped in to say that if the two base accounts didn’t knock it off, “No television for a week!” via Twitter “Fine,” Whiteman’s social media Tweet posted, along with an animated picture of a child looking nonplussed. “Ain’t got time for T.V. anyway. #Training #Deterrence.” via Twitter The “threat” didn’t change matters much and the roasting continued through Oct. 25, 2017. Like small children on the playground confronted by an adult, the two accounts blamed each other in meme-filled posts for “starting it.” via Twitter At one point, Minot bragged that the B-52H can carry more bombs than the B-2, to which Whiteman responded by highlighting the Spirit’s mission to carry the 30,000 pound GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), saying it was about “quality not quantity” and throwing in another animated picture of James Franco from the movie The Interview – which involves a U.S. government plot to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un – with the phrase “They hate us cause they ain’t us.” via Twitter At one point the two squabbling Twitter accounts agreed that the KC-135R tankers from the 22nd Aerial Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base were an integral part of the bomber mission and that without them neither the B-52 nor the B-2 would be able to get anywhere near the target area . The 22nd is specifically assigned the role of supporting bombers during a nuclear mission. Minot and Whiteman declined to point out that the KC-135 is even older than the B-52. The Air Force has been steadily upgradinge those aircraft with new glass cockpits to help keep them flying for the foreseeable future as it continues to struggle with getting the new KC-46A tanker into service. via Twitter Near the end of the day on Oct. 25, 2017, whoever runs the main Air Force Twitter account had clearly decided it was time to go figuratively thermonuclear and try and end banter. “We didn’t want to do this, but if you 2 can’t get along we must,” the post began. “Santa will bring you nothing this year,” it continued, before doing something that only a truly terrible parent would do. “Because he isn’t real!” via Twitter Whiteman’s account appeared stunned, sending along another meme of Homer Simpson disappearing into a hedge. Minot’s challenged the assertion in response, noting that NORAD famously tracks him every year on Christmas Eve – which is an entirely separate story that started with a misprinted phone number in a 1955 Sears ad that offered children a chance to call Santa, but instead connected them to the American component of the air defense command. via Twitter via Twitter The Washington Examiner quickly ran a story saying that the air Force had “ confirmed ’ that Santa wasn’t real, putting the service’s Twitter account into something closer to more conventional damage control. “Santa is real,” it Tweeted out. “Bluffing to get @Whiteman_AFB @TeamMinot in line.” via Twitter Air Force Times subsequently ran its own story with the very accurate headline “Air Force says Santa isn’t real, regrets it immediately.” The Santa debacle seemed to end the whole episode, whether the Air Force’s Twitter account was ever really serious about wanting to curtail it or not.  Minot has since deleted most of its Tweets, but Whiteman’s posts are still up. It’s why we’ve chosen to use screen shots throughout this story, in order to best preserve a record of this oddly intense debate. When it comes to global thermonuclear war, the only way to win might be to not play at all, but it doesn’t appear to prevent the stewards of America’s nuclear arsenal and those who keep the watch from gently ribbing each other in the meantime.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 9, 2019",South Korea Reveals Plan to Hit The North With a Huge Missile Barrage If War Erupts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high, South Korea has publicly revealed a three-layer attack strategy, along with plans to acquire additional types of ballistic missiles, which it could put into action in the event of any conflict with North Korea. The disclosure appears to be the latest in a string of surprisingly detailed military announcements that South Korean authorities have been making to deter an increasingly belligerent Kim Jong-un , but could just as easily provoke the pariah state. South Korea’s Army included the missile strike concept in a report to the Defense Committee of the country’s National Assembly as part of an annual audit. The strategy, coupled with the acquisition of new ballistic missiles, was part of a larger five-pillar modernization plan that also included improving the capabilities of the country’s conventional ground forces , adding more drones and unmanned ground vehicles to the force, crafting a new battle management network, and the already announced formation of a specialized unit for so-called “decapitation strikes” to surgically neutralize key North Korean figures and assets during a crisis, which we at The War Zone have already examined in detail . The review specifically said that the main goal of the three tier missile attack plan, which sounds very similar to South Korea’s existing “ Kill Chain ” concept, was to present North Korea with the threat of rapidly losing much of its ballistic missile , nuclear weapons , and long-range artillery capabilities , which the South Korean Army said would be “unbearable costs” for Kim Jong-un’s regime. “We would use those three-types of missiles as the first salvo of the missile strike and concentrate them during the initial phase of war to destroy North Korea’s long-range artillery units and missiles located in ballistic missile operating area,” the report explained, according to The Korea Herald . The three missiles in question are South Korea’s existing indigenously developed Hyunmoo-2 short-range ballistic missiles, along with two new surface-to-surface designs, the Korean Tactical Surface-to-Surface Missile (KTSSM) I and II, which are still in development. South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group first publicly displayed the KTSSM-I, which it dubbed “The Artillery Killer,” at the annual International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition, or ADEX, in Seoul earlier in October 2017. The KTSSM-I has a range of approximately 75 miles and looks very much like the U.S. military’s Army Tactical Missile System ( ATACMS ), though it’s unclear what, if any, connection there actually is between the two systems. Unlike the tracked or wheeled launchers Americans use to fire ATACMS, Hanwha has developed a fixed, four-round launcher that South Korea would likely emplace at multiple, hardened locations within striking distance of the North. “KTSSM-I will strike the enemy’s tunnels with the 170-mm self-propelled howitzers and 240-mm multiple-rocket launch systems,” the South Korean Army noted in its report to the National Assembly, according to South Korea’s Yonhap News . Hanwha released a graphic at ADEX 2017 showing the missile following a complex flight path straight into a tunnel opening. Hanwha Group via Defence Blog South Korea hopes to take delivery of these weapons starting in 2019. There has been one report in the South Korean press suggesting that work on this design might end up delayed by as much as four years due to the need for the United States to approve the export of various sensitive components. The KTSSM-II, which Hanwha has not publicly unveiled, would simultaneously hit North Korean short-range missile sites and rocket artillery batteries, according to the annual review continued. Lastly, the Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missiles would strike nuclear weapons related sites, including those underground. Earlier in 2017, South Korea released footage of a test of the Hyunmoo-2 against a mock bunker, highlighting its ground penetrating capabilities in an obvious threat to North Korea, which relies heavily on subterranean facilities to protect its key military facilities and weapons. There was no mention of whether or not the Hyunmoo-3 surface-to-surface cruise missile might also be involved in this attack plan. Though it is a South Korean Army concept, it is possible that the final strategy could also include submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which is a capability the South Korean Navy is expected to include in its future Jangbogo III -class diesel electric submarines. It is possible that the country may decide to retrofit older subs to a similar configuration, as well. On top of that, the South Koreans are close to fielding the latest Hyunmoo-2C variant , which has the range to strike anywhere inside North Korea, as well as considering development of an even more capable design, referred to as the Hyunmoo-4. At present, a bilateral agreement between the United States and South Korea limits the maximum size of the warhead in any South Korean ballistic missile to 1,100 pounds and stipulates a range of no more than 500 miles. In exchange, the government in Seoul gets assistance with its weapon development within those parameters. Ostensibly the idea behind these restrictions was to avoid an unnecessary tensions between South Korea and both North Korea and China. However, in light of major North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear weapons developments, the U.S. President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in tentatively agreed to scrap those limits and set new standards, in September 2017, which could allow the notional Hyunmoo-4 to carry twice as much payload over longer distances. As with previous South Korean announcements, it’s not clear how effective this missile attack concept – which The Korea Herald dubbed “ Frankenmissile ” – would be either in practice or as a tool for deterring Kim Jong-un. South Korea’s Army itself said it was confident it could destroy North Korea’s frontline artillery systems in its report to the Defense Committee, but did not extend this assessment to the North’s ballistic missile or nuclear weapon capabilities. One immediate plan with this strategy is whether it will actually serve to deter rather than provoke North Korea. Kim and his regime operate a massive propaganda machine that routinely accuses the United States and its South Korean allies of preparing for preemptive strikes and planning to assassinate North Korea’s leadership, something we have highlighted at The War Zone numerous times in the past . A public announcement of a plan for preemptive missile strikes can only feed into that narrative and potentially prompt North Korea to make additional provocative demonstrations, such as missile launches or nuclear tests, to demonstrate its own resolve to respond decisively to external threats. Separate from the announcement of the missile strategy, Ri Yong Pil, a senior North Korean diplomat told CNN that world leaders shouldn’t be quick to dismiss a recent threat by the country’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho of an unprecedented atmospheric nuclear weapon test . “The foreign minister is very well aware of the intentions of our supreme leader, so I think you should take his words literally,” Ri said. North Korean Premier Kim Jong-un reportedly signing the order for a nuclear test in January 2016., Kyodo via AP But the bigger issue is probably whether or not any combination of South Korean missiles has the capability to reliably destroy North Korean artillery and missile emplacements, as well as command and control centers and other key facilities, especially those buried deep underground. Previous demonstrations notwithstanding, it seems highly unlikely that Hyunmoo-2 or the upcoming KTSSM family have the ability to bore down far enough to be truly a threat to many important sites. In April 2017, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway discussed this issue with regards to the appearance of the Ohio -class guided missile submarine USS Michigan and its Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles in South Korea. He wrote : “The Michigan packs a massive amount of standoff weaponry that theoretically could reach anywhere into North Korea with a high chance of survival. It is in many ways a reminder of just how little the US would need to commit in terms of risking its own warfighters during the opening strikes of a conflict. All of this sounds impressive—and it is to some degree—but to the Kim regime it likely means very little. Although North Korea may have their garish military parades , the US has now shown off every single known piece of conventional military hardware to Pyongyang, and it has had zero effect on the Kim regime’s behavior. The USS Michigan’s presence nearby will be no different. Not just that, but its cruise missiles only represent a tiny fraction of the targets that would be needed to be attacked during an open conflict with North Korea. But most importantly, they are nearly useless against the regime itself, which has deeply buried and highly fortified bunkers spread throughout the North Korean countryside—some buried under entire mountains. The only weapon (short of a nuclear barrage) that threatens these bunkers is the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) —but you have to know where all these bunkers are—and where the regime may be hiding—before you can put these exotic and limited weapons to use. Still, don’t be surprised if we get to see the MOP in action in the near term, because the Pentagon has run out of conventional weapons with which to intimidate the North Koreans. With bomber flights over South Korea becoming little more than a lame exercise in routine saber rattling, a highly publicized practice bombing run by a MOP-lugging B-2 Spirit on a range in South Korea could be in our near future.” For a plan such as this to be successful, especially with its stated goal of imposing “unbearable costs” on North Korea, it has to have a good chance of neutralizing the bulk of that country’s ability to respond. Beyond the hardened bunkers, North Korea has been investing significantly in road-mobile launchers that would make it harder to track ballistic missiles and solid fuel rocket motors that would make it more difficult for the South Koreans to engage them before crews can fire. Troops need significantly more time to set up liquid-fueled weapons before a launch. As the South Korean Army noted in its review, there are parallel efforts to substantially increase South Korea’s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and communication and information sharing capabilities. Most notably, the South Korean Air Force will get two RQ-4 Global Hawk drones in 2018 and another pair the year after. Though these high flying unmanned aircraft aren’t able to stealthily penetrate North Korean air defenses undetected, they could carry long-range radars and other sensors that could peer into the Hermit Kingdom from a stand-off distance. You can read more about that in our detailed explainer on U.S. military intelligence and surveillance assets pointed at North Korea. Those American satellites, aircraft, drones, and other systems could potentially feed additional data to South Korea’s military in preparation for the missile attacks. South Korea is also exploring renting commercial surveillance satellites ahead of plans to launch its own space-based intelligence gathering constellation starting in 2021. But given the density of South Korean urban centers and their proximity to North Korea – the country’s capital Seoul is already within range of North Korean 170mm guns and 300mm artillery rockets – even just a single North Korean missile, especially one carrying a nuclear or chemical weapon, could be devastating. If enough of those weapons survive the initial barrage, Kim Jong-un could decide to provoke a regional crisis by attacking targets in Japan, or even lash out at the U.S. military base on Guam or beyond. The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway recently pointed out that the North Korean premier could decide to launch a terrifying asymmetric attack on military and commercial satellites in low earth orbit, too. Kim Jong-un and other North Korean officials celebrate after the successful test of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile in September 2017., KCNA Ballistic missile defenses could help defend against these counter-attacks. The U.S. Army recently declared that it had finished setting up its Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) missile defense battery in South Korea and formally attached the unit, Battery D, 2nd Air Defense Artillery, to its 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, which is forward deployed in the country. Unfortunately the interceptors only guard a relatively limited area and would have trouble responding to a multi-missile barrage, especially if it came from a number of different directions at once, including from submarines off shore , which could be a possibility in the future. Conservative estimates from experts suggest that millions of people could die in the opening salvo of any conflict that erupts first on the Korean Peninsula. Despite fiery rhetorically from both U.S. President Trump and Kim and his regime in North Korea, Government officials in the United States, South Korea, Japan, and other countries in the region have consistently stressed their desire, at least publicly for a non-military solution to the problem. “North Korea’s provocation threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council,” U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis said during a shared press conference with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Defense Ministers Meeting in the Philippines on Oct. 24, 2017. “As United States Secretary of State Tillerson has said, quote, ‘Our goal is the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,’ unquote.” Part of achieving that goal will definitely including the United States and its allies making clear their willingness and capabilities to respond militarily to North Korean provocations. So, far, though, it unfortunately has had little obvious impact on convincing Kim to adopt a more conciliatory tone.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 30, 2018",Northrop Grumman Bails on Navy’s Watered-Down Tanker Drone Competition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a significant turn of events, despite having been seeing as one of, if not the leading firm involved the program, Northrop Grumman has revealed it will not submit a bid for the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone competition. The decision suggests that company felt it could not significantly resdesign its existing X-47B unmanned aircraft, or develop an entirely new aircraft, and still make a competitive offer. Northrop Grumman CEO Wesley Bush made the announcement during a phone call with reporters on Oct. 25, 2017. He added that this was the third time the company had decided to drop out of a major aircraft procurement program in the past decade. The firm pulled out of the KC-X tanker competition in 2010 and decided to withdraw its bid for the T-X trainer program earlier in 2017. The Navy released the final MQ-25 request for proposals (RFP) to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman in October 2017 and the other three are still vying for the contract, which the service expects to award in September 2018. “We really look … under terms of [the] RFP to make sure we can execute,” Bush explained, according to a series of Tweets from FlightGlobal’s Leigh Giangreco. “You might say we’re a little tough on ourselves, but I demand and the company demands we’re clear eyed about that.” Bush said Northrop Grumman did not feel it could “put forward an attractive offer” that met the Navy’s demands. However, he stressed that the decision wasn’t solely based on whether or not the company could win. The announcement offers important hints as to how the competition might go over the coming months. Aviation analysts and experts had widely viewed Northrop Grumman as a leading candidate to build the MQ-25. This was in no small part due to the extensive and unique experience in building unmanned aircraft for the Navy that the company already had in its portfolio. Northrop Grumman’s two X-47B demonstrators, a deliberately stealthy flying wing design, had essentially written the book on carrier-based drones in extensive tests that ran from 2011 into 2015. The X-47Bs were the first fixed wing unmanned aircraft to perform a catapult launch from an aircraft carrier and first to land autonomously back on the ship. The experimental pilotless planes were also the first to link up with an aerial tanker using a probe-and-drogue type refueling system. The Navy had said that this Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator (UCAS-D) project would be a lead in to the competitive Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program. The goal would be to build a low-observable unmanned combat aircraft that would be able to sneak past advanced integrated air defenses to perform precision strikes or persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. We at the War Zone have written extensively about the transformation of the Navy’s requirements from the UCLASS vision to an almost completely different request for a tanker drone with a secondary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability. So, Northrop Grumman’s decision not to compete is an important development, but not one that’s necessarily surprising. One of the X-47B demonstrators., Northrop Grumman It was already clear that the requirements Navy’s revised MQ-25 program, also known as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), could scuttle any firm’s plans to use its existing stealthy concepts. Rob Weiss, in charge of Lockheed’s famous Skunk Works, had already gone on record saying he expected all the competitors to have to significantly revise their designs. As I wrote in July 2017: The shift in requirements to a tanker with secondary intelligence gathering capability already  suggested manufacturers might rework their proposals around less costly non-stealthy designs. “From our viewpoint, the requirements, as they are currently unfolding, are going to require a new design from all of the  competitors,” Rob Weiss, head of Lockheed’s Skunk Works advanced  projects office, told USNI in March 2017 . … Of course, there is always the possibility one or more of the four contractors could put forward a stealthy tanker design. There is growing evidence that aerial refuelers, manned or unmanned, are increasingly vulnerable in high threat environments in general. In May 2017, a Russian fighter jet intercepted and then did a barrel roll atop an Air Force KC-10 flying over Syria, underscoring this potential danger. But unless all of the competitors decide to go this route,  anyone who does might be stuck making an offer that is significantly  more expensive and less attractive as a result. When a photograph emerged of one of the X-47Bs with an air refueling or “buddy” store, which contains its own retractable fuel line with a receptacle “basket” at the end, there was no new information to suggest it wasn’t still reasonable to question whether this combination would be a viable contender . Not only was it unclear whether the existing design had the space to hold the required to be able to supply the required 2,200 gallons of fuel 500 miles away from the carrier’s deck, but also whether it would be cost effective for Northrop Grumman to reconfigure it for this new mission. The latter point seems especially pertinent, since any stealth aircraft is going to be more expensive than a non-stealthy one as a rule. It is easy to interpret Northrop Grumman CEO Bush’s comments as an acknowledgement that an X-47B-derived tanker could’ve been overly expensive and that there was no interest in producing a new, clean-sheet design. But it is still interesting that Northrop Grumman chose to withdraw and effectively abandon nearly four years of experience working directly with the Navy on unmanned carrier aviation for the foreseeable future. That’s not counting even more work on unmanned combat aircraft for the service stretching back to the early 2000s, either. If the MQ-25 program moves ahead as expected, it will be the service’s first operational pilotless carrier aircraft and could serve as the basis for variants tasked with additional missions, something that General Atomics has already indicated is the case . One of the X-47B demonstrators aboard the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in 2012., Northrop Grumman Opting out now could cut the company out of the potential for immediate sales, as well as putting them at a disadvantage in future programs. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway had similar questions about why the firm decided to suddenly pull out of the T-X trainer competition. Northrop Grumman’s entry for that program leveraged significant experience from its existing T-38 trainer. As in that case, it is entirely possible that Northrop Grumman decided its energies were best spent elsewhere. The company is already deeply invested in developing the B-21 Raider stealth bomber for the U.S. Air Force and is very active in clandestine unmanned projects .  In his conference call, Bush specifically noted that his company’s drone projects were “broadly doing well.” There’s also the distinct possibility the decision could be linked, at least in part, to Northrop Grumman’s purchase of Orbital ATK, a deal that will set the company back nearly $8 billion immediately. This will undoubtedly cost even more in total as the firm has decide how best to integrate the large portfolio of diverse new business divisions. As a result, it might feel that it does not have resources to spare to make a viable bid for the MQ-25. With Northrop Grumman out of the running, it will be interesting to see how the other competitors respond. Boeing and Lockheed Martin have yet to show detailed artwork depicting their designs. In the meantime, General Atomics’ MQ-25 concept looks to have turned the tables and brought that firm from being a dark horse contender in the UCLASS project to a leading competitor in present CBARS program, something we’ve discussed in detail in the past. With General Atomics now firmly out in front, it is entirely possible that either Boeing or Lockheed Martin could decide to drop out and refocus their own efforts on other projects.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",The US Is Crafting a Joint Air Force-Army Search and Rescue Super Team in Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The last U.S. Air Force combat search and rescue unit in Afghanistan is about to undergo an interesting transformation. The new organization will retain its commend element and pararescuemen, but replace the service’s HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters with U.S. Army CH-47F Chinooks. On Oct. 22, 2017, one of the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron’s HH-60Gs flew with a pair of Army CH-47Fs on a mission from Bagram Airfield, the U.S. military’s main hub in Afghanistan, ahead of the transition . As part of the drawdown of American forces in the country ahead of the end of official coalition combat operations in 2014, the Air Force shut down the 26th Expeditionary Rescue Squadron at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province in December 2013, leaving the 83rd as the only remaining Air Force rescue element. This isn’t the first time Air Force and Army elements at Bagram have trained together for the search and rescue mission. In March 2017, the 83rd teamed up for a drill with a quick reaction force of Minnesota Army National Guardsmen attached to the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade’s Task Force Fight Eagles, a general purpose outfit that also conducts casualty evacuation missions, which are generally less complex than combat search and rescue operations. “Its two like entities doing a similar job,” a member of the 83rd, which the service identified only as U.S. Air Force 2nd Lieutenant Dan, said. “Combine their strengths to make a superior force to get our guys home.” An HH-60G Pave Hawk taxies with a pair of CH-47F Chinooks ahead of a joint mission from Bagram Airfield in October 2017., USAF It appears that the U.S. military has heeded this advice with the decision to create a formal joint unit that blends together both combat search and rescue and casualty evacuation specialties. We don’t know why the Air Force and Army settled on the Chinook in this particular case as the main aircraft, but Ed Darack, an author and photographer, recently shared his own experiences with the helicopters while he was embedded with U.S. forces in Afghanistan with us at The War Zone, describing them as an unsung workhorse of the fighting in the country. Specifically, he wrote : “The Black Hawk’s passage above the airstrip highlighted, through contrast, the key distinguishing characteristic of the CH-47: its rotor configuration. The Black Hawk is a “tail rotor” helicopter, relying on a tail rotor to counteract the torque effect of the main rotor system –and through “anti-torque” foot pedal control inputs, yaw the aircraft clockwise and counterclockwise. By far the most common form of rotary-wing aircraft throughout the world, the tail-rotor helicopter suffers a fundamental disadvantage: that tail rotor draws upwards of 15 percent of available power that would otherwise be used for thrust simply to keep the helicopter from spinning wildly out of control. “The Chinook, on the other hand, uses a torque-cancelling configuration of two counter-rotating rotor systems, one three-bladed assembly at the front of the helicopter’s fuselage, and one at the rear. With this design, virtually 100% of available horsepower its two turboshaft engines produce is applied to thrust – a small amount is lost due to internal friction of the gears in the combiner box and transmissions. “All of this thrust allows the Chinook to carry upwards of 50 troops and their gear in its spacious fuselage. The helicopter can also haul tens of thousands of pounds of cargo, loaded internally or slung beneath it. The ability for CH-47s to externally sling heavy military implements like howitzers quickly became so renowned that it inspired an enduring nickname for those in the Chinook world: “Hookers,” for the hooks found on the underside of the aircraft’s fuselage to which the slings attach. “The Chinook also ranks as the fastest helicopter in the Department of Defense, contrary to an unfortunate stereotype frequently repeated in media reports characterizing it as “huge and slow.” All three primary iterations of the U.S. Military’s largest helicopter, the CH-53D, E, and now K , dwarf the Chinook in size, but not speed.” Speed is of particular importance during combat search and rescue and casualty evacuation operations, where every minute a helicopter crew spends getting to and from the scene adds to the total time before a possibly seriously wounded service member arrives at a field hospital. Medical professionals often talk about the “ golden hour ,” the first 60 minutes after a serious injury where they have the best chance of saving that person’s life or otherwise preventing serious permanent damage. The added cargo capacity of the Chinook could also come in handy if friendly pilot came down in an insolate area that could be swarming with enemy fighters. A pair of CH-47s could more easily carry a more substantial reaction element to defend the recovery operation than the smaller HH-60Gs. Combat search and rescue missions in general require at least two helicopters, with one typically providing immediate protection as the other lands to pick up the friendly personnel, as well as offering a backup in case something happens to the lead aircraft. Additional fixed wing aircraft, such as the venerable A-10 Warthog, typically provide additional support . Air Force pararescuemen and Army National Guardsmen train together in Afghanistan in March 2017., USAF Of course, the CH-47 is larger and could have trouble negotiating smaller landing zones – or even just a present a bigger target for the enemy to shoot at. We have seen some pretty impressive demonstrations of the Chinook’s ability to hold a hover on relatively small outcroppings to load and unload troops and cargo, though, a maneuver commonly known as a pinnacle landing. You can see an example of this in the video below. Regardless, the HH-60Gs themselves, despite significant upgrades since they first entered service in 1982, are in desperate need of replacement. The Air Force, however, has struggled to acquire new search and rescue helicopters for more than a decade. In November 2006, the Air Force had actually selected a variant of Boeing’s Chinook, the HH-47, as the winner of a program to replace the Pave Hawks. Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky both successfully protested that contract award and the service canceled the purchases. What followed was a series of other abortive attempts to find a suitable aircraft. An artist’s conception of Boeing’s proposed HH-47 rescue helicopter., Boeing In 2014, the Air Force finally chose Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, as the winner of the latest competition. Unfortunately, those new helicopters, known as the HH-60W, won’t start arriving until sometime in 2020 . So, beyond just the potential added benefits of the Chinook, the joint model might be a good option to best allocate resources. Those aircraft combined with Air Force pararescuemen, also known as PJs in reference to the old title of parajumper, might be the best of both worlds. It frees up the HH-60Gs for differently demanding combat search and rescue operations elsewhere, as well. Official concept art of the forthcoming HH-60W., Lockheed Martin PJs are “basically the subject matter experts for casualty extraction and treatment – this is their bread and butter – so they’ve been helping us with that,” U.S. Army First Lieutenant Brett Rankowitz, a member of the Minnesota Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 136th Infantry, said during the exercise in March 2017. “They are working to make sure that our medics are to the proficiency that they would like to see, working to develop our extraction techniques, and helping us with the air to ground integration as well.” This concept might even be applicable in other areas where the U.S. military is deployed, including at bases throughout the Middle East supporting the fight against ISIS and sites across Africa as part of various regional counter terrorism efforts. Still, as the War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has pointed out before, the idea of traditional helicopters performing combat search and rescue missions in anything but low-risk environments is becoming increasingly untenable in the face of steadily improving, integrated air defenses , especially among possible near-peer opponents such as Russia and China . Even countries, such as North Korea, that have aging, but dense air defense networks could pose a significant threat . In August 2017, he wrote : “The USAF is finally getting its CSAR community new Black Hawk derivatives— the HH-60W —to replace their worn-out HH-60G Pave Hawks. But how these aircraft can reliably infiltrate into areas where only high-end stealth aircraft can venture, and even they couldn’t survive, is unknown. For lower-end threat environments, the HH-60W’s capabilities, along with a traditional package of assets including A-10 Warthogs in the “Sandy” role, and other aircraft to provide suppression of enemy air defenses, electronic warfare support, command and control, and defensive counter-air capabilities will be applicable. “Meanwhile the USMC has adapted their tactics to take full advantage of the MV-22 Osprey’s great qualities for what they call the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission. The Osprey has speed on its side, which is critical for the CSAR/TRAP mission set, but the same issues apply to the Osprey as the HH-60W and even the Air Force Special Operations Command’s CV-22s—even with low-level flying and external support from myriad of assets, can an Osprey survive in a higher-end contested environment where stealth aircraft pilots could inadvertently find themselves on the ground in the future? … “With these issues in mind, it would seem that in the most critical of situations, the best aircraft for recovering a stealth aircraft pilot is another stealth aircraft. As we all well know the Pentagon has the technology, and the high-end CSAR mission seems like a key niche that requires it, a solution I have laid out in detail before. As of now there are no known plans to provide the CSAR community with a low observable design for the toughest of CSAR missions. This means either the Air Force is willing to accept much higher risk for future CSAR missions or that they simply won’t be able to attempt to rescue pilots in certain contested environments at all.” In Afghanistan, where enemy forces have extremely limited anti-aircraft capabilities, helicopters will continue to be an important part of the search and rescue and casualty evacuation equation, though. The need for this support will only likely increase as the United States looks to step up offensive operations against both the Taliban and its allies and an emergent ISIS-affiliated group, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. By June 2017, six American troops had already died in the fight against ISIS-K . And even if hostile forces can’t shoot down friendly aircraft, accidents do happen. In March 2016, an F-16CM fighter jet crashed shortly after taking off from Bagram due to a catastrophic engine failure. With a new influx of aircraft into Afghanistan, including additional F-16 multi-role fighter jets and KC-135R tankers , the potential for such an incident goes up, even if the overall chances remain small. As the U.S. military gets its expanded mission underway, the Air Force-Army team at Bagram will be at the ready for both combat and non-combat emergencies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 11, 2018",Just How Closely Are US and French Forces Cooperating in Niger?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a lengthy and detailed briefing for the press on a deadly ambush near the Nigerien village of Tongo Tongo that led to the deaths of four American troops, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford highlighted how closely the U.S. military was working with French forces in North and West Africa during this particular mission and in general. However, new details from U.S. Africa Command call into question the extent of that relationship , including the true nature of intelligence sharing and combined operations, and the state of the multi-national counter-terrorism effort as a whole . For more information on why the U.S. military has forces deployed in Niger, we have already written an in depth explainer here . You can also find more details about American military activities across Africa in general here . Dunford offered the most granular timeline of the incident to date and then answered a host of questions over the course of the hour-long briefing at the Pentagon on Oct. 23, 2017. While noting that a number of investigations are still in progress, America’s top uniformed officer made it clear that he was looking to provide as much information as he could and as was known at that time, including explaining why and how French military support came to be involved and when it arrived on the scene. Working with the French in Africa “Within an hour, French Mirage jets arrived on station. And then later that afternoon, French attack helicopters arrived on station,” Dunford explained. “During the firefight, two U.S. soldiers were wounded and evacuated by French air to Niamey, and that was consistent with the casualty evacuation plan that was in place for this particular operation.” According to the general, this was the case because of significant existing coordination between France and the United States not only in Niger, but across the whole of North and West Africa. At present, France has deployed approximately 4,000 personnel across sites in Niger, as well as Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, and Mauritania, a bloc now known as the G5 Sahel , in reference to the region of Africa between the Sahara and true sub-Saharan Africa. A French H225M Caracal search and rescue helicopter refuels with a US Air Force MC-130J Commando II special operations transport during an exercise off the coast of France in 2017., French Ministry of the Armed Forces The force, which includes light armored vehicles, special operations forces, transport and gunship helicopters, and fixed-wing combat aircraft, conducts active counter-terrorism operations, including long range patrols looking for militants, as part of Operation Barkhane . This was a successor to a long-standing French presence in Chad, which started in 1986 as Operation Épervier , and its intervention in Mali, Operation Serval , which began in 2012. “We are integrated in conducting operations with the French,” Dunford explained. “We are partnered with them there [in North and West Africa].” But when we asked U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), the top U.S. military headquarters for operations on the continent, to elaborate on the exact level of coordination, what we found was that much of the relationship seems more informal and ad hoc than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff seemed to be suggesting. While the two parties clearly provide support to one and other as necessary, they do so without any localized, combined command structure to truly focus the effort. Robyn Mack, a spokesperson for the command said unequivocally in an Email to the War Zone that there is no shared U.S.-French intelligence fusion center in Niger or any neighboring country. Similarly, there is no formal combined task force that links the two forces in the region together. By comparison, in Iraq and Syria, the U.S. military runs what it calls the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, which has representatives from various coalition nations working directly together in a number of command centers and intelligence shops throughout the Middle East. “We have engaged with the French and African forces in the Lake Chad region for some time,” Mack noted. “The support provided by our French counterparts is demonstrative of the importance of our partnership and mutual efforts to bring stability to the region.” French troops supporting Operation Barkhane in 2014., French Ministry of the Armed Forces A limited partnership This is unquestionably true, but it appears that most of that active coordination occurs in Europe rather than actually on the ground in places such as Niger. Direct American support for France’s contingent began in January 2013 following that country’s intervention in Mali. As part of a separate effort, known as Operation Juniper Micron , the U.S. military provided logistical and aerial refueling support, as well as increased intelligence sharing. Small joint teams situated primarily at French and American bases in France, Germany, and Italy coordinated this effort. In addition to U.S. Air Force personnel who managed the influx of personnel and cargo in Mali’s capital Bamako, U.S. special operators flew into Mali on small, specialized U.S. Air Force transport aircraft with discreet civilian-style paint jobs to directly assist French forces on the ground. According to one official history that the author obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, the C-146A Wolfhound , a militarized version of the twin engine Dornier 328, was particularly important. “The C-146A proved instrumental and provided U.S. support to the French counter-offensive,” the 524th Special Operations Squadron explained in a review of its activities during 2013. “The C-146A was also the first U.S. aircraft to land in Gao [, a major city in Northern Mali,] following the offensive against Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, delivering U.S. special operations forces to the frontlines of conflict.” USAF via FOIA This support has been constant ever since and has continued in response to French requests. The U.S. military itself had suggested it would’ve preferred to end the partnership entirely years ago. In January 2014, Defense Department spokesman U.S. Air Force Major Robert Firman told Stars and Stripes “the Pentagon does not expect it to go on indefinitely.” “So, we’re hoping to continue to see, obviously, the French success there and hopefully our mission will continue to slow down,” U.S. Air Force Major Nicholas Schindler, then commander of the 351st Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron in Moron, Spain, also told the outlet at the time. Robyn Mack, the AFRICOM spokesperson, confirmed to The War Zone in her Email that Operation Juniper Micron is still ongoing. That mission is now more than four years old. A C-146A Wolfhound., USAF Separate missions However, the American troops who died in Niger on Oct. 4, 2017, were out on a patrol with Nigerien forces were there under the auspices of Operation Juniper Shield. This is a larger, overarching American regional counter terrorism operation in North and West Africa, which first began as Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara, or OEF-TS , in the mid-2000s. Over more than a decade of operations, there have been various special operations forces deployments, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions to monitor trouble spots. In 2013, President Barack Obama announced the establishment of a drone operation in Niger’s capital Niamey. U.S. commanders in the region reportedly retasked one of these unmanned aircraft from its assigned mission to monitor the situation as it developed in Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4, 2017. A table showing RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy plane missions originating in Europe in 2007, including coverage of Chad, Mali, and Niger, nicknamed Creek Wind., USAF via FOIA However, the Pentagon stresses that the mission is focused broadly on advising and assisting security forces in various North and West African countries and improving their ability to respond to the threat posed by terrorist groups aligned with Al Qaeda, ISIS, and Boko Haram . Unlike the French with Operation Barkhane, the Pentagon does not depict it as an active combat mission. There are unconfirmed suggestions, of course, that this has quietly begun to change. On Oct. 24, 2017, citing an anonymous survivor of the incident and a separate, unnamed U.S. intelligence official, ABC News reported that the mission had transformed from a patrol to gather information into an actual attempt to kill or capture a high-value individual with ties to both Al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates in the region. NBC News ran a similar report with its own anonymous sources, naming the target as Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahraoui, presently the leader of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). A still from the video in which Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahraoui pledged an oath of allegiance to ISIS in 2016., via The Long War Journal But the lack of formal shared commands in Niger or elsewhere in the region still seems to underscore an apparent lack of a common objective and very different level of commitment between the French and Americans. It seems that this could only have a negative impact on the overall level of cooperation, with both parties tasking their various resources without any direct coordination. So, though General Dunford has now said the French were part of the contingency plan for American operation near Tongo Tongo, it still remains unclear exactly how much they knew of the operation and how hard it might have been to coordinate their response. We don’t know if the French have any aircraft on standby specifically to respond to U.S. requests, but it would seem unlikely given the demands of their own effectively separate operations. That being said, the French Mirage fighter jets did appear overhead relatively quickly after the request for support came, especially since they would’ve been flying in from Chadian some 900 miles away. But it took two hours for attack helicopters – which ABC described more as armed transports carrying more special operators than France’s Eurocopter Tiger gunships that are situated in Mali – to arrive and potentially even longer for Super Puma transports to come in and recover the two wounded soldiers. “The French saved our men,” the intelligence official told ABC. “Yes, we lost four, but we would have lost everybody if it wasn’t for the French.” A rare, low quality image showing a US Air Force MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker refueling a French H225M Caracal search and rescue helicopter over Chad in 2015., French Ministry of the Armed Forces More or less cooperation? The more informal cooperation on the ground in Niger would also help explain the French government publicly calling for an increased American presence in the region that would be able to shoulder more of the burden of the fighting. The France’s 4,000-storng force in North and West Africa is almost equivalent to the total number of American troops across Africa, according to General Dunford. “In the Sahel, France is deploying in a high-intensity environment, with tremendous support from the United States. We are immensely grateful for that support,” French Defense Minister Florence Parly said during a speech in Washington, D.C. in October 2017 that came after the incident in Tongo Tongo. “But much more needs to be done. We can’t be, and don’t want to be, the praetorian [guards] of sovereign African countries.” Both the U.S. and French militaries would seem to prefer to turn responsibility for the situation over to the actual countries in the region and reduce their overall commitments. In June 2017, the U.N. Security Council approved the mandate for a G5 Sahel joint force, a 5,000 member organization that would run an African-led counter-terrorism effort in the region. During his briefing, Dunford specifically mentioned the U.S. military’s support for this force, as well as separate training for some 35,000 other African troops over the years. Still, President Donald Trump and his administration have continually underscored their intention to fight terrorists more actively wherever they might appear, reducing or removing restrictions put in place by President Barack Obama and his cabinet. Some members of Congress have alluded to increasing the American footprint in Niger and North and West Africa more broadly in response to the recent deaths. “This war is getting hot in places that it’s been cool, and we’ve got to go where the enemy takes us,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republic, told reporters on Oct. 20, 2017. “The war is headed to Africa.” But for the U.S. military, the war has been in Africa for more than a decade already – two decades by General Dunford’s count actually, predating the 9/11 terrorist attacks – and it’s unclear if there is any real interest in increasing America’s commitment in North and West Africa in particular.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 6, 2020",HiMARS Goes To Sea: US Marines Now Fire Guided Artillery Rockets From Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As it had long planned, the U.S. Marine Corps has successfully fired a 227mm GPS-guided rocket from the flight deck of a ship during an annual exercise in the Pacific region, nicknamed Dawn Blitz 2017. Something we at The War Zone have highlighted many times in the past, this combination could offer an important new capability for traditional amphibious operations, more limited contingencies, and even possibly operations further out at sea. Marines of the 5th Marine Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment conducted the mock fire support mission with a truck-mounted M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) while on board the USS Anchorage , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock. The 227mm M31 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GLMRS) round hit a target floating in the Pacific Ocean with its 200 pound high explosive warhead approximately 43 miles away, the maximum range of the weapon. “We had two training objectives for today’s shoot,” U.S. Army Major Adam Ropelewski, the lead planner attached to I Marine Expeditionary Force for what the exercise organizers termed “sea-based expeditionary fires,” explained. “The first training objective was demonstrating this capability and, second, we wanted to have good effects on the target. We achieved both objectives.” Dawn Blitz, as a whole, is an annual amphibious warfare drill that runs Marines, sailors, and other U.S. military forces through scenarios based on potential global emergencies. Prepositioned Marine expeditionary units embarked on Navy amphibious ships remain one of America’s primary means of quickly responding to a crisis of any kind, including natural disasters. For the 2017 iteration of the exercise, Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force have joined forces with the Anchorage , as well as the amphibious assault ship USS Essex , the landing ship dock USS Rushmore , and the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer , as well as small patrol boats from Coastal Riverine Group One. Members of the U.S. Army are also involved or otherwise present to observe, as are foreign allies. Most notably, an infantry company from Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Force its taking part in the drill. “Dawn Blitz 2017 is an excellent opportunity to operationalize concepts the Navy and Marine Corps services have been discussing for some time,” Navy Commander Matthew Hoekstra, the lead exercise planner, said . “While others continue to talk, wargame or tabletop future concepts, we are executing with live forces afloat and ashore.” The sea-based HIMARS launch was one of a number of firsts for the event. This is also the first year that the Marine Corps’ F-35B Joint Strike Fighters have joined the exercise. An F-35B touches down on the USS Wasp during an earlier test event in August 2017., USN But Marines using of artillery rockets and other weapons while still on board a ship is definitely something that the service has been considering for some time. Since taking up the post of Commandant in 2015, U.S. Marine Corps General Robert Neller has been vocal about challenging established notions about the way his troops operate. “You’re not going to see Marines just sitting down on their bunks reading magazines,” Neller said at the Marine Corps League’s annual Modern Day Marine exposition in September 2017. “You’re going to see snipers up on the weather deck. You’re going to see guys up there with Javelins and heavy guns. You’re going to see air defenders up there with air defense systems .” HIMARS, in particular, makes a lot of sense for sea-based operations. The wheeled launcher can either hold six 227mm rockets or a single, larger short-range ballistic missile, known as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) inside a standardized rocket pod that makes the whole system relatively easy to reload. With that latter weapon, crews can hit targets approximately 190 miles away. It’s already been a major factor in the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria , where the weapons offered an alternative to air strikes to launch precision strikes against terrorist emplacements. Unlike fixed wing combat aircraft or gunship helicopters, HIMARS doesn’t get grounded due to sandstorms or low overcast skies. Depending on whether or not there are already aircraft on station, artillery, including the guided rockets, responds to requests for support much faster. These benefits had already made it a weapon of choice in Afghanistan, including for targeted strikes against particular militants. With these weapons on amphibious ships sitting off shore, Marines would be able to have on-call, precision artillery fire during an amphibious landing without having the launchers at increased risk on the beachhead itself or relying mainly on aircraft or attack helicopters for this type of support. Once the initial landing area is secure, the trucks can go ashore and continue to support the force as it moves further inland, complimenting air support carriers and amphibious assault ships. “We know we can shoot HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] off the flight deck of a ship,” Neller added at the Modern Day Marine exposition. “You’re going to see precision fire delivered off amphib ships, whether it comes out of tube guns or rockets or delivered from unmanned systems.” A HIMARS crew from 5/11th Marines reloads their launcher during an exercise in 2014., USMC Even the basic 227mm GPS-directed rockets would give amphibious ships significantly more stand-off capability than they have at present. The design for the San Antonio -class included space for two Mk 41 eight-cell vertical launch system (VLS), but the ships did not reach the fleet with those weapons in place. Whidbey Island -class landing ship docks and Wasp – and America -class amphibious assault ships do not have any such provisions at all. In December 2016, Neller had brought up the possibility of adding the VLS cells onto the San Antonio ’s in order to let them carry Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles. He pointed to a series of attacks off the coast of Yemen that year in which Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had fired anti-ship missiles at American naval vessels, including the San Antonio herself . The amphibious ship lacked the means to retaliate directly . However, the original plan had been to pack the San Antonio ’s VLS full of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), four of which can fit in each cell, in order to expand the air defense capabilities of an amphibious expeditionary strike group. Each cell could only have accommodated a single Tomahawk. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has previously argued that adding the VLS capability in would be a major boon to the ships and also noted that it might even make more sense to just use that space for fixed GMLRS rocket pods to begin with, something that would make sense on other surface ships, too. With HIMARS launchers on the deck, the ship would have had another, potentially more flexible means to respond to multiple threats. A Marine artillery crew would be able to reload much faster than sailors would be able to insert new missiles into the VLS for follow up with additional strikes if more targets presented themselves, as well. The Marine Corps is also looking at a concept that would move the rocket launcher into a containerized package, dubbed “Box O’Rockets,” that would be easy to mount on standard cargo trucks or any appropriate flat surface on a ship or on land. Concept art of Box O’Rockets on a notional modular floating platform., USMC This capability would give amphibious ships more options during more limited contingencies where Marines might not even conduct sustained operations ashore. In 2016, Marines supported local Libyan forces in the city of Sirte as they fought to eject members of an ISIS-aligned terrorist group who had seized control. The Marine expeditionary unit flew strikes using its AV-8B Harrier jump jets and AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters. With no direct threat to the amphibious ships off shore acting as sea bases for the operation, it would have been just as easy for them to move within HIMARS range. Though it would’ve been limited to hitting fixed targets, a launcher on the flight deck would have been able to hit anywhere within the city just with GMLRS rockets from well within international waters. The addition of dual-mode kit with a laser guidance option could solve the moving target problem, with fixed-wing aircraft, drones, gunships, or troops on the ground with the appropriate equipment actually putting the laser beam on the target. Combined with the Navy’s new massive floating sea bases , Marines in the future might easily be able to part themselves off the coast of crisis zone and conduct precision strikes against terrorists and militants from a safe, stand-off position. Add networked sensors, including information fed back to HIMARS crews from manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as other ships, and their ability to quickly and accurately engage hostiles ashore only expands. The Navy already has separate plans for an overarching fire-control network to link together all of its planes and ships, known as the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA). The basic idea is to be able to share targeting information rapidly to allow sailors or pilots to engage targets that might be outside the range of their own sensors or otherwise attack targets without having to rely on their own systems. For HIMARS, this might mean a future where a drone spots a target ashore, translates that information into specific GPS coordinates and sends that directly the launcher crew by way of the amphibious ship. It might even allow for more complex strikes if new, longer range rockets or missiles that employ other attack modes become available for the weapon system. Specifically, both the Marine Corps and the Army are actively looking at the possibility of using the eminently modular HIMARS to fire anti-ship missiles. A launcher able to fire something such as Lockheed Martin’s Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM ) or the Raytheon-Kongsberg Joint Strike Missile would quickly turn artillery crews into ship killers and amphibious ships in multi-purpose strike platforms. On top of that, Raytheon is working on a new long-range missile to replace the ATACMS known as DeepStrike . The company says the final product should be able to hit targets approximately 310 miles away, significantly increasing the distance at which HIMARS crews would be able to engage the enemy. Each launcher would be able to hold two DeepStrike missiles instead of just a single ATACMS, too. An extended range version of the standard 227mm rocket, that can travel nearly 60 miles is also in development. Raytheon Moreover, in theory, the Marines should have been able to conduct the HIMARS mission from the flight decks on any sufficiently large surface ship, as well as on land, which might allow for additional flexibility. The Navy recently said it was considering reactivating a number of mothballed Oliver Hazard Perry -class frigates, but with virtually no upgrades to their weapons or sensors. The service has similarly struggled to improve the capabilities of the long under-performing two-class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) family and began developing the requirements for a new guided missile frigate earlier in 2017. Placing one of the launchers on the helipads on any of these ships could immediately make them more versatile in a host of low-risk scenarios. It seems likely that in the future, Marine and Army artillery crews will even more heavily integrate HIMARS with Navy amphibious ships and Army watercraft , even if just to rapidly reposition them. Especially in the Pacific region, quickly placing the launchers on one small island might allow troops to easily threaten another during a crisis or outright conflict. Vietnam appears to have already done this in the heavily contest South China Sea, deploying its truck-mounted Israeli-made EXTRA artillery rocket systems, similar to the HIMARS system, to islands it controls that are within range of China’s growing constellation of man-made outposts. Other countries have already seized on the concept of quickly adding long range capabilities to various ships using containerized artillery rockets and missiles in general. Russia has announced plans to install containerized anti-ship missiles on board a new class of ice-breaking corvettes that will patrol the countries arctic territories. In June 2017, Israel test fired its Long-Range Artillery (LORA) system from a ship and South Korea launched a new version of its Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile from a truck-mounted launcher on board a floating platform. In the South Korean case, the use of a sea-based test structure was due to the nature of the firing range, but still highlighted a potential maritime application for the system. The ability to rapidly preposition these weapons using various ships would offer additional flexibility during a so-called “ decapitation strike ” against North Korea or during a broader conflict on the Korean peninsula . Containerized and otherwise highly mobile fire support systems have become increasingly popular beyond rockets and missiles, too. Finnish firm Patria offers a version of its lightweight, turreted NEMO 120mm breech-loaded mortar that fits inside its own special pod . This turns a regular flatbed cargo truck or any ship able to carry a standard shipping container into a fire support weapon. With all of these developments in mind, it seems almost certain the Marines and other U.S. military services are only starting to discover the capabilities that a shipboard HIMARS launcher could provide for future operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",All The New Details We Learned About The Ambush In Niger From America’s Top General,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than three weeks after a deadly firefight in Niger claimed the lives of four American troops and five members of the Nigerien security forces, significant questions remain about the nature of the mission and what exactly happened on the ground outside a village called Tongo Tongo. Now, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford has briefed the press and given the American people the most detailed picture to date of what the U.S. military knows about the incident. Dunford gave his briefing on Oct. 23, 2017, specifically noting that it was also the anniversary of a deadly bombing of a U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983. He said that while that incident was entirely unrelated, his thoughts were with the families of those Marines, as well, before launching into his briefing . Here is a rundown of the important details he provided about the mission in Niger and its aftermath: After talking with Secretary of Defense Mattis, Dunford decided to make his remarks in the first place in response to what he called “a lot of speculation about the operation .” Dunford said he specifically wanted to challenge the perception that the Department of Defense hasn’t been forthcoming about the incident. “Our soldiers are operating in Niger to build the capacity of local forces to defeat violent extremism in West Africa. Their presence is part of a global strategy.” Dunford specifically highlighted the threat of ISIS and Al Qaeda. Terrorists use global networks of fighters and other resources to threaten weak institutions around the world and “our strategy is to cut that [connective] tissue.” The U.S. military has had forces in Niger on and off for 20 years and has approximately 800 personnel there at present, the largest presence in any single country in North and West Africa. The U.S. mission is linked to a multi-national, regional effort, anchored by the 4,000 French troops in Niger and elsewhere in North and West Africa. Since 2011, U.S. and French troops have worked together specifically to train a 5,000 member “West African force” and 35,000 other troops from countries in the region. In the region, the main threats are terrorists affiliated with ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Boko Haram . During the incident in Niger specifically, which began on Oct. 3, 2017, 12 members of the U.S. special operations task force in the region joined 30 Nigerien personnel on a “civil-military reconnaissance mission.” This mission originated in the Nigerien capital, Niamey and the U.S. military’s assessment was that “contact with the enemy was unlikely.” The established operational rules for the unit in question were generally not to conduct an operation, either with Nigerien forces or independently, if there is any likelihood that there could be a confrontation with the enemy. U.S. personnel could accompany partners on riskier missions, but would have to hold back if there was a likelihood of a direct engagement. On Oct. 4, 2017, the patrol came under attack as they moved south from an area near the village of Tongo Tongo toward their “operating base.” The enemy force was approximately 50 members strong in light vehicles armed with small arms and rocket propelled grenades. The attackers were “an ISIS-affiliated group.” “Approximately one hour after taking fire, the team requested support and within minutes a [U.S.] remotely piloted aircraft arrived overhead,” after commanders retasked the aircraft from another mission in the area. Dunford said the drone did not attack targets on the ground, but would not say whether or not it had the capability to do so. The drone was capable of capturing full-motion video. “Within an hour, French Mirage jets arrived on station.” Dunford made the point that the Mirages and other allied combat aircraft are indeed allowed to conduct strikes for force protection situations if US soldiers need help, but what is not clear is if troops on the ground had even tried to request they attempt to do so or what may have kept them from employing their weapons. The French combat aircraft were in the air in 30 minutes and overhead 30 minutes after that, meaning that approximately two hour elapsed between the beginning of the fire fight and the arrive of the jets. “Later that afternoon, French attack helicopters arrived on station and a Nigerien quick reaction force arrived in the area where our troops were in contract with the enemy.” There is no limit on the ability of units operating in Niger to request for self-defense purposes. Dunford says it would be his judgment that the unit waited to request air support because it initially felt it could handle the situation. “We shouldn’t conclude anything by that one hour” delay in requesting support at this time. “I made it very clear that I make no judgment as to how long it took them to ask for support.” French helicopters helped two wounded U.S. soldiers evacuate to Niamey during the firefight, which lasted for multiple hours. This was the established casualty evacuation plan for this operation in the event that anything happened. Contractors subsequently recovered three American troops who had died on the evening of Oct. 4, 2017. At that time, the force considered U.S. Army Sergeant La David Johnson still missing in action. Friendly forces found and recovered Johnson’s body on Oct. 6, 2017. U.S., French, and Nigerien forces in some combination were in the area at all times until they found Johnson. The U.S. military committed unspecified “national assets” to the search and rescue effort. “We brought the full weight of the U.S. government to bear in trying – to try and recover his [Johnson’s] body.” The ongoing investigations into the incident are attempting to determine whether or not the mission of U.S. forces changed during the course of the operation, did they have adequate intelligence and other resources, was the initial assessment of the overall threat situation accurate, how did Johnson end up separated from the main group during the firefight, and why did it take two days to find him? Dunford stressed that U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, may want more resources in general, especially to expand his operational capabilities, but this doesn’t necessarily mean the particular mission in Niger was understaffed or under resourced . “The responsibility of commanders is to employ the force within the resources that they have available.” After an operational pause, the United States has resumed combined patrols in Niger. Responding to criticism from members of Congress, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham , that they were unaware of U.S. military activities Niger until seeing the news, Dunford said “if the Congress doesn’t believe – that they’re not getting sufficient information, then I need to double my efforts to provide them with information.” “We owe you more information and, more importantly, we owe the families of the fallen more information.” Dunford could not say why Myeshia Johnson might not have been able to view her husband’s remains. It is typical policy to suggest in certain circumstances that families may not wish to view the remains, but ultimately leave that decision to them. “If any of the families of the fallen are unsatisfied with the support that they’ve had to date or have addition questions, we’re going to go to every last length to try and satisfy their concerns or answer their questions.” Dunford said he hoped to be able to provide more information over the “next several weeks” as the investigations clarify key points about the incident. “We lost four Americans in this incident. We had two others wounded. That makes it a big deal to me. That gives me a sense of urgency to identify exactly what happened, to communicate exactly what happened to the families and to the American people.” You can watch the whole hour long briefing below: Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces Armies French Air Force Land Sea Special Operations U.S. Army U.S. Marine Corps"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020","No, the USAF Hasn’t Put its Nuclear Bombers Back on 24/7 Alert, Yet","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s top officer General David Goldfein says the service is preparing to possibly put some of its nuclear capable bombers back on 24-hour alert for the first time in more than 25 years. With a major Pentagon-wide review of how the U.S. military positions its nuclear forces in process, it’s unclear how likely it is that this plan will ever come to fruition, especially given that it would require significant funding and other resources , could increase the risk of accidents , force reductions in other parts of America’s nuclear triad and the B-52’s community’s conventional weapons training regimen, and provoke unwelcome responses from potential opponents, including Russia and North Korea . Goldfein talked about the potential for bombers going back on a standby posture during an interview with Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber during the course of a six-day visit to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana earlier in October 2017. The base itself is home to the Air Force’s 2nd Bomb Wing and its B-52H Stratofortress bombers and has existing alert facilities, but no longer has any nuclear weapons on site. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States ended decades of having the aircraft, as well as B-1 Bones and B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, ready to go at a moment’s notice for a nuclear strike . The B-1s are now no longer nuclear capable at all. “This is yet one more step in ensuring that we’re prepared,” Goldfein told Defense One. “I look at it more as not planning for any specific event, but more for the reality of the global situation we find ourselves in and how we ensure we’re prepared going forward.” When the outlet asked for clarification, other officials reportedly explained that there was no actual alert order, but that the Air Force was making preparations in case it came down from U.S. Strategic Command, which has responsibility for nuclear operations, or U.S. Northern Command, in charge of safeguarding the continental United States. B-52Hs at Barksdale take part in a minimum interval take-off training exercise in 2013., USAF It seems likely, given Goldfein’s comments, that placing bombers back on 24-hour alert is under discussion as part of the Pentagon’s latest Nuclear Posture Review, which began in April 2017. Of course, that the concept is under consideration would not necessarily be an indication of the likelihood of the U.S. military putting the plan into action. In the past six months, Secretary of Defense James Mattis himself has publicly gone back and forth about supporting the possibility of eliminating one of the three legs of the nuclear triad, which includes the nuclear-capable bombers, ballistic missile submarines, and land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). “Really it depends on who, what kind of behavior are we talking about, and whether they’re paying attention to our readiness status,” Goldfein said when asked about whether or not the alert posture would help deter potential enemies. “I’ve challenged…Air Force Global Strike Command to help lead the dialog, help with this discussion about ‘What does conventional conflict look like with a nuclear element?’ and ‘Do we respond as a global force if that were to occur?’ and ‘What are the options?’” There could be benefits to having the bombers sitting at the end of the runway ready to go 24 hours a day. As we at The War Zone have noted before , this particularly leg of the triad remains one of, if not the most scalable and flexible in nature. Though not on 24/7 alert, B-52 crews routinely train to perform so-called “minimum interval take-off” operations to get multiple bombers into the air as quickly as possible in a crisis. Unlike ballistic missiles, bombers have the ability to take up a visible position near a target area extended period, offering a very pointed deterrent without necessarily having to even fire a weapon. Since it takes time to get the aircraft into position to strike, commanders have additional time to divert them to other areas or abort their mission in response to rapidly changing situations. Bombers also present a far smaller infrared signature, which makes them harder for space-based early warning systems to spot and track compared to ballistic missiles. Having the bombers sitting on their concrete alert pads at the end of the runway would be a very visible reminder of these capabilities to any opponent, which the United States could decide is an important signal in the face of an increasingly assertive Russia or an increasingly belligerent North Korea, the latter of which routinely threatens to use its small, but significant nuclear arsenal. The alert posture would simply speed up the existing ability of the bomber force to respond to any contingency, as well. This rapid response capability could be important if the United States has to consider a more limited nuclear strike in the future. There have been reports that Russia may have adopted its own more flexible approach to the use of tactical nuclear weapons, using them to “ escalate to de-escalate ” a conflict and limit the ability of major powers to respond. The U.S. military’s ability to have a more immediate and scalable nuclear response could be valuable in the aftermath of such an incident. Similarly, it could reduce the time necessary to a North Korean provocation or to follow through with an order for a preemptive strike. Smoke fills the flightline at Barksdale at B-52s start their engines during a minimum interval take-off training exercise in 2013., USAF It could also help remind bomber crews of the importance of the nuclear mission and the need to properly train for it, which seemed to be slipping in recent years as the threat of a global nuclear war appeared to recede. In 2007, the Air Force infamously punished 70 personnel after an incident in which crews accidentally loaded six AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles , each with a live W80 nuclear warhead, onto a B-52H that then flew from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale. The weapons remained on the bomber for approximately 36 hours before anyone noticed they were missing from the secure storage bunker at Minot. Having the bombers on alert, or even just suggesting the possibility, could just be way for Goldfein to make the mission more visible ahead of potential budget battles over funding for various bomber-related projects, including new engines for the B-52H and other upgrades , the procurement of the B-21 Raider with its top-secret cost estimates , and the LRSO . The Air Force may have decided to consider this change in deference to a direct request from President Donald Trump, who, through the White House, has already been directly involved in a number of high profile defense programs, most notably design changes to Air Force One . “We won’t need an increase [in nuclear weapons], but I want modernization and I want total rehabilitation,” Trump said during shared remarks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Oct. 11, 2017. “It’s got to be in tip-top shape. But putting the bombers back on alert would also increase the potential for serious accidents simply by the law of averages. Since 1950, there have been 32 incidents involving nuclear weapons , which the United States calls “Broken Arrow” events, a not insignificant amount of which involved plane crashes or other aerial mistakes . In January 2014, an electrical fire during routine maintenance totaled a B-52H, forcing the Air Force to spend nearly 20 months getting another aircraft out of storage and back into flying condition . Putting the bombers back on alert would undoubtedly require millions of dollars of upgrades to infrastructure and a significant reorganization of manpower resources, too. In particular, possible alert bases such as Barksdale no longer have stockpiles of nuclear weapons anymore and would need new bunkers, hardened against physical, electronic , and cyber attacks , to keep the warheads safe. In addition, the Air Force would need to make sure the alert pads and other existing facilities are properly rehabilitated for daily use and secure against a range of threats that simply did not exist when the service built them in the first place, including increasing concerns about the potential for hostile actors to carry out illicit surveillance or even sabotage using small, commercially available quad- and hex-copter type drones. The service has already begun to repair the alert pads at Barksdale, in part in order to support the alert posture of command and control aircraft that support the nuclear mission such as the E-4B Nightwatch and the E-6B Mercury . Beyond the physical improvements necessary, a large number of security personnel, trained to respond to possible nuclear incident and accidents, would have to stand watch 24 hours a day, as well. During a talk at the Air Force Association’s (AFA) annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference in September 2017, retired U.S. Air Force General Roger Burg, who was previously in charge of 20th Air Force, the unit that still manages the service’s ICBM force, made clear his belief that these issues could be a major challenge if anyone ever decided to return bombers to a 24-hour alert posture. “For those of you who watched us deploy B-52s behind three-strand barbed wire fence with 14 airmen with M16s guarding them, with nuclear weapons attached to their wings or inside their bomb bays, in today’s threat environment, would we really do that and have that be our day-to-day deployment for the bomber?” he said. “Very difficult problem to solve.” A security forces airmen guards a B-2 bomber at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam in 2017., USAF On top of that, every bomber on alert would be one less aircraft available for a conventional mission. The Air Force’s B-52H fleet makes up the bulk of the service’s nuclear-capable bombers and will continue do even after the first B-21 Raiders arrive, which may not even have an nuclear capability initially. There are already plans to keep the aging aircraft combat ready for decades to come. The BUFFs have flexed their conventional capabilities in fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria and more recently returned to the skies over Afghanistan to battle a resurgent Taliban and other militant organizations. A 24-hour alert would have to find a way to balance these demands against the more active nuclear mission. “I want those bombers to be available for a lot of other things besides pulling nuclear alert duty,” Burg added at the AFA gathering. “They have proven their worth in war over the last 20 years, the value they bring to our joint force, as a precision weapons delivery platform. I don’t want us to not have that capability for the joint force.” The added requirements of keeping bombers on an 24-hour alert could also just take time away from routine conventional and nuclear training requirements. Secretary of the AIr Force Heather Wilson depicted the existing requirements on many B-52 crews as onerous in her own remarks at the AFA conference in September 2017. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gIGbebmirhM Strategic arms control agreements the United States has with Russia would only make this more complicated. At present, the U.S. military can only field a certain number of nuclear-capable bombers. As such, it would difficult, if not impossible to quickly add more long range strike aircraft to make up for a shortfall of B-52s available for conventional missions. At the same time, those arrangement limit the two parties to a fixed number of nuclear warheads they can have actually attached to delivery platforms at any one time. Loading nuclear cruise missiles onto the aircraft would force American authorities to reduce the total number of warheads elsewhere, such as sending out submarines with less than a full load of ballistic missiles or emptying out some ICBM silos . At present, the Air Force is very actively promoting its plans for an all-new ICBM, a project known as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD), and it seems unlikely they would want to put themselves deliberately in a position that would threaten the program’s size, scope, and budget. “I’ve spoken to a lot of bomber crews who love the fact that the IBCMs are on alert and they no longer are,” Burg noted at the Air, Space, and Cyber Conference as part of a vigorous defense of the ICBM mission. “They don’t have to be, but if the ICBMs were not on alert, we would probably have to put some bombers on alert.” The question of available funding and resources is particular important when one considers that the Air Force already regularly highlights the burdens of decades of constant conflict and has resorted to desperate measures to solve a dangerous shortage of pilots. What Goldfein has already tacitly admitted is that, at least right now, putting bombers on alert would be adding a new set of costly requirements to the mix without any clear understanding of the benefits to America’s overall nuclear deterrent posture. A B-52 sits on the ramp at Minot Air Force Base during a test of special cold-weather fuel., USAF There is the distinct possibility that it could have an adverse effect. Another deal between the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia prevents the parties from flying long-range bomber patrols with live nuclear weapons. In August 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin did say his country would restart patrols with nuclear-capable bombers, but it was unclear whether they would carry actual warheads. “We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic bombers on a permanent basis,” Putin said at the time . “Russia stopped this practice in 1992. Unfortunately not everybody followed suit. This creates a strategic risk for Russia … we hope our partners show understanding towards the resumption of Russian air patrols.” He appeared to be referring to the existing American practice of routinely deploying B-52 and B-2 bombers overseas, both for training purposes and as shows of force, including in Europe. The United States understands itself to be abiding by the terms of the deal since no aircraft actually carries warheads during these missions. If the Air Force did put its bombers on alert, it would almost undoubtedly draw criticism from Russia, as well as China, both of whom could easily follow suit. This would only increase the probability of accidents or other incidents worldwide. Just in September 2017, a Russian Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber skidded off the runway during an exercise. “The world is a dangerous place and we’ve got folks that are talking openly about use of nuclear weapons,” General Goldfein told Defense One. “It’s no longer a bipolar world where it’s just us and the Soviet Union. We’ve got other players out there who have nuclear capability. It’s never been more important to make sure that we get this mission right.” He’s definitely not wrong and makes sense to have both senior leaders and crews take a hard look at how they train for the nuclear mission. But, given the issues involved, the Air Force has a number of reasons to ultimately decide putting an actual alert posture back into place is simply not worth the time and money.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 10, 2019",This USAF Intelligence Squadron’s Insignia Appears to Show the “F-19 Specter”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Military unit insignia can be weird, obtuse, and sometimes even a little problematic , but they can also offer important and interesting insight into the history and roles of particular units. There’s the mosque in U.S. Army North’s logo, the mysterious “ Desert Prowler ” patch with art lifted from an Insane Clown Posse album cover, and apparently one odd official reference almost certainly depicting the fictitious “F-19A Specter” stealth fighter. The Alabama Air National Guard’s 117th Intelligence Squadron’s official insignia is pretty spiffy overall, including a satellite with beams pointing at Latin America and North America, as well as the shape of an airplane that looks very similar to the popular depiction of the F-19A emanating a series of waves beneath it. According to both the Air National Guard’s History Office and the U.S. Army’s The Institute of Heraldry , which manages official devices across the services and is a thing that you should know actually exists, the art dates to 1989 as the logo for what was then the 117th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron. Here is the official description of the significance of the various devices: “Blue and yellow are the Air Force colors. Blue alludes to the sky, the primary theater of Air Force operations. Yellow references to the sun and the excellence required of Air Force personnel. The globe reflects the worldwide observation technology of the Squadron. The aircraft signifies the reconnaissance and intelligence gathering missions performed by the unit’s airborne sensor capabilities. The satellite indicates reconnaissance and intelligence data obtained through remote sensing.” The official description of the 117th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron’s insignia., ANG According to a historian at the Air National Guard History Office, the airplane itself is a “generic” design not intended to reflect any particular design. According to an overarching Air Force regulation it has to be this way to help make sure the insignia is as timeless as possible and doesn’t have to change as a unit receives new aircraft. “Usually you see triangles and delta shapes and the like,” they explained to The War Zone in an Email. “The reason for this is because of the unchanging nature of heraldry. An emblem is supposed to last for generations, therefore we do not depict anything mission specific, because then the emblem would be mismatched or obsolete.” A low quality scan of the original artwork., ANG The features in the design, though, seem too similar to the popular image of the F-19A for it to be a coincidence. Of course, that’s not to say that this is some final proof of the Specter’s existence. Most likely, it’s exactly the opposite. For those who might not know the story, in the 1980s, the Air Force skipped the number “19” in the fighter category of the U.S. military’s official designation system. There had been the F-16, which beat out the YF-17, and then the F-18, which eventually became the F/A-18. The most detailed rendering of Loral’s proposed F-19 Specter stealth fighter. Apparently the illustration was born from the artists mind, not from input from company engineers., Northrop/Loral But in 1982, the Air Force, which manages the designation system across the series, gave Northrop Grumman’s Tigershark fighter jet the nomenclature F-20. There was immediate speculation as to what the F-19 might be, with the most common believe being that it was a long-rumored stealth fighter . Six years later, that plane emerged as Lockheed’s F-117 Nighthawk , perpetuating the belief that there was another design that remained highly classified. This has been pretty conclusively debunked. Andreas Parsch, an independent aviation researcher, notes on his website designation-systems.net , citing official documentation, that the Air Force pretty clearly skipped F-19 in deference to a request from Northrop. The company hoped for major international sales of its Tigershark and argued for F-20 instead, suggesting that there might be confusion with the Soviet practice of odd number fighter nomenclature and the MiG-19 specifically. Northrop’s F-20 Tigershark., USAF Though this argument might seem dubious, the U.S. military’s official aircraft and missile nomenclature system is full of exceptions and non-standard variations, as well as out of sequence numbers and lettered suffixes, many of which occurred purely to serve various marketing and political concerns. One good example was the desire to create an additional link between the C-130J Hercules and C-27J Spartan , which shared a number of common systems, including their engines. To make this happen, the Air Force agreed to skip eight suffix letters and go straight from C-27A to J. The rumor persists to this day, but there has never been any confirmed evidence that the F-19 actually exists. A pair of Loral/Northrop ads supposedly for the Specter routinely circulates on the internet, the obvious suggestion being that they requested the F-20 designation to hide the stealth jet, but nothing to prove that they’re genuine. In addition, Northrop’s failed competitor to the F-117, the XST , has become public knowledge and it looks more similar in shape to Lockheed’s stealth fighter than the purported F-19. There is, of course, always a possibility that another stealthy tactical platform design did exist from the era in small numbers, got shelved somewhere along the way, and/or still remains in the classified world. An operational penetrating tactical renaissance aircraft that could persist over the battlefield undetected remains a missing link in the shadowy history of stealth aircraft development from the period, an aircraft that would bridge the gap between Tacit Blue/BSAX demonstrator and unmanned aircraft with a similar mission set that began to emerge in the latter 1990s. But there is no reason why it would look like the F-19 or even have an F designation. One of the supposed F-19 ads. , Via keiththomsonbooks.com There’s also the possibility that some combination of the Air Force, U.S. intelligence services, Northrop, decided to request and approve F-20 nomenclature as a means of deliberate disinformation to either confuse or distract opponents from looking too hard at actual stealth designs, such as the F-117 or B-2 bomber , which were very different from the supposed Specter planforms. If the general public was as interested in the missing “F-19,” Soviet military intelligence was undoubtedly curious, too. This model from an Air Force convention in Las Vegas in 1986 shows one of Northrop/Loral’s early ATF designs. Variations of the design would carry on in advertisements for a supposed F-19 stealth fighter. The YF-23, which has much more relevant stealth features, ended up being Northrop’s final ATF configuration. Many manufacturers proposed similar ATF designs during the very early stages of the program., via hitechweb.genezis.eu In the case of the the 117th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron’s logo, the design seems much more likely to have been an in-joke, especially since the unit doesn’t actually have any aircraft and didn’t at the time the insignia came into being. It might’ve seemed especially appropriate at the time given that the unit’s mission at the time was processing film from SR-71 Blackbird , U-2 Dragon Lady , and RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance aircraft, interpreting that imagery, and then sending out the images and analysis to the appropriate places. It is also very possible, if not probable, that some sort of classified intelligence gathering aircraft also provided products to the unit, as such, the highly publicized and not at all sensitive F-19 would have been an ideal choice to denote such a secretive aircraft’s affiliation. In 1989, though, a year after the Air Force officially revealed the F-117, the continued rumor of the F-19 would have been well known to many aviation enthusiasts and even in more general popular culture. In 1988, MicroProse had released an F-19 computer game and Hasbro released the G.I. Joe X-19 Phantom , a clear reference to the jet. There were numerous scale plastic models of the “ mystery plane ,” too. These represented what have become two most popular notional designs, the rounded, broader wing version linked directly to the reported Northrop/Loral ads and another narrower one that model maker Testors said took inspiration from the basic shape of the SR-71. The Testors model, other companies, such as Revell and Italeri, have sold since under their own brands, became one of the best selling kits of all time, with at least approximately 700,000 sales . Today, the 117th Intelligence Squadron continues to perform similar functions as before, but now analysts review imagery from satellites and full motion video from drones, among other sources. They’ve supported 10 major operations since Desert Storm in 1991 and have helped process data for domestic emergencies such as the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. They’re still using the same awesome insignia. If you happen to know anything more about its history, feel free to shoot us an Email or let us know in the comments below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 11, 2018",The U.S. Military’s Incident In Niger Has Been a Long Time Coming,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The revelation that a private contractor took part in the efforts to rescue American service members who came under attack in Niger, which The War Zone first reported , has prompted renewed scrutiny of the U.S. military’s preparedness in the region and even viral conspiracy theories about the incident.  In reality, already underscored by the infamous Benghazi incident, it highlights a long-standing set of issues and it’s a wonder such things haven’t occurred more often. For more on why the U.S. military has a presence in Niger in the first place, we have a detailed explainer here . You can also find in depth information about American deployments across Africa in general here . At the core of the present debate is why American soldiers in Niger had to rely primarily on air support from French forces in the area, as well as contract aircrews stationed in the country’s capital Niamey, after they came under attack from militants near the border with Mali on Oct. 4, 2017. How this all contributed to U.S. Army Sergeant La David Johnson ending up missing for two days afterwards before local forces found him dead remains unclear. That the combined force of U.S. and Nigerien troops reportedly rode in unarmored vehicles and had only personal weapons when they encountered more than 50 enemy fighters in trucks with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades has only served to add apparent insult to injury, though. The U.S. military isn’t the Peace Corps “There’s a reason that we have U.S. Army soldiers that are not the Peace Corps. Because we carry guns,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis said, defending the response during a shared Press Conference with Israeli Minister of Defense Avigdor Lieberman on Oct. 19, 2017. “It’s part of the danger that our troops face in these counterterrorist campaigns, but remember we do these kinds of missions by, with and through allies. It is often dangerous; we recognize that. … This is an example of how seriously we take this mission that we put our troops in that position.” Mattis is among other members of President Donald Trump’s administration who have begun to challenge the emerging narrative in the media that the U.S. military had bungled the mission and that it was unprepared to respond properly during such a crisis. U.S. officials have stated on and off that record that there are a number of reviews and investigations in process, one of which now includes members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . American and French personnel conduct a casualty evacuation exercise in Djibouti., USAF “There’s an investigation ongoing,” White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters during rare and impassioned remarks, in which he invoked the loss of his own son in combat and lambasted the press for their handling of the incident, despite offering no new substantive details about what happened and why when a reporter asked him directly. “An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll.” And to be sure, there has been something of a “ CSI effect ” when it comes to the general public’s expectations of U.S. military capabilities. This term specifically refers to an apparent impact on the American justice system from the popularization of forensics in television and movies, leading to a common, but false assumption that this type of evidence, DNA samples in particular, should be readily available in all criminal cases. The representation of the U.S. military and special operations in particular in popular media has definitely created the need for a corollary of sorts. Some of the first questions reporters wanted to ask after the attack in Niger were “where were the drones?” and “why couldn’t they call in an air strike?”, neither of which are capabilities automatically available to all American military units overseas, even those working hand-in-hand with foreign troops on counter-terrorism missions. Reports that U.S. special operations forces are “carrying out nearly 100 missions at any given time” across Africa ignore the varied nature of these activities. They can definitely include secretive kill and capture missions, but are more likely to involve much more banal things such as basic drills on the firing range, leadership conferences, various courses in a classroom setting, pop-up clinics, and just driving around with friendly forces and observing them as they go about their daily business. Though the details remain murky and conflicting about what happened near the Nigerien village of Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4, 2017, the most consistent parts of the story suggest that the U.S. troops and their partners from Niger’s specialized Bataillon Sécurité et Renseignement (BSR), or Security and Intelligence Battalion, stopped to resupply and engage with locals. Establishing links with the village elders, who are likely the real power brokers in the area, would serve civil affairs and human intelligence goals, explaining the nature of America’s presence in the country, while also taking the opportunity to ask important questions about local security. What happened next is unclear, with reports suggesting that the Americans and the BSR contingent, the size and composition of which remains almost entirely unknown, may have been ambushed after their meeting in Tongo Tongo or even lured into a trap just outside the village. Inexplicably, no group has officially claimed responsibility for what would be, if nothing else, a major propaganda victory. Nigerien security forces at the country’s anti-terrorism center in Niamey in 2016., Britta Pedersen/picture-alliance/DPA via AP Dangers everywhere But while it’s unfair to expect every U.S. military mission to look like the massive operations in Iraq or Afghanistan, and most Americans probably wouldn’t want them to, it is still more than reasonable to ask whether or not troops across Africa have adequate resources in place. As has become clear in Niger, these forces are operating in areas full of hazards, from terrorists to infectious diseases to just poor roads, where routine missions can quickly become anything but. It’s perhaps worth noting that more American special operations forces have died due to road accidents in Africa in the last five years than during the ambush in Niger. In April 2012, three special operators died in Mali, along with a trio of Moroccan prostitutes, in a particularly bizarre incident . There was reportedly another similar accident sometime in the 2000s in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, where an American special operator in that country drunkenly ran a rental vehicle into the wall of the Belgian Embassy, but was not seriously injured, which I have not been able to confirm. In June 2013, a U.S. Army soldier who had served with the virtually unheard of U.S. Special Operations Logistical Support Element – part of the Joint Special Operations Command – and then transferred directly to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command headquarters, died in another car crash in Kenya. Eight months before the attack in Tongo Tongo, another member of the U.S. Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) was killed during what the U.S. military described as “ routine administrative movement .” That’s not to mention the number of times American personnel, including special operators, have been swept up in terrorist attacks and political crises elsewhere in Africa. Notably, in January 2016, American and French special operators rushed to respond to terrorist attacks in Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou. Members of the US Air Force’s 6th Special Operations Squadron repair their vehicle after an accident in Niger in 2011., USAF As such, concerns about access to sufficient medical care and other support are not new or unknown to the U.S. military and predate the incident in Benghazi in 2012. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), which first came into being in 2007, and U.S. European Command, which managed the bulk of American military activities on the continent before that, have both emphasized a “ light footprint ” approach with no official “ bases ” and most troops officially only on temporary deployments. AFRICOM’s headquarters is in Germany and all of its service components are similarly situated in Europe. The reason for this, in no small part, is to accommodate partner governments that worry a major influx of American troops might prompt fears of a neo-colonial invasion. In many cases, many already accuse these regimes of human rights abuses and stifling political dissent, so they’re undoubtedly interested in avoiding provoking any additional domestic opposition. The War Zone Make sure to check our updated interactive google map showing the U.S. military’s posture in Africa that posture in Africa “African governments want a small U.S. footprint. They watch what we’ve done in other places, and it scares the hell out of them,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Donald Bolduc, who led Special Operations Command Africa until retiring in June 2017, told The New Yorker earlier in the year.  “Quite frankly, it scares the hell out of me, too.” Beyond the sprawling American facilities at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, the U.S. military rarely names or even acknowledges a network of tiny forward outposts across Africa. Refusing to call Camp Lemonnier a “base” is a technicality that serves a political purpose, but also reflects a general attitude toward operations on the continent.  Before 2007, that particular site was the responsibility of U.S. Central Command and it remains a hub for operations primarily in Somalia and across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen . Members of the East Africa Response Force training Djibouti in 2013., USAF An operational backwater Operations elsewhere, including in Niger, have not received nearly the same attention or resources. Since its creation, in general, AFRICOM has had to rely heavily on forces assigned to other commands. During the United Nations-approved, NATO-backed intervention in Libya in 2011, U.S. Air Forces Africa (AFAFRICA) actually had to move next door into to the U.S. Air Force’s in Europe’s (USAFE) command center since it was simply not otherwise able to run a major air campaign. The Air Force subsequently decided to scrap the idea of a separate component for Africa and the head of USAFE is now also in charge of AFAFRICA to help streamline the sharing of resources in a crisis. On the continent itself, contractors quickly became another important way to make up the lack of resources, especially with regards to aerial support, including cargo hauling and medical missions, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance flights. In line with AFRICOM’s “light footprint” policy, many contracts have specifically said contractors must paint their aircraft white so as not to give off an obvious military connection and that U.S. military officials would only approve alternate colors on a case-by-case basis. Though now in the public eye, Berry Aviation , and its subcontractor Air Center Helicopters, Inc. , have been on call for airlift and casualty evacuation services in Niamey since at least 2014. Before then, Berry had run this operation out of Ouagadougou, where it still reportedly maintains a presence. When that shift occurred, I was among those to surmise, very accurately as it turned out, that it indicated the mission in Niger was becoming much more important . The use of contractors hasn’t always been ideal. In July 2014, a small twin engine CASA 212 cargo plane carrying American special operators made an emergency landing in Uganda, shining a light then on the secretive American mission to help African forces hunt down members the Lord’s Resistance Army and the group’s enigmatic leader Joseph Kony. Thankfully, no one was injured. At the time, EP Aviation, a wholly owned subsidiary of AAR Corporation, operated the plane on behalf of the U.S. military. Infamous private military contractor Erik Prince had formed the company, which he named after himself, before selling it off to AAR. EP Aviation still has this contract for airlift and casualty evacuation support across Central Africa. Things haven’t always been better when the U.S. military has tried to put together ad hoc missions for higher risk scenarios. In December 2013, three Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors, assigned to U.S. Central Command, but based in Djibouti, flew to the city of Bor in South Sudan to help American citizens evacuate the country as it descended into civil war following an attempted coup. As the aircraft came in to land in what they believed was a safe landing zone, a barrage of gunfire and rocket propelled grenades slammed into all three Ospreys , leaving three U.S. Navy SEALs on board one of the tilt-rotors clinging to life. Leaking fuel and full of bleeding special operators, the aircraft raced to Entebbe airport in Uganda, the nearest secure and well established U.S. “forward operating location.” There American medics stabilized the wounded before aircraft arrived to fly them to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. A US Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22 tilt-rotor during a training exercise., USAF Limited resources This was notably after the Benghazi incident had prompted significant reviews of the U.S. military’s ability to respond to crises in Africa, which had led to the establishment of a variety of dedicated rapid reaction elements on the continent and in Europe. Since then, there isn’t much indication that the force posture in Northwestern and Central Africa has changed dramatically. While there is an East Africa Response Force, made up of Army troops and Air Force aircraft, now in Djibouti, there is no counterpart on the other side of the continent. There are similarly no forward deployed U.S. military manned combat aircraft anywhere in Africa besides in Djibouti. America’s drone operations in northwestern Africa, though they receive a significant amount of press attention, are themselves actually relatively small deployments. A typical unmanned combat air patrol consists of four aircraft, with the idea being that this allows for a single aircraft to be over a target area at all times. One aircraft is on station while the previous drone is heading back to base to refuel and possible rearm. At the same time, Another is already heading out to take over the mission. A fourth is in reserve in case an accident, break down, or some other issue sidelines one of the other three. On any given day the U.S. Air Force has approximately 65 of these patrols at work around the world. The Central Intelligence Agency has a number of its own drone packages , as well. However, many of the missions in Africa have made due with single MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper drones. As of 2013, the 3rd Special Operations Squadron, based at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico, was remotely operating three individual drones in support of three different regional special operations commands, according to an official history the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. It’s no simple task to redirect these limited assets from their assigned missions on any given day to respond to a rapidly developing crisis. USAF via FOIA In some cases, smaller elements may have access to shorter range unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the Scan Eagle or RQ-21 Black Jack, but generally for surveillance purposes only. With the limited resources at many of these forward sites, contractors are often responsible for running those flights. The larger MQ-9s are still relatively, slow as well, making it difficult for them to quickly rush to the scene even if they’re available. There was a reason why the French Air Force’s fast-moving Mirage 2000 fighter jets based in Chad were the first air support to arrive after the attack in Tongo Tongo. When they arrived, their ability to help out was greatly limited by the apparent confusion on the ground, with friendly forces “ overlapping ” with the militants, according to French General Staff Colonel Patrick Steiger. Initial reports said that French still did not have approval from Nigerien authorities to engage targets on the ground when they arrived. There is no indication that there was a joint tactical air controller or similar individual on the ground with the necessary equipment or training to communicate with the pilots overhead to even discuss the possibility of what would’ve been a risky strike. In delivering his annual posture statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2017, U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of AFRICOM, specifically noted many of these issues. He complained that he could only meet 20 to 30 percent of the intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance requirements in his command and highlighted both the reliance on contractors casualty evacuation and the lack of sufficient medical capacity for American forces on the continent. “While the command has been able to succeed in multiple efforts, our mission is impacted by inconsistent resourcing of key requirements and capabilities,” Waldhauser told legislators in his prepared remarks . “These constraints risk our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and Civilians executing activities on the African continent.” There are also reports that before the incident in Tongo Tongo, the head of Special Operations Command North and West Africa, which manages U.S. special operations activities throughout the region, had asked for additional support. The Embassy in Niger apparently rejected this request, fearing the political impact of an increased American presence, which has already grown eight fold since 2013. With all this in mind, it’s hard to imagine that heads won’t roll, despite what White House Chief of Staff Kelly’s words of caution. But as we can see, the outrage over the outcome in Benghazi was tempered by the relative rarity of these incidents. As the public outrage over the actual particulars of that debacle subsided, so did any impetus to dramatically change the U.S. military’s force posture and contingency plans in much of Africa. There’s already immense focus on how President Trump and his administration have handled the notification of the families rather than the specific particulars of the mission to Tongo Tongo, which remains largely unexplained. Within the U.S. military, there will undoubtedly be significant soul searching as the review of the incident continues, but domestic and foreign political considerations, limited resources, and other factors may prevent anyone from implementation substantive changes on the ground any time soon. What is clear is that something like this has been a long time coming and its something that could easily occur again in the future under the present circumstances.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",The Army’s Latest Spy Planes Are Flying Hundreds of Hours Overseas,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three of the four versions of the U.S. Army’s latest spy plane, the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System, or EMARSS , are now flying hundreds of hours a month over Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The service says the full fleet should be ready for aerial intelligence units by the middle of 2018. As of Oct. 19, 2017, the geo-intelligence, signals intelligence, and Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER) versions were operating in the regions of the globe were U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Central Command, and U.S. Southern Command oversee U.S. military activities, according to the Army’s Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors, which manages the program. In March 2017, just the signal snooping type was conducting missions in Africa and Latin America. Brandon Pollachek, a spokesperson for the Army office, told The War Zone in an Email that the deployed aircraft collectively were in the air for approximately 800 hours a month outside of the contiguous United States. Citing operational security, he declined to say how many EMARSS planes were overseas, what units were flying them, or in support of what missions. As of 2015, the Army had a total of 24 EMARSS aircraft or aircraft it was converting to one of the four configurations. There are eight geo-intelligence EMRASS-Gs, four signals intelligence EMARSS-S, and four VADER-equipped EMARSS-Vs. Though the equipment varies from type to type, each variant uses a version of the twin engine Beechcraft 350-series King Air, known as the MC-12S, as the base platform. The EMARSS-V variant., Bill Word We’ve discussed the EMARSS-S and -V types in detail before, with the signals intelligence version being able to find and record enemy transmissions, while the VADER radar can produce detailed radar imagery over a wide area. Both aircraft also have a turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras. The EMARSS-G is another wide-area surveillance version that has a powerful electro-optical camera that can either record low-grade video or take higher resolution still pictures covering more 12 square miles at a time. Analysts can then put the imagery together to form even large “mosaic” maps to track even minute changes, such as apparent recently disturbed terrain suggesting the presence of an improvised explosive device. As with the other EMARSS types, these plans have the camera turret, as well. At least some have or will feature a laser imaging system that can detect objects buried near the surface of the ground, again an important tool for spotting roadside bombs and other potential hazards. The final eight multi-purpose EMARSS-M, which have yet to see overseas service, will be similar to the EMARSS-S with signals intelligence equipment combined with the sensor turret. The Army is modifying MC-12W Liberty aircraft to create this type. These came second-hand from the U.S. Air Force, which had bought the planes in 2008 after a review by then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the need for more surveillance aircraft in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the face of budget cuts, that service subsequently transferred the entire fleet to the Air National Guard, U.S. Special Operations Command, and the U.S. Army. USAF MC-12W Liberty Bell in Afghanistan in 2014, USAF All of the EMARSS aircraft combine their sensors with satellite data links to transmit the information back to base or directly to troops on the ground, consoles directly linked to the controversial Distributed Common Ground System – Army (DCGS-A) intelligence data network, and a software suite that can readily accept updates and upgrades known as Big Iron. There’s a clear intention to make the aircraft as modular as possible so that they can rapidly incorporate new sensors and equipment in the future. The King Air, which is relatively cheap to operate and maintain, has long been a popular aircraft for the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance role, especially within the Army. The U.S. military has and continues to employ contractors flying similar types, as well. The Army also saved more money – and the EMARSS program itself, which had become something of a saga by 2013, a story you can read about in detail here – by buying some of the King Air-based spy planes straight from the contractors it had previously hired to fly the missions. These became the EMARSS-G and -V variants. And it’s not surprising the Army has already put these planes to work. The new MC-12S fleet is in the process of replacing older RC-12H, K, N, and P Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), all of which again used the King Air platform, but only had the ability to locate and monitor enemy communications and other signals. A US Army RC-12P GRCS aircraft in Iraq in 2006., James Gordon via Wikimedia But despite a number of common self-protection features, including missile warning sensors and decoy flares, these aircraft are best suited to lower threat environments. Though they can be risky for troops on the ground, the terrorists and militants the U.S. military is targeting in Latin America and Africa in particular have very limited anti-aircraft capabilities. Even in Iraq and Afghanistan, groups like ISIS and the Taliban have not proved to be an insurmountable threat to similar aircraft such as the Army’s late model RC-12X GRCS aircraft, the Air National Guard’s MC-12W Liberties – yet more intelligence gathering planes with the King Air at their core. Contractors have also been flying Beechcraft-based surveillance aircraft in support of Joint Special Operations Command missions in these areas, such as the one that crashed in Iraq in March 2016. The value of having these planes in the sky during these operations is clear, though, especially in large parts of Africa , where there are few population centers, let alone functional local security institutions. Just mapping these areas to begin with can be a nightmare for a central government with limited resources. Keeping tabs on highly mobile groups of militants, such as the one that ambushed American troops in the West African country of Niger earlier in October 2017, requires persistent surveillance over large areas. One of the EMARSS-S aircraft., US Army There are already significant questions over whether the U.S. personnel and their Nigerien partners had adequate manned and unmanned surveillance capabilities before and during the incident. With more resources in place, they might have assessed the risk of that mission differently. Of course, it’s a truism that there is always a high demand for intelligence and that American commanders would always prefer to have more of it if possible. The Army is clearly making sure to get the EMARSS aircraft out into the field as quick as it can to help out.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 15, 2020",Boeing Might Include Stealthy Features on Overhauled US Navy Super Hornets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has disclosed that the expected service life extension program for the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets could include stealth features and improved avionics and mission systems in addition to a more general airframe overhaul. This more comprehensive update would not only keep the aircraft safely flying at least until 2040, but could potentially make them a capable, but low-cost alternative in many scenarios compared to the service’s up-coming F-35C Joint Strike Fighters or any future sixth generation design. On Oct. 17, 2017, Mark Sears, director of Boeing’s Super Hornet service life modification (SLM) division, told Aviation Week that the company hoped to begin work on the first of the Navy’s aircraft in April 2018. The basic overhaul would add approximately 3,000 flight hours of service life to the jet’s existing 6,000 hour life span, in line with stated plans to keep the planes in service through 2040 . In addition, the program may include additional improvements, including unspecified low observable (LO) or stealthy enhancements, to bring the service’s existing aircraft closer to the configuration of the all-new Block III F/A-18E/Fs it is also planning to buy . “There are various degrees of LO enhancement,” Sears explained to Aviation Week without giving detailed specifics. “We’ve played within that spectrum, but there’s certainly an LO piece of Block III.” In general, Sears said these possible additions could include adding a low observable material “coating” to the basic airframe or replacing existing portions of the aircraft with radar absorbent material components. A fully enclosed weapons pod or similar conformal compartments might be an easier addition. It would be difficult for the Navy to request drastic changes to the basic shape of the plane without incurring significant additional costs. Boeing’s Advanced SUper Hornet prototype with conformal fuel tanks and a fully enclosed weapons pod., Boeing In 2015, pictures did begin toemerge of what appeared to be a Super Hornet test article with a dramatically revised planform sitting in storage at the U.S. military’s main aircraft Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. This could be part of what Sears meant when he said Boeing had “played within that spectrum,” but he also suggested to Aviation Week that the company had eventually decided to take a significantly less labor intensive approach. @Aviation_Intel close up shot of that stealthy looking F/A-18 mock up at the Boneyard- https://t.co/8OK67Q786h pic.twitter.com/2l38eQQLEQ — Scott Lowe (@tropicostation) May 7, 2016 “At some point we drew a line that would allow us to be stealthy enough in a balanced survivable way to be effective, and that is what we think we have,” said Dan Gillian, Boeing F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager. “The F-35 is a stealthier airplane, but we have a balanced approach to survivability, including electronic warfare, and self-protection.” Beoing first proposed an “Advanced Super Hornet” upgrade in 2008. The new Block III configuration will reportedly include a long-range infrared search and track (IRST) sensor, already in the works as part of the Block II upgrade , that can detect the heat signature of enemy aircraft. This would complement the F/A-18E/F’s already capable AN/APG-79 active electronically-scanned array radar , which the Navy introduced with the Block II aircraft and subsequently added to its older Super Hornets. On top of that, Boeing’s Block III fighters feature a new widescreen cockpit display, an improved mission computer, and data links that can receive and transmit more information to and from the aircraft to improve the pilot’s overall picture of the battlefield. The Navy has plans for an overarching data sharing network, called Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air, or NIFC-CA , which will link its ships, manned aircraft, drones , and other sensor nodes, as well as networked missiles and other stand-off munitions themselves, together. Beyond just providing greater situation awareness and integrated threat information from E-2D Hawkeye airborne early warning planes and EA-18 Growler electronic warfare aircraft, the links would allow ships or aircrafts to pass targeting information to other assets, or even networked missiles or other munitions themselves. An F/A-18E/F integrated into the NIFC-CA net could, in theory, fire a long-range air-to-air missile at a target using the radar picture from a drone scouting ahead or a ship operating in the area, allowing the aircraft to engage the enemy even while in “radar silent” mode, helping to conceal its own position. An look at possible Advanced Super Hornet enhancement from a presentation about the IRST upgrade., Boeing The other major reported addition to the Block III Super Hornets is a set of conformal fuel tanks (CFT) that will add approximately 100 to 120 miles to the jet’s effective combat radius of around 450 miles, depending on its load. The CFTs would also take the place of two drop tanks that the jets often carry on operations, potentially freeing up more space for ordnance . Further improvements in the future could include enhanced performance General Electric F414 engines with roughly 20 perfect more thrust, as well. The Navy hopes its up-coming MQ-25 tanker drone will allow the carrier air wing to strike targets another 500 miles further away by itself. This means that Block III Super Hornets with CFTs coupled with the MQ-25 could possibly hit enemy positions more than 1,000 miles away from the carrier, keeping the ship safer from the increasing danger of networked defenses and long-range anti-ship missiles , including anti-ship ballistic missiles . Boeing model of proposed Block III Super Hornet @ #sas2017 — potential competitor to F-35C pic.twitter.com/YFSOryrX9b — Sydney Freedberg (@SydneyFreedberg) April 4, 2017 Combined with any low observable additions, both the new Block III jets and the overhauled aircraft could offer the Navy more options when planning operations against medium-to-high end threats. While the improved Super Hornets wouldn’t be able to take the place of the F-35C Joint Strike Fighters against a layered, integrated air defense network on the “first day” of a conflict, it might make them more survivable against any residual threats that remain after the initial strikes. In the open sorties of a crisis, the enhanced F/A-18E/Fs might even be able able to use their new low observable features and other countermeasures to get close enough to the target area to safely launch stand-off weapons. It would also increase the number of lower risk situations in which F/A-18E/Fs might be able to fill in for stealth F-35Cs, helping reduce the operational burden on those jets. Regardless of how intensive Boeing’s SLM division expects the upgrade work to be, the Navy is in desperate need of the basic overhauls to prevent a dangerous fighter shortfall. On average, less than 60% of the service’s Super Hornets are flyable every day. That figure is even lower when looking at totals for both the older F/A-18A/B/C/D Hornet fleet and the F/A-18E/Fs combined. A spate of accidents and vexing problems with the aircraft’s on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS), another issue we at The War Zone have previously looked at in detail , undoubtedly haven’t helped those statistics. The Navy will have to decide whether or not a more extensive upgrade is worth it, both in terms of cost and time the aircraft will be out of service. It is possible that Boeing could interest other Super Hornet operators and potential operators in the package, as well, which would help drive down the final unit price. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet., USN Boeing’s Mark Sears told Aviation Week that the company expected the overhaul of the first Super Hornet would take approximately 18 months, though he did not say whether this was the time frame for the SLEP or that plus additional Block III upgrades. He added that he hoped his team could shorten this down to just a year, but noted that there would “likely be surprises.” The Navy is likely hoping to avoid a repeat of service life extension work on its older F/A-18C/D Hornets, which began in 2012. That work suffered significant delays as depots began pulling planes apart and discovering a host of unexpected problems. Boeing told USNI News in April 2017 that it had adopted a different and more extensive “factory production approach” to get ready for the Super Hornet program. The Chicago-headquartered plane maker expects to put more than 400 Super Hornets through the process, which will run through 2028. The Navy’s budget request for the 2018 fiscal year includes $87 million specifically for the project, but does not explain how many planes this money will cover. Without the work, many of the jets in question are headed to the bone yard sooner rather than later as is, Sears noted to Aviation Week. The Navy has gobbled up hours on these jets over the last decade and a half of fighting in the Middle East and other high-tempo operations abroad. We may just have to wait and see what the rehabilitated Super Hornets look like when they emerge from Boeing’s St. Louis, Missouri and San Antonio, Texas facilities, and if they have obvious stealth additions or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2018",Royal Navy May Sacrifice Its Last Amphibious Ships to Pay For Its New Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the U.K. Ministry of Defense declared 2017 to be the “ year of the Navy ,” there are a number of notable achievements in this area, including the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth putting to sea for the first time and the start of construction of a new class of frigates . Unfortunately, personnel cuts and budget shortfalls mean the service may be considering gutting its amphibious warfare capability in favor of its forthcoming supercarriers, which would only call more into question its ability to perform large scale, independent operations, especially with those new ships. On Oct. 5, 2017, the BBC reported that First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones, the Royal Navy’s top officer, had assembled a variety of options to cut costs and otherwise shift resources. Among the possible courses of action, which were not mutually exclusive, were trimming the Royal Marines by approximately 1,000 personnel, the retirement of the amphibious ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark , and pulling a pair a smaller mine hunters and a survey vessel out of action. “No decisions have yet been made and at this stage,” a Ministry of Defense spokesperson told numerous British media outlets , though they did not deny Jones had put together the list. “Any discussion of the options is pure speculation.” The fate of Albion and Bulwark , along with the possible cuts to the Royal Marine’s 3 Commando Brigade, have so far drawn the most outcry from critics. The two-ship class of landing platform docks only entered service in the early 2000s and represents the bulk of the Royal Navy’s amphibious capabilities. Even more galling, the Albion just finished a refit worth 90 million Pounds, or almost $120 million at the present exchange rate, in September 2017 that was supposed to extend her service life out to 2030. The service’s only other amphibious warfare ship, the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean , will head to the scrap yard in 2018 after just two decades of steady service, unless something changes. There are rumors that Brazil is interested in purchasing the vessel, but the Ministry of Defense has so far declined to confirm or deny that anyone is interested in buying it. Albion is supposed to take over from Ocean as the Royal Navy’s flagship until the Queen Elizabeth reached initial operational capability in 2020. Without Ocean , Albion , and Bulwark , the Royal Marines would have to rely either on ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary , a civilian mariner-manned service akin to the U.S. Navy’s merchant marine Military Sealift Command , or accept that its days of hitting the beach are essentially over. Cutting 1,000 members from the force, which has fewer than 8,000 personnel in total , wouldn’t help matters, either. The other option would be utilize the Queen Elizabeth , or her sister HMS Prince of Wales , in the amphibious role, something that the Royal Navy has already suggested it is planning to do in the future, describing the configuration as being for “littoral maneuver.” However, the ships would be unable to perform this duty and the functions of a fixed-wing aircraft carrier simultaneously, as each mission requires an entirely different air wing. Since neither flattop has a well deck, an issue the U.S. Navy ran into with the America -class , it would be hard, if not impossible for the Marines to make use of landing craft or hovercrafts to get ashore. And here's what the composition of the @HMSQnlz carrier strike group, and its littoral air manoeuvre air wing, will look like: pic.twitter.com/VhR5QZCEK1 — Thomas Newdick (@CombatAir) June 20, 2017 These issues could only limit the ability of the ships to support large-scale amphibious operations, as well as be available for traditional carrier missions. That’s before one even considers whether or not routine and potentially limited amphibious landings is really the best use of the pair of ships, which will each cost approximately 3 billion Pounds, or nearly $4 billion. Of course, there is also a long-standing debate as to whether or not amphibious operations remain a realistic method of operating in a world increasingly full of networked air and missile defenses , long-range anti-ship cruise missiles , and other defenses . Regardless, there have been numerous examples in the past where military amphibious ships have shown the continued utility of these capabilities, even just for administrative landings, both during combat operations and in support of humanitarian relief efforts. Most recently, Ocean , full of aid and helicopters to distribute it, has been a major part of the United Kingdom’s relief efforts in British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean following Hurricanes Irma and Maria . The U.S. Navy has done the same by sending its own amphibious ships to the area. But Admiral Jones’ may feel he has few other options. Even with a 1 billion Pound infusion from the Ministry of Defense, the Royal Navy may still be facing a budgetary shortfall. The United Kingdom’s top defense officials have been reluctant to publicly discuss budget issues, though they did deny reports in January 2017 that Prince of Wales would head straight for mothballs after its commissioning because of a budget gap of approximately 500 million Pounds. Whatever the case, the BBC reported that its sources explained that the proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were a two-part effort to both save money and free up sailors to man the two Queen Elizabeth -class carriers. This in turn provoked more ire and raises additional questions about where the service will find the necessary resources to get the most out of those ships. “This is the worst procurement decision of the past half century,” an anonymous Royal Marine officer told BBC, referring to the carriers, which will be the largest ships the Royal Navy has ever operated. “That’s what the Royal Marines are being sacrificed for.” A Royal Marine commando takes up a position after exiting a hovercraft during cold weather training in Norway., Crown Copyright We at The War Zone have repeatedly raised questions about the practicality of the two aircraft carriers given the Royal Navy’s capacity and needs. Most glaringly, the Fleet Air Arm doesn’t expect to have the first batch of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, the centerpiece of Queen Elizabeth ’s air wing, in operation until 2023, two years after the carrier enters service. To make up for this, the service has already made a partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps that will see Queen Elizabeth sail her first patrol in 2021 with American F-35B Joint Strike Fighters rather than British aircraft. In the absence of real jets, deck crews are training for their future jobs with full scale models . But the ship’s aviation component, or lack thereof, is only one small part of the issue. When Queen Elizabeth left port for the first time in June 2017, I wrote : According to ACA [the Aircraft Carrier Alliance , the consortium building the Queen Elizabeth -class], the two new carriers will ultimately have a full crew of 1,600, including air wing personnel during cruises, but Queen Elizabeth is heading out with its core crew of 700 for her initial evaluation which won’t include any air wing personnel. Even taking into account its smaller size, compared to a typical U.S. Navy carrier with its embarked air wing, both of these figures seem low. A Nimitz -class carrier has a crew of 3,200 without the air wing, which raises the final total to over 5,500 personnel. Beyond the issues with carrier’s aviation element, there is just the matter of what it takes to support one carrier, let alone two. No matter how their air wings are configured, the Royal Navy would need to commit significant numbers of escorting ships, such as destroyers, frigates, logistical ships and submarines to each deployment. A typical U.S. Navy carrier battle group includes a guided missile cruiser, three destroyers, and at least one Los Angeles -class attack submarine, not mention the logistical ships that support the Strike Group. As of 2017, the Royal Navy had six Type 45 destroyers and seven Astute – and Trafalgar -class attack submarines in total, plus another 13 Type 23 frigates. This all calls into question the ability of the Royal Navy to operate both ships by itself and may imply a need for increased cooperation with allies, such as the United States, for expeditionary or forward-deployed operations. If the Royal Navy is already cutting ships to find sailors to properly staff Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales , one has to wonder whether it has enough personnel to adequately operate the other ships it will need for its carrier battle groups. We’ve already seen what happened to the U.S. Navy as it tried to make due with overworked crews aboard already undermanned vessels. At present, the service isn’t even expecting to buy enough new Type 26 frigates to replace the aging Type 23s on a one-for-one basis. There are plans to add five Type 31e “ general purpose frigates ” to the eight City -class ships, but these vessels by their very design will be less capable and possibly ill-suited to carrier escort work depending on their final configuration. But even with an entire new fleet of frigates, its unlikely that those ships would ever all be in service at once, if only due to the need for routine maintenance and upgrades. The Royal Navy’s readiness troubles and budget woes could have an impact there, too. As of July 2017, four of the six Type 45s and nine of the 13 Type 23s were pier side either undergoing repairs or overhauls or laid up waiting for that work to start. More recent exercises suggest that the United Kingdom might be considering making up the shortfall by operating in concert with other NATO allies as a matter of policy. Ongoing manpower issues revealed by status of Royal Navy surface escorts https://t.co/2LoAP15JQ1 pic.twitter.com/vda5mQqFgT — Navy Lookout (@NavyLookout) July 8, 2017 There doesn’t seem to be universal sympathy for the Royal Navy’s plight at the Ministry of Defense, though. At least one anonymous official who talked to the BBC also seemed annoyed that the service had continued to push for its new carriers, as well as a raft of other shipbuilding, even as the budget situation became increasingly dire. At present the Royal Navy is working to add the two Queen Elizabeth -class carriers, replace its Vanguard -class nuclear ballistic missile submarines, build the new Type 26s and additional Astute -class attack subs, and add a number of other small patrol boats, all at once. “The Royal Navy has got us into this mess,” the senior Ministry of Defense officials, who BBC described as a “senior figure,” said. “So it’s up to them to take the pain necessary to get us out of it.” Looming in the background to all of this, of course, is the United Kingdom’s plans to leave the European Union following a controversial national referendum, a process known as the British Exit or Brexit. The country’s economy has already entered a slump as private business tensely watch government officials stumble through plans to negotiate new trade deals and other agreements with the rest the continent and further abroad. The value of the Pound has already fallen to its lowest point in decades. A Royal Navy Wildcat helicopter flies ahead of HMS Queen Elizabeth as she enters Portsmouth in August 2017., Crown Copyright There are reasonable fears that all of this could prompt even further budget cuts, including to defense spending, as well as curtail or cripple supporting industries. Shipbuilding in particularly is a notoriously long-lead time affair, requiring a significant investment in infrastructure and skilled labor up front, with costs going down only as production gets going and only if new orders remain relatively steady. Every time a major layoff occurs or a shipyard shuts down, it resets the process. So it’s not a particularly good sign that BAE Systems, part of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and parent company of the Govan shipyard that will be churning out the Type 26s, announced plans to cut 2,000 jobs across the United Kingdom, including 340 working at the Royal Navy’s Portsmouth Naval Base, Queen Elizabeth ’s homeport, earlier in October 2017. However he decides to proceed, it seems clear that Admiral Jones will have to make some hard decisions in the near future. A certain point, though, cutting more things will only lead to diminishing returns, especially if the First Sea Lord has to keep poaching sailors from one set of ships to fill the billets on others.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020",USAF and Raytheon Say Cost Overruns Won’t Slow Delivery of Vital New Bomb,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s Small Diameter Bomb II program has seen such large cost overruns that the service will force the manufacturer, Raytheon, to absorb some of the increases, amounting to nearly $40 million. Both parties insist that the present production and delivery schedule won’t suffer, which is important given the present plan is for the precision guided munitions to become a core weapon system for a variety of American combat aircraft, especially the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . On Oct. 18, 2017, the Air Force acknowledged that Raytheon had run out of “financial liability” in its deal to develop the small precision glide bomb, also known as the SDB II or GBU-53/B, as well as in two limited production run contracts. In a not uncommon move, when it signed the deals, the service had set a maximum allowable amount by which costs could grow, with the defense contractor agreeing it could not seek reimbursement for any issues afterward. So far, the Massachusetts-based firm could have to shell out up to $39 million, according to Bloomberg , which first reported the issue. The company “has worked diligently to address technical discoveries and is implementing the necessary factory infrastructure improvements to meet current contract requirements,” Captain Emily Grabowski, an Air Force spokesperson told Bloomberg. Still, the service “believes Raytheon Missile Systems is able to reliably and consistently build” the weapon. This assessment is important for both parties, since the Air Force is already planning to buy up to 17,000, as well as help American allies purchase the bombs. Earlier in October 2017, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced that the U.S. government had approved the sale of 3,900 SDB IIs, plus a variety of other equipment and support services, to Australia , a deal worth approximately $815 million. An F-16D carries SDB IIs during a test., Raytheon The weapon definitely offers improved capabilities over the older GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb and the Laser Small Diameter Bomb (LSDB). The standard GBU-39/B has a combination inertial navigation system and GPS guidance system, while the LSDB adds laser guidance. The LSDB was already a significant upgrade that also included the necessary software to properly calculate how far ahead of a moving target the bomb has to fly to hit it, known as a “laser-lead” capability . The INS/GPS-directed SDB had no ability to hit moving targets. Raytheon’s GBU-53/B will have the option of using either of those methods to attack targets, as well as a millimeter wave radar and infrared sensor. This will allow the bomb to find its mark through smoke, dust, and other poor weather conditions, making the weapon truly all-weather capable. The weapon’s on board computer has the ability to classify and prioritize targets on its own, seeking out its especially vulnerable points, too. It also offers pilots another means of pressing forward with an attack in the event one or more systems malfunction or otherwise get knocked out. The latter point is becoming an increasingly important consideration with regards to GPS, especially as reports of Russian jamming and spoofing increase in Europe. During an actual crisis, those electronic attacks could limit the ability of INS/GPS weapons to function as intended or prompt concerns about their accuracy, making commanders and aircrews wary of using them at all, something we’ve discussed here at The War Zone many times before . DoD On top of all that, both the older SDBs and LSDBs and the new SDB IIs have pop-out wings on top, allowing them to glide dozens of miles before dropping down on hostile positions or vehicles. This means the launching aircraft to put more distance between it and the target area, potentially allowing the pilot to better avoid enemy defenses or detection, or kill those threats if need be. Raytheon’s improved bombs have an approximate stand-off range of between 40 and 45 miles, depending on the target type. They’re also networked, which lets the pilot, using information provided by their own board sensors, from other aircraft, or troops on the ground, point the bomb toward another target while it’s in flight to respond to rapidly changing situations. By all accounts, the program seems to be progressing well. Any new weapon system is likely to have unexpected issues that need fixing, though, and the latest delays and cost-overruns are linked to failed flight and environmental tests. In 2015, a prototype failed to detonate during a live fire test, requiring a number of unspecified improvements. Raytheon appeared to have resolved that issue, but another weapon’s wings malfunctioned in a test in 2016 and the company had yet to determine the source of the issue as of January 2017, according to the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation . The bomb’s programmable fuze prematurely detonated another bomb during a test of the INS/GPS-guidance mode, but the company resolved that problem. Perhaps the most problematic issue wasn’t really related to the Air Force’s requirements. In 2016, a prototype SDB II failed an environmental test “related to the shipboard environment,” according to DOT&E. The U.S. Marine Corps and Navy both expect to employ the bombs on their versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which will fly from amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers . Raytheon had to rework the basic design to account for “corrosion, temperature, altitude and humidity, and vibration environments,” the Pentagon’s top weapon testing office explained. Though the company declined to comment for Bloomberg’s story, this problem could only have slowed the company’s production schedule and could have forced it to either fix or scrap production bomb or components it had already built. An F-15E Strike Eagle carries SDB IIs during a test., Raytheon The Air Force told Bloomberg this pushed the delivery of the first weapons back from November 2016 to June 2017 and delayed the testing and evaluation process. The service now expects to reach initial operational capability with the SDB II on the F-15E Strike Eagle by January 2019. However, the Air Force is undoubtedly keen to get the new GBU-53/Bs into action as soon as possible, having already spent more than a decade on the program. A major corruption scandal , in which the Air Force’s top acquisition official Darleen Druyun steered the contract to Boeing in exchange for future employment, brought the initial project to a halt and forced the service to run an entirely new competition in 2005. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which had been the only other company to submit a bid the first time around, joined together on a new submission, but Raytheon won out. It first flight tested its SDB II design in 2009. In the meantime, the utility of a small and accurate 250-pound class precision weapon that is less likely to harm both friendly forces during so-called “ danger close ” air strikes on enemy forces in close proximity, as well as innocent civilians. In 2008, the Air Force introduced the Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) version of the SDB, which has a lightweight composite shell that disintegrates when the bomb goes off, further reducing the chance that errant shrapnel could cause unintended collateral damage. An inert display model of the FLM warhead., Joseph Trevithick So it’s no surprise that the SDB and LSDB have been stars of the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, where the fighting has devolved into pitched battles over tightly packed cities full of terrorists, friendly partner and coalition special operations forces, and civilians. In 2015, the Air Force warned it was running out of the weapons, along with other precision guided munitions. Two years later, the service reported that it was no longer “on a glide path to zero,” as one official briefing had termed the situation. The delays in having the weapon ready for the F-35 have been a particular sore spot for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, as well. In 2012, U.S. legislators even considered cutting the SDB II program altogether given that the Joint Strike Fighters themselves were behind schedule. We’ve discussed the F-35’s presently limited arsenal in the past in detail and the SDB II would offer a significant additional capability for the jet during many missions, including its controversial expected role as a close air support aircraft supporting troops on the ground. At present, the Air Force’s F-35A and the Navy’s F-35C can only carry one bomb, in the 2,000-pound class or smaller, internally in each of their two weapons bays. These aircraft could carry four SDB IIs instead, allowing them to engage more targets while still remaining as stealthy as possible. Marines test load SDB IIs into the revised weapons bay of an F-35B., USAF The issue is even more significant with regards to the Marine Corps’ F-35B, which is limited to at most two 1,000-pound class weapons because of the weight and bulk of the large lift fan in the center fuselage that gives the variant its vertical take-off and landing capability. In 2015, the Pentagon’s central F-35 program office, which manages the project for all of the services, acknowledged that the Marine version would need a resdesign to even accommodate the SDB IIs on their special four-bomb rack, something that it has worked with Lockheed Martin to do since then. One picture, seen above, does show a fit check of four of the weapons in the F-35B’s bomb bay, but its unclear whether this is a functional installation yet. Until recently, the F-35 fleet as a whole lacked the ability to hit moving targets, too. Lockheed Martin found an interim solution by adding the dual-mode INS/GPS and laser-guided GBU-49/B 500-pound bomb, which has its own built-in laser-lead capability, to the plane’s possible load outs. The SDB II won’t be an option for the jets until sometime in 2022. It will be an option for Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18E/F Super Hornets by 2020, though. A US Navy infographic showing that service’s plans for the SDB II., NAVAIR These same issues apply to any American ally that is planning to field the F-35. It is no surprise that Australia, which is expecting to buy more than 70 Joint Strike Fighters, is interested in buying thousands of SDB IIs to go along with them. Hopefully the Air Force’s and Raytheon’s optimism about the situation will be well founded. Given the already heavy use of the existing SDB and LSDB muntions, pilots and aircrews would find the improved SDB IIs a welcome addition on their missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2019",Greece Plans to Spend Billions Upgrading Its F-16 Fighter Jet Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States has approved the possible sale of more than 120 upgrade kits from Lockheed Martin to the Greeks for their F-16 fighter jet fleet. The deal, worth more than $2 billion, highlights the continued importance of advanced 4th generation fighter jets , especially for countries such as Greece that don’t necessarily have the need for or the resources to procure expensive, stealthy 5th generation aircraft. The announcement came on Oct. 17, 2017, as U.S. President Donald Trump met with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Washington, D.C. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the alliance’s defense budget targets , applauded Greece for meeting the goal of each member spending two percent of their gross domestic product on their military and highlighted the F-16 upgrade plans. “They’re upgrading their fleets of airplanes – the F-16 plane, which is a terrific plane,” Trump said ahead of a bilateral meeting. “They’re doing big upgrades.” According to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the complete package includes the necessary components to bring 123 of Greece’s existing F-16C and D fighter jets up to Lockheed Martin’s new F-16V standard, which the company first introduced in 2012. The updates include, among other things, new mission computers, navigation systems, multifunction displays, Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) transponders, and the Link-16 tactical data link. One of the Hellenic Air Force’s F-16Ds., Hellenic Air Force By far, though the most important upgrade is the replacement of the existing jets’ mechanically scanned radars with the AN/APG-83 active electronically-scanned array type radars, also known as the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). Faster scanning, even interlaced air and ground modes, and able to more accurately detect targets at longer ranges and smaller aerial targets flying at low altitude, the AESA unit is a cost-effective way to get more capability out of the older F-16Cs all by itself. The United States itself has recognized this and in June 2017, radar’s manufacturer Northrop Grumman announced it had gotten a contract to upgrade 72 Air National Guard F-16Cs with the new unit. “AESA radar upgrades are critically important to give the F-16 community, the tactical advantage it deserves, and we are honored to provide this differentiating technology for the safety and mission effectiveness of our warfighters,” Bob Gough, the Vice President of Northrop Grumman’s Combat Avionics Systems division, said at the time . “The APG-83 SABR system is in full rate production and available now for U.S. and international F-16 upgrades.” With 123 kits, the Greeks will be able to upgrade all 115 of their single seat F-16C fighters – a mix Block 30, Block 50, Block 52+, and Block 52+ Advanced aircraft, the latest versions featuring conformal fuel tanks among other improvements – to a single uniform configuration, as well as bring a number of their 40 two seat F-16D trainers up to the new standard. The full package would include two spare SABRs, 26 of Raytheon’s Advanced Self-Protection Integrated Suite (ASPIS) II electronic warfare systems for jets that haven’t yet received that upgrade, and a host of other spare parts and support services. The total estimated value is of the purchase is just more than $2.4 billion. If Greece goes ahead with the deal, it would be the third country to purchase the F-16V package. Taiwan was the first to choose to upgrade its older F-16A/B jets to the new configuration in 2015, after it became apparent the United States would not approve the sale of all-new fighters for political reasons. The actual work began in January 2017. Eight months later, the U.S. approved the sale of 22 new production V models to Bahrain . Lockheed Martin is pitching another derivative based on the upgrade package, the Block 70 , to India, as well. On top of that, after fumbling the issue , the U.S. Air Force expects to overhaul more than 800 of its own Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 F-16C/Ds and keep them flying through 2048, during which time they will need their own additional radar and systems upgrades, suggesting that there will be a steady support pipeline for any country flying Vipers for years to come. At a little more than $19.5 million per jet, the Greek plan is definitely more cost effective than buying all new fighter jets. A trio of late block Greek F-16Cs., Hellenic Air Force It is a small fraction of what it would cost Greece to procure and operate stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , something it still reportedly remains interested in doing in the future. The Greeks have been keen to match the capabilities of Turkey, which is planning to purchase both the F-35 and build its own fifth generation fighter, known as the TFX . Though they are both NATO members, the Greeks and the Turks have long been major rivals, sparing violently many times over the years, especially with regards to the Mediterranean island country of Cyprus. An ethnic Turkish minority occupies a de facto independent region in the north, which only the government in Ankara recognizes, in defiance of the island’s ethnic Greek majority. Since 1964, a United Nations peacekeeping mission has provided a buffer between the parties while they’ve struggled to negotiate a final settlement. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the two countries’ air forces have faced off numerous times over the Aegean Sea , with Turkey notably accusing Greek Mirage 2000s of shooting down one of their F-16s in 1996. Greece said the Turkish aircraft crashed after an apparent mechanical failure during the engagement. Beyond Turkey, Greece also has to consider security threats emanating from in the Middle East, such as Syria, as well as North Africa. In addition to looking to upgrade its F-16s, the country is also hoping to update its Russian-made S-300PMU-1 surface-to-air missile systems, which it acquired from Cyprus in 1997 as part of a deal to ease tensions with the Turkish government, as part of modernizing its integrated air defenses in general. One of Greece’s similarly aging S-300PMU-1 transporter erector launchers., Greek Ministry of Defense Unfortunately, a financial crisis in 2007 finally gave way to a depression in 2009 and the country’s economy has infamously struggled to rebound ever since. State-sponsored bailouts, notably from Germany, talks of leaving the Europe Union, and other desperate measures followed. In June 2017, the International Monetary Fund effectively let Greece slide on its monthly debt payments in exchange for an agreement from Greek authorities to institute various austerity measures, such as changes to the country’s labor laws and changes to its national social security scheme. This put Greece’s plans to buy its own F-35s on hold, at least until 2025. “Multiply the total cost [of an F-35] on 5 also for maintenance, infrastructure, etc,” Greece’s Deputy Defense Minister Dimitris Vitsas said during an interview on the country’s Skai TV. “Do we have the ability to do such things? When can we purchase such new fighters? In 2025.” The Hellenic Air Force has a need for the upgrades now, though, especially when it comes to the oldest Block 30 F-16C/D, which it began receiving in 1985 through a U.S. Air Force managed Foreign Military Sales program colorfully nicknamed Peace Xenia. The Block 50 aircraft began touching down in 1993 as part of Peace Xenia II. These two batches of aircraft continue to make up a sizable portion of the country’s remaining 150 or so Vipers. Hellenic Air Force Finally bringing the diverse fleet to a single standard would help reduce strains on maintenance and logistics, since ground crews will no longer have to manage four different sub-types, no matter how similar they are, which in turn would help cut costs. This money could go into new procurement or make up for other budget shortfalls. Costs and cost saving are undoubtedly high on the list of factors driving the upgrade program in general, given Greece’s budget troubles, but it is still reasonable to ask whether or not the Greeks will ultimately be able to pay for the upgrade project or any other modernization plans. Greece’s government insists it will continue to spend two percent or more on defense and security, just one of five countries in NATO meet that spending goal. The others are the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia, and Poland. But while Greece may intend to continue spending significant amounts on its defenses, especially in light of Turkey’s expanding military capabilities and growing regional influence, it simply might not be able to do so if it cannot get its finances in order. Further budgetary hiccups could easily slow how fast that work gets done or outright curtail the number of F-16s that ultimately receive the upgrades.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 31, 2021",NATO Members Train to Nuke a “Fictional” Enemy After Major Russian Drills,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NATO has quietly begun an annual exercise to practice how it might launch a nuclear attack during a crisis. The drills follow massive Russian war games along its borders with the alliance, including a test of new nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile , as well as increasing reports of electronic and cyber attacks likely originating in Russia. On Oct. 16, 2017, NATO personnel in Belgium and Germany kicked off this latest iteration of the alliance’s main nuclear deterrence exercise, nicknamed Steadfast Noon. Publicly available U.S. military documents describe its main goal simply as “operations plan validation.” This year’s iteration involves operations at Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium and Büchel Air Base in Germany, where the United States maintains stores of B61 nuclear bombs . The North Atlantic bloc rarely highlights the event and generally omits it from publicly available lists of upcoming exercises. The drills involve an entirely “fictional scenario,” one anonymous NATO official told The Wall Street Journal . It’s hard not to see the exercise in the context of the Kremlin’s increasingly revanchist foreign policy, though. Since Russian troops seized control Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and subsequently began actively supporting separatists seeking to break away from the central government in Kiev, NATO has adopted an increasingly more militarized posture along its eastern and southern frontiers. A proposed drawdown of American nuclear weapons on the continent has effectively been on indefinite hold ever since. A German Tornado multi-role combat aircraft., Bundeswehr In September 2017, approximately 13,000 troops from Russia and Belarus, conducted drills along the same borders as part of the Zapad 2017 exercise . Zapad, which means “West,” occurs once every four years. Officials in Moscow insist it is defensive in nature, but it focuses on large scale, high intensity warfare, something that sounds a lot like practicing for a conflict with the western alliance. In addition, the Russians followed up the massive conventional demonstration with a show of nuclear force, including intercontinental ballistic missile tests by its Strategic Missile Forces. One of these involved a weapon with an all-new warhead design that seems intended to defeat ballistic missile shields such as the one the NATO is presently developing. Though experts debate how serious the danger is , there is a real concern that the Kremlin has adopted a doctrine of “ escalating to de-escalate ,” as well, which could involve a limited nuclear strike, further underscoring the continued importance of deterrence. On top of that, there have also been an increasing number of reported incidents of electronic and cyber harassment against alliance members and their other European partners. These almost certainly originate in Russia and highlight the tense nature of the situation despite the lack of any active conflict. We don’t know what exactly goes into the actual Steadfast Noon drills, regardless of whether the scenario is focused on Russian threats or not, but the main goal is undoubtedly to run through what can only be heavily regimented procedures. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has kept B61 nuclear gravity bombs at bases such as Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium and Büchel Air Base in Germany. There are approximately 150 to 200 of the weapons spread out between those bases, as well as additional locations in Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, with the latter location becoming increasingly controversial . The bombs are technically “tactical nuclear weapons,” though experts and advocates routinely debate the validity of this term and whether any nuclear weapon can be seen as a limited, tactical tool. Crews can set the tactical versions of the so-called “dial-a-yield” B61 to explode with the force of anywhere from 0.3 to 170 kilotons of TNT, that upper limit being more than eight times more powerful than the Fat Man bomb the United States dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. The United States is presently working on a new B61 Mod 12 version that will be a dual-purpose, tactical and strategic design that incorporates a GPS guidance system and a deep penetrating design. As well as keeping those weapons forward deployed, the U.S. government maintained agreements with all of the hosts, save Turkey, to potentially share those bombs in an emergency. After an American commander released the weapons to those countries, Belgian and Dutch F-16 fighter jets and German and Italian Tornado multi-role combat aircraft – described as “dual-capable” conventional and nuclear aircraft for treaty purposes – would deliver them onto the specified targets. There are no American aircraft stationed at either Kleine Brogel or Büchel. For the alliance to conduct a nuclear attack, American personnel at these bases would need to receive and input the appropriate codes into the B61’s Permissive Action Link , a fail-safe device to prevent unauthorized use, before then signing control of the weapons over to European crews. A simultaneous authorization from the host country’s government is reportedly necessary, too. Weapons Storage and Security System vault in raised position holding a B61 nuclear bomb, adjacent to an F-16. The vault is within a Protective Aircraft Shelter., USAF The exercise likely has conventional components, as well, since any nuclear-armed jets speeding toward their targets could need to refuel on the way to and from their targets. Since the present European dual-capable aircraft aren’t low-observable in design, other elements would need to clear the way first, which could include physically destroying enemy air defenses or launching coordinated electronic or cyber attacks to disrupt those networks. NATO even has a specific term for the aerial companion missions, SNOWCAT , or Support of Nuclear Operations With Conventional Air Tactics. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qj4xIR8tYyQ But the lack of fanfare surrounding Steadfast Noon, which by all accounts should be a very visible signal to potential enemies, highlights the alliance’s complicated relations with nuclear weapons. NATO has long had to tempter its clear desire to present a strong deterrent to potential opponents, especially an increasingly aggressive Russia, with consistent domestic political and public opposition to the presence of nuclear weapons in much of Europe. Belgian F-16AM fighter jets., Belgian Defense That the B61 gravity bombs at Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium and Büchel Air Base in Germany are the property of the United States only makes the situation more complicated. The exercise is a “delicate balancing act,” another anonymous official told The Journal . These issues aren’t new, of course. For decades during the Cold War, the U.S. military stockpiled and deployed a variety of nuclear bombs and missiles in NATO member countries to deter the Soviet Union, which did the same, along with its Warsaw Pact allies. France and the United Kingdom were the only other alliance members with their own nuclear arsenals. Aircraft carrying nuclear bombs was a key component of the doctrine, as Richard Crandall explained to The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway in 2016, telling him : I was absolutely convinced I would have to nuke a Warsaw Pact nation, as that was about all we could hit with the F-111. We had a couple of targets in Russia where we would have had to recover with emergency fuel at one of the far northern bases in Norway. But really, we all knew the base would be gone and we would have to punch out. We also knew that we would not be the first nuke on the target. Every single target I ever saw had ICBMs and then SLBMs and then us on it, and then hours and hours later, the stateside B-52s and B-1s. We always practiced World War III as starting conventional, usually with the Russians punching through the Fulda Gap. I remember looking at the plans and seeing that we had a handful of tanks to stop them, compared to thousands of Russian and East German tanks lined up just waiting to punch through. We would fall back, and back, and then stand down, load up the nukes, and then sortie. Exercise over. Treaties and the final collapse of the Soviet Union meant that by the time the United States signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, with Russia in 2010, the B61s were the last of these U.S. weapons in Europe. And despite the fact that it is widely accepted that the bombs are there, both the United States and NATO decline to comment on them as a matter of policy. “I think they are an absolutely pointless part of a tradition in military thinking,” former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said in a National Geographic documentary released in 2013, becoming one of the more senior officials to ever acknowledge the bombs presence in NATO countries. “I would never have thought those silly things would still be there in 2013.” Dutch F-16 fighter jets, some of which are “dual-capable” and able to perform NATO’s nuclear mission., The Netherlands Ministry of Defense Most recently, the stockpile of B61s in Turkey came under renewed scrutiny following a coup attempt in 2016 that involved many members of that country’s air force, including some of that service’s top leadership. Turkish authorities arrested the commander of Icirlik Air Base, where the U.S. keeps the bombs, in the aftermath of the crisis. At the time, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway highlighted the potential dangers of maintaining what many consider to be largely a symbolic stockpile in that country, writing : The idea of a country stealing nuclear weapons from the US has long been a staple of pop culture fascination, but the reality is far less sensational. Still, an incident where American nuclear weapons security was directly threatened could be a massive geopolitical failure for the United States, and if they were to fall into someone else’s hands, even those of a close former ally, it would be devastating to American credibility abroad, regardless of if they can actually be used or not. On the other hand, if their withdrawal were made public, some say it would set a bad precedent and offer disturbing symbolism for NATO. Then again, if the alliance is that weak, than we have much bigger problems, especially considering that there would still be around 150 American nuclear bombs deployed to four other NATO countries. Will 50 less make that big of a difference? No it won’t. That is unless the US plans to leave a standing contingent of fighters at Incirlik Air Base with crews trained and ready to fly these weapons into combat at a moment’s notice, which it doesn’t. One alternative to keeping those bombs in Turkey, and elsewhere in general, would be to continue expanding ballistic missile defenses throughout NATO, which the alliance is already doing. Earlier in October 2017, before Steadfast Noon, NATO forces conducted a major ballistic missile defense exercise called Formidable Shield 2017 . The scenario for this drill involved the first-ever instance where the alliances ships practices using traditional air defenses to protect ship-based ballistic missile defenses, demonstrating an expanding layered, integrated defensive network. During the exercise, the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Donald Cook fired an SM-3 Block IB interceptor at mock ballistic missile, while Spanish and Dutch warships knocked down incoming anti-ship cruise missiles with RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles. Separately, another Arleigh Burke , the USS McFaul , conducted a European test launch of the increasingly versatile SM-6 missile . USS Donald Cook fires an SM-3 Block IB missile during Formidable Shield 2017., USN The U.S. Missile Defense Agencies had two of its specially modified Gulfstream II business jets on hand for the exercise, as well. Able to fly at high altitudes, these aircraft carry various sensors to help gather data on tests for future research and development that personnel on the ground or other lower flying planes would be unable to collect. The issue here of course is that ballistic missile defense systems have yet to conclusively prove their capabilities in testing , let alone against a real world in-coming threat. In addition to often limited engagement envelopes, the interceptors rely on data from various space-, sea-, and land-based radars, as well as other sensors, which have vulnerabilities and deficiencies themselves at present. These limitations have come to the forefront in light of the increasing threat of North Korea’s long-range ballistic missiles and growing nuclear weapons capabilities. Critics quickly debunked U.S. President Donald Trump’s assertion earlier in October 2017 that America’s ballistic missile defense shield could reliable take out threats 97 percent of the time. Perhaps more problematic, even if the component systems work as intended, missile defense shields only protect against a select few nuclear delivery systems. Russia alone has nuclear capable aircraft and is developing ground-launched nuclear-tipped cruise missiles , as well, neither of which a ballistic missile interceptor would be well suited to protect against. As such, they would not be a complete counter to potential nuclear attacks as a whole and it would be hard to see how they could ever truly replace the deterrent capability of nuclear weapons. Another alternative to American nuclear weapons in Europe would be to allow other NATO members to develop their own national stockpiles. However, one of the main arguments for the U.S. military keeping the B61s across Europe in the first place is to give alliance members that sense of localized security without the need to actually expand the number of nuclear weapon states. Neither the United States nor countries such as Belgium and Germany seem inclined to change this status quo. Given the available options, NATO members seem inclined to want to keep the bombs on their territory, even as they try to keep the fact out of the public eye. There are already reports that Italy and the Netherlands plan to integrate the B61 on their future F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in order to maintain their ability to perform the nuclear mission. There is the suggestion that this is one the reasons why Belgium is part of that program and the capability will likely be a consideration as Germany looks to replace its Tornados , as well. Unless a truly viable alternative appears or the security situation in Europe changes dramatically, it seems likely that the B61s, and the need to train for the hopefully remote possibility that NATO members could need to use them, will continue to be an open secret.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A loss of GPS coverage in Norway and an outage in cellular and emergency cellular services in Latvia, both are part of a growing and worrying trend of reported electronic warfare , as well as cyber attacks , in and around NATO member states in Europe. The incidents both occurred during the largest Russian military exercises in years, suggesting that the Kremlin may have used these drills to more actively demonstrate its expanding hybrid warfighting techniques , all of which offer ways to harass the alliance and other countries with relatively little risk of setting off an actual conflict. On Aug. 30, 2017, Latvia experienced a major cellular network outage in the western portion of the country, which sits along the Baltic Sea. Another incident, where the country’s 112 emergency telephone hotline , equivalent to America’s 911, was out for approximately 16 hours, occurred on Sept. 13, 2017. In between, on Sept. 7, 2017, commercial aircraft flying over Norway’s East Finnmark district reported a complete loss of GPS signal over a prolonged period. “Our authorities are analyzing a pattern of communications disruption that appears to have originated during the Zapad exercise,” Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in October 2017, adding that the country’s intelligence services were investigating the apparent electronic attacks, according to The Washington Post . “This was a demonstration of muscle. This was not defensive but offensive.” The Russian military holds the Zapad military maneuvers together with Belarusian forces every four years. Though the Kremlin insists the overarching scenario across the Western Military District is always defensive in nature, NATO sees the drills, the name of which translates literally as “West,” as a show of force along the land and sea boundaries with both the alliance and its non-member European partners, namely Sweden and Finland . The Russian Krasukha-2 electronic warfare system., Russian Ministry of Defense Moscow said the 2017 iteration involved approximately 13,000 troops from Russia and Belarus. The Russian military conducted a number of other exercises elsewhere in the country during and after, including another major annual exercise involving the country’s Strategic Missile Forces . Still, Rinkevics suggested that Latvia might have actually been an inadvertent victim of a Russian electronic barrage pointed at Sweden’s Öland Island, which sits opposite Latvia across the Baltic Sea. Similarly, the Norwegian Intelligence Service , a military intelligence arm also known as the Forsvarets Etterretningstjeneste or E-tjenesten , did not believe that the GPS jamming was directed at the country specifically, according to the country’s state-run NKR radio service . East Finnmark is situated along the border with both Finland and Russia. That even state intelligence services have had difficulty in determining the source of the jamming and whether or not it was deliberate, highlights how effective these tactics can be even during an uneasy peace. With electronic and cyber assaults, Russia has found an effective way to disrupt the military and government activities of its regional opponents while maintaining a surprising amount of plausible deniability . Regardless, that the Russian military’s electronic warfare, cyber attacks, and other hybrid capabilities might have been part of Zapad 2017, which officially ran from Sept. 14 to 20, is hardly a surprise. For years now, the Kremlin has been focusing on expanding its ability to conduct these types of operations, in no small part as a means offsetting its limited ability to field expensive advanced weapon systems . Russia’s forces have a wide array of ground and aerial electronic warfare systems mounted on variety of wheeled and tracked vehicles, aircraft, and unmanned aircraft. “Because of maneuver warfare’s reliance on communication, Russia has invested heavily in electronic warfare systems which are capable of shutting down communications and signals across a broad spectrum,” the U.S. Army’s Asymmetric Warfare Group warned in a handbook it published in December 2016. “The Russians layer these systems to shut down FM, SATCOM [satellite communication], cellular, GPS, and other signals.” And whether it was deliberately targeted toward them or not, what the Latvians and the Norwegians reported is well in line with these core Russian military capabilities. Russia’s electronic warfare troops could easily have established positions along the country’s western borders, nominally for mock attacks within their own territory, but knowing full well that the range of the systems meant they would have an observable real world impact. Though there are well established reports of Russian troops using electronic warfare and cyber attacks in Ukraine and Syria , the Kremlin would be understandably eager to gather information about how its systems perform against countries, especially NATO members, with more technologically advanced communications and navigation networks. Zapad 2017 would have provided an ideal opportunity for such tests. There is evidence that Russian military and intelligence services have already been probing NATO members’ responses to these capabilities. Earlier in October 2017, American and other alliance troops in the Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – and Poland revealed they had been the victims of a variety of cyber attacks against their cell phones and social media accounts. Hackers combed through personal details, deleted contacts, uploaded songs, and remotely triggered software. After the breaches some service members reportedly had interactions with apparent Russian agents who knew a worrying amount of information about them and their families. This mirrors reports from Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have apparently begun to use data gathered from cyber attacks to threaten individual Ukrainian troops, their significant others, and their children. “Tactics such as this can have a tremendously negative psychological impact on young soldiers that are out of direct contact with their loved ones,” the Asymmetric Warfare Group noted in their December 2016 handbook. A soldier mans one of the terminals inside a Krasukha-4 electronic warfare vehicle during an exercise., Pavel Lisitsyn/Sputnik via AP The potential for these types of attacks to significant disrupt both military and other activities is obvious. Knocking out cell phones during a crisis would slow the ability of a country’s authorities to disseminate important information to its citizens. Preventing people from calling for help, especially if coupled with attacks on critical infrastructure or even a natural disaster, could be devastating. The U.S. Army’s Asymmetric Warfare Group, which has the task of researching emerging threats and ways to defeat them, says similar attacks on military communications infrastructure could easily cripple a mission. The same goes for GPS, which American forces rely on not only for getting from point A to point B, but also for directing precision guided munitions. GPS disruption isn’t limited to jamming, either. There are increasing reports that the Russians have been expanding their ability to spoof the system’s signals, point receivers at the wrong locations. In June 2017, we reported on the U.S. Maritime Administration’s report about such incidents in the Black Sea in which ships’ navigation equipment was showing their location miles inland. Other reports of location errors had earlier cropped up in Moscow among players of the popular cell phone game Pokemon Go, which relies on a mobile device’s GPS-enabled location services. “The U.S. reliance on robust communication infrastructure and GPS navigation means that a sudden interruption of this capability, even for a short duration, can be disastrous to an operation,” the Asymmetric Warfare Group’s December 2016 manual explained. “Even combat and fire support would prove to be a problem due to the possibility of fratricide, especially if close to Russian front line positions.” Russia’s Il-22PP electronic warfare aircraft., Alexey Kudenko/Sputnik  via AP After the Black Sea reports appeared, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway explained in detail how spoofing could be even more dangerous than just knocking out the signal, writing : Advanced guidance and navigation systems, like those found on aircraft and in most GPS-guided weapons, use inertial navigation with embedded GPS. System software loaded onto the INS/GPS guidance system uses algorithms to detect discrepancies among various steams of information. This way the system can place less priority on one stream of information, say from a malfunctioning ring-laser gyro or GPS receiver, than others. Or it can discount that steam entirely if it starts straying far from the consensus of the others. This way a navigation system that suddenly loses a component due to failure or has one of its data streams deviate for other reasons won’t simply stop working. For instance, if the GPS telemetry suddenly leaps miles away, the navigation system may “vote out” the GPS information entirely. The system will be less accurate overall because of it, but it will still function. As an example, take a Joint Direct Attack Munition, the most common guided bomb used by the USAF, which uses GPS and INS navigation. If the system suddenly loses GPS connectivity during its attack sequence, INS will take over, but the bomb will be substantially less accurate than it would have been with both GPS and INS working together as a team. But spoofing isn’t as simple as telling a GPS receiver it is somewhere totally different than where it really is. By broadcasting false GPS data that slowly changes over time, navigational systems with GPS and INS may not “throw out” the GPS data so soon, or at all for that matter. Over time this could result in vehicles going far off course or even running into shores, mountains or even other vehicles without warning. Some say this is how the Iranians brought down the RQ-170 Sentinel drone in a relatively intact state in late November 2011, although this remains highly debatable. Even if the spoofing doesn’t have any immediate effects, the knowledge that it is or could be occurring could easily lead to a loss of confidence in those systems, as well. Commanders may be more hesitate to employ a GPS-directed bomb or rocket, especially near friendly forces, if there is any concern that it could fall on the wrong target due to jamming or another form of electronic warfare. This in turn could greatly limit the fire support options available to American forces or their allies. It’s one of the reasons why the U.S. military as a whole is becoming increasingly interested in guided weapons that still work in “ GPS-denied ” environments, as well as re-emphasizing basic map-and-compass land navigation skills. In June 2016, the U.S. Navy conducted an apparent test of what a major GPS outage might look like for American forces. There is even an indication that the American forces are beginning to be increasingly interested in developing their own so-called “navigation warfare” capabilities, which is defined, in part, as “degrading, disrupting, or deceptively manipulating PNT [positioning, navigation, and timing] transmissions,” according to one official U.S. Central Command regulation we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. Just on Oct. 13, 2017, the U.S. Navy announced it would pay Northrop Grumman nearly $8.9 million to devise and install an unspecified navigation warfare system onto some of the service’s E-2D Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft. An official US miliary definition of electronic warfare as it applies to navigation warfare., US Central Command via FOIA We don’t know when that equipment will be ready or whether the service plans to make the modifications across the Hawkeye. Navigation warfare also encompasses methods to defend against jamming or spoofing, so it is possible this equipment will protect the radar planes rather than offer a means for attack opponents. Either way, its another indication of the growing importance of the issue. It is increasingly obvious that the Russian systems. and the threat they pose, are out there now, though. They also offer the Kremlin a relatively low risk means to probe or otherwise harass its opponents without touching off an actual conflict, as is the case with cyber attacks, since it can be difficult for authorities to isolate the source of the jamming or spoofing and the actual intent. As with cyber breaches, it seems likely that reports of these types of electronic disruptions in NATO countries and the alliance’s non-member partners in Europe, will increasingly become the norm, whether or not the attacks are deliberate or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Has The Iraqi Civil War Begun?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed militias aligned with the government in Baghdad have begun a massive military operation to wrest control of Kirkuk governorate from the country’s Kurdish Regional Government following a controversial referendum on a future independent Kurdistan. The move has left the United States and its anti-ISIS coalition desperately scrambling to de-escalate the situation, calling it just a “misunderstanding,” while at the same time still trying to avoid publicly taking a side in a conflict that could turn into an all out civil war or even a regional crisis. Iraqi troops began the offensive overnight on Oct. 15, 2017, and claimed to have ejected the Kurdish Regional Government’s (KRG) own security forces, known as the Peshmerga, from major oil fields to the south of Kirkuk city, as well as the province’s main military base. Active fighting between the two parities, to include an exchange of artillery fire , reportedly resulted in dozens of casualties and the destruction of numerous military vehicles . The government in Baghdad also formally named Arab politician Rakan Saeed Al Jobouri to take over as governor of the province , the Iraqi parliament already having voted to remove the previous Kurdish official, Najmaldin Karim, ahead of the independence referendum in September 2017. In spite of this, the U.S.-led coalition said “these movements of military vehicles, so far, have been coordinated movements, not attacks,” in an official statement on Oct. 16, 2017. “We believe the engagement this morning was a misunderstanding and not deliberate as two elements attempted to link up under limited visibility conditions.” “We call on all parties to immediately cease military action and restore calm while we continue to work with officials from the central and regional governments to reduce tensions and avoid further clashes,” the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said in a statement. “We support the peaceful exercise of joint administration by the central and regional governments, consistent with the Iraqi Constitution, in all disputed areas.” In taking these positions, it appears that the United States is hoping to give both parties an opportunity to claim the fighting has been the result of confusion, not policy, and stop the shooting without losing face. This in turn would open the path up to renewed negotiations on how to settle the fate of Iraqi Kurdistan following an overwhelmingly positive response to a referendum calling for independence from the rest of Iraq in September 2017. There are unconfirmed reports that the U.S.-led coalition has instituted a no-fly zone over Iraqi Kurdistan. Officially, the United States has no involved itself directly in the dispute, though, and any prohibition on Iraqi Air Force activities had not impeded forces on the ground from pursuing their objectives. However, both sides have already received significant training and military equipment from the U.S. military and its partners The American diplomatic ploy might have worked when both sides were simply in a tense standoff. Unfortunately, the Iraqi government has made it perfectly clear that this is not a “misunderstanding” and that it is simply making good on threats to act it made weeks ago after it rushed to impose an economic blockade already aimed at strangling the region into submission. It has become increasingly clear that the very ability of a “peaceful exercise of joint government” to continue existing at all in Kirkuk and potentially other areas of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, is at the core of the dispute. “We showed them [the Kurds] the magnitude of the danger that will be exposed to Iraq and its people, but they preferred their personal and partisan interests to those of Iraq, with its Arab and Kurdish people and the rest of its components,” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi said in an official statement. “We have only acted to fulfill our constitutional duty to extend the federal authority and impose security and protect the national wealth in this city, which we want to remain a city of peaceful coexistence for all Iraqis.” The thousands of Kurds fleeing north from Kirkuk clearly do not feel there has been any confusion on the part of the government in Baghdad. The Peshmerga’s top General Command described the Iraqi push into the province as “a flagrant declaration of war.” Video of an Iraqi U.S.-made M1 Abrams tank knocking off a billboard depicting KRG President Masoud Barzani only underscores the true nature of the situation, as do unconfirmed reports of Iran-backed militiamen beheading captured Pershmerga . The U.S. government’s long-standing position that all parties in Iraq should remain focused on defeating ISIS and that the Kurdish poll was a dangerous distraction from this shared cause, has only made it harder for it to influence either side, too. American officials have repeatedly deflected on whether or not they believe that an independent Kurdistan is either viable or in the United States’ interests now or in the future. Earlier in October 2017, the United States allowed a deal where it paid the salaries of Peshmerga fighters to lapse , calling into question its commitments to the KRG. Though the terrorist group will likely remain a significant security threat for the foreseeable future, the rapid collapse of ISIS’ physical “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria has reduced the immediacy of that threat . The situation had definitely begun to stabilize enough for the KRG to see an opportunity to make a serious push for independence and for Iraqi authorities to feel they could divert significant military resources to help in suppressing the results. Iraqi Federal Police snipers training during a US-sponsored exercise in May 2017., US Army The longer the U.S. government waits to either publicly take a side, or even admonish both sides, the more politically complex the situation will get, something we at The War Zone had warned was a distinct possibility right after the independence vote. In September 2017, I wrote : If the referendum does pass, the United States could then find itself compelled to take a position on Kurdish self-determination and the future of the region, whether it wants to or not, even if only tacitly. Facing a unified front from Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Russia, with even Israel staying silent, the U.S. government may feel it has little option but to turn on the Kurds once again or risk getting embroiled in a major conflict it has no desire to be a part of, at least according to the past statements from the State Department and the Pentagon. Without American support, there’s a real question about whether the KRG could reasonably hope to survive the economic or military pressure from the forces already converging on it. In addition, not supporting the Kurds, might embolden the United States’ opponents and give the appearance that the U.S. government is unwilling to challenge Russian and Iranian hegemony in Iraq, which would be politically problematic at home . That last point is particularly important given President Donald Trump’s recent unveiling of a new U.S. government policy toward Iran on Oct. 13, 2017, which included designated that country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. It’s no secret that that Iran, but way of the IRGC, has been actively advising and aiding the Iraqi military and supporting state-sanctioned predominately Shia Muslim militias commonly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) or the Al Hashd Al Shaabi. The PMF, as well as the Iraqi Federal Police, another organization with long-standing ties to the IRGC and Shia militias, have been at the forefront of the Kirkuk operation, though regular Iraqi Army and elite Counter Terrorism service personnel have also been involved. The KRG appears to be hoping to play off this by highlighting this Iranian backing in nearly all of its official statements on the situation, as well as pointing out their use of American-supplied weaponry. This is an obvious implication that officials in Baghdad are diverting aid to groups the U.S. government considers terrorists, something many observers have highlighted in the past. The Trump Administration could find itself in a political conundrum whereby choosing not to unequivocally support the Kurds effectively puts it on the same side of the argument as Iran and the IRGC. This in turn could undermine Trump’s stated goals in constraining Iranian influence in the Middle East and elsewhere and become a major domestic political issue. There are already reports that American personnel, including special operations forces, may be in danger of getting caught up in the fighting. But to make things even more complicated, though the Kurds have denied this is the case, there are unconfirmed reports, video, and pictures that suggest the Peshmerga has called upon the support of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Better known by its Kurdish acronym PKK, both Turkey and the United States have officially designated this Turkish Kurdish faction as a terrorist group. One video reportedly shows a Humvee flying the group’s flag and carrying a picture of Abdullah Öcalan, its leader, who is currently in prison in Turkey. American and Turkish officials have already sparred rhetorically over U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish factions, commonly known as the People’s Protection Units or YPG, which Turkey says are simply another arm of the PKK. The U.S. military has repeatedly insisted that the two Kurdish groups are not formally linked and that the Syrian Kurds do not represent a threat to Turkish interests. Turkey categorically disagrees and has already threatened to invade Iraqi Kurdistan in coordination with officials in Baghdad in response to the referendum. In addition, Turkish troops have recently begun taking up positions in northern Syria to block the expanding influence of the YPG as part of a Russian-backed plan for “ de-escalation zones .” Turkish tanks take up positions along the Syrian border in 2014., Mauricio Morales/Sipa USA via AP Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, with direct help from his Russian and Iranian benefactors, has similarly made significant gains against ISIS and its domestic opponents as of late. This has directly threatened American forces in the country and challenged the U.S. government’s ability to have any say in the future of the Assad regime or the nature of governance in the country’s northwestern regions that its Kurdish and Arab partners have liberated from the terrorists. With all this in mind, it is hard to overstate the potential for a far larger and more dangerous regional conflict to grow out of this emerging, localized skirmish in Kirkuk. Though the U.S. government is undoubtedly working behind the scenes to try and stop the fighting and reduce tensions before it gets to that point, those efforts are undercut somewhat by public pronouncements that sound detached from the reality on the ground. What happens in Iraq, as well as Syria, after ISIS ceases to be an immediate danger is something we at The War Zone have been concerned about for some time, and is surely a question the United States should have been thinking long and hard about before now. As Iraqi and Kurdish forces began to push into Mosul, one of the terrorist group’s major Iraqi strongholds, in July 2017, we wrote : Finally, there remains the question of how Iraq will find peace once ISIS no longer holds territory within its borders. With Iranian-backed Shiite militias, U.S.-backed Kurds, and the Iraqi Army itself empowered and armed like never before, can Iraq keep itself from falling into civil war? And what is America’s plan should that occur…or is there one at all? If the United States continues to find itself unable or unwilling to take a stronger position, it may be difficult, if not impossible to contain the many agendas of the myriad actors already involved in the crisis, none of whom appear to be inclined at present to back down.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",An Explainer On How The Trump Administration Just Changed US Policy Toward Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has revealed a new, overarching American policy strategy toward Iran, which includes refusing to certify the controversial deal over the country’s nuclear program and new sanctions that formally label an entire portion of the Iranian government, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a terrorist organization. The announcement has already prompted criticism from the Trump Administration’s domestic opponents, foreign allies, and unsurprisingly the government in Tehran and its international partners, and will undoubtedly have massive ramifications in the months to come. Trump announced the major policy shift in a speech at the White House on Oct. 13, 2017. The plan is an apparent culmination of a much repeated campaign promise to hold Iran accountable and get rid of the Iran Deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA . Trump has repeated slammed the agreement, most recently characterizing it as “one of the most incompetently drawn deals I’ve ever seen” in an interview with Fox News’ Shawn Hannity. “We hope that these new measures directed at the Iranian dictatorship will compel the government to reevaluate its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people,” Trump said in his speech . “We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East – a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own citizens.” Limited by what it is legally able to do without going through Congress, the Trump Administration only made two main policy decisions immediately. Each one is significant, though, so here’s a quick overview. On the Iran Deal: Under the terms of the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which Congress passed ahead of the final JCPOA agreement in July 2015, the president has to report to legislators that the Iranian government is holding up its end of the bargain in continuing exchange for a reduction in U.S. sanctions on the country. Trump, for the first time as President, says he will not recertify the deal, stating “I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.” Trump stated that he is doing this since, even though his own cabinet says that Iran is abiding by the letter of the JCPOA, it is not living up to the “spirit” of the agreement. The administration says Iran is violating the spirit of the deal, which specifically sought to improve “regional and international peace and security,” though a variety of actions, including continuing its provocative ballistic missile development efforts , supporting hostile foreign actors and those the U.S. government has designated as terrorist groups , harassing American military personnel , threats toward Israel , and continuing to restrict the freedoms of its own people and foreigners who travel to the country. None of these issues were addressed as part of the original scope of the JCPOA. In addition to declining to recertify the deal, which Trump has already done twice since taking office in January 2017, he announced his intention to work with Congress to “fix” the terms of the JCPOA. Trump stated that legislators are already drafting a new law to strengthen the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which would, in particular link certification of the agreement directly to a halt in the country’s ballistic missile programs. At present, the JCPOA does not specifically address these issues Should the Trump Administration not be able to “fix” the Iran Deal, in consultation with Congress and America’s allies – there is no specific mention of renegotiating the deal with Iran – the president has said “then the agreement will be terminated.” The State Department has already publicly insisted that Trump’s announcement does not equate to a decision to abrogate the deal, despite his clear threat to do so in the future if Iran doesn’t meet the United States’ demands. Sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other Iranian entities: Founded in the immediate aftermath of Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is powerful government entity that operates both as a parallel security organization to the country’s military and a major operator of state-owned economic interests and has the stated goal of defending the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his overarching authority. In addition, it coordinates and provides active support to numerous state security forces and non-state actors, including organizations that many consider terrorist groups, such as the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Hezbollah . In 2007, President George W. Bush’s administration designated the Quds Force , a portion of the IRGC which is known to work directly with Hamas and Hezbollah, as a terrorist organization. The Trump Administrations’ new sanctions designate the entire arm of the Iranian government, which answers straight to Iran’s Supreme Leader, as a terrorist organization. In the Treasury Department’s own press release , Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin specifically cited the IRGC’s work with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, Hamas, and Hezbollah as the underlying reasons for the designation. Under the provisions of Executive Order 13224 , which President Bush issued following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Treasury has the authority to freeze U.S.-based assets of any designated group and any individuals or organizations engaging with financially with that entity. The government can seek to prosecute any U.S. national for continuing to conduct transactions with sanctioned entities The move to designate the Quds Force as a terrorist organization in 2007 was already unprecedented and the U.S. has never before sanctioned an entire uniformed military service in a foreign country in this way. Given IRGC’s extensive economic enterprises, the new designation was accompanied by sanctions on four other entities, Shahid Alamolhoda Industries, the Rastafann Ertebat Engineering Company, and Fanamoj. All of these organizations have connections to the IRGC and Iran’s cruise and ballistic missile programs. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the China-based Wuhan Sanjiang Import and Export Company Limited for its connections to Iran’s Shiraz Electronics Industries, a state-run defense contractor that the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics owns and operates, and that again has done work pursuant to Iran’s ballistic missile programs. Beyond these immediate actions, Trump reaffirmed previous policy positions, including the need to constrain Iran and prevent it from gaining more influence in the Middle East and beyond, neutralizing proxies, and work with regional and global allies toward a comprehensive approach to achieving these goals. Similar pronouncements had been a key part of Trump’s major policy speech during his first overseas trip as president, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in May 2017. Iran makes no secret about providing support to Hamas, Hezbollah, Yemeni Houthi rebels , Shia Muslim militias in Iraq and Syria, and other entities that are overtly hostile to U.S. interests and have sought to attack the United States and its interests at home and abroad. Iranian officials do routinely threaten to destroy Israel in no uncertain terms and its ballistic missiles are as clear an indication as any that they intend to make these pronouncements credible.  The government regularly imprisons journalists and other political dissidents and jails foreigners effectively as a means of extracting concessions from its domestic and overseas opponents. It is definitely fair to question why the JCPOA fails to take any of these issues into account and that it does not has been a long-standing point of criticism of the agreement. Also particularly noteworthy, an official White House fact sheet on Trump’s announcement said that the “United States policy has also consistently prioritized the immediate threat of Sunni extremist organizations over the longer-term threat of Iranian-backed militancy.” The president himself did not actually mention the word “Sunni” in his remarks. Below is a video of President Trump’s complete speech on his administration’s new Iran strategy. Though an obvious reference to the U.S. government’s focus on Sunni Islamist organizations such as Al Qaeda and ISIS, this could easily be aimed at generating support from other American allies, chiefly Saudi Arabia , as well. Experts have long accused the Saudis of supporting Sunni terrorist groups, including those who seek to attack the United States and Israel, as a means of advancing its own policy agenda . Iran routinely counters criticism of its own activities by pointing at support from the government in Riyadh to these groups in countries such as Syria. International reaction to the new United States policy push was swift and largely negative, even from traditional American allies. The governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, all of whom were part of the JCPOA negotiations, issued a joint statement saying that they were “concerned” by Trump’s stance. “Preserving the JCPOA is in our shared national security interest,” the statement read. “We encourage the U.S. Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the U.S. and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.” Russia said it “ took with regret ” the announcement, but hoped the U.S. government would not take additional steps to undermine the agreement. China, the final member of the P5+1 bloc that negotiated the Iran Deal, had earlier come out against any changes to the JCPOA. This effectively lumps some of America’s most prominent allies together with its two principle global rivals in opposition to the new policies. The European triumvirate did say they hoped to work separately with the United States on limiting Iran’s missile programs and the influence of the IRGC, which they agreed was a shared security concern. It’s hard to say exactly how significant the policy shift will be, but it’s hard to imagine it will not lead to American allies and opponents reassessing their own positions and other agreements. Iran has already reacted angrily to the news, with some Iranian politicians saying their country should pull out of the deal if the United States does. For his part, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani pledged to continue abiding by the agreement as Iran understands it. Short of pulling out of the Iran Deal, the Trump administration could seek to apply even more new sanctions or threaten some form of military action, offering to negotiate only if Iranian authorities conclusively halt their ballistic missile programs and end support for terrorists and militants abroad. Instead of touching the nuclear deal at all, the U.S. government could also try and separate certain issues, such as missile development or international terrorism, by applying specific sanctions regimes based on Iran’s actions surrounding those issues. This would leave the nuclear deal untouched, but would still put new pressure on Iran to curtail its aggressive actions abroad and its missile programs at home. In the meantime, though, Trump’s announcements will serve to reinforce the rhetoric of the most hard line factions in Iran’s government, who see the United States as perpetually negotiating in bad faith. It definitely fuels the regime’s propaganda that it is actually the U.S. government that is being unreasonable and irrational and is a real threat to stability in the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 20, 2017., Anthony Behar/Sipa USA via AP On top of that, the decision to designate the IRGC as a terrorist group could easily open American personnel up to similar designations from hostile powers, who could then claim legal justification for detaining them abroad, or worse. Syria’s Assad has already criticized the presence of U.S. forces on his territory as illegal. Beyond Iran, there could be a direct impact on the U.S. government’s attempts to pressure North Korea to abandon its own provocative nuclear and ballistic missile programs. North Korean Premier Kim Jong-un could already see what had happened to Iraq and Libya, who abandoned these projects under U.S.-championed international agreements. Trump backing out of the Iran deal would only reaffirm the view that giving up these weapons is a prelude to violent regime change. If the Iran Deal were to collapse, it would remove the only present impediment, no matter how weak, to Iran resuming an active and open nuclear weapons program. This in turn could easily prompt calls, in America and Israel in particular, for preemptive military action to neutralize this threat. There has been a not insignificant amount of public support from policy makers and politicians for strikes against Iranian nuclear and military sites in the past. We at The War Zone has already explored the heavily intertwined nature of present Middle Eastern geopolitics in detail and any attack on Iranian soil could easily turn into a regional conflagration, if not touch off even broader conflicts or political disputes. The Saudis already appear to be preparing for this with the purchase of a massive ballistic missile shield that will almost certainly be pointed at Iran. The immediate sanctions against the IRGC could lead Iran to authorize more direct covert activities or otherwise increase support to groups looking to attack Americans. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, at center, attends a graduation ceremony for IRGC cadets in 2014., Sipa via AP Earlier in October 2017 there was an ominous report that an explosively formed penetrator, a type of weapon that came to be a hallmark of Iranian-backed militants in Iraq during the 2000s, had claimed the life of another American service member in Iraq. This is exactly the sort of indirect action Iran could take in retaliation to the Trump Administration’s new policies or attempts to change or end the Iran Deal. Perhaps the most worrisome immediate impact of Trump’s policy announcement, which plainly says that “the Trump Administration will not repeat these mistakes [that the Obama Administration made],” is that it could easily force the administration into a rhetorical trap where it has to act or otherwise look like its backing down. The U.S. government now faces a daunting task of implementing the new plan, while also reassuring allies, not giving political ammunition to Iran and its partners, and still fulfilling its objectives.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Additional details that have emerged regarding an ambush in southwest Niger that left four U.S. Army soldiers dead continue to prompt more questions than they answer about the incident. The top American headquarters for military operations on the continent, U.S. Africa Command, has now confirmed that private contractors helped casualties evacuate the area afterwards, but has again declined to elaborate on the U.S.-Nigerien patrol’s overall objectives or who is responsible for the attack. The facts as they are known at present are that, on Oct. 4, 2017, two U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers and two other members of the service attached to elements of the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) in Niger died after their convoy came under attack from militants near the village of Tongo Tongo, near the border with Mali. A multi-national force of American, Nigerien, and French forces responded to the incident to help drive off the hostile force and rescue the remaining friendly personnel. One of the American soldiers killed in the incident was missing for two days before U.S. forces recovered his body and it remains unclear when and how he died. Private contractors working for Berry Aviation in Niger’s capital Niamey “were on alert during the incident and conducted casualty evacuation and transport for U.S. and partner forces,” Robyn Mack, a spokesperson for U.S Africa Command, or AFRICOM, told The War Zone in an Email. “Currently, Berry Aviation is the only contractor in Niger or Burkina Faso under CASEVAC [casualty evacuation] contract for U.S. Africa Command.” We don’t know what part of the process the company was involved in, whether it was moving casualties from Tongo Tongo to Niamey, between a third site and the Nigerien capital, or from there to the U.S. military’s Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Berry Aviation is presently fulfilling the terms of a three month bridge contract through the end of October 2017 that requires the firm to have one fixed wing aircraft and one helicopter situated in Niamey ready to go within three hours for operations throughout North and West Africa. According to Berry’s website, however, the company’s fleet only includes a variety of fixed wing aircraft, such as the de Havilland Canada Dash-8 and Twin Otter, both twin engine turbo-prop planes. It is unclear whether the firm also has helicopters or subcontracts to provide that service. Contracting documents for previous iterations of this arrangement do not specify the need for any particular aircraft by name or prohibit the use of third parties to meet its requirements. That the aircraft were on call and participated in the response efforts is an important detail. The ability of the U.S. military and contractors working on its behalf, or lack thereof, to rush to the rescue during the attack has been a point of significant scrutiny. A grainy picture of one of Berry Aviation’s Twin Otters at an unknown location., Berry Aviation Various reports had previously noted that French helicopters, likely flying in either from Niamey or their base in Gao in neighboring Mali, were able to respond relatively quickly, calling into question the preparedness of American forces in the region. Earlier in October 2017, sources told The New York Times that troops in Central Africa, where conditions are similar, understood that it might take up to 10 hours for a medical evacuation. Another simply said the time frame was “multiples” of the so-called “ golden hour ,” a term for the first sixty minutes after an individual suffers a traumatic, potentially life-threatening injury when medical personnel have the best chance to save them or otherwise avoid serious complications. Berry Aviation’s standard three-hour alert posture, which U.S. commanders could reduce to one hour with prior notification, underscores this issue. Under those parameters, the golden hour would be gone before the aircraft were even in the air in the best case scenario. “You’re never going to have the golden hour in Africa; it’s not possible,” retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Donald Bolduc, who led Special Operations Command Africa until June 2017, told The Times . “But you have an acceptable amount of time that commanders have agreed on.” It seems almost certain that these procedures are under review in light of the incident in Niger, which AFRICOM has already said is under investigation. Another issue will likely be the ability of dedicated rapid reaction elements to actually meet their operational requirements. The War Zone Make sure to check our updated interactive google map showing the U.S. military’s posture in Africa that posture in Africa After the infamous attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, the U.S. military established a variety of response units around the world. The U.S. Marine Corps stood up a so-called Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force, or SPMAGTF, equipped with MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors and KC-130 aerial tankers, in Spain on alert for contingencies in Africa.  Another company of Army troops formed the East Africa Response Force, paired up with U.S. Air Force aircraft in Djibouti. On top of that, various special operations forces are at the ready in a crisis. A team of U.S. Navy SEALs reportedly deployed to Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, Italy in preparation for possible movement onward to Niger. AFRICOM would not say whether it alerted the SPMAGTF for a possible mission or why the naval special operators did not ultimately travel to the West African country. “For operational security reasons, I cannot provide specific details regarding unit deployments,” Mack said in her Email. “We leveraged sufficient assets to safely and securely conduct personnel recovery operations,” she added. Beyond the response to the attack, AFRICOM has largely declined to explain why the American personnel have traveled to Tongo Tongo in the first place. Official statements and anonymous sources have described the mission variously as a ‘reconnaissance patrol,” part of existing advisory efforts, and a trip to meet with local leaders in support of counter terrorism operations, all activities that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. This video below, which shows footage from the annual Flintlock special operations exercise, which AFRICOM held in Niger in 2014, gives a sense of the U.S. military’s mission in the country. Reports that French forces were involved in the operation from the beginning and that the Nigerien personnel belonged to the specialized Bataillon Sécurité et Renseignement (BSR), or Security and Intelligence Battalion, have prompted speculation that the mission might’ve been part of an effort to locate one or more specific terrorists or militants or another larger operation. That one of the dead, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Johnson, as not a Special Forces soldier, but a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist attached to the team has also raised questions about whether the patrol could have a connection to Niger’s uranium mining industry. This seems unlikely given that AFRICOM has officially described its initial assessment of the mission as “low risk” and how far Tongo Tongo is from the country’s uranium mining centers to the northeast. Reports leading up to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 that suggested dictator Saddam Hussein had actively attempted to purchase refined, yellowcake uranium, from Niger turned out to be fabrications . That being said, in May 2013 , the terrorist group Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, claimed responsibility for two coordinated attacks on a Nigerien military base in Agadez and a French-operated uranium mine in Arlit. There was no indication that the operation in the latter location intended to steal any radioactive material, but it did apparently prompt the U.S. military to subsequently send forces to the city, where they are still reportedly active . In addition, a separate splinter group, led by the enigmatic Algerian terrorist Mokhtar Belmokhtar , a veteran of the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan and also known as “Mr. Marlboro” for his earlier smuggling activities in the region, may also have taken part in the 2013 attacks. Portions of these two entities later merged to form yet another group, Al-Mourabitoun, and some of those very seasoned fighters in turn took on the mantle of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, or ISGS in 2016. Many reports suggest that ISGS was responsible for the ambush near Tongo Tongo, but it doesn’t necessary mean there is any nuclear or radiological connection. A French special operator speaks to Nigerien troops during the 2014 iteration of the annual U.S.-run Flintlock special operations exercise., AFRICOM Regardless, as of 2014, the Army had attached a chemical reconnaissance detachment to each one of its Special Forces groups. “The chemical reconnaissance detachment conducts chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives … reconnaissance and sampling in permissive or uncertain environments,” according to one official manual . “The majority of our Special Operations missions require dedicated special operations forces and a team of non-special operations force enables in order to achieve success,” Mack explained. “Every mission is examined individually to ensure we have the right composition of personnel assigned to the team.” It still remains unclear whether Johnson had joined this particular mission specifically in order to provide his specific expertise or simply because of the need for additional manpower. Sergeant La David Johnson, a wheeled vehicle mechanic who was missing for two days before U.S. and partner forces found him dead, was another non-Special Forces soldier attached to 3rd Special Forces Group’s element in Niger who had gone on the mission as a driver. “We can’t get into a detailed breakdown [of U.S. forces in Niger],” Mack told The War Zone. “However I will tell you Special Forces make up a fraction of the overall force composition.” US Air Force special operations advisers replace the front wheel on their Toyota Land Cruiser after an accident near Niamey in 2011., USAF U.S. officials have generally declined to offer specifics about the operation or America’s overall military posture in Niger. There are reports that President Donald Trump and his administration are seeking to deny the group responsible any propaganda benefits from the brazen attack as they plan to retaliate . Any direct action would likely come in the form of either air or missile strikes or a special operations forces raid to kill or capture the individuals who planned the assault. We have seen both types of responses in the past. In June 2014, elite troops snatched  Abu Khattala, the alleged mastermind behind the Benghazi consulate attack, from his home in Libya and brought him back to the United States. His trial began on Oct. 2, 2017. In January 2017, President Barack Obama’s administration sent B-2 bombers to pound ISIS-affiliated fighters in Libya, following a brief conventional counter-terrorism operation in that country. The attack with one of America’s most advanced aircraft demonstrated the U.S. military’s ability to attack when and where it chooses and when its opponents least expect it. The Trump Administration is likely considering similar options, and the type of statement it might wish to make, while also working around possible limits to what it can do in Niger due to existing Status of Forces and other bi-lateral agreements. Nigerien and French forces have reportedly launched subsequent operations in the Tongo Tongo area themselves. Maybe the U.S. military will be more forthcoming with information about the incident and its overall activities in Niger after this response takes shape.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Listen To What American Diplomats in Cuba Heard During Those Crazy Sonic Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of investigations, the circumstances behind bizarre series of apparent sonic attacks on American diplomatic staff in Cuba, which left some individuals seriously injured, are as mysterious as ever. Now, The Associated Press has revealed the first public recording of what some sources say are the sounds they heard during the assaults. On Oct. 12, 2017, the wire service posted an enhanced version of the noise online, having only increased the volume and removed background noise. The report did not say where the recordings had come from specifically, beyond a site or sites in Cuba, but added that the U.S. Navy also had copies for analysis. Neither the Navy nor the State Department would confirm the authenticity of the audio. Cuban officials would not say whether they had their own copy. “That’s the sound,” one of AP’s sources said, according to its report. Beyond that, the entire episode, including how the attacks occurred and why, remains almost entirely unexplained. At the heart of the issue is the exact reason that the wire service can safely post the clip safely online. Experts almost unanimously agree that it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to cause physical injuries like the ones American government sources have described to the press using any sort of sonic weapon that would be small enough for American officials not to notice. Below is the recording, which AP posted on YouTube. There is no indication that it is unsafe to listen to in this format. “If you want to produce a tight beam of energy that you can point at someone, ultrasound is the one to go for,” Tim Leighton, a professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics at University of Southampton in England, told The Guardian in September 2017. “If you want to put a lot of power into it so you could produce a beam that could go through windows, it starts to look more like a suitcase. In order to generate hearing loss at 50 meters away, you’d be looking at a car-sized device.” Ultrasound frequencies are too high to be audible to the human ear. Another option would be inaudible infrasound, which is lower than the range of noise people can hear. But as the clip suggests, the sounds are audible, at least to some degree. The recording AP obtained has the cricket-like qualities some sounds had previously noted. There were also reports of “grinding” sounds, ringing in the ears, and temporary deafness. The resulting symptoms, which have included long-lasting and possibly permanent hearing loss, disorientation and dizziness, and even concussions and brain swelling, are equally diverse. “The concussions, brain swelling and other symptoms like that have no possibility to be created by sound,” Dr. Joseph Pompei, a former researcher and psychoacoustics expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Public Radio International earlier in October 2017. “Somebody would have to be in a large bathtub, covered in ultrasonic transducers at a very high power.” Cars drive past the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba., Isaac Risco/Picture Alliance/DPA via AP That being said, something has injured American diplomatic staff in Cuba. The State Department has confirmed the incidents and that some individuals had to receive medical treatment. There is a distinct suggestion from the recording AP has released that sounds are man-made, too. “What it is telling us is the sound is located between about 7,000 kilohertz and 8,000 kilohertz,” Kausik Sarkar, an acoustics expert and engineering professor at The George Washington University, told AP after listening to the audio. “There are about 20 peaks, and they seem to be equally spaced. All these peaks correspond to a different frequency.” Whatever is causing the noise, the attacks have led to a cooling of U.S.-Cuba relations, which had been improving since President Barack Obama eased travel and economic restrictions for Americans visiting the island and reopened the American Embassy in Havana in 2015. The U.S. government has so far avoided accusing Cuban authorities of being behind the attacks, instead accusing them of failing to meet their obligations to keep international diplomatic personnel safe. A car drives past a billboard in Havana protesting the United States’ embargo of Cuba in 2016., Guillermo Nova/Picture Alliance/DPA via AP The United States has still retaliated over the incidents. Just in October 2017, the U.S. government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats and demanded a further 60 percent reduction in personnel working at the country’s Embassy ion Washington, matching an earlier voluntary reduction in the total number of Americans in Havana. In September 2017, the State Department had ordered all nonessential personnel out of Cuba , saying it could not guarantee their safety. Cuban officials continue to insist that they are not behind the attacks and are working through their own investigation into the incident. One prevailing theory is that at third party, most likely Russia, is behind the sonic barrages and sought to halt the warming of ties between Cuba and the United States, which it may have seen as a threat to its own interests. Another possibility is that the Cubans were involved and were looking to retaliate against the policies of President Donald Trump and his administration. None of this adequately explains why Canadian diplomats, representatives of a country that has long had ties with Cuba, also fell victim to what appear to have been entirely separate, but similar assaults. Based on the limited information available, it’s impossible to say for sure whether these individuals came under attack from some advanced sonic weapon or experienced some other odd confluence of symptoms. At least now you can listen to the chirping yourself. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Land Land-Based Directed Energy Weapons"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 11, 2019",The USAF’s AC-130W Gunships Are in Desperate Need of Special Ammunition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has made an urgent purchase of a specific type of 30mm cannon shells on behalf of U.S. Special Operations Command. Without the ammunition, the service said the U.S. Air Force’s AC-130W Stinger II gunships would be forced to use alternative rounds that would be unacceptably inaccurate and dangerously unreliable. In June 2017, the Army approved a plan to purchase up to 200,000 PGU-46/B 30mm cannon rounds from Orbital ATK. The service did not publicly disclose the total potential dollar value of the contract, but had to issue a so-called justification and approval document to explain why they needed to give the work straight to the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor rather than solicit competitive bids from various companies. This document appeared on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on Oct. 11, 2017. The review contains a number of redactions and the released portions never mention the AC-130W or the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). However, it does specifically mention the need for the ammunition to work with the GAU-23/A cannon without any additional modifications. The Air Force’s AC-130W and AC-130J Ghostriders are the only aircraft presently in inventory that use this weapon and the J-model is still in the operational test and evaluation process. The Stinger IIs have appeared in official photographs and video from the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and have supported operations in Afghanistan, as well. The gunships generally support special operations forces on the ground. Even with the redacted portions, in its justification, the Army makes a clear argument that not buying the ammunition as soon as possible would put American personnel in unnecessary danger. There is also the possibility that innocent civilians could be at increased risks if the Air Force crews had to use alternatives in high priority close air support missions, or CAS, to defend friendly “troops in contact,” abbreviated TIC. “The inventory of PG-46/B [sic] has now reached a critical level,” the contracting document explains. “The result of using PGU-13D/B rounds would be degraded support to [redacted] placing them at increased harm and risk as the PGU-13D/B is less accurate and experiences a higher dud-rate at longer stand-off ranges.” US Army According to the document and information from Orbital ATK’s website , the differences between the two types of ammunition are minimal. The major change is that the PGU-46/B has a new low-drag fuze that more reliability detonates the shell’s high-explosive incendiary filler when it hits a target at “extended ranges.” Neither source provides the exact parameters. But part of the reason for integrating the GAU-23/A onto the AC-130W and AC-130J was specifically to give the aircraft increased stand-off range when using its guns. The PGU-46/B round is also virtually identical to the U.S. Navy’s Mk 266 , except that the latter has a bright-burning tracer compound at the base of the projectile itself. Censors redacted the reason why a tracer round would be unacceptable, but it could easily be because the AC-130Ws almost exclusively operate at night. The light the Navy’s shells give off might be intense enough blind the AC-130W’s electro-optical and infrared cameras, or risk illuminating the aircraft itself, making it a glaring target for the enemy on the ground. The PGU-46/B round, above, and a cut away showing its internal construction, below., Orbital ATK The single-barrel GAU-23/A is a variant of Orbital ATK’s Bushmaster II cannon. The Navy has installed its own version, the Mk 44 , on the San Antonio -class of amphibious ships and the new Zumwalt -class destroyers as a means of defending against small, swarming watercraft. The U.S. Army recently began to field a new type of Stryker armored vehicle with another variant of the weapon, known as the XM813. All of these weapons use the same size ammunition as the fearsome GAU-8/A Avenger cannon on the venerable A-10 Warthog . The older AC-130U Spooky II aircraft have smaller 25mm GAU-12/U rotary cannons with a shorter range but higher rate of fire. This had in turn replaced a pair of 20mm M61 Vulcan cannons on earlier models. By the time the Air Force retired the last AC-130H Spectre in 2015, the service had removed these guns, replacing them with observation windows, and the planes relied entirely on their larger 40mm cannon and 105mm howitzer during operations. A late model AC-130H with a pair of observation windows in the forward fuselage in lieu of two M61 Vulcan cannons. , USAF The main armament of the AC-130W initially was almost exclusively precision guided bombs and missiles. In February 2017, U.S. Air Force Major General Eugene Haase, AFSOC’s vice commander, revealed that so-called Block 20 Stinger IIs , armed with the 30mm cannon and an 105mm howitzer, were “down range.” Apparently for a period, at least some of those crews were firing the older PGU-13D/B ammunition. “[Redacted] previously used the PGU-13D/B 30mm round for TIC operations, but ceased doing so because of high dud-rates and lower accuracy at stand-off ranges,” the contracting document explained. “Testing identified that the PGU-13D/B does not meet the precision weapons delivery that is required for real world TIC CAS. Furthermore the deployed units have further self-restricted that only the use of PG-46/B be used in combat for high priority tasked missions.” US Army This is a particularly interesting detail since the Air Force had admitted the combination of modified Mk 44 guns and the PGU-13D/B was too inaccurate for widespread use in tests almost a decade earlier. In 2007, the Air Force replaced both the GAU-12/U and the 40mm cannon on four AC-130Us with a pair of the Bushmaster IIs. By August 2008, it had returned all the aircraft to their original configuration. On Aug. 11, 2008, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Bradley Heithold, then a brigadier general and director of plans, programs, requirements, and assessments for AFSOC, said the service had cancelled the project because the guns were too inaccurate “at the altitude we were employing it” during testing, according to Air Force Magazine . The U.S. Marine Corps also indefinitely delayed its own plans to add the gun to its KC-130 Harvest Hawk gunships, focusing instead on precision guided munitions. USAF None of the unredacted portions of the Army’s justification for the purchase of PGU-46/B rounds describe any actual instances of friendly fire or civilian casualties due to the use of the older PGU-13D/B design. The risks are obvious, though, especially during operations in densely populated urban areas. Sieges and brutal campaigns to liberate major cities have become hallmarks of the campaign against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria. The U.S.-led international coalition and the airpower it provides has been essential to those operations, particularly in ejecting the terrorists from their main hub in the Iraqi city of Mosul and the ongoing push to defeat the group in its de facto capital in Syria’s Raqqa . In August 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported that American forces were routinely launching drone strikes that were “ danger close ” to U.S.-backed forces in Syria, meaning the bombs or missiles would hit in such close proximity to friendly personnel that the attack required special approval. This report came from a visit to Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, the nerve center for the Air Force’s drone operations, so it is possible that manned platforms were seeing a similar uptick in these types of missions. Both of these campaigns have been marked by a distinct increase in reports of civilian casualties from air strikes. A similar surge of air strikes in Afghanistan has led to an increase in claims of collateral damage there, as well. The U.S. military has previously weathered criticism over likely causing innocent deaths during counter terrorisms operations in other countries, including Yemen . There is no information available to suggest that the use of PGU-13D/B had contributed to any earlier claims of collateral damage. Given that crews have been restricting themselves to using the PGU-46/B would suggest they themselves see significant dangers in using the other ammunition. An AC-130W Stinger II gunship., USAF It is also unclear whether or not the issues with firing the PGU-13D/B from the AC-130W gunship have manifested themselves in any way with regards to the A-10s, which have also employed the rounds in combat against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Warthog’s low-level strafing runs are completely different from the Stinger II’s higher altitude pylon turn gun runs though. Differences in the altitudes both aircraft operate at and how steep their typical angles of attack are could easily impact the functioning of the round’s fuze and its stability in flight. At the time of writing U.S. Air Forces Central had not responded to a query about whether or not accuracy or reliability concerns had impacted the use of the PGU-13D/B more broadly. Since the PGU-46/B has become the default for AC-130W operations, it seems clear that U.S. Special Operations Command, or another service working on its behalf, will have to find a way to keep a steady stream of the rounds coming in the future regardless. They’ll need it for the up-coming AC-130Js, too. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 10, 2018",Highlights From the Showroom Floor at the Army’s Biggest Arms Expo and Conference,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every year, the Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) holds a series of meetings, panel discussions, and other talks, combined with a huge trade show, in Washington, D.C. American and foreign military personnel descend on the event to get the latest information about the service, as well as take an opportunity to see the latest military technology, including vehicles large and small, all matter of weaponry, and other equipment , that vendors from around the world are offering. The major themes Army leaders espoused at the 2017 AUSA conference, which began on Oct. 9 and ended on Oct. 11, 2017, centered on the service’s long-standing desire to expand its overall size, streamline stalled modernization plans, and improve overall readiness and capabilities in the face of transforming threats from opponents such as North Korea and Russia . The modernization work in particular would revolve around improving capabilities in six core functional areas: long-range precision artillery fires , a next generation combat vehicle, the Future Vertical Lift aircraft program, a new mobile and expeditionary communications and information sharing network, air and missile defense capabilities, and overall soldier lethality. The Army is in the process of establishing six so-called “cross functional teams” of senior officials and subject matter experts who will report directly to the Army’s top leadership to manage these efforts. “This is going to be a banner year. Our objective is to get these organizations stood up by summer of 2018,” U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley said during an opening speech at the AUSA gathering on Oct. 9, 2017. “This is necessary, it’s important and I absolutely believe that unless we do this we will be increasingly losing ground against potential adversaries.” Unfortunately, 16 years of fighting limited conflicts against terrorists and insurgents without advanced weapons or air forces meant that preparing for conventional ground combat against a near peer opponent with high performance aircraft and other advanced capabilities hadn’t been a major priority, even for the Army, for more than a decade. One particularly glaring gap in short range air defenses appeared across the U.S. military. After Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, began actively supporting separatists against the government in Kiev, and otherwise began to adopt a revanchist foreign policy around the world, this attitude slowly began to change. Still, Congress’ inability to routinely pass full budgets, instead relying on temporary spending bills known as “continuing resolutions,” along with the Budget Control Act’s spending caps, a process known as sequestration, haven’t helped matters, either. The Army had also suffered a number of costly missteps, including the abortive Future Combat Systems (FCS) vehicle project and its Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) successor program, as well as the struggling Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T). As such, many of the service’s major modernization requirements remain much the same as they have been for years and companies are still eager to sell what are in many ways simply updated versions earlier offerings that never made it into service due to mismanagement or budget cuts. Many firms are simply offering upgrades or new configurations to existing vehicles, such as BAE Systems Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) version of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle . The M-SHORAD Bradley., Joseph Trevithick The M-SHORAD has many similarities to the older air defense version of the Bradley, the M6 Linebacker, notably the four-round Stinger surface-to-air missile pod in lieu of the vehicle’s usual two-round TOW anti-tank missile launcher. The updated version features a new turret with additional sensors, including an infrared sighting system, the shorter range “perimeter” version of RADA’s three dimensional Multi-mission Hemispheric Radar (pMHR), and a jamming system to take out small unmanned aircraft with its own short-range targeting radar on top. A detailed look at the M-SHORAD’s turret., Joseph Trevithick In addition, BAE Systems made it clear that the turret design was modular and could accept various weapons and sensors to take on other roles. At AUSA 2017, the M-SHORAD display also featured a launcher with two millimeter radar-guided Longbow Hellfire missiles that could attach to the Bradley’s turret instead of the Stingers of the TOWs. The Longbow Hellfire option for the Bradley., Joseph Trevithick BAE’s other big draw – and I mean big, with people constantly gathering around it, making it so hard to get a clear shot I gave up – was the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV). This heavy tracked vehicle is the remnants of the failed FCS and GCV programs and the Army ultimately intends to replace its aging fleet of M113A3-based vehicles with new design. The new AMPVs, which are essentially turretless Bradleys, will take over a variety of support roles, including general purpose carriers for combat support troops such as engineers in mechanized formations, armored mortar carriers, protected ambulances, and command vehicles. The version BAE brought to AUSA 2017 had both slat, which can “catch” small shaped charge anti-armor rockets and set them off early or prevent them from going off at all, as well as explosive reactive armor tiles . Given the Army’s increasing concerns about conflict with a more advanced opponent who benefits from a well equipped air force, as well as the increasing threat of small drones, the M-SHORAD was only one a number of air defense vehicles on display. Both General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) and Oshkosh had vehicles fitted with Boeing’s improved modular air defense weapon station, similar in basic concept to its existing AN/TWQ-1 Avenger system the U.S. Army and Marine Corps use on their High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, better known as Hummers or Humvees . The version on the GDLS’ Stryker featured a four-round Stinger SAM pod and four Hellfire missiles, while the Oshkosh Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) variant had the Hellfires and a .50 caliber machine gun. The existing Avenger has two of the Stinger pods, as well as a .50 caliber machine gun. The new armored turret also features a sensor turret on top. You can read all about the Army’s great need for SHORAD systems in this past feature from The War Zone. Boeing turret on the back of a variant of GDLS’ Stryker., Joseph Trevithick The SHORAD JLTV variant., Joseph Trevithick GLDS also had a model of its Stryker Mobile High Energy Laser (MEHEL) variant, intended mainly to destroy small unmanned aerial vehicles. The Army is actively testing this variant, putting the last version through the paces during the annual Maneuver Fires Integrated Experiment (MFIX) at Fort Sill in Oklahoma in April 2017. A model of the Stryker MEHEL., Joseph Trevithick Northrop Grumman also put out a model of a Styrker equipped with its active electronically scanned array Highly Adaptable Multi-Mission Radar (HAMMR). The company is working with the Army on this radar as a complementary sensor for various short range air defense weapons and has depicted it installed on a Humvee, as well.

The radome is cut away to show the radar itself within. , Joseph Trevithick Air and missile defense wasn’t only limited to vehicle-mounted options, with numerous companies showing off longer range surface-to-air missile types. Raytheon’s had displays for its Patriot SAM system and land-based SM-3 ballistic missile defense interceptors, while Lockheed’s had models of its Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) ballistic missile defense system and forthcoming THAAD-ER interceptor. Aerojet Rocketdyne, which makes the motors for both THAAD and Patriot also had its own booth. Cut-away models of the Patriot Advanced Capability 3 missile, at top, and the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) type below., Joseph Trevithick Another cut away model of the THAAD interceptor., Joseph Trevithick In addition, Israeli company Rafael’s Iron Dome and Lockheed’s Miniature Hit-to-Kill (MHTK) missiles were both on display. These systems are both intended to counter small unguided rockets and mortars, but could potentially serve as defenses against small drones as well. The U.S. Army has already tested both as possible options for its truck-mounted Multi-Mission Launcher and is interested in purchasing the Iron Dome system itself, by way of American defense contractor Raytheon. Rafael’s Iron Dome at the Raytheon booth., Joseph Trevithick A model of the MHTK launcher, showing missiles quad-packed into each tube., Joseph Trevithick A full size model of the MHTK missile and other example in a single launch type, as well as the remains of a mortar bomb the system destroyed in tests., Joseph Trevithick There were models and full size examples of a variety of other vehicles, including some that appeared targeted toward foreign buyers rather than the U.S. Army. South Korea’s Hanwha had one of the most impressive displays with one of its K9 Thunder 155mm self-propelled howitzer and a Hybrid Biho mobile air defense system, which has a turret with two 30mm cannons and four Singung short-range surface-to-air missiles on top of a tracked chassis derived from the K200 armored personnel carrier. The original Biho, which means flying tiger in Korean, only had the pair of cannons. The K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzer., Joseph Trevithick The Hybrid Biho mobile air defense system., Joseph Trevithick The South Korean conglomerate also had models of various other products, including the K21-105 medium tank and the Barracuda 4×4 light armored personnel carrier. The K21-105 is a variant of the K21 infantry fighting vehicle , but with a turret armed with an 105mm gun. The Barracuda is in service in Indonesia and Iraq. A model of the K21-105 light tank., Joseph Trevithick Models are a lot easier to get into a conventional hall in downtown Washington, D.C., so many vendors chose to bring them instead of full-size vehicles or mockups. Leonardo DRS, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Italy’s Leonardo, had smaller representations of the Israeli-made Trophy active protection system on both the M1A2 Abrams and the Stryker series. The company had just earlier released photographs of a prototype Abrams with the defensive gear to the press. The Stryker vehicle with the Trophy MV variant for medium weight vehicles also had RADA pMHR radars and a mast-mounted electro-optical and infrared sensor suite, as well. Various firms presented similar raised sensor installations at AUSA 2017 as an option for a wide array of vehicles. A model of an M1A2 Abrams tank with the Trophy active protection system., Joseph Trevithick A model of a Stryker vehicle with the Trophy MV variant and various additional sensors., Joseph Trevithick For more than a decade, the U.S. Army has been increasingly interested in active protection defenses for its vehicles. Having observed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and seen the impact of guided anti-tank missiles in the fighting in Iraq and Syria, the service has only become more determined to field equipment like Trophy broadly across its forces. So in addition to the versions for heavier vehicles, Israeli manufacturer Rafael and other companies made sure to highlight the versatlity of Trophy in particular. As already noted, the system comes in versions suited to heavy- and medium-weight vehicles. There’s also an even light Trophy LV, which appeared at AUSA 2017 fitted to a JLTV truck. A JLTV with the Trophy LV active protection system., Joseph Trevithick Israel Military Industries’ Iron Fist and American defense contractor Artis’ Iron Curtain , two competing active protection suites, also made appearances. General Dynamics had a number of its Flyer lightweight 4×4 vehicles in various configurations, including one with the Iron Fist system. A Flyer with the Iron Fist active protection system., Joseph Trevithick GD’s Ordnance and Tactical Systems is responsible for the Flyer, which the company offers as an option for light conventional and special operations forces who need mobility, but also require a vehicle that is small enough to fit inside the main cabin of smaller helicopters and aircraft, including the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor. In 2013, U.S. Special Operations Command chose the Flyer as the winning design for its Ground Mobility Vehicle 1.1 program. The U.S. Army as a whole is now investigating the utility of this design and even smaller all-terrain vehicles for regular airborne and airmobile troops. At AUSA 2017, there were Flyers armed with both .50 caliber GAU-19/A rotary machine guns – another GD product – and 30mm M230LF lightweight automatic cannons, as well as various levels of applique armor, sensor suites and the ability to launch and recover a small hex-copter drone from the vehicle itself. A Flyer with the GAU-19/A .50 caliber machine gun., Joseph Trevithick A more heavily armored Flyer with an M230LF cannon and an on board drone., Joseph Trevithick The M230LF-armed Flyer is indicative of another trend, since the U.S. Army has also become concerned about the lack of firepower on many vehicles, especially compared to their Russian counterparts. So, the service recently began fielding a version of the Stryker with a 30mm Mk 44 Bushmaster II cannon in Europe and is considering proposals to add the M230LF, which is a derivative of the AH-64 Apache’s main gun, to the JLTV’s arsenal. Both of these vehicles were prominent features at the AUSA expo. The Mk 44 Bushmaster II-armed Stryker Dragoon., Joseph Trevithick A JLTV with the M230LF cannon., Joseph Trevithick There were a number of other vehicles, or models thereof, on display intended for highly specialized roles or which companies seemed to aim at non-American customers. Both GDLS and Caterpillar had models of very interesting combat engineer vehicles at AUSA 2017. In addition a model of its famous D9 armored bulldozer , Caterpillar had a representation of an armored front-end loader with an additional large obstacle clearing blade that folds to the side when not in use. These types of vehicles have become especially important in Iraq and Syria for rapidly clearing improvised explosive devices and other hazards. The model of Caterpillar’s militarized front-end loader., Joseph Trevithick General Dynamics had a small model of another unique vehicle, a Piranha III 8×8 light armored vehicle fitted with a small bridge, which is a product its European Land Systems division offers. The U.S. Army’s Stryker and the Canadian LAV-III are both derivatives of the Piranha III design. GDLS says that the mechanism to launch the bridge can attach to any Piranha III-based design using the existing tie-downs and lifting points, allowing forces to quickly install or remove the entire system as necessary in the field. The bridge itself is the Rapidly Emplaced Bridge System , which the Army already has in service in truck-launched form and can quickly provide a path for troops and light vehicles over gaps approximately 40 feet wide. A model of the Pirnaha III bridge layer., Joseph Trevithick International Armored Group , which builds various 4×4 and 6×6 armored vehicles for military, police, and private security customers, had one of its Ford F550-based Sentinel 4×4 armored personnel carriers at the expo. This is the same company that builds the Guardian light armored vehicles , which the United States has supplied to Kurdish and other irregular forces in Syria . IAG’s Sentinel armored personnel carrier., Joseph Trevithick Israel’s Elbit systems also had an example of their Spear Mk 2 120mm soft-recoil mortar system, which is mounted on a light armored 4×4 chassis. Elbit first unveiled this weapon, which crews can program to fire at designated targets automatically, earlier in 2017. A number of countries are building similar systems, which are ideal for providing quick and accurate fire support during limited operations. The United States has sent the Spanish EXPAL Integrated Mortar System (EIMOS) to its partners in Syria . The Spear Mk 2 mortar system., Joseph Trevithick Beyond vehicles, a number of large defense contractors brought examples of their remote weapon stations or turreted armament systems that could work with a variety of vehicles. Norway’s Kongsberg builds the Army’s M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station II (CROWS II) remote weapon system, recently working to add an FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missile launcher to existing versions that previously only had a single .50 caliber M2 machine gun or 40mm Mk 19 Mod 3 automatic grenade launcher. Another possible version allows for the installation of the M2 and Mk 19 simultaneously. Kongsberg markets these and other different models as options for various land vehicles and watercraft as the Protector series. Kongsberg’s new M153 variant with the Javelin missile launcher., Joseph Trevithick A Kongsberg Protector with both an M2 machine gun and Mk 19 grenade launcher., Joseph Trevithick Belgium’s CMI Defence had a mockup of its Cockerill 3000-series turret, which is offers a a modular option able to accommodate various automatic cannons and large caliber main guns from 25mm up to 105mm, along with additional sensors and other equipment. Cockerill has long been an established name in low- and high-pressure guns, and turrets to hold them, suitable for light armored vehicles. The Cockerill 3000-series turret with an 105mm gun., Joseph Trevithick In addition, CMI and BAE Systems Hägglunds’ division have also joined up to produce a prototype version of the CV90 fighting vehicle with a Cockerill turret armed with an 105mm gun. Its the same turret that Hanwha has on their K21-105 vehicle. A model display showing the modularity of the Cockerill 3000-series., Joseph Trevithick These are the sorts of vehicles that the U.S. Army might be interested in as it proceeds with its new light tank project, known as the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. Defense contractor SAIC, which has partnered with Singapore’s STKinetics, has already said it will use one of CMI’s turrets in its bid. The goal of MPF is to give additional direct fire capability to the Army’s lighter forces. At present Stryker units rely on the much maligned Mobile Gun System variant and airborne and leg infantry formations have no such fire support vehicle at all. The Army is still interesting in adding small unmanned ground vehicles, either wheeled or tracked drones, that can reduce the burden of troops in units all the way down to the squad level have to carry themselves and potentially add additional, mobile firepower. Various firms brought their designs, but one of the most unique and potentially revolutionary is General Motor’s Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure, or SURUS, a hydrogen fuel cell-powered, optionally-manned chassis that can quickly adapt to a host of roles. We’ve already taken an extended look at this 4×4 platform and the present limits of the concept, which you can read about more here . A mockup of GM’s SURUS., Joseph Trevithick Perhaps more interestingly, Ukraine’s state-run arms broker, UkrOboronProm, had a display at AUSA 2017 for the first time and brought a heavily armed unmanned ground combat vehicle, called the Phantom-2. Manufacturer SpetsTehnoExport unveiled the updated version of the vehicle, which looks like a pint-sized Russian BTR-series 8×8 armored personnel carrier, earlier in 2017. It released the first version in 2016. The Phantom-2 replaces the earlier design’s 12.7mm machine gun with a twin-barrel automatic cannon and removes two of the Barrier anti-tank missiles to make room for a large boxy rocket pod. SpetsTehnoExport’s Phantom-2., Joseph Trevithick In addition to looking for new ground vehicles, the U.S. Army is looking to make big changes in its aviation elements in the coming years, primarily as part of the Future Vertical Lift program. FVL’s goal is to ultimately develop an entirely new family of aircraft, whether they be helicopters, tilt-rotors, or some other design, to replace all of the service’s existing helicopters. Bell Helicopters, part of defense contractor Textron, brought a full size mock up of its initial V-280 Valor tilt-rotor, which it is pitching for the part of the FVL project aimed at replacing the UH-60 Black Hawk series. A mockup of Bell Helicopter’s V-280 Valor., Joseph Trevithick The actual V-280 prototype began low-power ground testing earlier in October 2017. The FVL program will also include other variants to replace the Army AH-64D and E Apache gunships and members of CH-47 Chinook family .  Bell had a model of a possible scout/attack V-280 on display, similar to what the company had shown in earlier concept art of the aircraft, as well. A model of an armed V-280 concept., Joseph Trevithick Textron’s main competitor is a partnership between Boeing and Sikorsky, the latter of which is now part of Lockheed Martin. Both companies had models of their SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter, also a potential replacement for the Black Hawk being developed for the FVL program. Earlier in 2017, Lockheed Martin released a video showing off both the SB>1 transport and a gunship derivative. Boeing’s model of the SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter., Joseph Trevithick Boeing and Sikorsky, by way of Lockheed Martin, were still pitching their existing helicopter lines, as well. L-3 had a model of its SPYDR-II intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft concept, which uses the ubiquitous Beechcraft King Air 350-series as the starting point. Northrop Grumman had a full-size mockup of its VADER radar pod, which is a component on some of the the Army’s own up-coming King Air 350-based MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) aircraft. A model of L-3’s the SPYDR-II., Joseph Trevithick The VADER radar pod., Joseph Trevithick Unmanned aircraft were another important feature of the 2017 AUSA expo. Textron brought a sleek, gloss black version of its new Nightwarden , which it had earlier shown at the Air Force Association’s 2017 Air, Space, and Cyber Conference. The drone is an expanded derivative of AAI’s Shadow M2, featuring additional sensors and the ability to carry small, precision guided munitions. Not surprisingly, the version at the booth had a pair of Textron’s own Fury miniature glide bombs under the wings. Textron’s Nightwarden carrying a pair of Fury glide bombs., Joseph Trevithick Lockheed Martin had its own Fury, a flying wing drone it first revealed in 2015, at AUSA 2017. The company says the catapult-launched unmanned aircraft can stay airborne for approximately 15 hours and has a significantly reduced signature compared to other tactical pilotless planes of similar size, all while carrying electro-optical and infrared cameras, communications nodes, or electronic warfare payloads. Lockheed Martin’s Fury., Joseph Trevithick Lockheed had the drone hanging above a separate display with 227mm Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets and the larger Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile, both of which are Lockheed products. The Army is looking to replace ATACMS with a new long-range ballistic missile from Raytheon, called DeepStrike , but the weapon has come back into view after a number of launches in South Korea in response to North Korean provocations in 2017. We asked a Lockheed representative if the company had been pitching Fury as a means of cuing the rocket and missile attacks. They said they hadn’t, but agreed that this would be one of the possible ways the drone could contribute on the battlefield. Much more interestingly, the individual said that there was the possibility for more ATACMs sales to the Army in the near future, as the service has found renewed value in the system. Lockheed has kept the production line open almost entirely on the backs of international sales to countries such as Finland, Romania, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Models of Lockheed’s GMLRS rockets, at top, and ATACMS missile., Joseph Trevithick And, in line with the Army’s focus on soldier lethality, what would the 2017 AUSA conference have been without various displays of lighter weapons, machine guns, rifles, and explosives. These includes missiles and suicide drones , such as Israel-based UVision’s Hero-series. More technically known as loitering munitions, these weapons can orbit the battlefield for a protracted period of time before dropping down on a target. While in flight, they feed information back to an operator by way of an electro-optical or infrared camera.

The larger versions are still readily transportable., Joseph Trevithick Saab had both its older M3 and newer M3E1 84mm recoilless rifles on display, as well as the single-shot 84mm M136-AT4. The Army as a whole has used the AT4-series since the 1990s, while the M3 had been a standard weapon for U.S. special operations forces. Recently, the Army decided to begin fielding the newer M3E1, which is lighter weight and has a number of other refinements, to conventional units . The weapon can fire a wide variety of ammunition, make it extremely versatile in various situations.

At their display, the company had versions of the anti-structure rocket, able to break through brick and masonry walls before detonating, aimed at the U.S. military and European customers. The programmable M72E11 Mk 2 rocket., Joseph Trevithick The representative explained that the European model was “nicer,” relying on blast over pressure rather than shrapnel to kill the enemy, reducing the chance that innocent bystanders might get hurt inadvertently. The company designed the frangible, sub-caliber rocket body to completely burn up when it detonates. Norway and France have both bought this type.

GD-OTS’ .338-caliber LWMMG, Joseph Trevithick Separately, Textron continues to develop another family of advanced small arms around so-called cased telescoped ammunition, where the bullet sits nestled deep inside the cartridge case with the gun powder, reducing the overall length. The company has worked on this concept as a stepping stone to full caseless ammunition. At present, the Army is still interested in finally replacing its M16 rifles and M4 carbines with a new weapon using new ammunition, but a host of projects over the past five decades have failed to produce meaningful results, as we at The War Zone have discussed in detail in the past. Prototype light machine guns and rifles Textron had developed to fire cased-telescoped ammunition., Joseph Trevithick Cased-telescoped ammunition, in black at right, next to traditional brass-cased rounds firing bullets of the same diameter., Joseph Trevithick The Army hasn’t given up on traditional weapons firing conventional cartridges, though.

Heckler and Koch’s M110A1 CSASS., Joseph Trevithick There were also some oddities that, again, seemed aimed primarily at foreign customers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",US Navy Plans to Cut Cruisers by Half Amid Reports One Became Like a “Floating Prison”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is reportedly planning to decommission half of its remaining Ticonderoga -class cruisers within a decade, just as reports have emerged that life aboard one of them, the USS Shiloh , had become like a “floating prison.” The decision could only put additional strain on the service, which has already begun to suffer dangerously low readiness and morale, leading to a series of deadly accidents, in the face of high operational demands , difficulties in obtaining new ships , and crumbling shipyard infrastructure . On Oct. 9, 2017, Navy Times reported that the Navy would retire two Ticonderoga ’s each year starting in 2020, with a total of 11 out of service by 2026. At present, the service has a total of 22 of the cruisers, the oldest of which, the USS Bunker Hill , joined the fleet in 1985. On the same day, the news outlet began to disclose horrifying details about life aboard another ship in the class, the USS Shiloh , in a series of articles based on official, internal command climate surveys it had obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. “I just pray we never have to shoot down a missile from North Korea,” on the Shiloh ’s crew wrote . “Then our ineffectiveness will really show.” Part of the forward-deployed aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan ’s accompanying Carrier Strike Group, itself part of the U.S. Seventh Fleet headquartered in Japan, the cruiser is tasked in part with the ballistic missile defense role, though the latest version of its primary interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, remains in testing . In addition, to the increasing threat of North Korea’s arsenal, which the sailor noted, China is fielding a increasing number of long-range ballistic missiles of various types, including one, the DF-21D , that it has designed specifically to take out aircraft carriers and other large ships at sea. Ballistics missiles are quickly proliferating around the world in general, too, with 2017 having already seen other tests in Iran , Israel , and South Korea among other locales. The Ticonderoga -class USS Cowpens fires a SM-2 missile during an exercise in 2012., USN Displacing close to 10,000 tons with a full load, the Shiloh also performs a vital air defense role for the carrier group, with more than 120 vertical launch system (VLS) cells able to hold a variety of surface-to-air missiles, a long-range radar and associated Aegis combat system, and other weapon systems, sensors, and electronic warfare equipment. These include the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), the increasingly capable RIM-174A, better known as the SM-6 , and the RIM-162A Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile , four of which can be quad-packed into each cell. The VLS can also launch Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles for stand-off attacks against targets on land, making the ship even more versatile. Its helicopters also provide anti-submarine screening for the inner sanctum of the Carrier Strike Group. With unprecedented tensions on the Korean Peninsula and simmering disputes elsewhere in the Western Pacific, especially over freedom of navigation through the South China Sea , it’s terrifying to learn sailors called the Shiloh a “floating prison.” “It feels like a race to see which will break down first, the ship or it’s [sic] crew,” another member of the crew noted. The man at the center of many of the complaints was the ship’s commanding officer, U.S. Navy Captain Adam Aycock. The service told Navy Times that it was aware of the issues, but did not explain then why Aycock was allowed to finish out his more than two year stint as Shiloh ’s commander. According to the survey’s the outlet obtained, around half of sailors had reported “a lot” of work-related stress in 2015, when U.S. Navy Captain Kurush Morris was in charge. More than 80 percent said this was the case under Aycock’s leadership. The USS Shiloh ., USN Underscoring the toxic leadership was the captain’s reported use of a punishment of three days in the ship’s brig with only bread and water for meals, reminiscent of a long gone era of Navy operations. Aycock would subject sailors to this regimen for infractions as minor as showing up late to their duty posts or violating curfew while in port. “I do not wear my [USS Shiloh ] ballcap at the [Navy Exchange store],” a sailor said in one of the surveys. “Even the taxi drivers on base know us for being the ‘USS Bread and Water.’” The reports could help explain, at least in part, a bizarre episode earlier in 2017 in which one of the cruiser sailors hid for days in the ship’s engine room. Petty Officer 3rd Class Peter Mims faces a court martial after admitting he deliberately avoided search parties , leading the rest of the crew to believe he had fallen overboard, prompting a massive search and rescue operation. According to the surveys, things had gotten so bad for Mims and his shipmates that “even taxi drivers Know [sic] us by the ship who has the worst captain and people trying to commit suicide,” a sailor wrote in their comments. “I feel like I would be better off being a hobo in San diego [sic] than show up to work onboard [sic] USS Shiloh,” another said. Petty Officer 3rd Class Peter Mims., USN That the Navy allowed the situation on board the ship to continue after three surveys full of negative comments has only raised new and serious questions about the state of the ships assigned to the Seventh Fleet and whether the problems might be more widespread. It of course begs the questions about whether the service felt, right or wrong, that it had limited options in order to meet its operational demands. Unfortunately, the reports do appear to be well in line with a host of other emerging details about poor state of the Navy surface ships with its forward deployed command in Japan. This information has begun to emerge following a series of investigations into two deadly collisions earlier in 2017. In June 2017, a container ship rammed into the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Fitzgerald off the coast of Japan, an accident that killed seven sailors . Then, in August 2017, the USS John McCain , another Arleigh Burke , collided with an oil tanker east of Singapore near the Strait of Malacca. Ten more sailors died . Damage to the hull of the USS John McCain after it collided with an oil tanker in August 2017., USN This followed a pair of accidents earlier in the year. The Ticonderoga -class USS Antietam – one of the ships Navy Times says will end up retired in 2021 – ran aground in Japan. Another one of the cruisers, the USS Lake Champlain , which the Navy expects to decommission in 2022, got into an accident with a South Korean fishing boat. The events surrounding Fitzgerald ’s collision seemed so odd that it spawned a number of conspiracy theories . The John McCain ’s accident, however, made it clear that there were larger institutional problems . What has become clear is that due to a confluence of factors, including budget cuts and caps and problems with large shipbuilding programs such as the Littoral Combat Ship , the Seventh Fleet, along with other Navy commands, has been overworking crews and under-manning ships, often sending them out on patrols despite expired certifications . At the same time, commanding officers appear to have been reluctant to voice concerns or criticisms for fear of punishment by their own superiors. At a hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee in September 2017, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer and U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson admitted that the service was only able to meet 40 percent of the total demand for surface warships. They acknowledged a broad problem and promised to fix it, including through independent studies. U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee in September 2017., Ron Sachs/CNP via AP However, some members of Congress have questioned whether new research is either necessary or useful in turning the service around. Arizona’s Senator John McCain, a Navy veteran and whose father is the namesake of the destroyer at the center of the second deadly accident, had no problem dressing down Spencer and Richardson over the situation. “It doesn’t take a study or RAND or [the] Mayo [Clinic] when you are working people 100 hours a week, OK?” he said. “I don’t have to ask RAND. I think I know what 100 hours a week does to people over time. And that’s been standard procedure for a long time.” The initial reports of what happened aboard Fitzgerald in June 2017, which you can read about in detail here , are damning though, as are the first assessments of the McCain ’s accident, which the Navy has described as “ preventable .” The courage of sailors aboard each vessel seems to have been the only thing stopping both incidents from turning out even worse. But it’s not entirely clear what the Navy really has the ability to do in the near term that won’t further upset the ability of its surface fleet to perform its core functions. There have been steady punishments for senior leaders at the Seventh Fleet, including the dismissal of the command’s top officer, Admiral Scott Swift in August 2017.  The service relieved McCain ’s commanding, U.S. Navy Commander Alfredo Sanchez, and its second in command, Commander Jessie Sanchez, on Oct. 11, 2017. The USS Fitzgerald sits in dry dock in Japan in July 2017., USN Beyond that, there are major limits for how fast the Navy could reasonably expect to increase the total size of its fleet or the sailors to man those ships, even if there were no politics and budgets involved. Shipbuilding in general has a long lead time and requires significant upfront investments in infrastructure and skilled workers. Once the shipyards get going, it’s easier to sustain production and steadily reduce costs, but only as long as there is demand and adequate funding. The aforementioned Littoral Combat Ship program was supposed to be a solution to many of these problems , offering an affordable ship that a small crew could operate in various limited scenarios to free up larger surface ships, such as the Arleigh Burkes and Ticonderogas , and their crews, for higher intensity missions. That has since turned into a nightmare project that delivered perpetually under-performing ships that have been still too much for the intentionally skeletonized crews to handle effectively. Earlier in 2017, the Navy finally admitted it needed an entirely new and more capable frigate-type ship to meet its requirements. This was after it attempted to respond to criticism from legislators about its shipbuilding plans by hastily slipped another Littoral Combat Ship into the service’s budget request for the 2018 fiscal year after the proposal had already gone to Congress without any clear indication of how it planned to pay for the addition . This all calls into question the Navy’s ability to sustain the ships it has now, as well as the small number it already has in production. The goal of a 355-ship fleet seems especially dubious in this context. It’s prompted the service to look serious at reactivating a number of older ships, including the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk , and a number of Oliver Hazard Perry -class frigates. The latter plan would see the ships return to service with very limited capabilities . When it comes to keeping even the fleet it already has in an operational state, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway recently took a look at the sorry state of the Navy’s critical shipyards that keep many of its most advanced vessels running. The picture isn’t pretty to say the least. The aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its accompany strike group return to Japan from a patrol in November 2016., USN The Navy’s plans to at least mothball half of the Ticonderogas by 2026 is only likely to prompt more criticisms and questions from Congress about the service’s priorities. It is possible that it could put the older cruisers through a service life extension program to stabilize that part of the surface fleet, but again, the money for that work would have to come from somewhere. Whether or not American shipyards have the capacity to turn over the ships and get them back into action in a reasonable amount of time and in a cost-effective manner are separate, but equally important questions. There’s already the possibility the Navy may simply decide to try and squeeze more life out of the Ticonderogas as is, without any significant overhauls or modernization programs. In June 2017, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Tom Moore, head of Naval Sea Systems Command, suggested that it might be possible to extend the service life of steel-hulled ships another five or 10 years with just routine maintenance. Though many of the same budgetary concerns would apply to such a plan, the Navy has at least requested additional funds for these kinds of basic repairs as part of Pentagon-wide push to improve overall readiness across the U.S. military in the budget request for the 2018 fiscal year. What is clear is that the Navy is rapidly reaching its breaking point and people have already died. Sailors’ comments about their time aboard Shiloh appear extreme in nature, but hardly detached from larger, service-wide issues. It’s a dangerous cycle to be in as well, since pressure to make do with less puts strain on personnel who are then more inclined to leave as soon as they’re able, further reducing to total available manpower, and so on and so forth. “It’s only a matter of time before something horrible happens,” one sailor aboard the cruiser wrote. “It’s a place we despise going to and cannot wait to leave,” another declared. Now that horrible things have happened, it’s clearly well past time for the Navy to do some serious soul searching about how to move forward and change the service’s operational climate once and for all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2020",General Atomics Is the First to Show Off Its MQ-25 Drone Tanker Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The four companies competing to build the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray aircraft carrier-based drone tanker gotten the final request for proposals from the service, though the exact specifics have yet to become public. At the same time, General Atomics has become the first of the firms to show both concept art and models of its complete entry, which the company says will be more than just a flying gas station. On Oct. 10, 2017, USNI News was the first to learn that Naval Air Systems Command, or NAVAIR, had, without much fanfare, sent out formal requests for the MQ-25 to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The Navy said it expected to pick a winning design by September 2018. For more than a decade, the Navy has been working to develop a drone capable of operating from its aircraft carriers, first as part of a joint service project with the U.S. Air Force known as the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) and then under its own Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator (UCAS-D) program beginning in 2011. Though the UCAS-D effort continued in the background, in 2013, the Navy awarded contracts to the Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman for what was initially billed as a stealthy long-range strike and reconnaissance platform able to penetrate through dense integrated air defense networks, dubbed the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program. In 2016, the service morphed this project into Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS) and told the four companies to change course and focus on a air vehicle that would primarily be a aerial refueling tanker, but with a secondary reconnaissance capability. Northrop Grumman’s two X-47B demonstrators., Northrop Grumman As time has gone on, even that limited surveillance function has all but gone missing from the Navy’s official pronouncements about the project. The major goal at present revolves around extending the range of the manned components of the carrier air wing and freeing up F/A-18E/F Super Hornets from the burden of having to perform the tanking mission. At present, the service estimates that between 20 and 30 percent of carrier-based Super Hornet sorties are spent on refueling duties. In an interview in the September 2017 issue of Proceedings , USNI’s official magazine, Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, the Commander, Naval Air Forces, said that the final MQ-25 would be able to carry approximately 2,200 gallons, or nearly 15,000 pounds, of fuel out to a distance of 500 miles from a carrier. “The MQ-25 will give us the ability to extend the air wing out probably 300 or 400 miles beyond where we typically go,” he explained . Before October 2017, none of the companies working on the Stingray had revealed any substantial images of their concepts or a prototype. Two months earlier, a photo had emerged of one of Northrop Grumman’s X-47Bs in a tanker configuration, but it was unclear whether or not this was indicative of the state of their work or some other proof of concept testing. With the firms having tailored their original UCLASS proposals to a completely different mission set, Rob Weiss, head of Lockheed’s Skunk Works advanced projects office, told USNI News in March 2017 that he expected all of the competitors to have to significantly rework their designs . However, General Atomics is now the first company to show off a full concept for the new tanking-focused MQ-25 and their aircraft bears significant similarities to its Sea Avenger concept . The firm’s Stingray design has notably fewer low-observable or stealthy features and a thicker central fuselage. It also appears to have a new, less complex wing design with winglets and less overall sweep, but otherwise it has the same basic configuration with the engine intake on top and a v-tail. General Atomics’ Sea Avenger concept art., GA-ASI Terry Kraft, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who is now Vice President of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, told USNI News that the revised drone has an electro-optical sensor turret under the nose, just like the company’s existing Predators, Reapers, and Avengers, as well as a full retractable landing gear similar in basic arrangement to that of the Navy’s now retired S-3 Viking carrier based anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Most notably, General Atomics has reportedly added in a system that allows deck crews to direct the drone automatically using standard hand signals. Kraft did not explain how this system worked, but it would undoubtedly involve one or more cameras in the aircraft’s turret or otherwise placed around its fuselage along with a computer brain and specialized software to detect and translate a person’s motions into specific actions. The X-47B demonstrators used this experimental hand control for deck handling. General Atomics proposal will supposedly use hand signals alone. , USN That the overall design of the General Atomics submission is similar to the carrier-capable Sea Avenger concept isn’t particularly surprising. The earlier proposal was an underappreciated UCLASS contender and had many features that made it relatively easy to to convert from a strike and reconnaissance platform into a tanker . The Sea Avenger was already likely the cheapest of the UCLASS proposals and the revised Stingray derivative only appears to be a less complex design at base. Thanks to the work on that program and nearly a decade of work on the Avenger, much of the underlying technology is probably fairly mature, too, which would only help drive costs further down. All of the features made Sea Avenger a dark horse contender at the time could combine to turn General Atomics’ bid into an easy favorite to become the MQ-25. The company’s concept art only shows a single Cobham buddy store – a known Navy requirement – under one wing and a standard drop tank under the other, but there’s no reason why the new design couldn’t accommodate additional plumbed pylons, just like the Sea Avenger, for even more fuel, making it an even more attractive option. Of course, we have yet to see even a glimpse of the offerings from Boeing and Lockheed Martin. A General Atomics Avenger on display in Palmdale, California, with various inert weapons highlighting possible load outs, in 2012., USN The wider main fuselage offers immediate space for other mission packages if required in the future. The Navy might already be in the process of realizing it was passing up the possibility to get a much more significant capability out of the MQ-25 by focusing almost exclusively on tanking. “You can see a future for weaponization, you could see a future for ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] capability,” General Atomics’ Kraft noted to USNI News. “The Navy has already asked us to put hooks in there for a radar and I think it’s very logical that the first spiral would be some type of radar installation.” The U.S. Navy is also buying Northrop Grumman’s MQ-4C Triton drone, a derivative of the RQ-4 Global Hawk, for long-range maritime surveillance , but it is far too large and fragile to operate effectively from a carrier’s deck. The addition of a search radar capable of detecting targets in the air or at sea would be a relatively easy and sensible addition to the Stingray that could expand the sensor capabilities of the carrier battle group as a whole. An off the shelf passive electronic intelligence suite seems like another highly logical addition, as would installing a powerful network node akin to the U.S. Air Force’s Battlefield Airborne Communications Node to help relay information between various platforms. At present, the carrier air wing’s small number of E-2D Hawkeyes performs the long-range radar functions. The Navy is heavily invested in expanding the interconnected nature of it ships and aircraft as part of the overarching Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) network , which includes the Cooperative Engagement Capability net the video above outlines in more detail. This setup uses various data links to share information between various platforms, extending the range at which they can spot and engage enemy targets. In theory this means that a destroyer could fire a surface-to-air or surface-to-surface missile at a target beyond the range of its own sensors based on information from another ship or aircraft. An MQ-25 with a radar, even in a detachable pod, would add another valuable node to this network. The Navy is also buying increasingly advanced weapons, such as Lockheed Martin’s stealthy Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), that can act autonomously based both on data from off board sensors and its own systems. All of this continues to beg the question of why the Navy has been so laser-focused on the tanking requirement for the MQ-25 in recent months. There area readily available off-the-shelf intelligence and networking components that it would not take much effort for any of the Stingray competitors to integrate into their final designs. “At the end of the day, the UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] is a truck,” Kraft said himself to USNI. He’s not wrong and we will be watching intently to see what the Navy ultimately decides to load onto the Stingray.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 29, 2019","GM Thinks Its Stealthy, Optionally-Manned Truck Platform Could Change the US Army","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) 2017 annual meeting and expo, General Motors made hard pitch for its stealthy hydrogen-powered 4×4 Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure, which can operate in manned and unmanned modes, as a vehicle that could revolutionize how the U.S. Army fights, whether it carries cargo or a directed energy weapon . The company has already been working closely with the service on the technology, but it’s still limited by a lack of supporting infrastructure. GM gave an in depth presentation to attendees of the event on Oct. 9, 2017, showing off a full-size mockup of the 4×4 “platform,” a chassis that can take on the various roles by simply swapping out the body kit on top. The company had revealed the system , also known as SURUS, earlier in October 2017, suggesting it would be equally useful in conflicts, after natural disasters, and for basic commercial trucking. Still, it seems clear that the automotive firm is heavily focused on the martial applications. The vehicle’s name is a forced acronym, a reference to Surus , or “the Syrian,” a war elephant from Hannibal’s army that famously marched over the Alps against the Roman Empire at the end of the third century BC. Charlie Freese, executive director of GM’s Global Fuel Cell Business, explained at the AUSA expo that Surus had served as a platform to help the one-eyed Carthaginian general better survey the battlefield and give him and his forces an advantage over their enemies. SURUS itself follows from an earlier collaboration between GM’s Chevrolet Division and the U.S. Army that began in October 2016 . The firm had supplied a prototype hydrogen fuel cell-powered 4×4 light truck, called the ZH2, which the service had experimented with over the following 12 months. https://youtube.com/watch?v=do3u8x59a1A The ZH2’s most obvious advantage over existing vehicles, such as the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, better known as the Humvee or Hummer , was the highly efficient fuel cell powerplant, which when combined with an on board battery system, produced a total of 174 horsepower over an undisclosed range. The time it took to “charge” the hydrogen fuel cell was only as long as it took an individual to fill up the fuel tanks, shorter than the average time it takes to recharge an entirely electric vehicle of similar size. Perhaps most important, the entire arrangement is both quiet and produces relatively little heat compared to an internal combustion engine. This makes the vehicle harder for an enemy force to detect, especially at night, making it perfect for powering a stealthy surveillance vehicle. GM’s team at AUSA said that in test exercises the ZH2 prototype had been able to take Army scouts to within 330 feet of the their objective, letting them gather information and then withdraw, all without the “opposing force” ever knowing they were there. In addition, GM made sure to give the ZH2 the ability to act as a mobile generator when not moving, able to provide 25 kilowatts of power, on par with many commercially available emergency home generators , through standard 120- and 240-volt outlets. And as a byproduct of the ZH2’s power generation process, the hydrogen from the fuel cell bonds with oxygen, producing two gallons potable drinking water per hour – explaining GM’s trademark for the technology, Hydrotec. This could easily help sustain longer patrols and other operations where small units might find themselves without direct logistical support. The Chevy ZH2., GM All of these features carry over to the SURUS chassis, but in upgraded forms. Most importantly, GM is using a second generation fuel cell for the vehicle and has also entered into a partnership with Honda to continuing developing improved versions and produce them in the United States. The platform itself is inherently modular and GM envisions that it will even able to accept a traditional truck body similar in basic shape to that of ZH2. However, the 4×4 light truck is by far the most basic concept the company showed at AUSA. Other variations included a manned cargo truck with a flat rear bed, as well as a robotic version to perform those duties even in dangerous situations, including combat, and help reduce the risk to drivers, both from hazards and fatigue. SORUS configured with a high-energy solid state laser. , Joseph Trevithick With the significant on-board electricity generation, though, GM says it is interesting in promoting SURUS as an option for carrying various “power dense” equipment, including air- and surface-search radars, lasers and other directed energy weapons, and even more conventional arms such as the six-round 227mm artillery rocket launcher found on the U.S. Army’s and Marine Corps’s existing truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). Manned and unmanned scouts, akin to the ZH2 prototype, with a variety of high-powered sensors, including radars, electro-optical cameras, and infrared imaging systems, were another option the company proposed at AUSA. A model of an unmanned SURUS with the HIMARS rocket launcher., Joseph Trevithick On top of that, GM was quick to highlight the ability for commanders to use the platform’s modular nature to rapidly reconfigure it in the field. In light of recent, devastating hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, such as Hurricane Maria , representatives pointed out that the vehicle could easily provide power generation and mobile medical facilities in an emergency. As of Oct 9, 2017, approximately 85 percent of Puerto Rico remained without power and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was still working on getting generators to the island and then to areas in need. A model of an unmanned SURUS generating station, with solar panels to also help recharge the on board batteries., Joseph Trevithick SURUS isn’t in a position to help out with the present disaster relief efforts, unfortunately. A lack of ready infrastructure to support hydrogen fuel cell vehicles remains a significant limiting factor and one that GM is well aware of. There still aren’t enough convenient filling stations, or the basic hydrogen fuel production capacity, to make it commercially attractive. But when the ZH2 first appeared, Wired noted that the Army was in a potentially ideal position to make use of the technology. It is possible to convert JP-8 jet fuel, which the U.S. military already has a steady supply of in its logistics chain. “The advantage of hydrogen is that you can get it from almost any other form of energy, renewable, grid, or conventional liquid fuels,” GM’s Freese told Wired at the time. “You could put a reformer up near forward stations, and strip the hydrogen off the JP-8.” A possible configuration of the power outlets for running separate equipment as seen on the SURUS mockup., Joseph Trevithick That process would require its own infrastructure and would still require the Army to set up its own figurative jet fuel “pipeline” for the vehicles. It would be much more likely that the service would chose to pay for hydrogen fuel made from natural gas, a much more common production method. GM has already invested more than $2 billion in Hydrotec, hoping that eventually that infrastructure will catch up for the commercial market as it has already done for electric vehicles. Large sales to the Army or other branches of the U.S. military could definitely help drive down costs and expand both the military and commercial markets. The partnership with Honda is another important development to distribute the burden of both research and development and production. GM’s Charlie Freese stands next to the SURUS mock up at AUSA 2017., Joseph Trevithick At the same time, though, electric car manufacturers, notably Elon Musk’s Tesla, are also looking to expand their businesses into producing larger commercial trucks , which could easily have similar military applications. Those developments could have an inherent advantage over hydrogen powered vehicles because of the advanced state of existing infrastructure, including high density battery production and charging station designs. GM definitely appears to be pushing for military contracts to keep the promising technology moving forward, but SURUS could turn out to be more like its namesake than the company might want, the last of its kind after a bold, but ultimately futile maneuver.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 18, 2018",Russia Tests Modified RS-24 Ballistic Missile With an “Experimental Warhead”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it has successfully tested a new version of its RS-24 Yars nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with an “experimental warhead” design. The three-warhead configuration could make the weapon more accurate, as well as harder for an opponent to track and intercept. The Russian Strategic Missile Force conducted the test launch from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the northwestern Arkhangelsk Oblast, flying approximately 3,500 miles before impacting the Kura Missile Test Range in Kamchatka Krai on the other side of the country. It was unclear whether or not this was the first test of the new warhead arrangement on the RS-24, which first entered service in December 2010. “The main purpose of the launch was to reaffirm the reliability of a batch of the same class missiles,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, according to state-run media outlet TASS . “The experimental warheads reached the designated area at the Kura proving ground in the Kamchatka Peninsula. The targets were met and tasks accomplished in full.” That the RS-24, also known as the Topol-MR, carried multiple warheads was already well established. From all accounts, the initial version was simply a modification of the original RS-12M Topol-M to allow it to carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs, each able to strike a separate target. The United States has argued that the new designation is simply an attempt to circumvent existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) limitations on the total number of warheads U.S. and Russian forces can have available on ICBMs. Though Russian media has reported that each Topol-MR carried as many as 10 individual nuclear weapons , experts believed the actual number is far lower . Each one reportedly has a yield of between 150 and 250 kilotons. In a typical MIRV arrangement, the missile holds all of the warheads in a single stage that detaches from the rest of the weapon after launch. This unit can independently maneuver once it leaves the earth’s atmosphere, releasing each warhead over an individual target. You can see the basic sequence in the video below. According to a report by The Diplomat , the newly modified RS-24s have what are known as independent post-boost vehicles, or IPBVs. Instead of a single stage with all the warheads, this configuration essentially consists of multiple vehicles that break off after launch and then speed toward their final destination. The difference between when and how the missile releases its warheads may seem academic. However, the new Yars’ design could have a major impact on its ability to strike independent targets and break through and future missile defenses. Yars launch in September tested parallel deployment of warheads https://t.co/9Ssdyxw2cD (thanks to @artjomh for the image) pic.twitter.com/aiUUON9Uhi — Pavel Podvig (@russianforces) October 4, 2017 Though a MIRV-capable missile can release a number of individual nuclear weapons, they’re all attached to a single main unit that is flying on a relatively linear course. As such, the warheads can only hit targets in relatively close proximity to that path, which one can see in the still impressive photographs of these vehicles re-entering the atmosphere during tests. A time-lapse shot showing MIRVs re-entering the atmosphere during a test of the LGM-118A Peacekeeper missile. , US Army With an IPBV setup, it is possible that the warheads will be able to chart a course that is much more independent of the main missile’s trajectory, allowing a single ICBM to attack across a far wider area. It could also make for more precise targeting, since the vehicles would not be restricted to the same degree to a single flight path. The road-mobile version of Russia’s RS-24 Yars ICBM., Vitaly Kuzmin On top of that, the new warheads could then be harder for and opponent to monitor in flight or to knock out with a ballistic missile defense system, especially since the warheads would remain clustered together as a single object for a much shorter period of time. At present, the United States, for instance, relies heavily on its Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites to detect the heat of missile launches and then track their flight even when they “go cold.” For mid-course monitoring, various radars, other sensors, and communications nodes contribute to the overall picture and make sure the information gets where it needs to go. A projectile that more rapidly turns into multiple projectiles each heading on significant different courses could possibly overwhelm the capabilities of this network. This would present a challenge for any attempt to intercept the warheads during this mid-course flight, as well. The ability for the post-boost vehicles to fly on significant different trajectories might allow them to dodge past the U.S. military’s existing Ground-based Mid-course Defense and SM-3 Block IIA interceptors’ engagement envelopes. In May 2016, a Russian television special on the Yars already claimed that its warheads had advanced maneuvering capability to defeat interceptors Though the United States say its ballistic missile defense projects aren’t aimed at limiting the credibility of Russia’s or China’s nuclear deterrents, both countries publicly express concerns that this will be the end result all the same. It seems almost certain that the new version of the RS-24 is in direct response to the Kremlin’s concerns. It seems likely that the Russians could combine the IPBV concept with additional decoys and countermeasures, as well. In addition, earlier in 2017, the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center highlighted that “Russian officials claim a new class of hypersonic vehicle, probably called ‘object 4202,’ is being developed to allow Russian strategic missiles to penetrate missile defense systems,” in its latest public review of global ballistic and cruise missile developments. We at The War Zone have already written in depth about how hypersonic projectiles could easily add an entirely new dimension to warfare in general and be a serious challenge to existing ballistic missile defense systems. In June 2017, I wrote : A hypersonic weapon, able to carry a nuclear or a conventional warhead could upend this calculus entirely. The most common design involves a booster of some sort, often a rocket motor, which gets the craft going fast enough for an air-breathing high-speed jet engine to take over. Once at its cruising speed, these powerplants becomes highly efficient. But more importantly, this air-breathing engine generates a very different signature from a rocket motor, meaning space-based surveillance assets might not be able to spot one as quickly or keep tracking it during flight, or even spot it at all for that matter. On top of that, prototype designs look much more like super-fast flying cruise missiles or drones, able to fly in more erratic ways well within the atmosphere, maybe even changing course in mid-flight relatively rapidly. This could make any such weapon more accurate, since it could make more corrections before impact, as well. A projectile flying at a mile a second would be too much to process in general for even the most fast-scanning surface- and airborne radars that exist at present, and even if they could be tracked, engaging something going that speed within the atmosphere represents a huge set of problems of its own. The RS-24’s new warhead may only be one part of an expanding strategic missile arsenal that also includes other ICBMs with a hypersonic payload. With this in mind, it’s worth noting, following the RS-24 test in September 2017, there was a separate launch of an older Topol-M with an unspecified “advanced combat payload” later that month, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense . These new warhead designs have the distinct potential to reignite the existing disputes between the United States and Russia about whether the Kremlin is abiding by its START and New START treaty obligations with the RS-24 design to begin with. Starting with the Russian’s position, however dubious, that Yars is an all new design, reconfiguring the missile’s warheads, but not changing the overall number, would not necessarily amount to a new violation of the agreements. Still, Russia continues to see focusing on warhead designs to defeat missile defenses and otherwise expand capabilities as a cheaper avenue than designing all new missiles. This is an always important consideration for the Russians, who have seen their economy contract since 2014, in no small part due to the collapse of the global price of oil. This has forced them to significantly scale back or otherwise put on hold a number of advanced military modernization projects . It’s very possible that if the Russians have success with the IPBV concept, showing that it offers a cost-effective way to challenge opposing missile defenses and increase the overall flexibility of a country’s strategic missile forces, that we could see other countries move to adopt similar systems. The United States is similarly in the process of developing an all-new ground-launched ICBM as part of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program. “I think some of the technologies and processes we saw, during the Peacekeeper program, we will see again,” U.S. Air Force Major General Anthony Cotton, in charge of the U.S. military’s ICBM forces, said during a visit to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota on Sept. 29, 2017, referring to the now retired LGM-118A missile , which had a MIRV warhead configuration. “But, I think the next game changer is one I haven’t seen yet – and that is GBSD.” The Air Force’s remaining LGM-30G Minuteman III missiles only have a single warhead. The U.S. Navy’s submarine-launched Trident II D5 missiles are MIRVed. Of course, it’s almost guaranteed that the United States and the Russians are closely watching each other’s ICBM developments. If the Kremlin has any success with this new IPBV arrangement, this might impact the U.S. Air Force’s own thinking.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 11, 2018",What You Need To Know About Why U.S. Special Operations Forces Are In Niger (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The deaths of three U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers in Niger have brought American operations in the country under new scrutiny. At the same time, the Pentagon has been especially tight-lipped about the nature of the incident, despite a wealth of publicly available information, calling into question the exact nature of the “advise and assist” mission in the West African country. On Oct. 4, 2017, a still unknown group attacked a patrol of both American special operators and Nigerien security forces in the vicinity of the village of Tongo Tongo, which is less than 20 miles due south of the border with Mali. The next day, U.S. Africa Command, which oversees all U.S. military missions on the continent, confirmed that three Americans were dead, two were wounded, and that “one partner nation member” had died, but little else. Few official details “We’re – they’re ongoing operations and we’re gonna – no more details right now,” Dana White, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said during a press briefing on Oct. 5, 2017, which became a common refrain to questions about the attack. “I’m gonna have to just tell you, ongoing operations, we’re not prepared to go in any details on them right now.” It’s no secret that the U.S. military has ongoing operations in Niger and in neighboring countries. In February 2013, President Barack Obama told Congress , as required by the War Powers Resolution, that he had deployed approximately 100 American personnel to the country in order to run a drone surveillance outfit. In June 2017, President Donald Trump sent his own such letter , indicating that this number had increased more than six fold. Those approximately 645 individuals “provide training and security assistance to the Nigerien Armed Forces, in their efforts to counter violent extremist organizations in the region,” U.S. Africa Command said in their second press release regarding the Tongo Tongo incident. The U.S. government has previously acknowledged this detail, too. A US Army Special Forces soldier trains with Nigerien forces in 2017., US Army However, anonymous sources told The New York Times that the Special Forces personnel had been on a “reconnaissance patrol” with their Nigerien counterparts at the time, suggesting that these advisory personnel have been taking an increased role in actual field. This is in line with activities the Pentagon has described as “advise and assist” in nature – many of which seem very close to active combat by any basic definition – in other countries, such as Iraq , Syria , and Somalia . The 30 minute firefight occurred after the combined group came into contact with a group of militants in technicals in an apparent ambush. The Pentagon has so far declined to officially characterize the nature of the engagement in any specific way. French helicopters and fixed wing combat aircraft participated in the immediate response, as well as a subsequent operation that Nigerien forces conducted in response to the attack. The Times said that gunships, which would have most likely been Airbus Helicopters Tigers , helped beat back the militants during the incident itself. French media said that other helicopters – either NHIndustries NH90 , Aérospatiale Pumas , or Eurocopter Super Pumas – helped rush casualties back to Niamey for medical treatment. Mirage 2000 fighter jets were also involved at some point, according to French media reports. It’s not clear who called in the French, but both the U.S. and Nigerien militaries closely coordinate with that country’s forces in the region. In August 2014, France began Operation Barkhane , a broad counter-terrorism operation covering Burknia Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, involving approximately 4,000 French personnel. There are Tigers and other helicopters forward deployed in the Malian city of Gao, approximately 150 miles northwest of Tongo Tongo, and Mirages in the Chadian Capital N’Djamena, 900 miles or so to the east. More transport helicopters could have been situated in Niger’s capital Niamey, where France has based its MQ-9 Reaper and EADS Harfang drones. French task forces routinely conduct dispersed operations, as well. Pentagon spokesperson Dana White would not say whether or not there was any American air support on call. The Times reported that drones were operating in the area from the U.S. Air Force’s own base in Niamey. Nigerien soldiers during a US-led training exercise in 2017., US Army A rough neighborhood It’s hardly surprising that U.S. forces are in Niger, given its particularly strategic location. As a center point for the Pentagon’s counter-terrorism efforts in North and West Africa, grouped together under an overarching operation nicknamed Juniper Shield , there are few better countries. To the north, there is Libya, where militants and terrorists have exploited the chaotic situation that followed the ouster of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, in no small part thanks to a NATO-led, United Nations-backed coalition. Most recently, a faction of ISIS has emerged as a continuing threat in that country’s central desert after American-backed forces loyal to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli ousted the terrorists from the coastal city of Sirte. The situation in Libya also opened the flood gate for militants that Gaddafi had supported, including ethnic Tuaregs , to blitz across Algeria and Niger and into Mali, where they joined together with Islamist terrorists. Their rapid gains in 2012 precipitated a crisis that led to the Malian military to depose that country’s president, Amadou Toumani Toure, after they became infuriated with his poor handling of the situation. The United States later acknowledged it had bungled earlier attempts to train Mali’s security forces. With American backing, France intervened, eventually turning things over to a United Nations approved peacekeeping mission in 2013. United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, also known by its French acronym MINUSMA , remains in the country today, along with a European Union-run military assistance mission and a limited American military presence also tasked with aiding the country’s security forces. US special operators inspect Malian special forces in 2010., SOCAFRICA Since 2013, various militant groups have repeatedly split, reformed, and reformulated themselves as a host of different organizations, routinely experiencing friction due to competing agendas and ideologies. Underscoring the complexities of keeping these entities straight, in March 2017, a portion of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Tuareg-Islamist group Ansar Dine, and another Al Qaeda-linked umbrella organization known as Al Mourabitoun, announced they had joined forces to form Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin ( JNIM ), or the “Group to Support Islam and Muslims” (GSIM). On top of that, in 2016, another ISIS-aligned faction , Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) emerged in Mali. ISGS is made up of members of Al Mourabitoun who had declined to re-dedicate themselves to Al Qaeda’s cause. As if all of this weren’t enough, to the south, Niger borders northern Nigeria, where yet another Islamist group, Boko Haram , began its own reign of terror in 2009. The group prompted international outrage in 2014 when they kidnapped more than 250 school girls from the town of Chibok . In 2015, its leadership declared they become part of ISIS, sometimes referring to itself as the Islamic State-West Africa (IS-WA). Though it seems likely that one of the groups in Mali was responsible for the attack near Tongo Tongo, given the proximity to that country’s border, it is possible that any of these other regional groups could have been involved in the ambush. An official U.S. Defense Media Activity news story described the incident under the subheader “Fighting Al-Qaida in Africa,” but it was unclear if this was an indication that JNIM or another Al Qaeda faction was behind the assault. There’s always the potential for a new group to present itself or for the militants to ultimately turn out to just be smugglers or bandits who also make use of the regions many unpopulated and therefore ungoverned spaces. The aftermath of a Boko Haram attack in Nigeria in 2015., Kyodo via AP Images A quietly expanding mission With all of these security concerns, it makes sense that the U.S. military would be interested in Niger. This wasn’t always the case, though. As of 2011, U.S. Africa Command had it second to last in “engagement priority” of 11 countries in the “Trans-Sahara” region, also known as the Sahel, which separates North Africa from the true Sub-Saharan part of the continent, according to one official briefing. A briefing slide should US Africa Command’s “engagement priority” in the Sahel as of 2011., AFRICOM Libya was dead last in importance to the overarching mission, then known as Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara, or OEF-TS . This was the military component of a whole-of-government effort to bring together countries in the region known as the Trans Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). Niger was placed so low due in part to unspecified “limited access due to current USG [U.S. government] policies.” Critics do say that Niger’s President Mahamadou Issoufou, who has been in charge since 2011, of effectively being a dictator, accusing him of various human rights abuses . Those same complaints apply to almost all of the members of the TSCTP, though. Regardless, when Gaddafi’s government collapsed and took Mali with it, things quickly began to change. In 2013, under President Obama’s direction, the U.S. Air Force stood up the 409th Air Expeditionary Group, Detachment 2 to manage an unspecified number of MQ-9 Reapers flying from an American managed portion of the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aérienne 101, itself tacked onto Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey. The Reapers’ main job initially was to help keep tabs on the situation in Mali, feeding information back to American and French personnel on the ground as part of an effort that eventually became known as Operation Juniper Micron. The 768th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron eventually came to manage day-to-day activities at the so-called at the site. US Air Force Lieutenant General Richard Clark, Third Air Force commander, looks out over the flight line in Niamey in 2016., USAF A year after Obama first announced the drone operation, Niger’s then Interior Minister, Massoudou Hassoumi, implied to Radio France Internationale that having American and French forces present was the least those countries could do after throwing the entire region into chaos by deposing Gaddafi in Libya without having a clear plan to stabilize the situation. The countries responsible for that should “provide an after-sales service” and intervene in Libya again, he said . As the fighting in Mali dragged on, the situation in Libya didn’t stabilize. Just the opposite happened and in July 2014, U.S. Marines helped the remaining U.S. embassy staff in Tripoli evacuate to neighboring Tunisia . There had been something of a surge in terrorist attacks in Algeria, too, thanks to many of the same groups operating in northern Mali. By the end of 2014, the U.S. military had begun working to expand the facilities at the Nigerien Air Force’s Base Aérienne 201, attached to Manu Dayak International Airport in the city of Agadez far to the northeast of Niamey. The United States’ planned establish the necessary facilities for another MQ-9 Reaper operation, set to be ready soon, according to Stars and Stripes . U.S. military and contractor-operated manned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft also operate across Africa. Today, the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron manages the goings and comings of American aircraft and personnel at Agadez. The 409th Air Expeditionary Group has moved its main base of operations to Niamey, inactivating the separate Detachment 2. Detachment 1, which managed drone flights from the Seychelles for a time before moving inland to Arba Minch in Ethiopia, also no longer exists . US Air Force personnel standard guard as others unload a C-130J cargo aircraft at the base in Agadez., USAF Boots on the ground Though the drone missions command the most public attention, they reflect only a small portion of the activities the Pentagon has publicly, though discreetly, acknowledged in Niger. In 2015, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the U.S. military’s main logistics arm, bought and prepositioned aviation fuel at Zinder Airport , less than 100 miles north of the Nigerian border, to serve as a pit stop for American aircraft. More recently, in August 2017, DLA issued new contract documentation for fuel purchases across Africa. The list included planned deliveries of gasoline and diesel fuel, the kind of things you need to run trucks and mobile generators, for another five locations scattered around the country. The money would come from accounts linked to Special Operations Command Africa, the lead organization responsible for the Trans-Sahara military assistance mission, which had morphed from OEF-TS into Operation Juniper Shield sometime in 2013. At present, special operations activities in the region are coordinated by a forward deployed headquarters known as Special Operations Command Forward – North and West Africa, or SOCFWD-NWA. Among other things this organization runs the annual Flintlock special operations exercise , which generally rotates to a different country each year. This year’s iteration involved dispersed drills in Burkina Faso, Chad, Cameroon, Niger, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. Airmen from the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron move a generator in Agadez., USAF The sites in Niger that DLA’s listed contract documents are almost assuredly where both U.S. special operations and conventional forces perform these training and “advise and assist” missions with the Nigerien military, including the one that American special operators were on when they came under attack near Tongo Tongo. One of these locations, Ouallam, is roughly half way between Niamey and this small village and it might have been where the personnel on patrol were based. It’s not clear how well staffed or supported any of these locations are on a day-to-day basis. It is entirely possible that Americans only temporarily occupy them during specific training events, staying at larger facilities in populated centers like Niamey the rest of the time. We do know that just getting from one to the other can be dangerous given Niger’s limited infrastructure. The United Nations placed the desperately poor country second to last in the world in its Human Development Index for 2016. Central African Republic was lowest on the list. In February 2017, a member of the U.S. Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) died during “ routine administrative movement ” – that is to say traveling, likely by car or truck, from one location to another – somewhere in Niger. In 2015, the 3rd transitioned from focus on operations in Afghanistan to missions in Africa, taking the place of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) as the main provider of special operations forces for activities on the continent. Though the Pentagon has not publicly confirmed it, anonymous sources have told various media outlets that it was Special Forces soldiers from this unit that died in the ambush eight months later. US Air Force personnel patrol part of the American base in Agadez., USAF A high risk location? We don’t know whether or not the remote and austere nature of many of these sites in Niger puts American personnel at any higher risks should they become seriously injured for any reason. Pentagon spokesperson Dana White did not answer questions at the Oct. 5, 2017 press briefing about what sort of on-call medical support was available, if any, at the time of the attack in Tongo Tongo. There is an indication that there might be additional dangers simply due to Niger’s geography and the distance between major population centers. In the January-March 2017 edition of Special Warfare , the Army’s official special operations journal, Colonel Robert Wilson, a former commander of the 3rd Special Forces Group, painted what seemed like a pretty bleak picture. “Prolonged field care and sustaining a casualty for a very long time is something very different than what we find in the continental United States. We are spread out with limited medical resources in a very challenging environment with tremendous threats from not only the enemy but also from the geography, which is new to us,” he explained. “Our surgeons and our Special Forces medical sergeants are doing a phenomenal job taking a new approach medically. It affects our mission and how we prepare for our mission.” Since at least 2014, U.S. Transportation Command, by way of the U.S. Navy and Air Force, has managed a contract to stage one fixed wing aircraft and one rotary wing aircraft at Niamey to support personnel recovery, casualty evacuation, and airlift services on a 24 hours, seven days a week basis. Draft contract documentation stated that firm providing the services could typically expect 48 hours notice before a mission, but would have to be ready to go within three hours. At the direction of the local commander, they could end up on a one-hour alert posture. Each aircraft had to be able to accommodate four casualties on litters at a time. In August 2017, the U.S. military approved a request to award a contract to straight to Berry Aviation without a competition to continue to providing this support. Transportation Command officials argued that they needed to keep the company at work while it solicited bids for the next deal in order to prevent there being a gap in the critical service. “In Africa, the medical conditions requiring CASEVAC [casualty evacuation] services are typically related to wounds from enemy fire or fighting,” the so-called Justification and Approval document explained. “There is no ambulance or emergency medical service to support the US military in these austere locations, other than the contracted services requested. The need for these critical support services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would jeopardize the lives of the US military members in the area which is not acceptable.” We do not know what the status of Berry Aviation’s aircraft in Niamey was at the time or whether they were conducting other missions at the time. According to earlier contract documents, the two aircraft are available to commanders throughout North and West Africa, not just Niger, as necessary. We know contractors ferried an airman in need of unspecified medical care from a location in Niger to the Landstuhl military hospital at least once in September 2016. This contractor operated Gulfstream III transported an airman in need of medical care to from Niger to Germany in September 2016., USAF Under the microscope now “That’s an operational issue that I’m not going to discuss,” White insisted at the Pentagon presser when asked about casualty evacuations. “Partner operations are ongoing even today, so I’m not going to be able to go into any more detail on that.” But the Pentagon’s reticence to discuss this issue, and virtually anything else about the attack in Niger, seems curious given the extent of what is known about the U.S. military’s operations in the country. Part of that could be due to President Trump’s instance that the United States has given too much information away to its enemies in the past, promising during his campaign and after winning the election to withhold more details about overseas military activities. It could be due to reticence on the part of Niger’s own government to acknowledge the extent of their cooperation with the U.S. or French military. While many African governments are keen to accept support from the United States, they are well aware that their citizenry may feel that it is evidence of an emerging neocolonial relationship and another reason to criticize their authority. It’s unclear how long the Pentagon will be able to continue withholding any real official information, especially if there is any suggestion American troops were in harm’s way without adequate support. The dead and wounded American special operators have already forced the U.S. military to acknowledge the basic details of this bizarre incident. Update: On Oct. 6, 2017, CNN reported that anonymous U.S. sources had told them that rescue forces had found a fourth U.S. Army Special Forces soldier dead in Niger after they became separated from the main group during the attack near Tongo Tongo. Later that day, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed this information, according to The Washington Examiner. CNN also noted that, in addition to French forces, more Special Forces soldiers had arrived in the area from the United States and the U.S. military positioned a U.S. Navy SEAL element at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily , Italy, a common staging point for American response forces into Africa. The Navy special operators did not ultimately deploy to Niger. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Land Special Operations"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 22, 2019",Saudis Kick Off Historic Moscow Visit With Plans to Buy S-400 Air Defense System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After experiencing a literal false start to the first ever trip by a ruling Saudi Arabian monarch to Moscow, the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has gone to have what his country has called “historic momentum” in expanding relations with the Kremlin, including reports of a purchase of S-400 surface-to-air missiles and other arms deals. As with developments in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates , this could indicate a political shift by the Saudi regime away from its historical ally the United States or an attempt to exert political pressure on officials in Washington. Salman and his entourage touched down in Russia on Oct. 4, 2017, ahead of four days of talks on a variety of economic and foreign affairs issues. It has immediately become clear that the visit will have widespread impacts both in terms of cooperation between the two countries and the future of foreign policy throughout the Middle East. “We have held detailed talks behind closed doors to talk about bilateral relations and the situation in the region,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a press conference on Oct. 5, 2017. “I can say that our relations are keynoted by the similarity of views on many regional and international problems,” the Saudi King added. The first day of discussions, which Putin described as “substantive, meaningful, and confidential,” nevertheless made international headlines. Particularly noteworthy were reports by the Saudi Arabia’s al-Arabiya television network, citing the state-run Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), that the country had signed a deal to buy the S-400 surface-to-air missile system. This is one of the most advanced weapons of its type at present anywhere in the world and the Russian manufacturers claim it can defeat a wide array of potential threats, including low-flying cruise missiles and stealth aircraft, when coupled with equally powerful radars. The Kremlin has used the deployment of these missiles to its Kaliningrad enclave in Northern Europe and with its forces in Syria as a means of sending a message to opponents in both regions. Whether or not the weapons actually match the official sales pitch , the United States and other western countries have acknowledged that they could represent a significant threat in a crisis. As such, sales of the system also become an important tool of Moscow’s foreign policy. S-400 missiles on an 8×8 wheeled launcher., Vitaly Kuzmin The U.S. government sees possible sales of any advanced surface-to-air missiles to Iran as a threat to its own interests and that of its allies in the Middle East. The Turkish government’s recent decision to buy the S-400 also provoked the ire of other NATO members, who say it doesn’t fit within the alliance’s standards and signals a lack of unity in the bloc. According to al-Arabiya, SAMI said there were deals in the works for TOS-1A thermobaric artillery rocket systems, seen in the video below, along with Kornet-EM guided anti-tank missiles, AGS-30 30mm automatic grenade launchers, and Kalashnikov AK-103 assault rifles, as well. The Saudi military industrial arm said the purchases were “based on the assurance of the Russian party to transfer the technology and localize the manufacturing and sustainment of these armament systems in the Kingdom.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=C1a755ybJbE The possibility of technology transfer is an important detail as it could help the Saudis build their own domestic production capabilities. Many of their other regional partners might be interested in the ability to buy such systems from a local supplier. The Saudis themselves have also recently run into roadblocks continuing similar existing agreements with certain western countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom , over its controversial intervention in Yemen . It is worth noting that SAMI provided no indication of when any of this equipment would arrive in Saudi Arabia. Russia also appeared to downplay the status of the arrangements. “There is some interest, of course,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, told Russia’s state-owned media outlet TASS. “Talks on S-400 are in progress, but there are no final decisions yet.” But if reports about the deal with Saudi Arabia turn out to be accurate, it could similarly indicate a possible political shift by the country’s monarchy away from its historic reliance on the United States.  It would be an especially significant development given the unprecedented American arms sales to the Kingdom announced earlier in 2017, which included both Patriot long-range surface-to-air missiles – a rough analogue to the S-400 – and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile interceptors . The Saudis already have Patriot systems in their inventory. A US Army Patriot missile launcher, similar to those Saudi Arabia already has in its arsenal., US Army This immediately calls into question why the Saudis would need to add S-400s to their arsenal. President Barack Obama and his administration had slow-rolled some arms deals with the Kingdom, in no small part over the situation in Yemen. President Donald Trump has shown no such qualms, though, making his first overseas trip after taking office to visit King Salman in May 2017. Since then, the Trump Administration has been publicly supportive of the Saudis and touted shared interests in fighting international terrorism and containing the influence of Iran in the Middle East and beyond. However, in June 2017, there was a major political shakeup , with Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, a younger member of the royal family widely known for overseeing the campaign in Yemen, taking the place of Mohammad bin Nayef Al Saud as Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. Many reports suggest that Mohammad bin Nayef is now under house arrest. The mental faculties of the aging King Salman have also come under scrutiny, further prompting concerns that Mohammad bin Salman is rapidly gaining more influence over the Kingdom’s affairs. It is possible that the young prince is interested in taking the country in a different direction or in retaliation for the United States offering less than unequivocal support as time has gone on for its dispute with Qatar . Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in May 2017., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP The Kingdom has also tried to soften its image by recently by finally giving women the right to drive cars , a long-standing public relations issue for the conservative Islamic country. Critics say it is token gesture that doesn’t do anything to free women from “ guardianship ” rules requiring them to receive the formal approval of a male relative to make many major personal and economic decisions. As with the United Arab Emirates possible purchase of Russian Su-35S fighter jets, the Saudis decision to buy weapons from the Kremlin could be a way to exert additional political pressure on the United states to push through more military aid or even gather additional information about the capabilities of their opponents. Iran, the Saudi’s major regional competitor, has long expressed an interest in buying the S-400, as well. Another possibility is that the Saudis see benefits in expanding cooperation with the Russian that are detached from its relationship with the United States and worth risking those historical ties over. Russia and Saudi Arabia both rely heavily on the money they make from the export of oil and other related products, though the Kremlin is not a member of the powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) bloc . In January 2017, the two parties signed a deal to try and stabilize the international price of oil, which has been in freefall for years and has had a serious impact on their respective economics. The arrangement “breathed life back into OPEC,” Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, said at the time . Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih speaks in Moscow in October 2017., Vitaliy Belousov/Sputnik  via AP With ISIS in retreat in Iraq and Syria, and the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad looking as firmly entrenched as ever , the Saudis may be looking at expanded ties with Moscow as a way to temper the Iranians from expanding their foothold in the region. King Salman and his advisers could easily feel that there is an opportunity to force Putin to decide between supporting them or the regime in Tehran. Notably, during his remarks on Oct. 5, 2017, the Saudi monarch reiterated his country’s long-standing demand that Iran stop meddling in the affairs of other countries in the region, but left out any call for Assad to step down. Saudi Arabia has been one of the most significant supporters of Syrian rebels fighting the government in Damascus, both rhetorically and in terms of actual weapons and supplies. It would not be difficult to imagine the Saudis offering to “trade” support for Syria to the Russians in exchange for a reduction in the Kremlin’s ties with Iran. If could, of course, be none of these things at all, but rather just a desire on the part of the Saudis to expand their ties with foreign governments in general and move beyond a more or less exclusive connection with the United States. The Trump Administration’s many political crises may just have prompted a desire to have more partners on the world stage. US President Donald Trump walks Saudi Arabia’s King Salman during his visit to the country in May 2017., Sipa via AP For its part, the Kremlin has been working steadily to expand its own relationships throughout the Middle East and North Africa, presenting itself an alternative to the U.S. government that is less likely to scrutinize a country’s human rights record and related policies. The Russians have already expanded their ties with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates , both also traditional U.S. partners in the region, as well as working with rogue general Khalifa Haftar in Libya, who opposes the American-backed government in that country. Whatever the Saudis’ reasoning is, this engagement will surely have an impact in U.S. foreign policy and its relationship with the Kingdom. At present, Saudi Arabia is likely the United State’s second most important ally in the region, with Israel being the first. The Trump Administration will need its support if it wants to advance any of its future regional goals, especially the desire to exert new pressure on Iran over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. And to be sure there’s no real indication that the Saudis, or the Emiratis or the Egyptians, are looking to dump the United States as a partner, but they are making it clear that they have alternatives if there were to be a more serious political dispute.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 29, 2019",The US Army Is Buying New Boats to Replace Vietnam-Era Landing Craft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has signed a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars for its first new boat – yes, boat – in decades, the Maneuver Support Vessel (Light), or MSV(L), which will replace dozens of Vietnam War-era landing craft. The design will greatly improve the ability of the service’s substantial, but largely unknown watercraft fleet , to haul cargo and otherwise support combat operations and other emergencies, including responding to natural disasters. Read all about the U.S. Army’s largely unknown Navy of its own in this past feature. On Sept. 28, 2017, the Army announced it had hired Vigor Works to build up to 36 of the new craft, with actual low-rate production of the first four boats expected to begin in 2021. The contract for the MSV(L)s is valued at just shy of $980 million. The Oregon-based boat maker is perhaps best known in defense circles for a series of stealthy special operations craft it built for the U.S. Navy. It also built DARPA’s unmanned submarine hunter named Sea Hunter . The company’s sprawling facility on Swan Island, in North Portland, supports a large mix of vessels, including many of those used for missile defense and those in Military Sealift Command’s inventory. Vigor claims its new floating dry dock , The Vigorous , is the largest in North America and it already has opened up its business portfolio to a whole new set of clients. “The range of operating environments our soldiers face today – and will face in the future –continues to grow more diverse,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Drushal, the service’s Transportation Chief, said in a statement after the announcement. “Our mariners need modern, capable vessels that can carry today’s Soldiers and equipment. Our commanders need the flexibility to maneuver in many different environments – including maneuvering from the sea.” Though Drushal’s comments might make this seem like a new and perhaps unusual capability for the Army, the service has operated a significant number of watercraft since the Second World War, during which it actually conducted more amphibious landings than the U.S. Marine Corps. Unfortunately, many of these craft are becoming increasingly old and unable to handle the growing size of Army ground vehicles and other equipment. They’ve also become increasingly vulnerable, even in the low-threat environments in which they would typically operate. An artist’s rendering of Vigor Works’ MSV(L) unloading an M1 Abrams tank on a beach., US Army Of the approximately 116 watercraft the Army had on hand in April 2016, 36 were dated Landing Craft Mechanized Mk 8s, also known as LCM-8s. The first of these boats entered service in 1967 as replacements for World War II and Korean War-era designs. They retained the basic configuration that many people are probably familiar with from watching movies and documentaries about the D Day Landings or the fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific during World War II. The boats have a long open main cargo hold with a ramp in the front that drops down when it hits the beach. At the rear, the crew pilots the vessel from inside a small cabin. It’s a crude, but functional configuration that has served the world over for years. The LCM-8s capabilities have become increasingly limited, though, able to carry a maximum of 53 tons of cargo at a speed of around 10 miles per hour. This was fine at a time when the U.S. Army’s main tank, the M60A1 Patton, weighed around 52 and a half tons. The latest version of M1 Abrams main battle tank, the M1A2 SEPv3 version, is over 70 tons . The service’s other vehicles, including the Stryker and its up-coming Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), have also grown steadily heavier, primarily under the weight of additional armor and other protective gear. Two US Navy LCM-8s, identical to the Army’s versions, carry vehicles back to amphibious ship during relief efforts in Haiti in 2010., USN “Army transportation investments over the last decade rightly prioritized vehicle capabilities, especially in the area of protection,” U.S. Army Colonel Dan Furber, the project manager for Transportation Systems, including watercraft, told the service’s reporters. “While that was the right thing to do, it also deferred investment in the watercraft fleet and created a mismatch between the size and weight of ground systems and the watercraft designed to carry them.” While Vigor – together with design firm BMT, shipbuilder Gladding-Hearn, and Northrop Grumman – will spend the next four years finalizing the MSV(L)’s shape and configuration, the boats will be able to carry one M1A2 SEPv3, two Stryker wheeled armored vehicles fitted with additional armor, or four JLTVs. The LCM-8s, which they are expected to replace one for one, cannot carry any of those loads. The goal is for the new vessels to be twice as fast and have nearly 100 miles of additional range over the older landing craft.  Most notably, the boats will have a so-called roll-through configuration with a typical ramp at the front along with a loading gate at the rear. US Army reservists and members of the Puerto Rico Army National Guard load a contain onto an LCM-8., US Army This is important because it gives the crew additional options for loading and unloading. With the rear loading gate, troops can just drive straight on rather than having to back up into position, which can be especially tricky with a tank or other large vehicle. In addition, the arrangement means Army mariners can take on cargo in the well deck of one of the Navy’s larger amphibious ships or sea bases and then depart without having to turn the entire boat around once they get out onto open water. Combined with the flat rear end of the craft, it could be easier to back up to an actual dock to unload instead of having to maneuver the angled front end into the proper position. The boat can still unload as normal on any open beach, sufficiently low dock, or other appropriate floating platform. “Watercraft are not something we buy very often, but they are essential to meeting Army-unique maneuver requirements,” Scott Davis, the Army’s program executive officer for combat support and combat service support systems, added to the service’s reporters. “Industry’s steadfast participation in our industry days and other engagements absolutely made our requirements clearer and set this program on the path to success.” It may seem like an odd requirement for the U.S. military’s main ground force to have in the first place, but the Army’s watercraft fleet makes a lot of sense. The service has troops forward deployed around the world, including in areas with large bodies of water that both provide an easy route to move personnel and supplies, as well as a potential impediment during a contingency. The Logistics Support Vessel USAV Major General Robert Smalls sits in port in Kuwait in front of two floating cranes with a similar in design to the LCM-8., US Army Having its own fleet means the Army doesn’t have to rely on the Navy for support or burden that service’s much larger amphibious ships and their landing craft with its routine needs. It can also speed up the loading and unloading of chartered commercial ships in permissive or non-combat scenarios. The U.S. military relies heavily on commercial shipping for moving heavy equipment around the world for both training and operational purposes. The MSV(L) “is the lynchpin to the Army’s watercraft strategy,” Colonel Michel Russell, chief for focused logistics within the Army’s Resource Management directorate’s Force Development division, said in 2016 . For this exact reason, the Army, as well as the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard , has LCM-8s, along with larger, seagoing Logistics Support Vessels and other types, situated at various strategic locations, including in the Pacific and the Persian gulf . In the Pacific region especially, the ability for the Army to move on water with a certain degree of independence from other services gives it much more flexibility to maneuver and redeploy to respond to rapidly changing situations. Watercraft could support the evacuation of American citizens from a war torn country or move aid around after a natural disaster, as well. For this reason, they’re important tools to have within the United States and its outlying territories, as well. The Puerto Rico Army National Guard has a detachment of the older landing craft, though we don’t know how well they weathered Hurricane Maria or whether they’ve been in use in the recovery efforts. As of 2016, more than 50 percent of the service’s entire watercraft fleet, 116 craft in total at the time, was in forward deployed preposition stocks , ready to go if necessary. Vigor’s new boats will only improve the capability and readiness of existing units, as well as the utility of the assets in storage, making sure the Army can still call upon this unique capability in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 11, 2018",Militants Kill American and Nigerien Troops in Ambush Near the Mali Border (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though many of the details are still unconfirmed, U.S. Africa Command has acknowledged that unspecified militants in southwestern Niger ambushed a patrol of Nigerien and American troops, killing as many as three Americans, wounding two more, and killing or wounding a number of Nigerien troops. Situated strategically in between Libya, Mali, and Nigeria, the Northwest African country has become an increasingly important hub for various U.S. counter-terrorism operations in the region. Radio France International (RFI) was among the first to report the incident on Oct. 4, 2017, claiming that several Nigerien and U.S. personnel had died in the attack near the village of Tongo Tongo, which sits less than 20 miles south of the border with Mali. The Nigeriens were reportedly part of the specialized Bataillon Sécurité et Renseignement (BSR), or Security and Intelligence Battalion. It is unclear what U.S. military unit or units the Americans may have belonged to or whether private contractors were involved in the mission. The Associated Press and The New York Times both reported that the U.S. personnel involved were U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers and the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) is presently regionally aligned to provide support to U.S. Africa Command. “U.S. Africa Command can confirm reports that a joint U.S. and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger,” the Pentagon’s top headquarters for operations in Africa said in an official release late on Oct. 4, 2017. “We are working to confirm details on the incident and will have more information as soon as we can confirm facts on the ground.” Namatta Abubacar, a local official for the region of Tillaberi in Niger, told Reuters that there were at least five dead, while another anonymous source confirmed that the ambush had occurred to the wire service. It was unclear what group or groups were responsible, but the proximity to Mali suggests the involvement of one of a number of militant and terrorist organizations operating in that country. In 2012, a cooperative of ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants seized control of much of Mali, prompting an international response. These groups have since split, reorganized, and reformed themselves numerous times and in numerous configurations, the most recent predominant group being the Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, or the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), which is aligned with Al Qaeda’s regional franchise Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In addition, the U.S. government says it has now identified at least one ISIS-aligned faction in West Africa. As such, a United Nations-authorized peacekeeping mission remains active in the country and both France and the United States conduct independent counter-terrorism operations in the region, as well. The U.S. military’s overarching operation across North and West Africa is nicknamed Juniper Shield. And while we don’t know what U.S. military elements may have been part of the operation, we do know that in August 2017, the Defense Logistics Agency included a forward location associated with Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAFRICA) at Ouallam, less than 60 miles south of Tongo Tongo, in contracting documents related to U.S. military facilities across Africa in need of fuel deliveries. It is very possible that the Americans present at the ambush were special operators operating out of this site. Based on publicly available information, we know that the U.S. military operates or otherwise has access to at least seven different sites in Niger, including the Nigerien Air Force bases in the capital Niamay and the city of Agadez to the northeast. The U.S. Air Force’s 768th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron runs day-to-day operations in Niamey, where the service has a number of MQ-9 Reaper drones, while the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron performs the same administrative functions at Agadez. Both units are assigned to the Air Force’s 409th Air Expeditionary Group, which has its headquarters in Niamey. “U.S. Forces are in Niger to provide training and security assistance to the Nigerien Armed Forces, including support for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) efforts, in their efforts to target violent extremist organizations in the region,” U.S. Africa Command added in their statement. “One aspect of that is training, advising and assisting the Nigeriens in order to increase their ability to bring stability and security to their people.” Training and advising Nigerien personnel is likely the primary mission of the personnel at the site in Ouallam, as well as other SOCAFRICA-run locations scattered throughout the country, including in the cities of Diffa, Dirkou, Tahou, and Tillia. UPDATE 6:25pm PST: Sources have told a number of outlets that the two wounded U.S. special operators were airlifted to the capital Niamey and would eventually be moved to Germany, likely to the Landstuhl military hospital. Since 2014, the U.S. Navy has hired contractors to perform personnel recovery , casualty evacuation, and airlift missions from Niamey, as necessary. Most recently, Berry Aviation held this contract, which required them to maintain one fixed wing aircraft and one helicopter in Niamey for on-call missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Breaks into US Soldiers’ iPhones in Apparent Hybrid Warfare Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army’s Asymmetric Warfare Group, tasked with finding ways to counter emerging threats, recently sounded the alarm about the dangers of Russia’s hybrid warfighting concepts and warned that the U.S. military as a whole may be ill-suited to respond to them in a crisis. Now, American troops and their NATO allies say they have been subjected to a campaign of surveillance and harassment via their cellphones, the internet, and social media, hallmarks of this so-called “Russian New Generation Warfare.” On Oct. 4, 2017, The Wall Street Journal published a report detailing a number of cyber attacks and other electronic assaults on NATO forces stationed in the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as Poland, all of whom are members of the alliance. U.S. officials and their allies all indicated that Russia was almost certainly behind the interference. “It had a little Apple map, and in the center of the map was Moscow. It said, ‘Somebody is trying to access your iPhone,’” U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Christopher L’Heureux explained to The Journal about an attack on his cell phone. “They were geolocating me, whoever it was. I was like, ‘What the heck is this?’” L’Heureux is presently in charge of the NATO battle group in Poland, a unit consisting of rotating troops from various alliance members. There are similar organizations in each one of the Baltic States as part of the alliance’s Enhanced Forward Presence concept aimed at deterring Russian aggression. The program is a direct response to Russia’s continued intervention in Ukraine and its revanchist foreign policy that has included a number of veiled threats against a countries along its western borders . A US Army soldier riding in a Stryker armored vehicle holds a patch with the flag of Poland during a visit to the country in 2015., Poland Ministry of National Defense The Army officer told The Journal that unspecified hackers had breached the phones and Facebook accounts of six troops under his command. One possibility is that Russian officials were looking to gauge the exact size, composition, and location of NATO forces in the area. However, additional incidents the newspaper uncovered point to a broader and potentially more serious campaign to harass alliance personnel and potentially confuse or disrupt operations. Since January 2017, troops in the Baltics and Poland have reported apparent intrusions into their personal phones where hackers mined their data, erased information, uploaded music, and remotely activated applications. Most worryingly, a source told The Journal about an incident in Latvia, where a stranger, likely a Russian intelligence agent, approached an American service member at a sporting event and then began dropping personal detail about them and their family in conversation. The same source mentioned a similar interaction on a train in Poland. These reports match up almost word for word with information the Asymmetric Warfare Group collected regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The unit explained in its December 2016 handbook on Russian New Generation Warfare that the hybrid strategy had effectively blended electronic and cyber warfare with psychological operations to disrupt Ukrainian military activities. A member of a Ukrainian artillery unit talks on a handheld radio., Ukraine Ministry of Defense “Electronic warfare devices allow Russian Forces to broadcast … messages directly against opposing Ukrainian forces as discussed earlier with cellular text messages,” the manual explained. “These can be very specific and directed at individuals, such as by threatening their wives and children by name, or generic and sent to entire units as was the case in Ukraine.” Kremlin-backed forces in Ukraine even coupled these unconventional assaults with conventional military operations. The Asymmetric Warfare Group described one instance where separatists, undoubtedly with Russian support, zeroed in on a Ukrainian position possibly by pinpointing its radio transmissions , hit it with artillery, then sent texts asking to their opponents “asking how they liked” the barrage. Off the battlefield, armed with information scraped from phones and social media, Russia could make things especially personal, sending Ukrainian soldiers “text messages on their phone with threats against their families and accurate information of family locations,” according to the handbook. “Tactics such as this can have a tremendously negative psychological impact on young soldiers that are out of direct contact with their loved ones.” Poland Ministry of National Defense The Asymmetric Warfare Group warned in the handbook that the potential for these problem was only likely to increase given that the incoming generation of American military personnel were “truly ‘digital natives’” who have spent their entire lives interaction with the internet and social media. The U.S. military would have to learn to balance this reality with the obvious need for operational security. “Digital operational security violations now have strategic-level implications,” the unit’s handbook noted. “Never before has the actions of one lone individual been so visible and prone to manipulation by the adversary.” Of course, the Baltics are no stranger to any of this and there are significant indications that the alliance had been growing increasingly concerned about these threats even before 2017. In March 2017, former Estonia President Toomas Hendrik Ilves went before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, ostensibly to talk about Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election campaign, but also on the broader emergence of cyber warfare. “Virtually every history of what is now known as ‘cyber-war’ or ‘cyber-warfare’ begins describing an attack on Estonia at six months into my presidency in 2007, when my country’s governmental, banking and news media servers were hit with ‘distributed denial-of-service’ or ‘DDOS attacks,’” he explained in his prepared remarks . “The attack on Estonia in 2007 was different and new. This was as far as we can tell the first time a nation-state had been targeted using digital means for political objectives.” Former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves at the Warsaw Security Forum in 2016., Alexey Vitvitsky/Sputnik via AP Not strictly speaking “hacking,” denial of service attacks bombard a website or websites with an extreme amount of traffic, effectively rending them unusable. Though this can impact a private company’s ability to conduct their business, assaults on government systems could slow the ability of authorities to disseminate information in a crisis or otherwise communicate with the public rapidly. Since then, Estonia in particular has been the subject of more active intrusions, including Russia’s abduction of Internal Security Service officer Eston Kohver in 2014. The Kremlin released Kohver after more than a year in a Cold War-esque prisoner swap for a suspected Russian spy the Estonian government had detained. It should be no surprise then that Estonia is also home to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence , which stood up in 2008. By 2015, the United States and 15 other alliance members contribute to its activities, and non-members Austria and Finland are also participants. The organization works to develop new technology, strategies, and tactics for cyber warfare operations, along with studying the international law surrounding them. In February 2017, it released the Tallinn Manual 2.0 , named after Estonia’s capital, an updated analysis of how international rules and regulations apply to cyber attacks and defenses. The importance of the legal aspect cannot be overstated, as there is still no consensus as to how severe an incident in cyberspace must be before a government can treat it the same way as a physical strike. Czech cyber security experts at work during a NATO exercise in 2016., NATO Still, “International cooperation of like-minded nations in cyber defense is becoming inevitable,” Sven Sakkov, the center’s director, said at a ceremony , to welcome the organization’s two newest participants, Belgium and Sweden, in May 2017. “We are witnessing a growing interest towards our applied research, trainings and exercises, but the preparedness of nations to contribute themselves reflects more than just recognition to the work that has been done.” The inclusion of Finland and Sweden , Scandinavian countries not part of the alliance, but who share extensive land and maritime borders with Russia, are particularly notable. In the face of Russia’s more aggressive policies, both countries have indicated a desire to cooperate more close with NATO, and have even begun to consider applying for full membership in the bloc. This has in turn prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials to threaten possible retaliation with broad allusions to military or other offensive actions, which could include cyber attacks. The U.S. military itself also appears to be taking an increasingly active role in attempting to counter Russian cyber warfare and propaganda campaigns in Europe. In June 2016, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command revealed the existence of two forward-deployed special operations headquarters in Europe in a double issue of the official Special Warfare magazine . A US special operator works on a computer during an exercise in Lithuania., SOCEUR Among possible other duties, the two units, on for Eastern Europe and on for Southern Europe, were running “influence and information activities designed to prevent or end conflict and to counteract threats facing the U.S. and our allies,” according to one article. “PSYOP [psychological operations] soldiers are involved in every aspect of regional special operations forces … initiatives,” it added. As of 2016, according to the Asymmetric Warfare Group’s handbook, the Army’s main command in Europe was running a media campaign to apply a “Pinocchio Scale” to Russian media reports akin to The Washington Post ’s Fact Checker . “It is never an easy task,” the manual conceded. Easy or not, the Army and other services will have to incorporate more and better procedures to protect against Russian cyber and electronic harassment, or the potential for worse during an actual crisis. At the moment, it looks as if NATO personnel, including American troops, may already be active targets in one of Russia’s hybrid warfare campaigns.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 18, 2019",Russia Says Deal to Sell the UAE Su-35 Fighters Is Just Months Away,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is reportedly on the verge of selling more than a dozen advanced Su-35S Flanker-E fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates. If the deal is truly in the works, it could signal a shift by the country away from its long time partner the United States, or it could be an attempt by authorities in Dubai to gain political leverage over their counterparts in Washington. On Oct. 3, 2017, Russian state-owned media outlet TASS reported that a source had told it that the UAE was in line to purchase more than “a squadron” worth of Flanker-Es, typically between 12 and 18 aircraft. Russian sources, almost exclusively, both on and off the record, have discussed the possibility of this sale on and off since 2015. “They want a lot, over a squadron,” the individual, who reportedly deals in military and technical cooperation for the Russian government, said, according to TASS. “The exact number will be specified in the course of negotiations that may be held in November during an air show in Dubai.” This person was almost certainly referring to the annual Dubai Airshow and associated trade exposition. Organizers have scheduled the 2017 iteration of the event to run from Nov. 12 to 16. An Su-35S., Vitaly Kuzmin At its most basic, the purchase would make sense for the UAE. The country’s Air Force has nearly 50 French-made Mirage 2000-9 fighter jet that it purchased in the 1990s, as well as more than 50 F-16E/F Desert Falcons, which it first acquired in 2005. Replacing some of the oldest of these aircraft, namely the Mirages, with a late fourth generation design such as the Su-35S could increase the service’s capability. It would also give their F-16s a highly capable foe to train against. The fighter boasts impressive maneuverability thanks to advanced thrust vectoring technology, though The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway has explained in detail why this actually might be of dubious use in an actual air-to-air engagement. More importantly, the Flanker-E has a passive electronically-scanned array type radar that is significantly more capable than the pulse Doppler unit in the Mirages. This would extend the ranges at which UAE pilots would be able to detect their opponents and the overall area that each aircraft could scan for threats quickly, an important consideration in the tight confines of the Persian Gulf. Iran, a major regional opponent , sits just 150 miles from the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi and even closer to the country’s northern tip, situated near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. The country’s F-16E/Fs already feature a full up active electronically-scanned array radar, the first of its kind for the F-16, that is likely even more capable than the Su-35S’s unit. While buying Su-35S jets might make functional sense, it could easily be a political minefield that would spark the ire of the United States. The U.S. government has worked closely with the UAE, especially on counter-terrorism issues since 9/11, and sees the country as a stable and reliable partner in the region. Though often overshadowed by the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, the connection between Washington and Abu Dhabi is in many ways stronger, with U.S. officials colloquially referring to the Emirates as “ Little Sparta ,” a reference to the ancient Greek city state most commonly known for its military prowess. The U.S. and UAE militaries have cooperated actively on many occasions, most recently in Iraq and Syria against ISIS and in Yemen against Al Qaeda’s franchise on the Arabian Peninsula. Some of the UAE’s Mirage 2000-9s train in the United States in 2013., S However, during President Barack Obama’s Administration concerns about the country’s human rights record, especially the sometimes startling abusive treatment of foreign workers, appeared to slow or even halt the sale of advanced weapons. This in turn, prompted the Emirs to begin looking elsewhere. So, at the Dubai Airshow in November 2015, Sergey Chemezov, head of Rostec, a Russian state-operated corporation that promotes the development and export of high tech civilian and defense products made in the country, dropped something of a bombshell in a press conference, saying that the UAE was in talks to buy Flanker-Es. Viktor Kladov, in charge of Rostec’s International Cooperation Department, told the same thing to state-run news outlet RIA Novosti. The “Su-35 presentation here [at the airshow] is very good,” Chemezov said. “We are currently engaged in negotiations with the [United Arab] Emirates about the delivery of these aircraft.” Chemezov nor Kladov declined to offered any additional details, such as how many aircraft the UAE was considering buying or when Russia might finalize the deal. Around the same time, unable to purchase American-made armed drones such as the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper, the Emirates bought a number of similar Chinese CH-4s and had begun flying them over Libya and Yemen. There was no significant indication that the discussions over the Su-35 had moved forward at all until the annual International Defense Exhibition and Conference in Dubai, known commonly as IDEX, in February 2017. Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov told TASS that Russia and the UAE had actually signed a deal to cooperate on military technological development, including work on an unspecified fifth-generation fighter design. Chemezov again appeared in the press to say that the program could take seven to eight years and would involve a design derived from the MiG-29 rather than one based on the vexing PAK FA stealth fighter . Though the UAE’s own state media reported the military cooperation agreements, they made no specific mention of aircraft development. Talk of Flanker-Es for the UAE resurfaced in June 2017 at the annual Paris Airshow at Le Bourget.  Dmitry Shugaev, the head of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, a position that sounds very similar to the description of TASS’ most recent source, went on record to say that the Emirates had expressed interest in buying “ several dozen ” of the fighter jets. This all brings us back to the October 2017 report that the deal is now imminent. It is definitely possible that this is the case. The UAE could easily have looked at how long it’s taken for Kuwait and Qatar to move their own purchases of American-made fighter jets along and decided to seek an alternative option. On top of that, much to their frustration, the Emirates have thus far been unable to get into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, effectively closing off that avenue to acquiring a fifth-generation fighter in the near term. This would explain not only the interest in an interim solution, such as the Su-35S, but in working with another party such as Russia on an all new stealth fighter concept. “The U.S. waits for other nations to come to them and propose a deal,” Hannah Thoburn, a research fellow with the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., told Fox News in February 2017. “Russia takes a much more proactive approach with its defense industry in regards to building its political influence.” During Obama’s second term, Russia seized on the American government’s hesitation to continue working with a number of regimes and actors, which it has continued to do since then. The Kremlin has bolstered its ties with the military junta-turned-government of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt , made connections with rogue General Khalifa Haftar in Libya , and stepped up its commitments to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad , all in obvious attempts to make strategic inroads in both the Middle East and North Africa. The engagement with the UAE is clearly in line with this foreign policy push. But it might be that the UAE is looking to play off the Russians and the Americans, as well. Just as the Emirates can see the pitfalls of the U.S. government’s way of doing business, so too can they see the experience the Indian government has had working with the Russians on advanced fighter jets , including the PAK-FA stealth fighter program. India’s military has been continually disappointed with the progress of that project , which has seen repeated delays, technical troubles, and accidents . “The UAE also has ambitions to develop its national defense aerospace industrial base, but partnership in a Russian project is arguably not necessarily the best way to achieve this,” Douglas Barrie, a senior aerospace fellow at International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in the United Kingdom, told Aviation Week in February 2027. “An alternative view might be that the move is about trying to gain leverage on the U.S. as to when and how much access the UAE might eventually get on the F-35.” The UAE might be especially inclined to float this possible purchase of Su-35s in the press knowing that U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have had far fewer reservations than their predecessors when it comes to defense sales. The U.S. government recently approved the sale of A-29 light attack planes to Nigeria , a deal that the Obama administration had blocked on human rights grounds. One of Israel’s first F-35I Joint Strike Fighters., Israeli Air Force In addition, since the president’s trip to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, the Trump Administration has vocally stressed its ties to Arab states in the Gulf as a counter to Iran’s growing regional influence . Trump had even been quick to side with the Saudis and Emiratis in a serious political spat with Qatar , despite the latter country hosting a major American military base . It’s still unlikely that the United States would allow the UAE to join the F-35 program any time soon, as it is an important part of giving Israel a decided edge over all other countries in the Middle East. If UAE worked its way in, the U.S. government would almost undoubtedly have to allow the Saudis to join, too, opening the door to requests from an entire new tier of American partners. Still, the potential of an Su-35S sale to the UAE could prompt the Trump Administration, which routinely boasts about its connections to private industry, to look for a way to offer a deal on advanced derivatives of Boeing’s F-15 Eagle or F/A-18E/F Super Hornet or Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Viper , possibly including limited low-observable features for the Eagle and Super Hornet, as an alternative. The U.S. government has already approved sales of Advanced Eagle derivatives to both Saudi Arabia and Qatar , in spite of the ongoing political dispute. UAE could also be attracted to the simple idea of window shopping for fighter jets with cold hard petro dollars. Why not have the Su-35 and see how the Russians do it? There seems to be little downside for doing so and quite a bit of upside. If anything else, the jets would be a high-demand oddity for their own fighters and foreign allies to train against. If they end up liking what they see, they can buy more. And Russia would likely make them an attractive deal, with the aircraft costing substantially less than its western counterparts. If TASS source is to be believed, any new developments might become public sooner rather than later, as both the U.S. and Russian governments decide how much pressure they want to put on the UAE ahead of the Dubai Airshow.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2018","At Hearing, Dunford Highlights Plans for Afghan Black Hawk Gunship Variant","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a visit to Afghanistan , which saw a particularly brazen Taliban attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford went to Capitol Hill to talk to Senators about the state of America’s longest war. Among other things, America’s top uniformed military officer discussed efforts to improve the capability of Afghanistan’s military, specifically noting plans to deliver a gunship version of the UH-60 Black Hawk to the country’s air force. On Sept. 18, 2017, two UH-60A+ Black Hawks, the first of nearly 160 aircraft the United States plans to deliver to the Afghan Air Force, arrived a Kandahar Air Field on board a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane. The entire fleet will eventually incorporate almost 60 aircraft equipped with forward firing weaponry for close air support missions. “Longterm, and that’s about six or seven years from now, we’ll completely have transformed the Afghan Air Force,” General Dunford said in response to a question from Senator Deb Fischer, a Republic from Nebraska, during the hearing on Oct. 3, 2017. “A key piece of that is the transition from Mi-17 helicopters to UH-60 helicopters, which includes an attack variant.” Dunford did not offer any new details about when the first of these variants would arrive or what the configuration itself would entail. At present, the Afghan Air Force relies in large part on a fleet of less than 50 Russian-made Mi-17V1 and V5 Hip helicopters. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff US Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford., CQ Roll Call via AP You can watch the entire exchange below. Senator Fischer’s question about the Afghan Air Force begins at 54:10 if the player does not immediately forward you to that point. Designed from the outset as an assault transport, Afghanistan’s Hips can and have carried 23mm cannon pods and 57mm unguided rockets in order to provide fire support to troops on the ground. In 2015, the country’s air arm also began to receive MD Helicopter 530F light attack choppers, which can carry either a pair of .50 caliber machine guns or two seven-shot 70mm rocket pods . Those helicopters have since proven to be a controversial addition, as we at The War Zone have explained previously in depth . A very limited number of iconic Soviet-era Mi-35 Hind gunships have been in and out of service for years , as well. In principle, an armed version of the UH-60 could provide a significant boost in capability for the Afghan Air Force, especially if the armament package came combined with electro-optical and infrared sensors that allowed crews to operate and effectively engage enemy forces at night. The ability to take on the Taliban and other militants after dark, when they have the most freedom to move without Afghan or coalition forces spotting them, has long been critical to keeping those forces at bay. A US Army UH-60M Black Hawk commander’s variant with a sensor turret under the nose., US Army And while we don’t know the exact configuration the Afghans will get, we do have some hints as to what the aircraft might look like in the end. A number of countries, including the United States, already employ armed attack versions of the Black Hawk. One such configuration is the Colombian Air Force’s AH-60L, also called the Arpia, which means harpy in Spanish. The latest version, the Arpia III, features a nose-mounted radar to assist with low-level flight with a sensor turret underneath. Stub wings on either side carry 70mm rocket pods and .50 caliber GAU-19 three-barrel rotary machine guns , with additional machine guns fitted in the main cabin doors. A Colombia Air Force AH-60L Arpia III., Pablo Andrés Ortega Chávez via Wikimedia The U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment has used its own similar set up for years now. These specially arranged MH-60L and MH-60M Black Hawks are known as Direct Action Penetators, or DAPs, and again have a terrain following radar, sensor turret with day- and night-vision cameras, and small wings for ordnance. The DAPs are able to carry a mixture of 70mm rockets, Hellfire missiles, GAU-19/Bs, and 30mm M230 cannons. The last weapon is the same gun found on the AH-64 Apache gunship. In addition, each one of these helicopters has a pair of Miniguns that can be locked in a forward-firing mode to add to the firepower. In September 2017, the Army received the first set of all new lightweight wings for the 160th’s MH-60Ms, called the Multi-Station Lightweight Armament Support Structure (MLASS). The manufacturer, Unitech Composites, says the new units are 270 pounds lighter than the older sponsons and easier for troops to install and remove as necessary. They can still carry all of the same weapons as before and fit any UH-60A, L, or M derivative. An MH-60M Black Hawk with the MLASS wing set., United Composites Black Hawk maker Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, has offered its own, from factory UH-60 gunship, known as the “Battlehawk,” as well as offering the components as a kit for existing helicopters. The Connecticut-based firm demonstrated this configuration to the Australian and Israeli militaries, with the latter also experimenting with an underbelly 20mm cannon installation. In 2011, the United Arab Emirates put in an order for a number of these conversions to expand the capabilities of its Black Hawk fleet. Again, this offering includes an additional sensor package to go along with the added armament. Of course, any “AH-60” the Afghan Air Force receives could easily run into the same problems we at The War Zone have outlined repeatedly . In September 2017, I wrote : It’s hard to imagine the Afghan UH-60 fleet will be able to match that level of independent operation any time soon and the transition could throw the relative stability of the “advanced” Mi-17 program into disarray. Captain Salvin told Military Times that the U.S. military plans to provide training more than 60 future UH-60 pilots in both Afghanistan and the United States, starting between October and November. But it’s not at all clear where these aviators would come from and Salvin suggested this would be separate for transition training for existing Hip crews. As of July 2017, the Afghan Air Force had 82 Hip pilots in total, including 39 co-pilots and 11 instructors, according to a quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a top U.S. government watchdog. If the U.S. military plans to pull a significant number of Mi-17 pilots and crews off the line for these training courses, it will have to fill in the obvious and immediate gap with American aircraft or contractors, or otherwise accept that the Afghan military will have a significant shortfall in air mobility capability. SIGAR said in its July 2017 quarterly report that the Hips had flown 50 percent of all Afghan Air Force missions in the preceding four months despite reportedly having the lowest operational readiness rate of any of the service’s airframes. American officials blamed the low availability on the age of the aircraft, but it seems very likely that this heavily utilization was a significant factor, as well. At the October 2017 hearing, Dunford obviously remained optimistic. As he noted, the delivery of the UH-60s was an essential part of the overall plan to modernize the Afghan Air Force. “It’s [the Afghan Air Force] come a long way over the past two, two and half years,” he added in his response to Senator Fischer’s query. “And again, over the next six or seven years, we expect the Afghan Air Force to be able to provide the support the Afghans need.” At present, the expectation is that a significant amount of that support will come from these future UH-60 gunships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 28, 2019",USAF Replaces Bulky Tape Cartridges For Loading Launch Codes Into ICBMs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force still is pushing ahead with plans to modernize its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force as the Pentagon continues to work through its latest nuclear posture review, which will likely decide the future of that entire leg of America’s “Nuclear Triad.” In the meantime, the service is still conducting smaller more immediate projects to update the dated infrastructure supporting this deterrent arm, including replacing huge tape-based data systems that personnel used to reprogram missile launch codes and other data. On Oct. 2, 2017, the Air Force reported that the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, one of three ICBM wings in the service, had begun using a new information transfer system to upload critical mission information into each individual LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBM. The first of these new Data Transfer Units (DTU) became available in June 2017 as part of a $68 million upgrade program. “The DTU loads the Missile Guidance Set, which is the brain of the Minuteman III, with sensitive cryptographic data and other information the missile needs in order to function,” U.S. Air Force Captain Kevin Drumm, the codes operations chief at the 91st Operation Support Squadron, explained to the service’s reporters. “The DTU has increased productivity and shortened the time required to conduct coding operations.” Shortening the time is putting it mildly. Before the upgraded units arrived, the 91st was using a system called the Launch Facility Load Cartridge to program tape memory cartridges with all the necessary data. According to Drumm, it would take 45 minutes to build the data set, which personnel would then spend another 30 minutes loading into a single missile. US Air Force missileers check equipment in a launch control facility., USAF On top of that, the cartridge programming equipment was so old that it could only fit enough information for one missile on a single tape cartridge tape unit, which weighed approximately 45 pounds each. The information for each missile is unique for security purposes, so the wing’s code team would need to run through the process 50 times and lug all of the cassettes out to the dispersed launch facilities. Instead, the new system can build a missile’s full mission data package in 30 minutes and load it into the weapon in less than 10 minutes. Each Data Transfer Unit can hold the information for 12 missiles and weighs just 20 pounds. The Air Force did not say whether the new system is still tape based, which remains a popular high-density data storage format . All of this saves valuable time and effort during the annual change of codes across the Air Force’s ICBM arsenal, nicknamed Operation Olympic Step, as well as whenever the service might need to update other parts of the missile’s software. U.S. Air Force General Robin Rand, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all of the service’s strategic nuclear elements, specifically highlighted the long work hours for missileers supporting the ICBM mission during a panel discussion at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference in September 2017. “They’ll [the missileers] come in about seven o’clock, these younger lieutenants and captains most of them, and they’ll brief up and they’ll get their classified material and they’ll hit the road,” he explained. “They’ll drive as far as three or four hours to get to their ‘office’ and they’ll assume their alert. And they’ll go down on 24-hour alert and they’ll come up and drive those three hours back and then they’ll debrief.” Individuals will perform these 30-plus hour work “days” between seven and eight times each month, according to General Rand. Support personnel must drive the same distances to get the new code packages out to each of the missiles. Any time savings can be important both to efficient operating and unit morale, the latter of which has become a particularly significant issue for what some have declared a “ dead-end career .” But when it comes to the technology in use, the previous tape memory arrangement was indicative of the generally archaic infrastructure that supports the land-based leg of the Nuclear Triad. In May 2016, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report regarding the increasing age of computers across the federal government, mentioning the age of systems at ICBM launch control facilities, among others. “The Strategic Automated Command and Control System … coordinates the operational functions of the United States’ nuclear forces, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear bombers, and tanker support aircrafts, among others,” the report explained. “the system is still running on an IBM Series/1 Computer, which is a 1970s computing system, and written in assembly language code.” Introduced in 1976, the Series/1 was a so-called “minicomputer,” smaller than the room-sized mainframes of the day, which IBM made to order in configurations ranging from $10,000 to $100,000. The assembly code language dates to 1949. A scan of an image from an IBM Series/1 brochure, showing the equipment in an office setting., IBM In addition, the Air Force’s strategic control computers run off programs on eight-inch floppy disks. In March 2016, the Department of Defense had begun another $60 million modernization effort in light of the increasing age of the hardware. “Replacement parts for the system are difficult to find because they are now obsolete,” GAO noted. “There is a plan underway to replace the floppy disks with secure digital cards.” At the time, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Valerie Henderson, a Pentagon spokesperson, had a blunt response for media outlets asking about why the U.S. military continued to use the long out of production computers. “This system remains in use because, in short, it still works,” she said. Experts pointed out that, though dated, the Series/1s and its old disks might actually present a serious challenge for opponents looking to launch cyber attacks on the launch facilities. Disconnected from the internet and without a more common way of directly inserting malicious software into the system made them more secure in many ways. “I’ll tell you, those older systems provide us some – I will say huge safety when it comes to some cyber issues that we currently have in the world,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jack Weinstein, then a major general in charge of Twentieth Air Force, the service’s top ICBM command, had told CBS’ 60 Minutes in 2014. “A few years ago we did a complete analysis of our entire network. Cyber engineers found out that the system is extremely safe and extremely secure on the way it’s developed.” Though many of the specific details remain classified, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, the two contractors vying for the Air Force’s ICBM replacement deal, known as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program, have each indicated cyber security improvements are one of the many things they aim to include in their new missiles. They have also indicated plans to improve the modularity of the weapons, to allow personnel to perform upgrades and install updates much faster. The new Data Transfer Units and any new hardware and software for a future ICBM will have to take cyber attacks, among other threats, into consideration. As we at The War Zone have noted before , as the U.S. military has become more computerized, the dangers to those networks will only become more pronounced. Even if the Series/1 consoles get replaced, the Air Force may decide it makes sense to stick to transferring data to and from the missiles themselves on magnetic tape. So don’t be surprised if the new GBSDs, when and if they reach the Air Force’s missile units, still rely on mission software packages loaded up from a tape memory cartridge.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began a unique program to more closely study these devastating tropical storms and their impacts using small, expendable drones called Coyotes. But despite the system proving its worth as recently as the monitoring of Hurricane Maria, the project is now effectively dead amid a funding crisis that has begun to threaten the agency’s aerial research efforts in general, including leaving one of its research planes, a modified Gulfstream IV-SP business jet, increasingly dangerous to fly. On Sept. 24, 2017, one of NOAA’s two WP-3D Orion weather research aircraft, nicknamed Kermit after the Muppets character, flew out toward Hurricane Maria to collect data on air pressure, moisture, temperature, and wind speed and direction via its on board Doppler Lidar laser sensor and the remote controlled Coyotes. This flight to inspect the deadly storm, along with others earlier in September 2017, would use up all but one of the Hurricane Research Division’s drones. “I’ve got nothing left in the bank,” Dr. Joe Cione, head of NOAA’s Coyote program, told Popular Mechanics . “Just one Coyote.” That the research-focused agency came to be one of the primary customers for Raytheon’s tube-launched lightweight drone in the first place was something of a fluke.  After Hurricane Sandy slammed into the northeastern United States in October 2012, doing significant damage to New York and New Jersey, Congress approved $61 billion for disaster relief and related efforts as part of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013. One of NOAA’s Coyotes in 2015., NOAA As part of a larger pool of money legislators approved for elements of the Department of Commerce, NOAA specifically received $140 million, less the $290 million in earlier versions of the bill, but still a not insignificant amount for an agency that has an average annual budget of less than $6 billion . $25 million of this was specifically set aside for investment in ways to “improve weather forecasting and hurricane intensity forecasting capabilities.” Coyote was one program to come out of that new budget. It’s been hard to sustain that funding with the agency’s budget remaining relatively level in the years since Sandy. The U.S. Navy, which has been testing Coyote as part of its own research into the emerging capabilities of drone swarms , managed to get some funding over to NOAA, ostensibly because it has its own vested interest in understanding the impacts and effects of tropical storms. “I feel this is where hurricane research needs to go,” Cione added to Popular Mechanics. “But we have no resources for more.” The Raytheon-made drone is relatively cheap at approximately $15,000 per unit , but those costs could easily add up for a small organization like NOAA. That NOAA generally doesn’t expect the small unmanned aircraft, weighing just seven pounds, to survive their trip into a hurricane’s eyewall, the most intense part of the storm, doesn’t help matters. But that also means they can go where other aircraft, manned or not, can’t and gather vital data that would otherwise be unavailable to scientists. In various interviews since 2014, Cione has made it clear that he feels Coyote has greatly expanded the capacity of NOAA’s hurricane researchers. “The Coyote can make S turns, going with the wind, hunting MaxV [maximum velocity],” he explained to Popular Mechanics. “It’s an MRI instead of a single point snapshot.” Otherwise the WP-3Ds have to drop unguided sensor pods, known as dropsondes , from a safe position and hope they’ll glide into the right parts of the storm. A Cione noted, they can only send information back for a short period. Coyotes can fly more than 50 miles away from the controlling aircraft for at least an hour. The lack of money for the Coyote program is indicative of larger problems emerging at NOAA. On Sept. 27, 2017, The Washington Post reported that the agency’s lone Gulfstream IV-SP research plane, nicknamed Gonzo after another one of the Muppets, had aborted three missions in eight days due to technical problems. “Gonzo,” NOAA’s Gulfstream IV-SP, wearing her latest paint scheme., NOAA NOAA purchased the plane in 1996 to perform high altitude research that the WP-3Ds, which fly routes cutting through the storms, simply can’t provide. Cruising at an altitude of around 45,000 feet, Gonzo can release its dropsondes across wide areas in the upper atmosphere, as well as gather data with its doppler radar system. By flying over developing tropical storms rather than slicing through them, the aircraft provides a unique picture of the weather system below, improving forecasting about where it might travel. In recent years, though, budget cuts and shortfalls have made harder for the agency to maintain the aircraft properly. Especially worrisome, the seal on the plane’s main cabin door failed during a flight on Sept. 25, 2017, depressurizing the aircraft and forcing the crew to use the emergency oxygen system as they returned to the Aircraft Operations Center at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, Florida. With no other high altitude aircraft and only three planes in total in the entire NOAA hurricane hunting fleet, there was no backup available to take over in any way. Despite being required to by a law President Donald Trump signed in April 2017, “NOAA has taken no major steps to acquire reliable backup,” Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat and the bill’s sponsor, complained to Benjamin Friedman, NOAA’s acting administrator, in a letter earlier in September 2017, which The Post obtained.  “It is unacceptable that we again find ourselves in the midst of hurricane season without reliable NOAA aircraft reconnaissance and without backup capability.” Gonzo on the ground at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport., NOAA It’s unclear what, if anything, Friedman can realistically do about the situation. The U.S. government at present is only at work for the time being thanks to the latest in a long series of temporary spending measures, known as continuing resolutions, rather than a full budget. In its most recent budget request for the 2018 fiscal year, the agency asked for nearly $4.8 billion , a cut of almost $1 billion or one fifth from what it said it need in the previous fiscal cycle. This was part of a 16 percent cut across Commerce in President Trump’s first budget proposal. NOAA has tried to make up the shortfall by making arrangements with other public and private organizations. In 2016, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research temporarily made its Gulfstream V available to the agency for a series of flights in the Pacific Ocean. University Corporation for Atmospheric Research’s Gulfstream V, which it operates on behalf of the National Center for Atmospheric Research., UCAR More recently, in August 2017, NOAA’s hurricane researchers team up with NASA to make use of that agency’s Global Hawk drone , configuring it to employ dropsondes. This month-long project consisted of six 24-hour missions in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. These projects have been ad hoc and rely entirely on the availability of another party’s aircraft, though. None of the deals provides a back up option for Gonzo that is ready to go whenever NOAA needs it or offers a way to replace the precision capabilities of the Coyote drones. NOAA needs to be “diligent in complying with the law,” Senator Nelson said in his letter to the agency’s acting head, according to The Post . “Truly lives and property depend on it.” NASA’s Global Hawk., NASA Nelson isn’t being hyperbolic. Hurricane research only looks set to become increasingly important. Global climate change means warmers seas to feed storms as they build in the Atlantic and Pacific. It was quite possibly a contributing factor to the appearance of two “ once in 500 years ” storms, Harvey and Irma, back-to-back during the 2017 hurricane season. Harvey killed more than 70 people in Texas alone. Irma killed more than 120 across the Caribbean. Now Maria has claimed almost 70 more already, as of Oct 1, 2017. Being able to adequately understand how these storms work is essential to accurately predicting their immediate movements and impacts and preparing for future storms, as well as long-term predictions about hurricane frequency and size. If the 2017 hurricane season has been any indication, NOAA needs all the funding it can get to increase its ability to reliable study these storms. Gonzo’s dropsonde operations alone have been enough to improve the accuracy of its tracking forecasts by 20 percent, according to NOAA’s website . Cuts to its already meager offer a minimal savings for the overall federal budget compared to the benefits of having the agency operating at full capacity. Unfortunately, without a new source of funding, the agency will likely have to continue relying on Gonzo, its one remaining Coyote, the charity of other organizations, and its own ingenuity to keep doing its vital work.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone operating over the country.  The loss highlights a steady increase in counter-terrorism operations aimed at neutralizing Al Qaeda’s regional franchise operating out of Yemen under President Donald Trump’s administration. On Oct. 1, 2017, Houthi fighters, reportedly near Yemen’s capital Sana’a, brought down the unmanned aircraft. Video emerged online showing a portion of the MQ-9 spiraling into the ground in flames, but not the moment the pilotless plane apparently exploded. “We assess that an MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in western Yemen,” U.S. Army Major Earl Brown, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command told Military.com . “The details on the specifics of the mission are not releasable for [operational security reasons] and we don’t want to get ahead of any investigation.” It is unclear how the Houthis shot down the drone. Saba, Yemen’s new agency, which the group controls, simply said its forces had destroyed the unmanned aircraft . One possibility is that the rebels employed a man-portable surface-to-air missile system, or MANPADS. In 2013, the U.S. military and Yemeni Coast Guard seized one shipment of weapons bound for the group that included a number of Chinese QW-1M missiles , derived from the Russian 9K310 Igla-1 . Though not the most advanced of these types of weapons presently available, these shoulder-launched missiles still pose a significant threat, especially to relatively slow-flying and aircraft such as the Reaper. It’s unclear how many MANPADS type weapons the Houthis might actually have, though. If it turns out one of these missiles did knock out the Reaper, it could indicate a significant development in the conflict. For decades, these missiles have had outsized impacts on a number of conflicts, most famously the resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , but more recently in countries such as Iraq, Syria , and Ukraine . This incident might suggest the rebel forces may be able to increasingly challenge the Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi’s government to power. The Saudis and their partners have been conducting a brutal and controversial aerial campaign since 2015, which many say has deliberately targeted civilians . It is also possible that the Houthis shot the Reaper down with a light anti-aircraft gun. However, drones like the MQ-9 usually operate at altitudes where they are out of reach of this kind of enemy fire. A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper carrying a training version of the Hellfire missile under each wing., USAF We also don’t know what the drone’s particular mission was at the time. Though almost undoubtedly operating from the U.S. base at Chabelley Airfield in Djibouti across the Gulf of Aden, it is possible that the aircraft could have been either gathering intelligence or conducting a strike. Though the United States has not actively engaged the Houthis, it resumed attacks Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula after a hiatus following the collapse of Yemen’s internationally recognized in September 2014. In April 2016, American special operators returned to the country to work with the United Arab Emirates on containing the resurgent Al Qaeda terrorists, who had exploited the chaos to rebuild and regroup. In January 2017, the two countries partnered directly on a deadly and controversial raid that left one SEAL and a number of civilians dead in the country’s Al Bayda Governorate. The U.S. military has been actively supporting the Saudi-led coalition’s fight against the Houthis and other groups logistically, primarily mid-air refueling. The United States had supplied intelligence information, before appearing to scale back that support in 2016. The exact extent of American support for the Saudi-led operations at present is uncertain, even to the Pentagon, according to a report in September 2017 by The Intercept . Photos of the wreckage that subsequently appeared on social media showed the data plate from the drone’s engine and parts of a M299 Hellfire missile launch rail. This suggests the Reaper may have been on a strike mission against Al Qaeda terrorists at the time or beforehand. In 2017 alone, there have been more than 100 confirmed U.S. air strikes, including those by manned and unmanned aircraft, in Yemen, according to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism . This is a significant increase over the previous year, with just 32 publicly acknowledged aerial attacks in 2016. This also appears to be the first instance where the U.S. military has acknowledged that insurgents shot down a drone in Yemen. Drones have crashed in Yemen before, but these have been accidents rather than the result of enemy action and the U.S. military has generally declined to confirm or deny the circumstances one way or another. In February 2017, photos emerged online of one such apparent Reaper crash , where the aircraft might have been carrying specialized gear to find and track target cell phones linked to individual terrorists. Regardless, the Houthis have long sought to retaliate against American military personnel in retaliation for their aid to the Saudis in the past, attacking multiple U.S. Navy warships off Yemen’s coast in 2016. It seems likely that if they’ll continue to take advantage of any opportunities in the future to try and destroy more U.S. military drones. Update : Here is a video supposedly showing the use of a MANPADS to take down the Reaper in Yemen. We cannot authenticate the video and it is blurred which obviously doesn’t help with doing so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Iranian Tanks Roll Up to The Iraqi Border As Embargo of Kurds Expands,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has moved tanks and artillery up to the border with Iraqi Kurdistan, close enough to the boundary that they are visible from the other side. The move is the latest in a string of increasingly threatening responses to the semi-autonomous region’s decision to vote in favor of independence , which has drawn widespread condemnation from national governments in the region and failed to win unequivocal support from many of the Kurd’s powerful western allies, including the United States. On Oct. 2, 2017, the Iranian forces appeared along the Iran-Iraq border, reportedly as part of a previously announced combined drill with Iraqi national forces and militia in retaliation for the independence vote. Authorities in Tehran had already kicked off military exercises near the boundary on Sept. 24, 2017 a day ahead of the poll in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, ostensibly as part of the annual Sacred Defense Week to commemorate the Iran-Iraq War. More than 3.3 million people there, more than 70 percent of registered voters, turned out on Sept. 25, 2017 to cast their ballots, with more than 90 percent voting in favor an independent Kurdistan. Iranian and Iraqi officials had “agreed on measures to establish border security and receive Iraqi forces that are to be stationed at border posts,” Iranian state media said, according to Reuters . Iran’s top military leadership had met to discuss the situation and “[the] necessary decisions were taken to provide security at the borders and welcome Iraq’s central government forces to take position at border crossings,” Masoud Jazayeri, a spokesman for the Iranian army, had told the press on Sept. 30, 2017. This latest response to the referendum is worrisome, but not surprising. Iran’s central government, including President Hassan Houhani, had publicly criticized the Kurdish Regional Government, or KRG, for even planning to hold the vote, even before the results were in. Before polling began, Iranian authorities blocked all air travel between their country and the Kurdish region after consulting with their counterparts in Iraq. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4rvx1WdWSqo Iranian authorities fear that independence for Iraqi Kurdistan could prompt a similar push on the part of its own Kurdish region. The KRG has denied the referendum is intended as any sort of signal to other Kurdish majority areas in Iran, Turkey, or Syria, or as a desire for a greater Kurdistan. However, after the vote, when it became apparent that the majority were in favor in independence, Iranian Kurds took to the streets to celebrate the news. The Iranian military responded by flying military jets over the country’s Kurdish region and the central government otherwise moved to assert its authority. “[KRG President Masoud] Barzani is a middleman for Zionists [whose goal is] to disintegrate Islamic countries,” Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior foreign policy advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, said on Sept. 27, 2017 , undoubtedly in reference to the rhetorical support Israel had offered the Kurds leading up to vote. He went on to compare an independent Kurdistan as a “second Israel” that Islamic countries like Iran would and could not allow. It is worth noting that Kurds are predominantly Sunni Muslims, whereas Iraqi Arabs and Iranians are primarily adherents of Shia Islam. The reported military buildup and show of force follows earlier reports that Iraqi security forces had been looking to seize control of border crossings into the KRG by way of both Iranian and Turkish territory. Kurdish authorities had rejected a previous demand from the government in Baghdad to hand over control of all international entry points, including airports in the regional capital Erbil and the major city of Sulaimaniya. Though Iraqi officials say their Kurdish counterparts had a choice to comply or face the now expanding blockade, turning over control of the border points and airports would also allow the government in Baghdad to gain a stranglehold over the semi-autonomous region until it backs down from its calls for independence. Ahead of the referendum, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi’s office had already called on all foreign powers to halt independent oil deals with the KRG. And while Turkish officials denied they had closed their border with Iraqi Kurdistan, they had imposed unspecified restrictions on movement in and out of the region into Turkey. On top of that, they had facilitated the movement of Iraqi forces onto their side of the border in apparent preparations to help Baghdad assert its authority along the boundary. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IG5gf0fLLIk At the same time, there had been a similar show of force on the part of Turkey’s military, with tanks and other armored vehicles conducting drills nearby. On Sept. 25, 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had implied that, if necessary, those troops could surge across the border to help subdue the KRG. Separately, Turkey and Iran have agreed to increase cooperation on border security and counter-terrorism issues. The Turkish government has been fight a decades-long conflict with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, better known as the PKK, an internationally recognized terrorist group that it says has direct links to Kurdish factions in both Iraq and Syria. Not surprisingly, the PKK has voiced support for the Iraqi Kurdish independence referendum. Turkish tanks move out near the Habur border gate with Iraqi Kurdistan., Turkish Military via AP So far, there have been no similar moves on the part of the Syrian government, which has also rejected the results of the referendum. Shia-majority Syria shares a small border with Iraqi Kurdistan, but has exerted limited authority over its eastern regions since ISIS terrorists seized dramatically expanded their control over a swath of territory along the Syria-Iraq border in 2014. Since then, a U.S.-backed coalition has beaten back the terrorists and American-supported local forces have been conducting extensive operations in northern and eastern Syria. With support from their Russian allies, though, forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad began making significant progress in the eastern Deir ez-Zor governorate in September 2017. Still, as we at The War Zone have noted before , taken together, the political unity of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey in opposition is both impressive and concerning, easily suggesting that any fighting between Baghdad and the KRG could quickly spiral into a regional conflict. Without support from major foreign power, such as the United States, it’s hard to imagine Iraqi Kurdish would be able to withstand the pressure of this bloc. It’s unclear where the KRG could turn for support at present, either. The United States , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Russia , and China have all, in various languages, indicated displeasure with the unilateral referendum and criticized its timing. The U.S. government in particular, which has been a major benefactor of the Kurdish regional authority, seeing it as an essential part of the anti-ISIS coalition since the darkest days of the terrorist offensive into Iraq, has been disinclined to support the results of the poll. Female Peshmerga train in Erbil. , Sipa via AP “The United States’ historic relationship with the people of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region will not change in light of today’s non-binding referendum,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement on Sept. 25, 2017. “But we believe this step will increase instability and hardships for the Kurdistan region and its people.” American officials have continued to downplay the impact of this policy position, but it has tacitly endorsed the response by the Iraqi government if nothing else. It has obvious had no impact on Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey’s responses to the referendum. Thankfully, so far, both sides appear to be focusing on economic and political leverage, but there are indications that they may be preparing for violence. On Oct. 2, 2017 KRG President Barzani met with commanders of the region’s own security forces, known as the Peshmerga, in Kirkuk. This city has already been a flash point between Kurdish forces and Turkmen and Arab militias. During the referendum voting, the mayor publicly told his fellow Kurds to save their bullets in preparation for possibly having to defend them city from outside actors. And though the U.S. government had implored all parties to keep focused on battling ISIS, the threat is waning , with the terrorists on the defensive and increasing in retreat in both Iraq and Syria. Most recently, coalition-backed Iraqi forces have steadily moved to eject the group’s fighters from the city of Hawija . As such, Iraqi forces and militias aligned with the government in Baghdad could easily decide they can divert at least some of their attention to subduing Kurdish independence aspirations. If a conflict does erupt in Iraqi Kurdistan, the United States, as well as the KRG’s other western partners, will be compelled to take a stronger stance or risk losing influence in the region, particularly to Iran. In addition, the U.S. government could easily see pressuring the Kurds to back down as the only realistic option to deescalate the situation, but it would be a move that could irrevocably damage ties with Kurdish authorities. The Kurds already have many reasons to be skeptical of American intentions and commitments. With the various military forces increasingly surrounding the semi-autonomous region, the United States and its coalition partners may not be able to avoid becoming more seriously embroiled in the situation for much longer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 8, 2019",Canada Gets Desperate After Trade Dispute Upends Super Hornet Plans,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Canada continues to struggle with what to do about its participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, attempts to buy interim replacements for its aging CF-18A+ Hornets have turned into a saga of their own. The country’s military is desperately scrounging around for places like Kuwait and Australia for second-hand fighter jets to bolster their existing fleet in the wake of a rhetorically charged trade dispute between Canadian firm Bombardier and Super Hornet maker Boeing. On Sept. 28, 2017, Canadian Defense Minster Harjit Sajjan revealed that Canada had and might still be considering buying second-hand F/A-18C/D Hornets from Kuwait. Unfortunately, there were serious concerns about whether the two countries could finalize a deal before the Royal Canadian Air Force’s (RCAF) approximately 65 active CF-18A+s, also known as the CF-188, reached the end of their service life. “We have looked at the capability of the Kuwaiti fighters,” Sajjan said during a press conference in Riga, Latvia, where he had been visiting Canadian troops training there with other NATO members. “The biggest thing is right now they are not currently available. But we still want to pursue every single option.” The immediacy of the issue is a result of a combination of delays in the F-35 program, which Canada has been part of since 2001, and politics. During the country’s 2015 election campaign Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, head of the Liberal Party, had pledged to halt the country’s participation in the Joint Strike Fighter project, a pet project of the previous administration of Conservative Party Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and run a new fighter jet competition. An RCAF CF-18A+ over Lithuania in 2014., Canadian Armed Forces Beyond the political and legal backlash this caused at home and with the United States, this created a potentially dangerous capability gap as the CF-18A+s are only supposed to remain functional until 2020 at the latest. Sajjan has said that it will likely take that long to simply make a new, final decision on the future of the RCAF’s fighter fleet. So, Canada needs an interim solution and needs to get the ball rolling as soon as possible. Buying Kuwait’s F/A-18C/Ds, which have seen relatively little use, but have had good and steady maintenance and support over the years, could be a good option in principle. But even if the RCAF were to get all of the Kuwaiti jets, a fleet of less than 30 aircraft, it still won’t be enough to replace all of its existing Hornets. This means that it would either have to seek additional aircraft from other sources, invest in a service life extension program for some of the CF-18A+s as well, or have to scale back regular flight operations. Kuwaiti’s own plan to replace those aircraft with newer and more capable F/A-18E/F Super Hornets has hit its own snags , too, with the U.S. State Department only formally approving the potential deal in November 2016 . In the meantime, the country has quietly become embroiled in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen . In February 2017, Kuwaiti Air Force Major General Abdullah Al Foudari revealed that the country had flown more than 3,000 sorties in support of the coalitions operations against Houthi rebels and their allies. A Kuwaiti F/A-18C during a training exercise in the United States in 1993., DOD Earlier in September 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed credit for expediting the State Department’s approval process, but there was still no indication about when Kuwait would finalize the approximately $5 billion deal with Boeing. Fed up with delays with the Super Hornet Deal, Kuwait had already ordered 28 Eurofighter Typhoons in 2016, which could have an impact on any purchase. “During the same period, and the same trip to Saudi Arabia – which was my great honor representing our incredible country – His Highness personally asked me to expedite a $5 billion agreement for the sale of American F/A-18 Super Hornet fighting jets for Kuwait,” Trump said during a shared press conference with Kuwait’s Emir Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah on Sept. 7, 2017. “I am pleased to report that the State Department has now authorized this transferred purchase, which will not only strengthen our mutual security, but will greatly benefit American workers.” Still, given these operational commitments, it’s unlikely that the Kuwaitis were keen to sell off their Hornets until some replacement jets have at least begun to arrive. As such, Sajjan said Canada was more actively pursuing a possible arrangement with Australia to buy some of its approximately 70 F/A-18A/B aircraft. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) could more easily free up some of those jet since it began buying F/A-18E/F Super Hornets in 2009 and also plans to purchase a total of 72 F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, with the first examples slated to enter service in 2018. The problem with this plan is that any retired RAAF Hornets would be of a similar vintage as Canada’s own jets, though they have also received upgrades over the years, notably the addition of the AN/APG-73 radar and the AIM-120 air-to-air missile, both features also found on Canadian CF-18A+ aircraft. An RAAF F/A-18A takes off on a mission against ISIS terrorists., Australian DOD Both types are significantly less capable than the Super Hornet, which has a more powerful engines, an active electronically scanned radar, and a host of other improvements. As with the existing Canadian jets, the Australian planes could easily require significant time and money to keep flying safely. Any delays in the new RCAF fighter competition, which has yet to start, would only exacerbate the decision. “That capability we needed a long time ago,” Sajjan said from Riga. “We had a plan in place, a very good plan that was going to fill the capability gap, invest in our current fleet and start the fighter replacement competition.” And therein lies the biggest problem. In November 2016, the Canadian Defense Minister confirmed the plan was to buy 18 new F/A-18E/F Super Hornet jets for the RCAF straight from Boeing. This idea made a lot of sense, as The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway noted at the time : The case for Canada buying Super Hornets is extremely solid , and procuring a small fleet of the jets will put the type in an even more favorable position for further purchases down the line. This interim Super Hornet solution also gets around some looming financial issues surrounding the Trudeau Administration’s propensity to turn its back on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter–a program in which Canada has been a partner since 2001. Even if Canada decides to purchase F-35s after completing the competition, the Joint Strike Fighter program will likely be in a far more stable and developed position than it is at present. This equals less risk and probably lower unit costs than what can be had today. Also, if Canada purchases F/A-18Fs as part of this interim buy, these aircraft can later be converted to EA-18G Growler configuration after a new fighter is selected. This would give Canada a high-end electronic attack capability, one that’s very high in demand within NATO that potential Canadian F-35s could benefit from greatly. A US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet., USN Unfortunately, that has steadily turned into a political impossibility. After Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier landed a major deal to sell 75 CSeries light airliners to American airline Delta, Boeing had filed a formal complaint. The Chicago-headquartered firm alleged foreign government subsidies and other unfair business practices had given Bombardier an unfair advantage and accused them of “dumping” the aircraft into a U.S. market at an artificially low price. “We have obviously been looking at the Super Hornet aircraft from Boeing as a potential significant procurement of our new fighter jets,” Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau said on Sept 18, 2017. “But we won’t do business with a company that’s busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business.” Then on Sept. 26, 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce sided with Boeing and threatened to levy massive import tariffs of nearly 200 percent on any Bombardier products entering the United States. Those duties will only go into effect if and when the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) rules in Boeing’s favor, a decision expected to come sometime in 2018. Bombardier called the potential import taxes absurd and the Canadian government criticized the decision. “This is clearly aimed at eliminating Bombardier’s C Series aircraft from the U.S. market,” Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland after the ruling. Needless to say, this has effectively ended Canada’s consideration of the Super Hornet, at least for the time being. With the ITC still considering Boeing’s allegations, the dispute has yet to fully run its course. It is possible that the U.S. government may find itself eager to smooth over the matter as it has begun to involve more parties outside of just Canada and the United States. U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May has now entered the debate , threatening retaliatory measure by her country if the United States moves ahead with the tariffs. More politics are at work there, since May’s Conservative Party is presently in a coalition government relying on support from the Democratic Unionist Party, a small political party in Northern Ireland. A facility in Northern Ireland employing more than 4,000 workers builds wings for Bombardier’s CSeries. It’s also possible that the spat could impact the RCAF’s eventual fighter competition, as Boeing would almost undoubtedly have pitched the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet as an alternative to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Back in 2014, Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, argued that Super Hornets made much more sense for Canada’s needs than the stealthy F-35s. A US Air Force F-35A, left, flies with a US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet., USAF Without Boeing out of the mix, the most likely contenders would include the Dassault Rafale , the Eurofighter Typhoon , and the Saab Gripen , as well as Lockheed, which wants to pitch its F-35 again , but could also easily offer an upgraded F-16 Viper . A broader trade dispute could further limit those options if Lockheed decided to drop out in protest. All of this could have an impact on the RCAF’s overall capabilities, since there is no debate that it will need a replacement for its CF-18s soon, if it doesn’t already. This in turn could hamper the service’s ability to conduct joint operations with allies in a crisis or even just train or make other routine commitments. In May 2017, the Canadian fighters flew patrols over and around NATO ally Iceland, while earlier in September 2017, they began flying air policing missions out of Romania, another alliance member. In addition, Canada operates as part of a shared air defense scheme with the United States under the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). “The RCAF is actively risk-managing the capability gap to simultaneously meet our NORAD and NATO commitments,” Canadian Armed Forces Captain Patricia Brunelle told CBC back in March 2017. “There will be several months of gap between the two missions [in Iceland and Romania.” That gap only looks set to become more pronounced as the Canadian wades through the politics to find some interim solution to make sure the RCAF’s fighter force at least remains somewhat functional in the meantime.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2019",US Army Buys Israeli Trophy System So Its Tanks Can Blast Incoming Projectiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army will finally install the Israeli Trophy active protection system on at least some M1A2 Abrams tanks in response to an urgent request. The service is still in the process of deciding whether or not to widely deploy the self-defense equipment, which it has been testing in response to concerns about a variety of threats, including Russian aggression in Europe and the proliferation of guided anti-tank missiles among insurgent and terrorist groups. On Sept. 28, 2017, in its daily contract announcement , the Pentagon reported that the Army had hired General Dynamics Land Systems to add the system to an unspecified number of tanks in an “armor brigade combat team” as part of an “urgent material release.” The deal, which was a modification to a previous contract, was worth almost $10 million and covered work at the firm’s Sterling Heights, Michigan location through March 2019. Trophy, a joint development between Israeli state-owned defense contractors Rafael and the Elta Group division of Israel Aircraft Industries, is a so-called “hard kill” active protection system for tanks and other armored vehicles. It combines a radar with launchers that shoot a burst of metal pellets, akin to a large shotgun, to destroy incoming anti-tank rockets and missiles. Israel declared the system operational on its own Merkava main battle tanks in 2009 and first successfully intercepted a hostile projectile two years later. According to the Israel Defense Forces and Rafael, no Merkavas suffered damage during the Israeli intervention into Gaza in 2014 , thanks in no small part to Trophy, which experienced no false alarms or misfires during the approximately three week long ground operation. You can see the system take out a projectile while operating in Gaza here . The U.S. military’s latest announcement did not specify how many tanks would receive the modifications or what unit they will belong to. As of December 2016, the Army had 14 armor brigade combat teams , which have Abrams tanks and mechanized infantry in M2 Bradley fighting vehicles at their core. At that time, the service was in the process of converting another existing brigade to the armor configuration. In April 2017, the Army also announced it would deploy 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division to Europe to take over for the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. Both of these are presently set up as armor brigades. Though 2/1st Infantry’s rotation will likely end before the Trophy work is completed, it is possible that the “urgent” modifications could be in preparation for a future rotation. The troops in Europe are part of a U.S. mission to reassure allies in the face of the Kremlin’s revanchist foreign policy. Nicknamed Operation Atlantic Resolve , this effort began following the Russian seize of Ukraine’s Crimea region in March 2014 and subsequent support for separatists fighting the government in Kiev, which as resulted in a protracted crisis . A US Army M1 Abrams tank fires a round during a training exercise in Romania in August 2016., US Army Though there is no immediate prospect of a direct conflict between the United States and Russia, the Trophy system is part of a number of U.S. military initiatives intended to demonstrate a credible deterrent against both the Kremlin’s improving conventional military forces and hybrid warfighting style. After more than a decade battling terrorists and other militants, the Army in particular has become increasingly concerned it has a limited capability to respond to this type of “near-peer” threat, something highlighted in a recent official manual on Russian military developments. In March 2017, the Army announced it would install explosive reactive armor, which detonates outward to absorb the blast from an incoming warhead, on Abrams tanks in Europe. Unfortunately, this type of system has a number of significant disadvantages, which I discussed in detail at the time. The service has also sent early iterations of the up-gunned Stryker wheeled armored vehicles and new electronic warfare systems that can knock down enemy drones to help bolster its existing commitments. On top of that, man-portable anti-tank guided missiles, including the American TOW and the Russian Kornet, have become increasingly prevalent even in more limited conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. Houthi rebels in Yemen and ISIS terrorists in Iraq have both attacked advanced tanks with these types of missiles and caused significant damage. https://youtube.com/watch?v=y5xKCzdhAC8 “The [anti-tank guided missile is the singular greatest threat to tanks today,” a 2016 Army training handbook on foreign weapon systems declares. “Nearly all … launchers are high-level threats to vehicles and rotary-wing aircraft in the U.S. Army. They can also be used against personnel and materiel targets. The variety of launch platforms is increasing.” As such, the Army has already been testing Trophy and other active protection systems for months. Other possible systems include Israel Military Industries’ Iron Fist system , which the service is looking at as an option for the M2 and M3 Bradley fight vehicles, and American defense contractor Artis’ Iron Curtain for the Stryker and other lighter vehicles. Both of these similarly employ a radar to detect incoming projectiles before firing intercepting projectiles at them. The idea of active protection is by no means new, though. The Soviets fielded one of the first systems to see widespread service, called Drozd , in the late 1970s. Iron Curtain itself was the product of a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency effort that began in 2005. The Army has long been interested in the concept, as well, planning to incorporate the defensive equipment into the abortive Future Combat Systems vehicle program. The same day it awarded General Dynamics the Trophy modification contract, the service also said it would pay DRS Sustainment Solutions , the U.S. subsidiary of Italian defense contractor Leonardo, to supply another unspecified “kinetic defeat solution” for the M1277 M-ATV mine-protected 4×4 vehicle. Rafeal is pitching a lightweight version of Trophy as a possible addition for Army and Marine Corps Joint Light Tactical Vehicles , a small and lighter cousin of the M-ATV. Active protection systems aren’t perfect of course. Most notably, just like reactive armor, they only supply a limited number of total “shots” before they become dead weight and crews cannot readily reload them during a fight. In addition, the interceptors could be dangerous to nearby supporting infantry, critical to any armor operation, especially in dense urban terrain, as well as innocent bystanders. With this limitation in mind, tactics will have to be adapted for M1A2 equipped units that field the system operationally. An ultimate solution would be the development of a rapid fire, but ammo-less system. The most obvious example would be a turreted laser that could quickly target and destroy rockets and missiles. In June 2017, Raytheon reported that it had successfully tested a relatively small turreted laser pod on an AH-64 Apache helicopter. The Army has a Stryker-mounted system in the works, but primarily for shooting down small drones. Another option might be passive electronic warfare equipment that pre-detonates rounds before they hit the vehicle, something the Russian military has reportedly fielded already . There are possible limits to both of these concepts, though. A laser or other directed energy beam could lose strength and become unreliable in adverse weather conditions or smoky and dusty battlefields. Also the laser would need to be powerful enough to kill the incoming round in a very short period of time. Although solid-state lasers are quickly becoming more powerful, they have a ways to go before such a solution is viable. A jammer would have to be able to create a “bubble” around a vehicle without disrupting friendly communications or other electronic systems, and it would likely be less reliable against wide range of system than a kinetic or laser kill option. With these issues in mind, the Army itself has struggled to decide how much to rely on active protection systems. With any vehicle only able to handle so much weight, designers have to offset the additional strain of new defense equipment, no matter how lightweight, elsewhere. “The real sort of Holy Grail of technologies that I’m trying to find on this thing is material – is the armor itself,” U.S. Army General Mark Milley told reporters at the National Press Club in July 2017. “If we can discover a material – and I’ve got a lot of research and development going into it – if we can discover a material that is significantly lighter in weight that gives you the same armor protection, that would be a real significant breakthrough.” Earlier in Sept. 2017, the Army Requirements Oversight Council, which works to develop overarching operational requirements and concepts, had decided that more testing was needed on Trophy. This was due to an unspecified loss of performance with regards to the turret and other impacts on the Abrams’ basic functioning. Smoke and dust covers an M1 Abrams after it fires a shot during a drill in Germany in 2014., US Army Other Army officials have suggested in the past there is an institutional reluctance to eschew any amount of passive armor plating in favor of active protection. Confidence in a system is an important, if intangible factor. “There has to be a level of trust in whatever it is that you’re trying [to use] to displace that passive armor,” U.S. Army Lieutenant General John Murray, Deputy Chief of Staff for Resource Management, told industry representatives in March 2017. He said at the time he wasn’t sure troops had that level of faith in active protection. Given the latest contract announcement, it seems that this perception has changed, at least for some members of the Army’s leadership.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 15, 2019",The US Navy Has Created Its First Ever Underwater Drone Squadron,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has created its first ever dedicated underwater drone unit, Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One, or UUVRON 1, splitting it off from a secretive submarine unit in the process. The decision highlights the steadily growing importance of unmanned craft within the service, which hopes to have dedicated operational unmanned undersea elements by the end of the decade, and across the U.S. military in general. The Navy formally activated UUVRON 1 at a ceremony at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Keyport, Washington. At the same time, the new organization replaced a smaller detachment that had been part of Submarine Development Squadron Five (DEVRON 5). This unit still contains a variety of unique elements, including the USS Jimmy Carter spy sub, which recently returned from a shadowy, but apparently successful mission , as well as the Detachment Undersea Research and Development, which has been associated with those covert activities in the past. “Today we are transitioning our UUV detachment into the first UUV squadron,” U.S. Navy Captain Robert Gaucher, the outgoing head of DEVRON 5 said during the event . “Why is this historical? It’s because in standing up UUVRON 1, it shows our Navy’s commitment to the future of unmanned systems and undersea combat.” The previous Detachment Unmanned Undersea Vehicles was already a relatively young unit. It only received its first underwater drone, a torpedo shaped vehicle known as a Large Training Vehicle 38, in August 2014. The Large Training Vehicle 38., USN “This is certainly a key milestone,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant Brian Nuss, then the officer in charge of the detachment, said at the time .  “The future large-diameter vehicles will come in 2020 and in order for the detachment to fully prepare for the delivery of those vehicles we have to start with the tactics, training and procedures now to make it a successful program in the future.” The implication here would be that, at least for a period, the Navy planned for UUVRON 1 to reach its full operational capability at some point in 2020. It is possible that the service may be able to get the squadron fully up and running sooner, depending on how the state of the training pipeline to staff the necessary slots and what additional equipment it needs to acquire. Another possibility is that UUVRON 1 will continue to focus on research and development and test evaluation, while the Navy works to establish operational unmanned undersea units. It could be those organizations that the service expects to be ready to go by 2020. Whatever the case, the capability is important and it’s a long time coming. By 2020, the Navy will have spent two decades working on achieving the broad goals outlined in its unmanned undersea vehicle master plans. Sailors prepare to deploy a King Fish counter-mine drone., USN The service published the first of these white papers in 2000 and issued a new version in 2004. Seven years later, Seapower Magazine reported there was another updated document, but that it was classified. “We actually have action plans on all the missions we are trying to achieve,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, then the director of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities within the Navy’s Information Dominance unit, told Seapower about the new plan. It “covers every spectrum,” from a military missions, such as mine hunting and surveillance, to humanitarian assistance and research roles. It’s very likely that some of all of the missions in the 2011 roadmap were the same or similar to the nearly a dozen roles outlined in the 2004 document, which is publicly available. Some of these were intelligence gathering, time critical strike, anti-mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare, communication relaying, and force protection against enemy special operations forces and combat divers and terrorists. In addition, the Navy said it could be possible that a final unmanned undersea vehicle design could be modular, able to carry a number of payloads, including expendable weapons or remote sensors, depending on the needs of the mission. A graphic discussing possible underwater drone payloads from the US Navy’s 2004 roadmap., USN In a speech on Feb. 3, 2016, and in line with the so-called “ Third Offset ” strategy to stay technologically ahead of potential enemies, then Secretary of Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said the U.S. military as a whole would be investing $600 million in a variety of unmanned undersea systems. It’s “a new capability you’ll be seeing a lot more of” and would be part of larger plans for “making our ships and aircraft work together in ways that they haven’t before but technology makes possible,” he told sailors during the event in San Diego, California. This suggested a significant increase over the Navy’s budgeting at the time. In the fiscal year 2016 budget proposal, the service asked for just shy of $5 million for various undersea drone projects, less than five percent of the annual expenditure Carter was suggesting. At present, the majority of the Navy’s existing underwater drones fall into one of two categories, either being focused on mine hunting or employed in oceanographic mapping and research roles. In a bizarre episode in December 2016, members of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) snatched one of the latter vehicles, commonly known as gliders, out of the water in the South China Sea , before unceremoniously returning it days later. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4-DJ-ywOEqY The benefits in both of these cases are relatively clear cut. Gliders can help gather information about the ocean and sea floor faster and cheaper than sailing a large research vessel along the same routes. It is possible that they may be able to get into areas that would be too shallow or narrow for a larger ship, as well. They are far more persistent than a manned vessel as well, allowing for collection of data over a far larger timeframe. When it comes to mines, on land or at sea, using a remote sensor of some kind to identify an object help keeps personnel away from danger. A drone can move in very close to an object to examine it with relatively little risk and possibly disarm it without having to send out a specialized team. All of this helps commanders maneuver safely through potentially contested and congested waterways. Naval mines, including improvised ones that non-state actors are crafting, are a serious threat to both commercial shipping and naval vessels. Sailors release a Swordfish mine-hunting underwater drone. , USN At the same time, the Navy is working on a so-called Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV), as part of a program known as Snakehead. Detachment Unmanned Undersea Vehicles’s Large Training Vehicle 38 had been a surrogate for this vehicle, the first prototypes of which are expected to be in the water by 2019, according to USNI News . Not surprisingly, UUVRON 1 is slated to receive the first experimental LDUUV. There are also future plans for extra large systems that could operate as either a remote controlled or autonomous mini-submarine or even have the ability to be optionally manned if need be. In 2015, a team of Huntington Ingalls Underwater Solutions Group, Bluefin Robotics, and Battelle demonstrated on such vehicle Proteus. The next year, Boeing showed off the huge Echo Voyager , claiming it could operation underwater for up to six months. The Echo Voyager with an individual standing at the rear giving a sense of scale., Boeing There’s no real definitive idea of what these vehicles might look like in the end, those most of the notional concepts are shaped like little subs. In 2014, though, the U.S. Navy showed off a underwater drone that looked and moved like a shark. As of earlier in 2017, the Office of Naval Research was working on an unmanned flying craft that could hit the water and then turn into a subsurface vehicle, though purely as a proof of concept. A number of private companies are also working on similar convertible water craft that are both manned and unmanned . The Office of Naval Research’s Flying Sea Glider., Joseph Trevithick Whatever it looks like, the Navy’s initial goal for the final Snakehead is a design that can conduct a variety of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance functions. This could include gathering intelligence on enemy ships or facilities ashore, patrolling waterways for items of interest, or gathering information about a body of water, beach, or other landing side ahead of an attack naval or amphibious operation. Again, the benefit of a using a drone for these functions it that it offers a lower cost and reduced risk option, especially when attempting to gather information about heavily defended or otherwise restricted areas. With regards to unmanned undersea vehicles, it also reduces the burden on larger submarines, allowing them to focus on higher priority missions that requirement their more expansive intelligence gathering and weapon systems. The option to use a unmanned vehicle for these jobs will likely only become more important in the coming years, as well. Though we at The War Zone more often talk about concepts such as “anti-access and area denial” in terms of integrated air defense networks , many of the U.S. military’s potential opponents are exploring similar arrangements at sea. In May 2017, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) said it was beginning construction of an expansive sensor net in the South China Sea for “environmental” purposes. Of course, these nodes could just as easily end up configured to keep watch for submarines and in a conflict, it would be especially useful to be able to find the exact locations of the nodes and attempt to size up their capabilities without risking detection in a manned boat in the process. Further versions of Snakehead could carry actual weapons or electronic warfare payloads, to disable underwater sensors and mines or attack other undersea vessels, surface ships, or targets on land, depending on the final configuration. Though not mentioned specifically, it is possible that multiple LDUUVs could operate as a single swarm to confuse, distract, or overwhelm enemy defenses, or operate in combination with small underwater drones for that purpose. Networked together and connected to manned submarines, surface ships, or even aircraft, one or more of these unmanned underwater craft could just extend the situational awareness for the whole group along a broad front. “I can think of so many missions that unmanned systems can help out,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Robert Girrier, then Director of Unmanned Warfare Systems within the Navy’s top Unmanned Systems Office, said during a talk at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in February 2016 . Citing a desire for unmanned systems to be more of an integral part of operations in general, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mike Manazir, then Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Systems, shut down the office , also known as N99, in January 2017. Exactly what sort of systems and tactics will work or not is likely to be UUVRON 1’s primary concern regardless of whether it is considered an operational or trials unit. If the Navy sticks to its existing plans, we should start seeing some clues about what conclusions they’ve arrived at in the next few years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 17, 2018",NOAA’s Flying Hurricane Hunters Launch Suicidal “Coyote” Drones Into The Middle of Storms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The idea of flying straight into a hurricane probably isn’t for the faint of heart to begin with, but there are some parts that are just too dangerous for manned aircraft no matter the crew. So, as Hurricane Maria made its way toward the Caribbean and North America, scientists from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched Coyote drones into these hard to reach areas of the storm to gather vital information, highlighting just one of many emerging roles for expendable unmanned aircraft . Between Sept. 23 and 24, NOAA’s WP-3D Orion research aircraft dropped a total of six of the small remotely operated aircraft into Maria’s “eyewall,” a boundary layer between the eye and the rest of the storm where the weather is most severe and winds can reach speeds of 200 miles per hour or more, according to manufacturer Raytheon . The Coyotes gathered air pressure, moisture, temperature, and wind speed and direction data during the flights. “NOAA is investing in these unmanned aircraft and other technologies to increase weather observations designed to improve the accuracy of our hurricane forecasts,” Dr. Joe Cione, the head of the Coyote program at NOAA’s Hurricane Research Division, said in the Raytheon press release. “The Coyotes collected critical, continuous observations in the lower part of the hurricane, an area impossible to reach with manned aircraft.” Raytheon offers the seven-pound Coyote as a lightweight, low-cost platform for a variety of roles. Personnel can get the drone airborne from a common launch tube either on the ground, a ship, or on board an aircraft. After launch, a six-foot wide main wing, two rear stabilizers and twin vertical tails all pop into place, giving the pilotless aircraft a distinctive look. A Coyote on display at the Navy League’s 2017 Sea Air Space exposition., Joseph Trevithick NOAA’s WP-3Ds , originally Navy sub hunters, drop the unmanned aircraft from the plane’s repurposed sonar buoy launchers near the rear. Previously, scientists would release dropsondes , basically small air-droppable and expendable pods carrying similar sensors, from these tubes. In a hurricane or other tropical storm, with winds often 100 miles per hour or faster, these unpowered devices could easily get knocked off course. Crews would already have to fly relatively close to the specific part they were interested in gathering information about to have any chance of success. The two WP-3Ds , which NOAA’s Aircraft Operations Center has nicknamed Kermit and Miss Piggy after the famous Muppets characters , have radars and other sensors on board. A single Gulfstream IV business jet, called Gonzo after another one of the Muppets, also supports the Hurricane Research Division. The agency has a number of other smaller aircraft for other weather surveillance purposes, too. “Kermit,” one of NOAA’s two WP-3Ds, in its latest paint scheme., NOAA During a typical mission, crews would fly through the storm in a series of straight lines, and also fly around its outer edge. Over the course of the flight, they would employ dropsondes and gather additional information from their radars and other sensors. “What does get interesting is flying through the hurricane’s rainbands and the eyewall, which can get a bit turbulent,” Chris Landsea, an employee of NOAA’s National Hurricane Center, wrote in a description of flying through the storms for the agency’s website. “The eyewall is a donut-like ring of thunderstorms that surround the calm eye. The winds within the eyewall can reach as much as 200 miles per hour at the flight level, but you can’t feel these aboard the plane. But what makes flying through the eyewall exhilarating and at times somewhat scary, are the turbulent updrafts and downdrafts that one hits.” A flight plan for one of the WP-3D flights in and around Hurricane Maria., NOAA Now, with Coyote, researchers can maneuver the sensors into the correct position without exposing themselves to unnecessary danger. A datalink transmits the information back to the Orion so it’s not an issue if the drone ends up destroyed. The Coyotes do have a parachute so personnel can recover them for training purposes. “Data from these new and promising technologies have yet to be analyzed but are expected to provide unique and potentially groundbreaking insights into a critical region of the storm environment that is typically difficult to observe in sufficient detail,” Cione said in 2014 after NOAA’s first use of Coyote ever as part of the observation of Hurricane Edouard. The agency had purchased the drones with funding Disaster Relief Appropriations Act in the wake of Hurricane Sandy , which caused severe damage to the coasts of New York and New Jersey in particular. In 2016, NOAA began receiving improved Coyotes from Raytheon. The biggest improvement was an increase in how far away the drones could fly from the controller on the WP-3Ds. The latest models can operate up to 50 miles from the host aircraft and fly for approximately one hour with the research sensor payloads. NOAA’s first Coyote in 2014., NOAA Though the researchers have used the drones to supply information about the storms to help forecasters model the possible impacts and predict their paths, NOAA’s main mission remains focused on broader research to improve the accuracy of such data and how scientists gather and analyze it to begin with. These studies contribute to long-term planning and readiness projects, as well as generally increasing the knowledge base of how storms work. The U.S. Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, situated at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, remains the U.S. government’s main hurricane hunting arm. The unit has specially configured WC-130 aircraft , which can release dropsondes, but have no adopted the Coyote drone. The U.S. Navy stopped contributing to the hurricane hunting mission in 1974, according to NOAA . One of the US Air Force Reserve’s WC-130J hurricane hunting aircraft., USAF But the research mission underscores the broader potential of a system like Coyote for both civil and military applications. Raytheon says the drone is big enough to carry cameras and other sensors for military intelligence and surveillance missions. It’s could even carry an offensive payload, loitering over the battlefield for an extended, before striking a target of opportunity. American special operations forces have already put a similar system, called Switchblade , into use in the Middle East and Israeli has mastered the “optionally expendable” drone concept many years ago. Perhaps more importantly, the lightweight nature of Coyote, combined with a robust network, could allow a group of the unmanned aircraft to operate as single swarm , providing surveillance over a wider areas, a distributed attack on a variety of enemy positions, or other missions. The Defense Advanced Research Projects agency is in the midst of a research and development program to explore the potential of just such a system as part of project appropriately dubbed Germlins . The same capabilities could be useful in law enforcement or humanitarian relief scenarios, among others, as well. At present, many U.S. civilian government agencies have to rely in large part on the relatively limited views from still and video cameras to rapidly assess damage or other hazards after a major storm or other disaster. On top of that, NOAA’s operations show it is entirely possible for an aircraft to rapidly launch Coyotes or a similar drone and either control it directly or give it directions to follow autonomously. In the past, the U.S. Air Force has considered adding a similar capability to its AC-130 gunships, which would potentially allow them to spot and track targets beyond the range of their built in sensors or examine them in closer detail from a safe distance before decide to engage. The latest AC-130W Stinger II and up-coming AC-130J Ghostrider variants, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps Harvest Hawk KC-130 aircraft , already have common launch tubes that are able to fire AGM-176 Griffin missiles and GBU-69/B Small Slide Munition precision guided bombs. It would not be difficult to add Coyote as another option in the arsenal. Raytheon is already working with the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research on Coyote as part of its Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology effort, or LOCUST . The service is interested in swarms of Coyotes for intelligence gathering purposes or even possibly as decoys to distract or confuse an opponent, and any integrated air defenses they might have in particular, during a large scale attack. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo The U.S. Army has also expressed interest in the possibility of using the drones to take out hostile small unmanned aircraft, such as the commercial quad- and hex-copter style types that terrorist groups like ISIS have flown in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military as a whole is slowly waking up to this and other aerial threats, an issue that The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway recently explored in depth . If climate change trends continue to produce larger and more powerful hurricanes, the Coyotes will only become more important to NOAA’s research efforts. At the same time, it’s very likely that we could see the drones, or similar small, low-cost designs end up perform an array of other missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 18, 2018",Taliban Tries to Kill Mattis as US Struggles With New Afghanistan Strategy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Taliban has tried to assassinate U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis months after he bluntly acknowledged the Afghan government and its American-led coalition partners were losing the war in the country against Taliban insurgents and terrorists, including ISIS. The brazen attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport in the capital Kabul comes as the U.S. government is still struggling to implement a new vision for the conflict. In the attack on Sept. 27, 2017, the Afghan insurgents fired at least 40 rounds at the airport, including rocket propelled grenades and mortar bombs, according to reports . Mattis had earlier arrived for an official visit, but the timing was unannounced precisely due to these types of security concerns. There is no indication that the Secretary was ever in any actual danger from the inaccurate bombardment. It did reportedly kill one civilian, wound nearly a dozen more, and lead to a firefight in a nearby neighborhood where Afghan troops killed four militants. An official statement from the U.S.-led coalition said it had conducted an air strike in support of the Afghan response, but that “tragically, one of the missiles malfunctioned, causing several casualties.” America’s longest war “A lot is riding on this of course as we look toward how do we put an end to this fighting and the threat of terrorism to the Afghan people, to the international community and how do we put this into a path of political reconciliation,” the top American defense official said later in the day at the Presidential Palace, speaking alongside Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. “We are here to set the military and security conditions for that but recognize ultimately the responsibility for the Afghan leadership under your direction.” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had also traveled to Afghanistan with Mattis. U.S. Army General John Nicholson, head of all American and coalition troops in the country, joined them at the press conference. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, right, with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, center, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul The trip comes more than a month after President Donald Trump unveiled a new U.S. government strategy for the war in Afghanistan and the broader security situation in South Asia. Trump’s speech described what appeared to be largely a rehash of old ideas and, more worryingly, was often vague and contradictory , offering no clear indication of how the conflict would actually end. “Ultimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace,” Trump declared in his speech on Aug. 21, 2017. “We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live, or how to govern their own complex society.  We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.” But in spite of this, Trump promised a whole-of-government approach that included diplomatic and economic efforts, as well as a dramatically stepped up military campaign. He also implored allies, chiefly India, to step up economic and other developmental assistance for Afghanistan. These sorts of engagements have been the main components of the past nation building the president had just decried. Trump also said support for Afghanistan would not be “blank check” and had to be matched by real progress on the part of its government and security forces, almost identical to language President Barack Obama used in his own policy speech in 2009. In addition, Trump, again as Obama had done before, zeroed in on the need for Pakistan to do more to stop insurgents and terrorists from operating freely on their side of the border. The Pakistani government has repeatedly and forcefully denied it is unwilling or unable to act against these groups. Afghan police take up positions after bombings in Kabul in March 2017., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul A new-ish strategy The bulk of Trump’s new provisions seemed to be largely tactical rather than strategic in nature. Most pointedly, the “strategy” focused heavily on the relaxation of unspecified “restrictions” on how and when American forces and their partners can conduct operations. Many interpreted this mainly as an intention to reduce the existing emphasis on avoiding civilian casualties , which the Trump Administration had already put into practice in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. “Micromanagement from Washington, D.C. does not win battles,” Trump said in his big reveal. “They are won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers acting in real time, with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy.” The policy announcement had little in the way of details on what sort of metrics the U.S. government would use to define progress and success on and off the battlefield, nor what sort of force increases were coming. Trump insisted that this was part of his campaign promise to keep this information secret and prevent it from giving America’s enemies an edge. “I’ve said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military options,” Trump said. “We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities.” President Donald Trump announced the new Afghanistan and South Asia strategy in August 2017., AP In reality, it seemed to have been in no small part because no one had agreed on the specifics before the speech or that this had gotten left out of the crafting of the policy altogether. The head of the U.S. Air force, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mattis himself have all gone on record since the speech to say they they’ve been finalizing the total number of troops they wanted to add into the mix. “It’s actually too early to tell what this will mean in terms of plus-ups and reductions,” Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force General David Goldfein said in an interview Reuters published on Aug. 22, 2017. “Obviously the Joint Chiefs will work through their plans and make proposals, but I think the guidance was pretty clear from the president last night, and we’re going to go on the offensive and destroy these terrorist networks,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who had joined Goldfein to talk to Reuters, added. On Aug. 28, 2017, Pentagon spokesman U.S. Army Colonel Rob Manning confirmed to The Washington Post that there was still planning going on despite Trump’s policy announcement. Mattis had told Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford “to put together a plan to achieve the strategic goals of the president’s strategy.” The U.S. military has since deployed hundreds of additional ground troops, as well as sending more F-16 fighter jets and KC-135 tankers to Afghanistan. The use of B-52 bombers flying from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which began in March 2017 , has also continued to increase. There was also a troubling admission that not only had the Pentagon grossly underrepresented the number of personnel it had in the country to begin with for years, but that it did not necessary know the true figure itself. “The first thing I have to do is ‘level the bubble,’ and account for everybody that is on the ground there now,” Mattis said on Aug. 22, 2017. “The idea being that we’re not going to have different pockets that we are accounting for.” A US Air Force F-16 takes off from Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan., USAF Defining success Ahead of his visit to Afghanistan, the Secretary of Defense seemed to concede that there were still many unknowns as he traveled to India on Sept. 24, 2017. A reporter asked him specifically about metrics for success in the long-running conflict. “Yes, I’m not prepared to give those yet, because I need to get to Afghanistan, and I need to sit down in Brussels with the other nations and talk with them together about what the metrics are, and make certain we all put our heads together on this,” he offered in response . “So, once I have that, I’ll get very specific.  In general terms, you know what the metrics are, but I want to get a lot more specific.” He did not elaborate on these apparently obvious standards. This vagary is nothing new and what “it” might be became a key joke in the controversial Netflix original movie about Afghanistan War Machine . We at The War Zone have noted this lack of a clear goal and desired end state as unfortunately consistent elements of America’s now 16-year campaign in Afghanistan. In June 2017, I wrote: Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee any of this would work any better than it has in the past. Historically, Afghanistan’s endemic corruption has undercut these efforts. SIGAR [the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction] has routinely found examples of American officials wasting money on unnecessary projects, local contractors defrauding the United States and the Afghan government, and more. The country’s military has routinely proven unable to quickly absorb deliveries of new equipment, even systems that offer only modest improvements, and put them to good use. And we’ve seen in Iraq and Syria that “advise and assist” missions with forces that are not able to operate independently of outside support, or are just insufficiently motivated, can easily translate into what most people would reasonably consider combat for American troops. Even without seeing Mattis’ final proposal, there are definitely reasons for skepticism of any plan “win” the war in Afghanistan in general, not least of which because so many of the individuals responsible for crafting the new strategy were involved to some degree in crafting the old ones they now say have failed. While he retired from the Marine Corps in 2013, his fellow Marine, General Joseph Dunford, who is now Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the head of American and coalition forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Army General John Nicholson, have been in uniform the whole time. Before taking up his current post, Dunford had held Nicholson’s job title. Nicholson previously served as both a brigade-level and regional commander in Afghanistan. In those positions, they both went on the record with pronouncements that later turned out to be far detached from the reality. In 2009, Nicholson, then a brigadier general and the top coalition officer in Southern Afghanistan, said he was “unapologetically optimistic” about the upcoming surge of troops that President Barack Obama had recently announced. “To me, to see this increase in U.S. forces means we are now resourcing our counterinsurgency appropriately to accomplish what it is we have laid down in our [Afghanistan-Pakistan] strategy,” he continued in an official military interview. “So I am very encouraged and feel that this is going to make a big difference.” U.S. Army General John Nicholson, left, and U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford meet in Afghanistan in 2016., AP Photo/Robert Burns Years of wasted effort There is no reason to believe these factors are any less of a challenge now than they were earlier in 2017. In fact, evidence has emerged that what some have called “The Afghan Condition” is even worse than had been previously understood. Earlier in September 2017, SIGAR released an exhaustive and damning report cataloging the failures of more than a decade of a assistance to Afghanistan’s own military, which the U.S. government routinely says is and has to be in the lead as part of any successful resolution to the conflict. The $70 billion dollar effort – a relatively paltry sum that amounts to an average of $5 billion per year, roughly equivalent to what the United States expects to spend on military activities in Europe in the 2018 fiscal year aimed at challenging Russian aggression, but where these is no active conflict – was beset by problems ranging from the worrisome to the bizarre. The NATO-run training mission throughout the country generally had less than 50 percent of its authorized manpower, limiting its ability to focus on the development of cohesive security institutions. This meant that most advising and assistance efforts went to combat elements, leaving vital logistics and administrative functions critically underdeveloped. The impacts of this have been destructive functionally and to overall morale, with Afghan troops unable to maintain a variety of equipment that could be important to combating the Taliban and other groups. We have specifically highlighted these issues here at The War Zone with regards to the Afghan Air Force . American personnel load a UH-60A+ helicopter for Afghanistan onto a C-17 cargo plane., US Army “Critical … capabilities, including aviation, intelligence, force management, and special forces, were not included in early U.S., Afghan, and NATO force-design plans,” the U.S. government watchdog noted in a press release. In turn, “providing advanced Western weapons and management systems to a largely illiterate and uneducated force without appropriate training and infrastructure created long-term dependencies, required increased U.S. fiscal support, and extended sustainability timelines.” Afghanistan’s special operations forces have since become especially competent and capable, but remain a small portion of the country’s overall security forces. Their abilities and willingness to engage the enemy has meant they’re responsible for the majority of combat operations , though, even when they might be ill suited to the job. On top of that, the foreign coalition saw the police as of secondary importance to the military.The use of quasi-police forces, such as Afghan Local Police militias and the now defunct Afghan Public Protection Force , to help fill security voids at the local level was also often counter-productive. “With limited oversight from and accountability to the Afghan government and the United States, these police forces were reported to have engaged in human rights abuses, drug trafficking, and other corrupt activities, ultimately serving as a net detractor from security,” the full review noted. “While the United States stopped supporting two of the programs due to these issues, the Afghan Local Police continue to operate today.” Afghan Uniformed Police respond to another attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in 2015., AP Photo/Massoud Hossaini The routine inability for the U.S.-led coalition to properly allocate military advisers and contractors only compounded the difficulties in training the Afghans due to illiteracy, corruption, the persistence of the opium trade , and other factors. In many cases, assisting personnel had no knowledge of the subject matter they were supposed to be teaching. “One U.S. officer watched TV shows like Cops and NCIS to learn what he should teach [to police,” according to SIGAR’s press release. “In eastern Afghanistan, we met a U.S. Army helicopter pilot assigned to teach policing.” This would not have been a new revelation to the U.S. military. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, we obtained a Department of Defense Inspector General report from 2016 on the training of Afghan intelligence personnel, which, though heavily redacted, described many of the same issues. “The contractor trainers said they largely relied on materials provided by CSA [combat support agencies] LNOs [liaison officers], unclassified training material from the internet, and their own experience,” according to an unclassified section. Though we don’t know what agencies specifically provided some of the training information, the Pentagon’s combat support agencies do include the National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. DOD via FOIA Neither the Department of Defense Inspector General nor the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan has answered queries about whether or not personnel in the country had implemented recommendations in that report, which were almost entirely redacted. The coalition’s public affairs office has yet to answer whether or not it still sees the previous assessment of the existence of an “Afghan Condition” as valid. Though Mattis downplayed the attack at the airport in Kabul, the Taliban’s ability to strike at such a public location in the country’s capital, heavily monitored by both Afghan and foreign forces, underscores the real state of the conflict. It remains unclear how hundreds or even a few thousand additional American and other coalition troops will be able to do anything besides maintain the status quo stalemate, at least in the near term. “We are ready to train, assist, and advise,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Sept. 27, 2017, a somewhat odd remark given that the alliance has been running training activities for more than a decade already. “We would like to help you break the stalemate that we have seen,” he added, echoing earlier comments by Secretary Mattis and General Dunford. Key to breaking this cycle will be overcoming the inherent challenges of Afghanistan, as well as finally closing off save havens in Pakistan to militant groups, which has long stymied the U.S. coalition’s efforts to neutralize the Taliban, the Haqqani network, and other factions opposed to the government in Kabul, which exist on both sides of the border. Without truly addressing this multi-national issue, its hard to see how Afghanistan and its partners could truly arrive at any final settlement. Now that Mattis has seen Afghanistan, and the Taliban have made a pointed attempt to kill him, it remains to be seen what takeaways he’ll have as the Trump Administration continues to try and implement their vision for America’s longest war.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Mysterious US Army Spy Plane Turns Up at the Boneyard in Arizona,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s famous boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base houses more than 3,600 airframes in various types of storage, either as spares , sources of parts , or otherwise awaiting a new life or the junk heap. Now, it’s also home to two particularly secretive de Havilland Canada DHC-7 spy planes. On Sept. 22, 2017, the 309th Aerospace Maintenance And Regeneration Group, the U.S. Air Force unit that manages the facility, posted pictures of a number of recent arrivals, including a P-3C Orion patrol plane, a C-130H airlifter, a C-20B business jet, and an MH-60R helicopter. Another photo showed a DHC-7. To the casual observer, there might not appear to be anything special about this white-and-gray four engine plane, especially with much of its special equipment apparently removed, but it has had a long and still largely unknown career. A surprise appearance On Facebook, the 309th referred to the aircraft by the serial number 00-000076. In an Email, a public affairs officer for the unit provided information that showed it had arrived in the desert on Aug. 8, 2017. A second DHC-7, with the serial number 00-000056 had touched down nearly a year earlier, on Aug. 29, 2016, according to an official table of all of the aircraft in the boneyard. These two aircraft are much more commonly known by the civil registration codes N176RA and N566CC. While the Federal Aviation Administration issued those registrations to the Army’s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, the N176RA apparently went to Arizona by way of the Maryland Army National Guard in Hagerstown on the other side of the state, the 309th’s public affairs official said. Who had been flying these two planes and in support of what operations remains something of a mystery. In 2011, both N176RA and N566CC flew missions out of Kandahar Air Base in Afghanistan. Observers noticed at least one of the aircraft flying routinely over Benghazi, Libya in 2016, a hotbed of terrorist activity and an area of intense American military interest after the infamous assault on the U.S. consulate there in 2012. One was seen over Derna, Libya, east of Benghazi, in January 2017. Those missions likely originated in Malta . But there is no doubt that they had been intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms. For years, plane spotters have caught both N176RA and her sister crisscrossing the world, particularly during stopovers at commercial airports in Europe. They snapped pictures showing an array of blisters, bumps, antennas, and other features well associated with spy planes. Radomes underneath the fuselage would undoubtedly have held some sort of radar, likely able to produce imagery, spot and tracking moving targets, or both. Fairings on either side might hold additional radars or simply serve as a mounting point for other antennas. The array of aerials underneath and along the sides could form a signals intelligence system able to spot enemy radios and other emitters and possibly listen in on communications chatter. Sometimes they had a large dome on top that is common to satellite communications systems and datalinks, so the aircraft can share any information it collects in near real time. The planes also had infrared missile warning sensors and flare dispensers for self-protection. But more interestingly, under the fuselage these aircraft had three additional sensor positions with sliding doors to protect them when they’re not in use. This type of installation generally houses some type of wide-angle visual or infrared camera, or a multi-optic wide-area aerial surveillance system. The latter systems generally allow crews to take still imagery or full motion video of large sectors to help track targets and retrace their movements. Combined with a radar to spot moving objects, it is even easier for the aircraft to locate targets and monitor their movements, proving persistent imagery to help analysts build what is called “a pattern of life.” You can read more about the technology and this concept here . Similar installations have been spotted on other shadowy turboprop spy planes, like this CN235 that was operating over Seattle this Summer. All of the radomes are gone and many of the antennas are missing from N176RA now that its at the boneyard. Its not clear from the available picture whether the ventral doors got sealed before or after it went into storage. The Army’s other DHC-7s And while we don’t know the exact configurations of the two aircraft, what units flew them, or what purposes, we have a number of clues that offer a good sense of what these planes were capable of and what types of missions they eventually found themselves on overseas. The U.S. Army’s use of the DHC-7 as an intelligence gathering platform is well established. In March 1991, the Army hired California Microwave, Inc. to build the first version , which was only able to gather visual and infrared imagery, as part of the Grisly Hunter Program. The service had previously considered installing some or all of these sensors on a twin engine CASA 212 light transport and a single engine RG-8A powered glider , among other platforms. The aircraft had an electro-optical turret, a forward looking infrared system, and a wide-angle infrared line scanner camera in three separate positions along the bottom of the fuselage behind doors similar to what one sees on N176RA and N566CC. An Army RG-8A from the early phases of the Grisly Hunter program., US Army via FOIA The next month, the Army ordered two more DHC-7 spy planes with signals intelligence suites from the Maryland-based firm as part of a separate program called Crazy Panther. This pair dispensed with the underside ports and featured arrays of antennas instead. The two types, known as the O-5A and EO-5B, quickly went off to hunt insurgents and drug runners in Latin America. The complete systems were called the Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Imagery Intelligence and Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Communications Intelligence, or ARL-I and ARL-C. US Army Eventually, the Army realized it was a waste to have two separate aircraft for these roles, and bought three more “multi-sensor” ARL-Ms under yet another project called Crazy Hawk. Though they retained most of the systems found on both of the earlier ARL types, these planes, initially called RC-7Bs and then renamed EO-5Cs, swapped out the camera turret for a Hughes synthetic aperture radar in a retractable radome, which was able to produce imagery and monitor moving targets. The first of these types went to the Korean Peninsula in 1996 to keep watch over the demilitarized zone, where they still fly today . Over the years, the Army steadily upgraded and improved the systems, including adding electro-optical turrets back onto some of the EO-5Cs. By 2002, the fleet had also expanded to seven total operational aircraft, along with a single trainer type. All of these planes wear a white paint scheme with a pair of red stripes running down the sides of the fuselage. A US Army EO-5C., US Army Given the obvious similarities, N176RA and N566CC get described as EO-5Cs all the time, but we know they’re not. We can account for all eight ARL-M aircraft and all of their civil registrations are publicly available. Five of them are with the 204th Military Intelligence Battalion at Fort Bliss in Texas and the other three are part of the 3rd Military Intelligence Battalion in South Korea. US Army US Army A curious history Exactly how the other two DHC-7s came into their role as spy planes isn’t entirely clear. We do know that N176RA spent at least some time with the Joint Precision Strike Demonstration (JPSD) Project Office, an obscure organization that came into existence in 1991 as part of a larger Pentagon-wide program known as the Precision Strike Thrust. This “thrust” was “a set of integrated capabilities, from sensors to shooters, to locate, identify and kill high-value, time-sensitive, tactical targets, in adverse weather conditions, day or night, and to provide the Commander with near real-time battle damage assessment,” according to a 1994 Army report . The JPSD was the Army’s part of that initiative, which tested everything from long-range rocket artillery to airborne sensors, including synthetic aperture imaging radars , as well as some of the very first Predator drones . In 2003, a plane spotter caught a glimpse of N176RA wearing an overall white paint scheme similar to the EO-5C colors, but with green instead of red stripes. The aircraft also had the JPSD logo on the tail. A year earlier, the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratory had produced high resolution maps using radar imagery a “DHC-7” from the JPSD program captured of the sites of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Park City, Utah, along with unspecified parts South Korea, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. These images went to the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and multiple law enforcement agencies. It is entirely possible that N176RA, along with N566CC, remained test beds for new sensor technology even after the end of the JPSD program. The DHC-7’s size would provide ample space for a variety of radars, laser imaging, still and video cameras, and other systems. For a time, both it and N566CC wore overall white paint schemes before switching to the final swhite-over-gray style, neither of which are particularly indicative or any service or unit. It’s not uncommon for the U.S. military and other U.S. government organizations to send similar aircraft to actual conflict zones and hot spots to field test new equipment. NP-3D Orions from the U.S. Navy’s Scientific Development Squadron One (VXS-1) have made trips to Afghanistan and the Caribbean for geographic survey and surveillance missions. NASA’s unique WB-57F research aircraft have made similar deployments to Afghanistan and parts of Africa as a communications node. Another possibility is that these aircraft quietly moved from the Army’s research and development world to the special operations community, joining a variety of other secretive aircraft supporting some of the most shadowy elements of the U.S. military, including the Joint Special Operations Command. In March 2016, one of these planes, a contractor-flown Beechcraft King Air, crashed in Iraq . As with N176RA and N566CC, its civil registration, N6351V, pointed to Aberdeen Proving Ground. The latest detail that these aircraft came to the boneyard from the Army National Guard suggests that they could have been attached to one of these reserve elements for at least a time. Both the Army and Air National Guard do deploy units overseas. Maryland’s Army National Guard does include a military intelligence battalion, as well as multiple special operations units , but none appear to have aviation components. It’s also unclear whether the Army has put the two DHC-7s into storage permanently or if they already have plans to resurrect them at some point in the future. Whatever unit was flying them could easily have replaced them with a more advanced or otherwise newer system. The aircraft is long out of production and the newest examples of the type are almost 30 years old. The Army as a whole is ditching the type in favor of intelligence gathering aircraft based on the Dash-8 , a successor design that Bombardier, which bought de Havilland Canada in 1992, still produces in some configurations. With so much still unknown, we’re going to keep digging into these curious aircraft ourselves, but if you have any additional details, feel free to leave them in the comments below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2019",New US Army Manual Shows It’s Worried About Russia’s Hybrid Warfare Tactics,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. military approaches two decades of persistent campaigns against terrorists and militants, there has become concern that American troops are increasingly ill-prepared to fight a more capable “near-peer” foe, such as Russia.  With this in mind, the U.S. Army has crafted handbook detailing changes in the Russian military, highlighting topics regular readers of The War Zone might already be familiar with, including so-called “ anti-access/area denial ” weaponry, small drones , electronic and cyber warfare , and the use of proxy forces and propaganda . The Army’s Asymmetric Warfare Group , a unique special mission unit that includes operational, training, and research and analysis components, published its review of what it called “Russian New Generation Warfare” in December 2016. Public Intelligence, an online clearing house for restricted release, obscure, and otherwise notable government documents posted a copy of the document, which is marked unclassified, but “For Official Use Only,” online . “Certain things have been bred into today’s Soldier and dictate how we see the battlefield,” the handbook explains in its “purpose” section. “We own the night, the air, have qualitative numerical superiority, our technology is the best in the world, etc. The assumption that we will have these capabilities is inherent to every planning process the Army conducts.” Unfortunately, as the guide notes in its foreword, America’s potential enemies have not spent the past decade and a half or more idle. The Russian military in particular “barely resembles its former Soviet self” and in many ways has organized itself to match, or at least mitigate, the U.S. military’s often superior technological capabilities. A mockup of a Russian future infantryman shown at the Army 2017 expo., Vitaly Kuzmin “How do we protect our troops from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), communications and GPS jamming, and layered air defense networks?” the handbook asks rhetorically. As such, “Our focus at the operational and tactical levels should not be on the “newest kit,” but what we have to do in order to achieve success without it.” This view in many ways reflects the changing nature of the AWG itself, which came into being in 2006 specifically to help tackle the threat of improvised explosive devices and other insurgent weaponry in Iraq and Afghanistan. The unit has since evolved into a broader “red team” of sorts, studying enemy tactics and equipment and working to identify potential threats and capability gaps in the U.S. military. It’s no surprise that one of the first topics they’ve chosen to explore in depth is changes to the Russian military and how it operates. Since at least 2014, under the leadership of Russian President Vladmir Putin, the country has embarked on both a massive military modernization scheme and a revanchist foreign policy. Rearmament programs have focused in no small part on advanced weaponry , including new combat aircraft , warships , missiles , unmanned air and ground vehicles , and more. In parallel, there has been a push to form a core professional, volunteer force rather than rely primarily on conscript manpower. At the same time, Russia has notably seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region and continues to actively support separatists fighting the government in Kiev, to include deploying troops, intelligence personnel, and contractors alongside them. The Kremlin has sent a major military force to guarantee the continued existence of the regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad in Syria. Moscow is also looking to expand its sphere of influence, particularly in Africa . “Russian ground forces have updated their military doctrine to reflect these numerous changes in their organization, equipment, and tactics,” the AWG’s guide explains. “Their new doctrine views the military as part of a broader national whole of government approach to warfare.” At the center of this is the so-called “ Gerasimov Doctrine ,” named after the present Russian military Chief of the General Staff, General of the Army Valeri Gerasimov. At its most basic, this concept calls for less of a distinction in states of war and peace and the addition of nonmilitary activities, including propaganda and economic restrictions, to military campaigns. Some have referred to this as “hybrid warfare,” but the handbook calls it Russian New Generation Warfare (RNGW). General of the Army Valeri Gerasimov., Michael Klimentyev/Sputnik  via AP “The new objective is not victory in a conflict, but regime change ,” the AWG manual notes. “Because the new objective is the change of an entire system of government, the RNGW approach can use any lever of influence in their reach to achieve this change.” Though not stated explicitly, it would seem that these same tools of Russian regime change, as seen in Ukraine, have also been applicable to stabilizing friendly governments. In Syria, Russia has also employed a mix of conventional and special operations forces, along with providing direct support to private military contractors and local forces, including militias and terrorist groups . The AWG manual includes a low resolution scan of this chart showing Russian Private Military Companies., InformNapalm.org But even though the Gerasimov Doctrine might call for a blended military and nonmilitary approach to achieving foreign policy aims, the military component relies heavily on conventional weapons and equipment. The Russians have focused a significant amount of effort on developing and fielding systems that limit the ability of foreign powers, such as the United States, to intervene in response to the Kremlin’s actions. “U.S. forces have come to take air superiority for granted,” the manual notes. “Because of this, Russia has gone to great lengths to develop air defense capabilities on strategic, operational, and tactical levels to deny American’s the use of this capability.” Russia’s integrated air defense systems, including a wide array of anti-aircraft systems , surface-to-air missiles , and long-range radars, have come to represent a real challenge to American air power both along the country’s borders, such as in and around the Baltic and Black Seas , and around the world. Knowing this, the Russian military has worked to keep as much of this equipment mobile and rapidly deployable, able to move out with task forces as small as a reinforced infantry or armor company. A low resolution chart from the manual showing the integrated nature of Russia’s air defense arsenal., US Army The ability to rapidly challenge enemy air power was a hallmark of the initial phases of the separatist campaign in Eastern Ukraine, including the infamous shoot down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 by a BUK surface-to-air missile system in July 2014. Smaller man-portable systems claimed a number of Ukrainian combat aircraft and helicopters. We have since seen similar developments in Syria, where Russia has linked its own integrated air defense arrangement in that country with that of the Syrian government, giving the shared network even more coverage. Though it is unclear how much this has impacted the operations of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, it would have to be an important planning consideration for both air strikes and ground missions that rely on them. Long range rocket artillery , tactical ballistic missiles , and land- and sea-launched cruise missiles , serve much the same purpose, providing Russian forces at home and abroad with an important stand-off capability. The AWG’s research suggests that Russian forces see these systems as the “finishing arm” for a final victory in any engagement, rather than just supporting weapons for other infantry or armored forces. Notably absent from these sections, though, is any talk about Russia’s possible changing attitudes toward nuclear weapons on the battlefield. “The employment of UAS [unmanned aircraft systems; drones] by Russian Forces adds another dimension to their fires capability,” the handbook adds. “Russian Forces lagged behind the U.S. with UAS development and employment, however since the 2008 Georgian campaign have made it a priority. Their efforts have paid off, and Russia’s use of UAS has proven to be a game changer in Eastern Ukraine.” The ability of these drones to spot targets and help artillery units adjust their fire has been especially important given that the Russians lack the kind of precision guided rockets and shells that a pervasive in the U.S. military. According to the AWG, the entire process from getting information from the pilotless surveillance aircraft to adjusting the point of aim and firing another volley can be just 10 to 15 minutes. So far, the Russian military does not have armed drones, similar to the U.S. Air Force’s MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper of the U.S. Army’s MQ-1C Gray Eagle, but the AWG’s guide notes that some of their systems do carry electronic warfare and signals intelligence payloads. Observers have seen Russian proxies employing modified commercial quad- and hex-copter style drones , similar to those that ISIS terrorists have used in Iraq and Syria . It seems only a matter of time and resources before Russia fields a larger, purpose built unmanned combat aircraft, though. US Army The aforementioned electronic warfare capability has the potential to be just as devastating as a direct attack. Knowing that most modern militaries rely heavily on communications and electronic navigation capabilities , Russia has invested a significant amount on systems to neutralize those advantages. “The Russians layer these systems to shut down FM, SATCOM [satellite communications], cellular, GPS, and other signals,” the handbook explains. “In Eastern Ukraine, these EW [electronic warfare] systems have proved devastating to Ukrainian radio communications, are capable of jamming unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and can broadcast false GPS signals (an effect called spoofing ).” On top of that, many electronic warfare systems have the ability to spot and locate enemy signals as part of the jamming process, or even break into unencrypted video feeds . So, in some cases, the Russians have paired these units with artillery elements to offer yet another means of spotting high priority targets. The 1L265 electronic intelligence system., Vitaly Kuzmin “Certain platforms are used for protection , emitting … [a] signal designed to overload electronic fuses on incoming fires,” the guide adds. “Guided munitions, both direct and indirect, will either detonate early or change course once they come in contact with one of these … bubbles.” The Russian military’s focus on electronic warfare has bled over into cyber warfare, as well. Shutting down computer networks could easily give important advantages during a conflict, blind an opponent to up-coming attack, or simply serve to destabilize a hostile country. “Cyber-attacks can effectively shape the battlefield and require very little risk on the part of the perpetrator,” the AWG’s manual notes. “Since U.S. formations operate under self-imposed restrictions, like ethical hacking and prioritizing protective measures over offensives in the cyber realm, they are limited in their capabilities compared to Russian counterparts.” Gerasimov’s hybrid warfighting concept means that there is significant evidence that the Russian government actively cooperates with hackers or collectives , or even creates fictitious ones in order to give plausibly deniability to various activities. As we have seen in investigations into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which Putin has claimed might have been the work of “patriotic” Russians, it can be extremely difficult to separate one from the other. Russian President Vladimir Putin., Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik via AP “The Kremlin cooperates with criminal hacker groups and the Russian government employs thousands of professional hackers as part of their whole of government Information Operations strategy,” the handbook points out. “This severely outnumbers U.S. military cyber capabilities and means that U.S. brigades could be subjected to cyber-attacks from pro-Russian sympathizers in countries not even involved in a conflict.” The potential impact of information operations campaigns, both combined with and separate from active military campaigns, cannot be overstated and is something the U.S. military has also become increasingly aware of. Russian capabilities in this area are particularly advanced, combining traditional battlefield propaganda with new media tools and the internet. “Electronic warfare devices allow Russian Forces to broadcast … messages directly against opposing Ukrainian forces as discussed earlier with cellular text messages,” according to the AWG’s guide. “These can be very specific and directed at individuals, such as by threatening their wives and children by name, or generic and sent to entire units as was the case in Ukraine.” Control of information has also allowed Russia to shape the discourse about controversial conflicts in international forums and shield its own populace from the true costs of war. NATO in particular has become increasingly interested in tools to challenge these narratives and provide alternative sources of information , including via the internet. A Russian soldier directs an S-400 surface-to-air missile launcher into position in Crimea in January 2017., Sergey Malgavko/Sputnik via AP Despite the obvious threats to present and future U.S. military operations highlighted in the manual, the AWG’s handbook says its observations are just that and not to be taken as an indication of any official changes in U.S. military doctrine. Still, the unit’s analysts do offer some ideas about how to mitigate these emerging challenges. The biggest recommendation in the guide is for American training regimens to focus more on alternatives to electronic systems, including land navigation in GPS-denied environments , continuing operations as smoothly as possible during communications blackouts, operating without constant on-call air support, and recognizing, avoiding, and eliminating small surveillance drones . In addition, troops need to be aware of danger of targeted electronic warfare, cyber attacks, and information operations based on their online activities and social media usage. “The newest cadre of Soldiers, known as the first generation of truly ‘digital natives,’ is often culturally resistant to regulations imposed on their online social interactions,” the AWG manual reminds the reader. However, “a simple, innocuous-seeming post on Twitter or Facebook can now give away location, movement, and military capabilities in the stroke of a key.” Social media posts and other publicly available information are definitely gold mines of potential information. The U.S. government and independent observers have mined social media and other online pictures and information to prove the presence of regular Russian troops in Ukraine, locate the sites of missile launches and massacres , and even target the enemy . Of course, the AWG’s guide highlights the flagging Russian economy and the country’s limited resources, something we at The War Zone routinely bring up when talking about the Kremlin’s many military modernization goals . As such, many of its most advanced systems exist in far fewer numbers than Russia may like to admit or may never enter service at all. Still, the Gerasimov Doctrine exists in no small as a result of this reality and specifically offers tools to make up for relatively small numbers of certain forces and systems within the formal Russian military. Most of the emerging threats the handbook on Russia’s new form of warfare describes could easily apply to other possibly opponents, most specifically China , making the information and recommendations broadly applicable, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6_uK7S2sock Even if the threats are limited, it is no reason to not plan to defeat them. There’s no indication that the Russians, or other near-peer countries, are slowing their developments in both military hardware and new operational concepts, either. Russia in particular has been able to use both Ukraine and Syria as incubators to see what works and what doesn’t . “As the saying goes, ‘Only fools learn from their mistakes,” the handbook’s authors write in the foreword. “The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Around The Globe Cyber Warfare Drones Electronic Warfare/Countermeasures Europe News & Features Russia Unmanned"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2019",Trump’s Tweet About Old Iranian Missile Footage Isn’t A Good Sign,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. officials have reportedly told Fox News that the footage Iran showed of its new Khorramshahr ballistic missile was not from a new test, appearing to confirm The War Zoneâ€™s own original report. This underscores both a significant misreading of media reports from Iran itself by Western media, as well as the worrying suggestion the U.S. President Donald Trump relies more on those outlets than on information from his own intelligence agencies. On Sept. 22, 2017, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Iranâ€™s quasi-state operated media monopoly , released footage of a test of the new Khorramshahr just hours after the country publicly displayed the medium range ballistic missile for the first time as part of Sacred Defense Week. Various western media outlets reported that the video was of a new missile test, mostly citing a separate report from PressTV, one of the IRIB affiliates. On Sept. 25, 2017, Fox News reported that the release was â€œ fake â€ and not of a new or successful launch, citing a number of anonymous U.S. government sources. Instead, it showed a test of the missile the Iranians had more than seven months earlier. In January 2017, Iran had reportedly fired another Khorramshahr, but the missile exploded shortly after launch. Whether or not the footage displayed during Sacred Defense Week was of this failed launch or a separate earlier launch remained unclear. However, a closer reading of the original English-language PressTV report at the time, as well as their post promoting the piece on Twitter, never said that the footage is new, though they did say the launch had been a success. The outlet said the missile itself was new, which it was in a broad sense since Iran had never shown it publicly before, but never offered any details about where or when the test in the video occurred. https://youtube.com/watch?v=g1-pzkLjeE0 â€œIran has released footage of the successful test-launch of its new ballistic missile, Khorramshahr, a few hours after it was unveiled during a military parade in the capital city of Tehran,â€ the lede sentence in PressTVâ€™s Sept. 22, 2017 story said. â€œVideo footage aired by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) on Friday showed the missile launched from an unknown location.â€ The associated Tweet uses similar language. â€œVideo: #Iran successfully test-fires new ballistic missile,â€ it reads without saying that the launch itself was new. Video: #Iran successfully test-fires new ballistic missile Details: https://t.co/eKHi0jXnED pic.twitter.com/30XkB8ddbP — Press TV ğŸ”» (@PressTV) September 23, 2017 At The War Zone, we debated how to cover this important detail, settling on adding a note at the bottom of our piece and caveats throughout that there was no actual indication from the Iranian news reporting that the footage reflected a recent launch, though it did appear to us to have been successful. It seemed to me at the time that if there had been a new launch that Iran would have touted this achievement as they are inclined to do and would not have used such ambiguous language. It is entirely possible that they wrote it in this unclear way specifically to prompt sensational reporting elsewhere. The misreporting is one thing, it happens to everyone and appears to have been an easy and honest mistake. But what is significantly more worrisome is that it appears President Trump saw those initial reports, took them at face value, and rushed to make a public statement without first consulting with the U.S. Intelligence Community. On Sept. 23, 2017, Trump Tweeted out that â€œIran just test-fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching Israel,â€ likely referencing a news report given that the Iranians had aired the footage the day before. Â The President also slammed the Iran Deal, which he has criticized on numerous occasions , including at his first speech before the United Nations General Assembly earlier in the week, in the same post. Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 If Fox Newsâ€™ newest report is to be believed, and we have no reason to think otherwise given the wording of the original Iranian story, it would mean that neither the U.S. Intelligence Community nor the military could communicate this to Trump at the time or they could not make sure he absorbed this information. Furthermore, it’s no secret that both American intelligence agencies and the U.S. Strategic Command keep an eye out for ballistic missile launches, if for no other reason than to protect the United States and its interests abroad, and the U.S. government routinely releases statements after any such tests that it deems to be provocative.Â North Korea and Iran especially are subject to heavy surveillance given the U.S. government’s criticisms of the governments in those countries and their policies. It’s hard to believe that if the Iranians had launched a missile, that it would have gone unnoticed. Also it seems odd that the President would be comfortable enough with vague reports from the press before opining on those reports instead of getting the best information from national security team. Wouldn’t he just ask his aids what’s the deal with the launch? Whether or not Trump himself is to blame for the oversight, his Tweet is concerning in light of previous reports about the difficulty intelligence agencies have in making sure the president digests important updates in a timely manner. Making critical statements without having all the facts only serves to undermine the president’s credibility and that of his administration, as well as possibly limiting policy options in the future.Â In addition, given that the Trump Administration is reportedly actively considering either scrapping or attempting to renegotiate the Iran Deal, in no small part over Iranâ€™s continued ballistic missile developments, it would seem especially important for the president to not miss details about the state of its advanced weapons programs. The importance of the topic behooves media outlets to make sure their reporting is as accurate as possible, as well. Trump has not brought the issue up again since his Tweet, so it is very possible that he has gotten the correct information now. We definitely hope this is the case.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",How the Kurdish Independence Referendum Could Spark a Civil War or Worse,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iraqâ€™s semi-autonomous Kurdish region has finished voting on a controversial referendum that could potentially lead to a new independent country. It is a goal that Kurds around the world have long pushed for, but it potentially touch off a broader conflict involving Iran, Turkey , and Syria , as well as test loyalties and allegiances between the Kurds and dozens of nations and ethnic groups throughout the Middle East and beyond. On June 7, 2017, President Masoud Barzani, the present head of the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), met with various parties and formally announced the date for the non-binding poll as Sept. 25, 2017. Barzani, who has been president of the KRG since 2005, had initially called for the vote in 2014, following the meteoric rise of ISIS in Iraq following the spectacular collapse of the Iraqâ€™s national army in the face of the terrorist group, but delayed it due to apparent international pressure. With ISIS in retreat and the situation stabilizing, it has been harder to argue for further delays. Nothing is simple in Iraqi KurdistanÂ â€œWhen the referendum is held and the people made their decision, what alternative and decision can disregard the decision of those people?â€ Barzani posed as a rhetorical question during a press conference ahead of the referendum on Sept. 24, 2017. â€œNo, there is no alternative. The only exception is if they make the road shorter, they come two days from now and say that â€˜you don’t need two years. Letâ€™s reach an agreement within two months, and become good neighbors.â€™ This will be much better. But there is nothing they can offer to bring us back to failed partnership [with Iraq].â€ But the surety of Barzani and his Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) is unfortunately not necessarily reflective of the actual situation. Underscoring the very real complexities of the political landscape in Iraqi Kurdistan, Barzaniâ€™s meeting in June 2017 included representatives, from his KDP, the main opposition Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party, two Kurdish Islamist parties, three Kurdish Communist parties, three ethnic Turkmen parties, a single ethnic Armenian party, and two Assyrian Christian parties. A vendor in Erbil sells KRG flags along with KDP banners, including some showing President Massoud Barzani., Sputnik  via AP Whether or not the KDP even truly represents the interests of all Kurds in Iraq is a serious question, as its leadership is largely members of the Barzani tribe and its allies. This has led to serious and sometimes violent political confrontations with the PUK and other groups. All of this exists in an area with just approximately 5.3 million people, roughly a quarter of the population of the state of New York. In the rest of Iraq, the opinions are more clear cut. Iraqâ€™s central government had effectively rejected the results of the referendum before the voting even began. Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi has taken a largely inflexible position to the territorial integrity of his country and made it clear that he plans to use his full power, including the use of force, to keep the KRG for splitting away.Â Iraqis and Kurds prepare for a fightÂ On Sept. 24, 2017, Abadiâ€™s office released a statement called on all foreign governments to deal exclusively with authorities in Baghdad over oil and other trade issues, clearly hoping to cut off the KRGâ€™s financial lifelines. Oil fields in Iraqi Kurdistan generate approximately 650,000 barrels of crude oil a day, according to Reuters. On Sept. 25, 2017, the Iraqi parliament adopted a resolution demanding that Abadi order the Iraqi military into Iraqi Kurdistan to prevent any attempts by the Kurds to break away. The Iraqi president subsequently authorized the deployments. In particularly, Iraqâ€™s central authorities dispute the KRGâ€™s control over the Kirkuk governorate and its immense oil resources, as well as parts of the Nineveh, Diyala, and Salaheddin governorates. At the same time, observers have seen Shia militia rushing into the area and there are reports of Turkmen armed groups massing for a possible confrontation. There are reports suggesting that non-Kurdish ethic groups had largely boycotted the polls in protest of the referendum. Adding to the concerns, Najmiddin Karim, a member of the PUK and governor of Kirkuk, reportedly said that Kurds should refrain from any celebratory gunfire and save their ammunition for when it was necessary to defend the city. There is a very real potential for skirmishes and possibly even an outright civil conflict. It would not be the first time the Kurds have come to blows with other ethnic groups, especially over control of Kirkuk. After ISIS surged into Iraq in 2014, Turkmen and Shia Arab militias formed increasingly strong bonds to try and keep Kurdish aspirations in check, reflecting a new chapter in the already complicated history between Iraqi Kurds and the rest the country. Since World War I, many Kurds, a majority-Sunni Muslim non-Arab ethnic group, have increasingly agitated for greater autonomy within or outright independence from the countries they reside in, with some arguing for the creation of a Kurdistan state that would span all the regions they occupy. In some cases, this has taken the form of armed resistance. Majority groups have generally met these aspirations with violent resistance of their own. During the 1980s, the struggle in Iraq became particularly infamous when then dictator Saddam Hussein decided to launch a genocidal campaign in the countryâ€™s northern Kurdish region near the tail-end of the Iran-Iraq War and immediately afterwards. With support from Iran, Kurdish rebel groups had seized on the chaos of the conflict to make a renewed push for autonomy. A morgue worker looks over coffins holding remains from a mass grave Iraqi officials discovered in 2008 that likely contained remains of Kurds who died at the hands of Saddam Hussein’s regime. , AP Photo/Alaa al-Marjani Between 1986 and 1989, Iraqi troops and militias killed between 50,000 and 180,000 Kurds, including innocent civilians. The so-called Al Anfal campaign saw the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons, most notably during the massacre in the city of Halabja in 1988. After the first Gulf War, the United States and its allies shielded Iraqi Kurdistan from Saddamâ€™s government with a no-fly zone , leading to a growing sense of de facto independence, with the Kurds there establishing the KRG in 1992. After the U.S.-backed invasion that overthrew the Iraqi dictatorship in 2003, the regional authorityâ€™s power and influence continued to grow. Iraqi Kurdish has since developed a reputation for relative safety and stability compared to the rest of Iraq, along with a more cosmopolitan atmosphere less subject to the sectarian skirmishes of groups in the rest of the country. In particular, modern leisure attractions, including amusement parks and ski resorts have come to symbolize this development. Outside observers generally view its largely independent security forces, the Peshmerga , as competent and professional. The Kurdish forces were the first to reliably stand up to ISIS and the United States quickly rushed to send arms and equipment, as well as advisers, to bolster their defenses . On top of that, the U.S. government actively helped solicit, deliver, or facilitate the delivery of supplies from other allies . In the subsequent U.S.-led campaign against the terrorists, the KRG capital Erbil has also become an important hub for American and coalition operations, including the activities of the secretive task force from the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) hunting the groupâ€™s leadership. The airport there has hosted a variety of specialized American aircraft, including a pair of modified OV-10G+ Bronco light attack planes, and has been a key emergency landing site for coalition tactical aircraft operating over Iraq.Â “From now on, we won’t hide that that’s [independence] our goal,â€ Barzani said in July 2014 , as ISIS ravaged the Iraqi countryside, contesting the key KRG city of Kirkuk and looking like it could threaten more of the region. â€œIraq is effectively partitioned now. Are we supposed to stay in this tragic situation the country’s living?â€ A coalition adviser trains Peshmerga troops in January 2017., US Army A potential for regional conflictÂ However, the Kurds in Iraq are just one part of a larger community that exists as a significant ethnic minority in that country, as well as Iran, Syria, and Turkey. There is also a significant Kurdish diaspora elsewhere in the world, particularly in Germany. As such, there could be far wider reaching impacts of the referendum, whatever the actual results, many of which could lead to deadly fighting. Turkey, which has spent decades fighting a domestic Kurdish insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, better known by its Kurdish acronym PKK, is particularly concerned by the vote. Though the Turkish government has developed strong ties with the KRG, it sees an independent Iraqi Kurdistan as lending credibility to the notion of a similarly separate Turkish Kurdistan. Protesters in Beirut, Lebanon call for Turkish authorities to release Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the PKK seen on the banner, on Sept. 24, 2017., AP Photo/Bilal Hussein â€œOur military is not there [at the border] for nothing,â€ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sept. 25, 2017, referring to ongoing military exercises near the Turkey-Iraq frontier. â€œWe could arrive suddenly one night.â€ It’s not a hollow threat. In 2008, Turkish forces moved into Iraq ostensibly to attack PKK positions. Since 2014, Turkey has conducted a number of punitive operations and strikes against the group and other Kurdish forces it says are aligned with them in both Iraq and Syria. Turkish tanks and armored vehicles on drills near the Habur border gate on Sept. 25, 2017., DHA-Depo Photos via AP In his latest remarks, Erdogan also threatened to shut down an oil pipeline that runs into his country from the KRG and shut down a major border crossing. Though the Turkish president said that preventing the creation of an independent Iraqi Kurdistan was a â€œmatter of survival,â€ the countryâ€™s authorities denied they had preemptively stopped traffic at the Habur gate. This economic blockade could easily become a regional affair, akin to what has happened to Qatar . Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has echoed Turkish and Iraqi sentiments, no doubt worried about the stability of his own countryâ€™s Kurdish region in the event that the KRG declares independence. Turkeyâ€™s Foreign Ministry said it had met with its counterparts in both Iraq and Iran to coordinate a unified response to the referendum. There are reports that its could include cutting internet and other media services within Iraqi Kurdistan. Strained loyaltiesÂ KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, nephew to the KRG president, tried to downplayed these concerns saying that even if Iraqi Kurdistan voted for independence, the process would not be immediate. He also dismissed the suggestion that the referendum would have any bearing on the Kurdish regions in other countries. However, the KRG faces an increasingly diverse coalition, though. In addition to Iran, Iraq, and Turkey forming a unified front, the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad similarly rejected the polls as invalid. Syria’s Russian allies have also come out strongly in favor of a unified Iraq . Israel, which initially appeared to offer its support for Kurdish self-determination, has since adopted a reported policy of not commenting on the polls. All of this puts the U.S.-led coalition fighting the terrorists, and the United States in particular, in an uncomfortable political position. In addition to actively supporting the Peshmerga and the KRG as part of the campaign, to the ire of both Syrian and Turkish authorities , the United States and other coalition partners have been arming Kurdish groups in Syria and working with them directly. A Syrian Kurdish fighter looks out over the city of Kobani in 2015., AP And while many see the U.S. government as a stable and long-standing supporter of the Kurds and their ultimate aspirations of greater autonomy or independence, the KRG doesn’t necessarily see this as the case. They see a history of broken promises and betrayals , including turning a blind eye to Saddam’s atrocities in the 1980s and a refusal to support a push for independence after fighting alongside the Peshmerga to liberate Iraqi Kurdistan in 2003. In the 1960s, the U.S. military secretly supported the Shah of Iran to suppress a Kurdish rebellion, as well, according to an official U.S. Air Force history . The U.S. government’s refusal to support the referendum probably hasn’t help change the views of Iraqi Kurds who see it as an ultimately unreliable partner or make them any more inclined to respond to American political pressure. On Sept. 14, 2017, Heather Nauert made it clear that the United States wouldn’t support the present poll, saying it “takes the eye off the ball of ISIS.” On Sept. 21, 2017, U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the top spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition similarly referred to the referendum as a â€œ distraction â€ from what he suggested should be the main goal of all parties, defeating the terrorists. Â On Sept. 25, 2017, Boris Johnson, the United Kingdomâ€™s Secretary of State, took to Twitter to espouse a similar view. â€œI urge all parties to remain calm & work together to defeat Daesh,â€ he Tweeted, using another name for ISIS. â€œIraqâ€™s future lies in dialogue. UK ready to help.â€ So, its not surprising that there are already signs that some Kurdish groups in Syria have come to doubt the U.S.-led coalition’s long term plans in the region and are beginning to consider the shelter of the Assad regime. In August 2017, the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, struck a deal with Russian forces to provide a buffer between then and Turkish troops in and around the northwestern city of Afrin. These could lead to Kurdish groups taking differing sides on the issue, something that has happened before with Barzani himself allying with Saddam for a time, further complicating the situation, and making it more difficult to avoid potential conflicts. With the vote already done, it seems even more unlikely that the United States and other western powers will be able to stop the push and any potential backlash. If the referendum does pass, the United States could then find itself compelled to take a position on Kurdish self-determination and the future of the region, whether it wants to or not, even if only tacitly. Facing a unified front from Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Russia, with even Israel staying silent, the U.S. government may feel it has little option but to turn on the Kurds once again or risk getting embroiled in a major conflict it has no desire to be a part of, at least according to the past statements from the State Department and the Pentagon. Iraqi Shia militiamen train near Baghdad., AP Without American support, there’s a real question about whether the KRG could reasonably hope to survive the economic or military pressure from the forces already converging on it. In addition, not supporting the Kurds, might embolden the United States’ opponents and give the appearance that the U.S. government is unwilling to challenge Russian and Iranian hegemony in Iraq, which would be politically problematic at home . Â It is possible that Iraqi Kurdish officials could follow Nechirvan Barzani’s statements and say that the referendum doesn’t automatically mean there will be a declaration of independence, but only that there is a desire for statehood at some indeterminate point in the future. This could give both the Kurds and their U.S. allies space to smooth over the obvious tensions. The United states has similar downplayed the situation over Qatar as it tries to work to end that crisis . Still, with so many actors and agendas at play, it may be hard to prevent the referendum’s outcome, whatever it is, from sparking a broader and potentially violent crisis throughout the region.Â Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 15, 2019",Iran’s New Ballistic Missile Looks a Lot Like a Modified North Korean One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Shortly after revealing the new Khorramshahr medium range ballistic missile to the public for the first time, Iran released a never before seen video showing a successful test of the weapon, but did not give a date or place for the footage. The new development will undoubtedly have an impact on whether U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration decide to scrap a deal with Iran over its controversial nuclear program, but it also underscores long-standing concerns that the Iranian authorities have been working with the North Koreans and other allies to skirt their international obligations. Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), a military-political organization that commands immense influence on the country’s domestic and foreign policy, unveiled the Khorramshahr during a military parade on Sept. 22, 2017 as part of the country’s annual Sacred Defense Week . The events commemorate the country’s bloody war with Iraq between 1980 and 1988. The city of Khorramshahr features heavily in Iran’s historical accounting of that conflict, as it was the site of the war’s first battle and remained under Iraqi control until 1982. The liberation marked a turning point in Iran’s favor and the new missile’s moniker is almost certainly a symbolic reference. Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a senior commander from the IRGC’s Aerospace Division told reporters that the missile had a range of approximately 1,250 miles and could carry multiple warheads, suggesting it had a so-called multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) configuration and could strike more than one target at a time. “As it was observed, the missile has become smaller in size and more tactical and it will be operational in the near future,” he added. https://youtube.com/watch?v=g1-pzkLjeE0 The missile on parade had a single, solid nose cone, making it impossible to verify the multiple warhead claims. The video footage did not show any evidence of this feature, either. If the range figure is accurate, Khorramshahr could carry a warhead or warheads anywhere in the Middle East, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as hit targets in parts of Eastern Europe, East Africa, and Central Asia. “We will promote our defensive and military power as much as we deem necessary,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech before the procession. “We seek no one’s permission to defend our land.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, second from right, speaks ahead of the start of the 2017 Sacred Defense Week military parade., AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi Rouhani’s remarks and the display of the missile itself, seem to be a response, at least in part, to fiery rhetoric from President Trump, who criticized Iran’s government during his first ever speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly and has slammed the deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program. The Trump administration says that Iranian ballistic missile development and tests go against the spirit of that agreement. “We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,” Trump said in front of other world leaders and international diplomats at the United Nations on Sept. 19, 2017. “The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.  Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it – believe me.” President Donald Trump speaks at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19, 2017., AP The Iran Deal , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), does not technically cover ballistic missiles. United Nations Security Council resolutions, though, do prohibit Iran from developing such weapons, but only insofar as they can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Needless to say, the demonstration of the Khorramshahr has added a certain weight to calls in the United States to pull out of or otherwise reconsider the future of the JCPOA. Critics of pulling out of the arrangement say that it could only hasten Iran’s development of both newer and more advanced ballistic missiles, as well as a nuclear weapon. However, Khorramshahr may prompt additional concerns that Iran may already be working along both of these lines with help from North Korea and other allies. Observers were quick to point out that the missile shares a number of similarities, especially in its apparent engine configuration, with the North Korean BM-25 Musudan , also known as the Hwasong-10. Iran claims that the new missile is an entirely domestic effort, but it makes similar statements about almost every weapon system it unveils, even those that are clearly derived from foreign designs. Its existing Shahab-3 medium range ballistic missiles are a known derivative of North Korea’s earlier Hwasong-7. https://youtube.com/watch?v=F9d1BDeA5-I In July 2016, Fox News reported that Iran had unsuccessfully tested a Musudan , citing a number of unnamed sources. This came one month after the North Korea’s first successful launch of the type. Then, in January 2017, Fox News said that more anonymous sources had told them the Iranians had test fired a new, then unknown missile, with the name Khorramshahr. It reportedly flew approximately 600 miles with an unknown apogee before exploding. According to Reuters , a U.S. military official said this was the same type Iran had tested in July 2016. It is very possible that the video shown during the opening of Sacred Defense Week 2017 was from this test. Separately, in July 2017, Iran formally opened the Imam Khomeini Space Center near Semnan with the launch of a Simorgh space launch vehicle , which the United States and other critics say is simply a cover for work on an intercontinental ballistic missile. This launch occurred the same a month as North Korea’s first demonstration of the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile. Iran’s Simorgh space launch vehicle at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in July 2017., Iranian Defense Ministry via AP We cannot say conclusively that Iran and North Korea are actively working together on ballistic missile developments, but the timelines and past precedents heavily point to continued cooperation on advanced weapons. Though the Khorramshahr is liquid fueled, it is possible that this engagement could lead to improved solid fuel designs, which troops can set up and fire faster, similar to North Korea’s Pukguksong series . “Iranian solid-propellant programs are also progressing,” the 2017 NASIC report noted. Iran already has a solid fuel weapon with the same estimated range as the Khorramshahr, the Sejjil . We also know, thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request, that STRATCOM’s J321 Industrial Systems Analyst had been looking into someone’s solid fuel rocket motor development between July and December 2016. The briefing slide in question is so heavily redacted that it’s difficult to make out the exact objectives or targets of the analysis, but does mention earlier studies done on behalf of U.S. Pacific Command. STRATCOM via FOIA The added fear, of course, would be that if the two are working on missiles, then they could just as easily be sharing information on nuclear weapons . There has long been a concern that Iran could easily afford to halt its domestic nuclear program because it had either already completed all the necessary research or could continue it elsewhere away from the prying eyes of international inspectors. The appearance of ballistic missile-related facilities in Syria that look similar to those Iran adds weight to the possibility that the government in Tehran has reached out to allies to help shield various advanced weapons programs for scrutiny, to support parallel developments in those countries, or both. Iran has been very open about proliferating various artillery rocket and short-range ballistic missile technology, such as the Zulfiqar missiles it fired at ISIS terrorists in June 2017, both to states like Syria and non-state actors like the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah . “Taking a definitive stand against Trump is only the beginning of the path,” General Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the IRGC, said after hearing Trump’s comments, according to the organization’s official Sepah News outlet . “What is strategically important is that America witnesses more painful responses in the actions, behavior and decisions that Iran takes in the coming months.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=HOOy6npQlp8 Since Iran insists it is not building any nuclear weapons, it says its ballistic missile work does not fall under the terms of these resolutions. The United States has challenged this interpretation , saying that there is limited utility in long-range ballistic missiles with conventional payloads and that it makes little sense to spend the time and energy on their development without nuclear warheads. “The facts are that Iran is operating under the agreements the we signed up for under the JCPOA,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten , head of U.S. Strategic Command, said during a talk at the Hudson Institute event. “But at the same time they are rapidly, rapidly deploying and developing a whole series of ballistic missiles and testing ballistic missiles at all ranges that provide significant concerns to not just the United States, but our allies.” According to an unclassified 2017 report from the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), of the countries presently the United States know are working on new medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles, only Iran has not tested a nuclear device. “Iran has ambitious ballistic missile and space launch development programs and continues to attempt to increase the lethality of its ballistic missile force,” the analysts added. A display of IRGC missiles, including a Sejjil at left, during Sacred Defense Week in 2011., AP Photo/Vahid Salemi These concerns are hardly new, of course. Since Iran Deal came into effect in 2015, there have been more than 10 reported Iranian missile tests. “The United States is deeply concerned about Iran’s recent ballistic missile launches, which are provocative and destabilizing,” then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in March 2016 after a series of launches. “We condemn such threats against another U.N. member state and one of our closest allies,” she added in response to Iranian remarks that the tests were meant as a clear warning to Israel. Still, the appearance of the Khorramshahr is likely to unsettle Iran’s regional opponents, including Israel and Saudi Arabia , which are both already in the process of expanding their ballistic missile defenses. On Sept. 18, 2017, the U.S. military announced it would set up its first ever formal base in Israel , which appeared to be an expansion of existing missile defense cooperation . Israel is also increasingly worried about Hezbollah’s capabilities as the group receives more Iranian and Syrian support to continue operations against rebels fighting the government of dictator Bashar Al Assad in Syria. On Sept. 22, 2017, Israeli aircraft attacked a site the group controlled near the airport in Damascus, the latest intervention in that country by the Israeli Air Force . Earlier in September 2017, Israel also struck the Syrian Scientific Studies and Researchers Center. Those most reporting focused on this organization’s work on Syria’s chemical weapons program, it is also linked to ballistic missile work. It seems very possible that we could see a flurry of ballistic missile developments in Iran and among its allies in the near future. It also will be interesting to see if new Iran announcements continue to come soon after similar displays in North Korea. Note: Many news outlets reported the launch shown in the video the Iranians released during Sacred Defense Week 2017 as new, but it remains unclear whether or not this was the case. In their English language reporting, Iranian media outlets did not frame this as a new test, suggesting that it could have been footage of the January 2017 launch. As of Sept. 23, 2017, neither the Pentagon nor the U.S. State Department had released a statement about any new launch, either. Regardless, it was a clear demonstration that the missile has flown successfully on at least one occasion. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Land MRBMs/IRBMs"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019",How We Got to North Korea’s Pacific Nuclear Test Threat and What Comes Next,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An ever escalating war of words between the United States and Kim Jong-un’s totalitarian regime in North Korea has reached an entirely new level since President Donald Trump threatened to “totally destroy” the Hermit Kingdom in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. It seems all but guaranteed that the rhetoric will lead to new North Korean provocations, but what’s unprecedented and potentially game-changing is that they could potentially include a full demonstration of a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, or at least an above-ground nuclear weapon test, either which in turn would similarly demand some form of American response . This latest escalation in tensions between the U.S. government and North Korean officials began on Sept. 19, 2017, when Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time with fiery remarks , lashing out at not only North Korea, but also Iran , Cuba , Venezuela , and other critics of American foreign policy more broadly. He vowed to put the United States interests first in all matters and encouraged the other assembled leaders to do the same. But he reserved some of the most incendiary comments for Kim, who he has now nicknamed “Rocket Man,” and his regime. “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” he declared. “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary.” This particular statement drew “ audible gasps ” from some of the world leaders in attendance, according to The Associated Press . The North Korean delegation had already walked out in protest before Trump even began speaking. AP Since then, the Trump Administration has defended the decision to make this threat in such a public forum. The same was true after the president’s now infamous “ fire and fury ” comments in August 2017. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders took to Twitter afterwards to claim the comments were not a departure from established foreign policy norms, citing a 2016 comment by President Barack Obama, where he acknowledged the U.S. military’s ability to destroy North Korea. She left out that Obama had added a caveat immediately after making this statement that the humanitarian costs would be enormous and that a massive attack could only put American ally South Korea at grave risk. “The president’s rhetoric as completely appropriate because what is even more dangerous is if there’s a lack of clarity,” National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told CNN on Sept. 21, 2017. “[Kim Jong-un] is someone who has compromised everything for his nation in the pursuit of these capabilities. He is disadvantaging his own people every day by investing in what is a suicide mission.” There had been some indication that the administration’s rhetoric would continue to trend toward more threats in the days leading up Trump’s U.N. speech, as well. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said she had “no problem kicking it to [Secretary of Defense] General Mattis” on North Korea during a press conference on Sept. 15, 2017. Trump’s “fire and fury” statement “was not an empty threat,” Haley told CNN on Sept. 17, 2017, before doubling down on her previous statements. “Where North Korea is being irresponsible and reckless, we were being responsible by trying to use every diplomatic possibility that we could possibly do. … I said yesterday, I’m perfectly happy kicking this over to General Mattis because he has plenty of military options.” The string of threats, especially Nikki Haley’s comments, suggest the United states and its allies could easily handle the increasingly worrisome situation with military force if it runs out of other options . This of course is entirely untrue and major conflict with North Korea would be devastating for all the involved parties. Not surprisingly, this has not prompted a change in the behavior of the North Korean regime or Premier Kim. As we at The War Zone have noted for months , these statements feed into the country’s existing paranoid and propaganda that the United States and its allies are actively looking to destroy it and forcefully eliminate its government. It has only appeared to give North Korea more of a reason to continue to develop advanced ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons to achieve some relative parity with the United States in order, if nothing else, to preserve the regime’s very existence. Kim said as much himself in a televised rebuttal on Sept. 21, 2017. “His [Trump’s] remarks which described the U.S. option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last,” the North Korean dictator stated. “We will consider with seriousness exercise of a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.” Trump continued the cycle on Sept. 22, 2017, as part of a series of Tweets on various topics. “Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn’t mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!” he posted on the social media site. If his remarks in front of the United Nations seemed likely to generate a North Korean response, the Tweet sounded closer to a direct challenge. Given Kim’s immediate response to Trump’s threat of total destruction, it seems he will have little room but to make a provocative move in response to this new “test.” After Kim’s own televised address, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho had already said the North Korean response could include detonating a hydrogen bomb in or over the Pacific Ocean. Earlier in September 2017, North Korea tested what experts believe to be a working thermonuclear device. The country has also tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-14 , twice, in addition to firing two more intermediate range Hwasong-12s sailing dangerously over Japan into the Pacific. Either of these missiles could potentially carry a nuclear weapon. If the North Koreans did go this route, it would be an unprecedented and risky provocation that would fundamentally change the calculus of the crisis. The Chinese conducted the last atmospheric nuclear weapons test in 1980, but at the relative safety of the remote Lop Nor test site, which is well within their borders. Neither China nor North Korea are signatories to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which bans signatories from setting off nuclear devices above ground, under water, or in space. China did sign, but not ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits any tests whatsoever, while North Korea did not sign that agreement. North Korea test fires a Hwasong-12 on Sept. 14, 2017., KCNA North Korea lacks the space for this sort of above ground testing within its territory and would have to send a fully operational missile flying over Japan to reach an open expanse in the Pacific. Not only would this limit the ability of North Korean engineers and scientists to observe and gain valuable data about the test, a failure of the missile at any point during this journey could be catastrophic. Another option would be to fire the missile from a ship or a submarine , or to simply detonate a device on a floating platform out in the Pacific Ocean. However, this would open the mission up to interdiction on the high seas by American or other foreign powers, who might be able to seize the device, stop the test, and gain valuable insight into the state of North Korea’s most advanced weapons. In the future, North Korea may simply need to conduct nuclear weapons tests outside of its own borders since the Punggye-ri underground test site may simply not be able to survive the strain of more powerful thermonuclear designs. The nuclear test earlier in September 2017 appeared to cause the tunnel containing the device to collapse , highlighting the limits of underground testing. Even if the atmospheric test went as intended, it could be difficult to be entirely sure there would be no inadvertent casualties and the resulting fallout could easily fall on civilian mariners or populated areas. The crew of a Japanese fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryū Maru , infamously suffered dangerous radiation exposure after the U.S. military’s Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. One of the sailors died. It could also be hard for the United States and its allies to necessarily tell that if any new missile launches ares test and not a first strike, too. The U.S. military has only ever conducted one of these so-called “end-to-end” nuclear tests demonstrating the full capabilities of a live ballistic missile for exactly this reason. In 1962, the U.S. Navy fired an armed Polaris submarine launched ballistic missile in a test nicknamed Frigate Bird, part of the larger Operation Dominic . Many experts have already dubbed the potential North Korean launch “Juche Bird,” a blend of the American nickname with Juche, the name North Korea’s core, military-first ideology. It could be a risk Kim is willing to accept in the face of what appear to be consistently growing threats from the Trump administration. It is also possible he could seek to first demonstrate the full range of the Hwasong-14, proving his regime has the ability to strike the U.S. mainland. North Korea’s last missile test, involving a Hwasong-12, confirmed the weapon has at least the range, if not necessarily the accuracy, to strike the U.S. Pacific Ocean territory of Guam, a threat Kim has made repeatedly . In addition, it is possible that North Korea could seek other avenues to respond Trump’s rhetoric, including increasing its smuggling and other illicit efforts or stepping up cooperation with other American opponents, chiefly Iran. There are already a number of likely connections between North Korean and Iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs and the regime in Pyongyang could see proliferating its advance military technology as a means to further challenge the U.S. government. This could add another dimension to separate threats from the Trump administration to end the deal with Iran over its existing controversial nuclear program, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ). Underscoring this potential issue, on Sept. 22, 2017, Iran publicly displayed its Khorramshahr medium range ballistic missile for the first time, showing a number of similarities to North Korea’s now well proven Musudan design . And despite Nikki Haley’s and H.R. McMaster’s insistence that there are available military options to respond to these growing provocations, as well as Trump’s vague threats, any direct action would be fraught with its own dangers. One of the most likely courses of action, shooting down the missile, carries significant risks as the impact of the interceptor could trigger the device or the radioactive debris could fall over populated areas. Perhaps more importantly to the viability of America’s still largely unproven ballistic missile defense shield, if the intercepting weapon misses or otherwise fails to achieve the desired effect, it would expose a serious vulnerability to not just North Korea, but the rest of the world. On top of that, the United States would need to make sure its defenses are positioned in such a way as to have a good chance at scoring a hit. In particular, systems that engage the missile as it comes falling back down to earth, such as the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) system, have a very narrow window to achieve a “kill.” Furthermore, this means that personnel manning the interceptors would likely be in the direct path the incoming weapon, and if it was fully armed, a nuclear test. There is very little room for failure in any of these scenarios. Even if the shoot down were to go smoothly, it is possible that it could trigger a larger and immensely destructive conflict on the Korean Peninsula or throughout East Asia. The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway has highlighted these various issues previously in a deep dive into the United States’ available options in responding to North Korea’s continued provocations. Though he continues to stress that diplomacy should be the first choice to de-escalating the tensions, Secretary of Defense Mattis has indicated that the U.S. military may have other weapons or systems to attack the Kim regime without putting South Korea or Japan at risk. “Yes, there are [military options], but I will not go into details,” Mattis told reporters on Sept. 19, 2017. “Yes, I don’t want to go into that,” he added when asked if these plans involved so-called “kinetic” action, usually a term for lethal force. It’s hard to see how a direct strike, no matter how limited, would not provoke a North Korean retaliation that would be devastating at least to South Korea. North Korea has made it clear in the past that it is willing to kill South Koreans if it feels provoked. Under the leadership of Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong Il, in March 2010, the reclusive regime sunk a South Korean patrol boat, the ROKS Cheonan , killing all the sailors on board. Eight months later, North Korean troops shelled the island of Yeonpyeong , killing two South Korean Marines and another two South Korean civilians, as well as wounding nearly 20 more people. Kim Jong-un watches the Hwasong-12 test on Sept. 14, 2017., KCNA It is possible that Mattis simply meant kinetic as in direct action, but was referring to the use of electronic warfare or cyber attacks to cripple the North Korean military’s communications and command and control infrastructure or knock out power to key ballistic missile and nuclear sites. The Untied States reportedly planned to unleash a broad cyber offensive against state-operated infrastructure in Iran if the JCPOA fell through. There could easily be a similar plan in place toward North Korea. All of these options still come with their own risks, though, and there’s still no indication that they would convince Kim to change course. If the North Korean regime’s primary goal is its own survival, it is perfectly rational for them to continue to demonstrate their resolve to respond in kind to American threats. And despite his comments, Trump’s first step, on Sept. 21, 2017, was to sign a new executive order penalizing any individual or business doing business with North Korea. This follows a trend of steady sanctions against actors and firms outside of North Korea that the United States accuses of enabling the reclusive country’s government. Trump and other members of his administration repeatedly question Kim’s mental stability, but as we at The War Zone have noted before , he clearly has a coherent plan. We’re still not sure that U.S. government has developed a thought-out strategy to dissuade him from his chosen path.

Ed Darack and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Chinooks Over Afghanistan: The Unsung Workhorse Of America’s Never Ending War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The CH-47 Chinook is not a particularly sleek or sexy looking helicopter and it’s been a ubiquitous feature of most American military operations since the Vietnam War. Its age and shape give the overall appearance of a slow and lumbering aircraft. Ed Darack, a writer and photographer who has embedded with American troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and is the author of the new book The Final Mission of Extortion 17 , says that reputation is entirely undeserved and that the type has been the unsung workhorse of the war in Afghanistan in particular. Not only is the Chinook still an extremely capable design after decades of service, it is actually the fastest helicopter in U.S. military service at present, owing in no small part to its uncommon tandem rotor configuration. Darack has been kind enough to share his own experiences with the CH-47, as well as those of the aviators, crew members, maintenance crews, and other personnel who have flown, rode in, or otherwise seen the “Hooks” in combat. The pictures he took and video he obtained offer even more insight into how valuable the helicopter has been to Americans warfighters. My introduction to the Chinook “Remember to put your head down when they start shooting at you!” a grinning Sergeant First Class Rick Scavetta said in late September 2005. Rick, the media chief for Combined Joint Task Force 76 (CJTF-76), had just dropped me off on the southern end of Afghanistan’s Bagram Airfield for the start of my first-ever combat embed. I lifted my photography gear and backpack out of his pickup truck and hiked across the concrete apron toward my journey’s next ride, a CH-47D Chinook helicopter. “Have a nice flight!” Rick yelled over the THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of spinning rotors and the screams of two turboshaft engines of the “bird” that idled just one hundred feet from his truck. A CH-47D Chinook makes a landing approach at a small airfield in Jalalabad, Afghanistan., Courtesy Ed Darack I momentarily lost my breath walking through the hot, pungent exhaust plume roiling out of the right-side engine before shuffling up the helicopter’s loading ramp. Dropping my gear at the aft end of the Chinook, call sign “Big Windy 21,” I sat down on the webbed bench seat as the aircraft’s flight engineer raised the ramp a couple feet off the ground with a stiff push of a handle. With word that I was seated, the pilot on the controls “pulled thrust” and the helicopter mildly vibrated side-to-side for a second and then a smiling Rick and his pickup grew small as the helicopter smoothly lifted into the sky. Ed shared the video below, showing CH-47Ds from Extortion Company taking off for a mission as seen through night vision goggles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=68ph6uYlj5k Ker-chunk! The flight engineer armed the M240 7.62mm machine gun on the ramp as the Chinook nosed down and accelerated toward the southeast. The two other crew members on board armed their M240s as well, one on each side behind the cockpit bulkhead. As we passed over the perimeter of the base, two U.S. Army AH-64 Apache gunship helicopters joined our single-Chinook flight as escorts. The Apaches carved broad S-shaped patterns in the sky above and behind us, the pilots of each constantly scanning for threats and ready to unleash rockets or high explosive 30mm rounds on any attackers below. The author., Courtesy Ed Darack Flying just a few hundred feet above ground level at around 190 miles per hour, the orderly mosaic of Bagram’s paved roads, stacks of shipping containers, and lines of aircraft shrank into the hazy distance. With the large base to our rear, I took in views far more representative of the character of landscapes throughout Afghanistan: raw to the brink of feral. We sped above sweeps of bare, wind-scoured desert, past swaths of labyrinthine badlands, and over knife-edged ridges and vertical rock walls. While we flew over a few tiny mud hut villages and some roughhewn agricultural patchworks during the 45 minute journey, I picked out only a few roads. They were all dirt, and most of these were just tracks barely scratched into the landscape. They looked passable only by dirt bikes, donkeys, or human footsteps—certainly not by any standard military vehicle. A flight engineer mans an M240 machine gun on the ramp of a CH-47D Chinook flying over Afghanistan., Courtesy Ed Darack A workhorse in Afghanistan The helicopter, I quickly understood during that first flight in Afghanistan, wasn’t a luxury for the war, but an absolute necessity. I would further learn in the subsequent days and weeks that the type of helicopter in which I rode, the Chinook, had repeatedly proven itself to be the premier aviation logistical workhorse for the war effort. I would also learn of the importance and roles played by people of the Chinook world—the pilots, maintainers, and crew members—who hailed from the active Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. Soldiers from all three worked side-by-side, day and night, on the ground and in the skies of Afghanistan, continuing the legacy of the storied aircraft in what has been perhaps the most difficult, most austere operating environment the modern U.S. military has faced. That first flight took me to Jalalabad Provincial Reconstruction Team base, or “J-Bad PRT,” a small outpost on the edge of the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. After shuffling out of the helicopter onto the base’s gravel landing zone, I spotted a UH-60 Black Hawk approaching from the east. A UH-60 Black Hawk flies behind a CH-47 Chinook during a training exercise in Colorado., US Army The Black Hawk’s passage above the airstrip highlighted, through contrast, the key distinguishing characteristic of the CH-47: its rotor configuration. The Black Hawk is a “tail rotor” helicopter, relying on a tail rotor to counteract the torque effect of the main rotor system—and through “anti-torque” foot pedal control inputs, yaw the aircraft clockwise and counterclockwise. By far the most common form of rotary-wing aircraft throughout the world, the tail-rotor helicopter suffers a fundamental disadvantage: that tail rotor draws upwards of 15 percent of available power that would otherwise be used for thrust simply to keep the helicopter from spinning wildly out of control. The Chinook, on the other hand, uses a torque-cancelling configuration of two counter-rotating rotor systems, one three-bladed assembly at the front of the helicopter’s fuselage, and one at the rear. With this design, virtually 100% of available horsepower its two turboshaft engines produce is applied to thrust—a small amount is lost due to internal friction of the gears in the combiner box and transmissions. All of this thrust allows the Chinook to carry upwards of 50 troops and their gear in its spacious fuselage. The helicopter can also haul tens of thousands of pounds of cargo, loaded internally or slung beneath it. The ability for CH-47s to externally sling heavy military implements like howitzers quickly became so renowned that it inspired an enduring nickname for those in the Chinook world: “Hookers,” for the hooks found on the underside of the aircraft’s fuselage to which the slings attach. https://youtube.com/watch?v=l9YMeyRh60o The Chinook also ranks as the fastest helicopter in the Department of Defense, contrary to an unfortunate stereotype frequently repeated in media reports characterizing it as “huge and slow.” All three primary iterations of the U.S. Military’s largest helicopter, the CH-53D, E, and now K , dwarf the Chinook in size, but not speed. I watched and photographed all types of helicopters land, refuel, and then re-launch from the small airfield at the J-Bad PRT during my half-day stay at the base. Chinooks arrived and re-launched more than any other type of helicopter, an indicator of its broad utility and high demand in the war effort. During Operation Enduring Freedom, CH-47s transported troops of all nations involved in the war and hauled all types of cargo, from mail, to spare rotor blades, to engines for other helicopters, and sometimes entire helicopters slung beneath the Chinook by cables. CH-47s participated in all types of combat operations of all sizes, both conventional and special operations, all throughout Afghanistan, from the beginning of the operation to its final days. A CH-47D Chinook makes a dusty approach to a landing at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, near Bridgeport, California., Courtesy Ed Darack The CH-47’s storied history Today, Chinooks continue to support combat operations in Afghanistan, furthering a long legacy that began decades ago.  The CH-47 evolved out of a lineage of tandem rotor helicopters first pioneered in the 1940s by an inventor named Frank Piasecki, through his firm, Piasecki Helicopter. The company changed hands, becoming known as Boeing-Vertol in 1960 before ending up as part of the consolidated Boeing Defense, Space & Security division today. Over the years, these firms produced a number of high performance helicopters, such as the HRP Rescuer and the H-21 Shawnee, the latter setting a number of altitude and speed records for helicopters at the time. In 1960, the newly formed Boeing-Vertol released the tandem rotor CH-46 Sea Knight , relying on technology developed through Piasecki’s earlier models like the Shawnee. The CH-46, the only tandem rotor helicopter other than the Chinook employed by the U.S. military in recent decades, would serve as one of the longest-used aircraft in military aviation history, spanning over a half century of operation. Similar in appearance to the larger, more powerful Chinook, untrained eyes often confuse the CH-46 with the CH-47. The Chinook, however, is a far more powerful helicopter. The last of the U.S. military Sea Knights, flown by the Marine Corps—who called them “Phrogs”—retired in 2015, replaced by the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey . In 1961, Boeing-Vertol introduced the world to the Chinook with the CH-47A, originally known by the Army-specific nomenclature of HC-1B. The aircraft would evolve through a number of improvements and iterations in the subsequent decades, but its basic configuration and physical dimensions endured. An HC-1B Chinook., US Army In conflicts throughout the world, notably the Vietnam War and later the Gulf War, the Chinook proved itself to be a legendary mainstay of U.S. combat prowess due to its speed, reliability, and cargo and troop carrying capacity. The Army even converted four into heavily armed “ACH-47” gunships for use in the Vietnam war. The legendary 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the “Night Stalkers,” created a number of modified versions throughout the decades. The 160th’s MH-47D, E, and G “ Special Operations Aircraft ,” or “SOA,” each have in-flight refueling capability, enhanced defensive weapons, expanded fuel capacity, specialized navigation and avionics systems, and a number of other additions for the Night Stalkers’ specialized nighttime operations. Between 1982 and 1994, the U.S. Army converted all A, B, and C models of the Chinook to the D model, which had flown in Afghanistan from nearly day one of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 160th’s Chinooks, most all of which evolved from one of the conventional A through D model CH-47s, also flew in Afghanistan from the very start of the war. Some of the 160th’s specialized MH-47s., US Army In 2006, Boeing began production of the latest version of the Chinook, the F model. While some F models have re-used engines, rotors, and transmissions from D models, most of them are completely brand new. By contrast, all D models were upgrades from earlier versions. First test flown in 2001, the CH-47F began arriving in Afghanistan in November and December of 2008, with “Varsity,” B Company, 7th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, which is part of the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade, a unit of the storied 101st Airborne Division. These weren’t the first F model CH-47s to deploy to combat, however. That distinction went to CH-47Fs from the 4th Infantry Division, who took them to Iraq a few months prior to the Afghan deployment. The F model, while incorporating a number of improvements over the “legacy” A through D models, nevertheless retained the overall character of the original CH-47. Only those with a keen eye for Chinook detail can distinguish the F model from versions. With the debut of the F model, the Chinook may very well be the first military helicopter to reach the century mark of operational use. A CH-47D Chinook lands at a small landing zone at Firebase Blessing in Kunar Province., Courtesy Ed Darack Into Kunar province After my brief stay at the J-Bad PRT, I hauled my gear aboard another CH-47D, taking to the skies headed northeast, toward the restive Kunar Province, a hotbed of the war. The air crew first dropped supplies at a tiny Special Forces outpost on the Pakistan border and then unloaded me at Forward Operating Base Wright (FOB Wright), just outside of the city of Asadabad, the capital of the Kunar Province. That’s where the luxury of smooth, fast travel in the back of a Chinook ended, and my visceral appreciation for the CH-47 really began, courtesy of a ground convoy. I squeezed into the back of a Humvee a few hours after nightfall with Marines bound for Camp Blessing, deep in the Pech River Valley near the small village of Nangalam. Cold rain poured on us during most of the five hour journey and the Humvee slammed through potholes and ruts, knocking us off the steel bench seats a few times every minute. Despite the worsening condition of the road, the convoy accelerated when we passed by the opening of the Korangal Valley. We needed to move quickly as we’d entered “IED Alley,” where improvised explosive devices, buried under the dirt road and remotely detonated by insurgents and terrorists hiding in the Korangal, had destroyed a number of Humvees and other vehicles in the past months and years. These explosions had also killed and maimed American and Afghan military personnel, as well as Afghan civilians. Marines in back of a Humvee returning from a combat operation near the village of Wanat, in Afghanistan’s Kunar Province., Courtesy Ed Darack As the speed combined with the road conditions pounded us in the back, and as the thought of an IED detonating beneath our Humvee pounded in my head, I dreamed of the comfort, speed, and safety of the Chinook. Then a Marine in the back of the Humvee reminded me that deadly threats exist for CH-47s and other helicopters too. He pointed to the south, toward a mountain cloaked at that moment by darkness: Sawtalo Sar. Just three months earlier, during Operation Red Wings, an insurgent fired a rocket propelled grenade at a 160th MH-47D helicopter, “Turbine 33,” as it prepared to deploy a fast rope for the insertion of a quick reaction force of Navy SEALs high on the mountain’s slopes. The explosive round slammed into the rear transmission of the helicopter, sending Turbine 33 crashing onto the steep slopes of the upper peak, killing all sixteen on board: eight Night Stalkers and eight Navy SEALs. At that point, it was the greatest single-incident loss of life of American life in the war in Afghanistan. “Welcome to the edge of the empire,” Marine 1st Lieutenant Matt Bartels, the 25 year-old commander of Camp Blessing said when I arrived at three in the morning, drenched. Named after Jay Blessing, a Green Beret killed by an IED a couple years earlier, Camp Blessing held the distinction of being one of the most insular combat outposts in the War on Terror—and one of the most frequently attacked. Just a couple days before my arrival, a mortar had landed near the base’s command post, killing 20 year-old Marine Lance Corporal Steven Valdez. Matt told me that I’d arrived just in time, as the Marines were planning a raid to locate the mortar used to kill Valdez, and to seek out those who used it to kill him.

The Marines pounded a ridge a few thousand feet above and a few miles to the northeast of the base with 120mm mortars borrowed from the Army. As dust and smoke rose from the ridge, two CH-47D Chinooks sped into view and then landed side-by-side just outside the base’s perimeter next to a corn field. As two AH-64 Apache gunships orbited overhead, a platoon of Marines, about 30 “Afghan Security Forces” personnel, and I loaded onto the two idling Chinooks with all our gear. The Chinooks additionally carried enough MREs—meals, ready to eat—and bottled water to sustain us for a week. The Afghans also brought some of their own food: bags of rice, fresh vegetables, two live goats, and some live chickens. With our backpacks on the floor, M16s, AK-47s, rocket propelled grenade launchers, machine guns, grenades, and boxes of high explosives resting throughout the interior, the fully-loaded CH-47s lifted into the sky. As we passed the ridge that just minutes prior exploded under the mortar barrage, the pilots banked us hard toward it.

The site of Turbine 33’s shoot down, just across the Pech Valley, was plainly in sight of the ridge, and as such, the memory of that recent tragedy. According to the Marines, this was the first combat insert by Chinooks in the area since the Red Wings MH-47 shoot down. Just minutes after launching, the two Chinooks smoothly landed side-by-side on the grassy ridge. The Marines and Afghan fighters sped down the ramp and formed a ring of security around the two idling CH-47s as others offloaded the cargo and I ran around shooting photographs. The Marines had trained with Chinooks before, months earlier at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center near Bridgeport, California, where I met their battalion prior to their deployment to Afghanistan. While there I watched them conduct training for the type of real world raid I experienced first hand, courtesy of CH-47D Chinooks from the Nevada Army National Guard.

Despite the heavy loads, the high altitude and difficult terrain of the location in the Hindu Kush Mountains, and the warm air of late summer, which degrades a helicopter’s performance similar to high altitude’s effect, the insertion proceeded flawlessly. The insertion was a demonstration not only of the power and agility of the Chinook, but of the pilots, crew members, and maintainers of the aircraft. Shortly after the insertion, Lieutenant Bartels told me of another operation they had planned, this one in the Korangal Valley, just a mile from the shoot down location of Turbine 33, which we eyed from the ridge from which the Chinooks just departed. First, however, we needed to locate the mortar, and possibly those responsible for Steven Valdez’s death. A Marine speaks into a radio and troops unload a CH-47D Chinook after a combat insertion in Kunar Province., Courtesy Ed Darack Chinooks rush to help in Pakistan While the Marines discovered the small cave where the mortar system was hidden—and promptly destroyed it with 75 pounds of C-4 high explosive, the helicopter raid into the Korangal Valley never happened. A few seconds after the Marines blasted the cave, we felt the ground shake slowly side-to-side. 150 miles away, near Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, a 7.6 magnitude quake had struck. The “Kashmir Earthquake” had killed 100,000 people and left three million without homes. As a key component of America’s humanitarian assistance in response to the devastation, all available CH-47 Chinooks were dispatched to Pakistan. Chinooks proved so critical to combat operations in many of the most austere parts of Afghanistan that many missions simply could not be undertaken without them. No other helicopter can replicate its unique capabilities—not even close. One of the CH-47 pilots who journeyed to Pakistan for the earthquake relief mission was a young Army reserve lieutenant named Justin “Buddy” Lee. Buddy, who may have piloted a Chinook carrying myself and the Marines with whom I was embedded into the Korangal had the earthquake not occurred, had just recently been “winged” at Fort Rucker in Alabama, where all Army aviators receive their flight training. The months-long humanitarian mission brought Buddy a tremendous amount of Chinook piloting experience, which he then continued to build in the final months of his deployment where he supported combat operations in southern Afghanistan, including many special operations missions. Years later, Buddy would deploy to Afghanistan again, as a Captain, where he commanded “Extortion Company” out of Forward Operating Base Shank, south of Kabul in eastern Afghanistan. Almost a decade to the day after the earthquake that altered both our courses in each of our first journeys to Afghanistan, I met Buddy in person. Out of the military and working as a newly minted attorney, Buddy provided me incredible insight into the untold story of Extortion Company and Extortion 17, the CH-47D Chinook helicopter downed in the Tangi Valley by a rocket propelled grenade round in the dark early morning hours of Aug. 6, 2011. The tragedy marked the greatest single incident loss of life in America’s war in Afghanistan, with 30 American and eight Afghan personnel, and one American military working dog killed. The incident also marked the greatest single incident loss of life in the history of SEAL Team Six, the Navy SEALs overall, and in the history of U.S. Special Operations Command.

I learned about the machine itself, and its unique capabilities that allowed it to carry the Marines and myself onto that ridge above Camp Blessing and so many other operations in Afghanistan. I learned about the training that pilots undertake to fly such missions, including basic flight training, and then advanced mountain and high altitude training at a small facility in Colorado called HAATS, the High Altitude Army National Guard Aviation Training Site. A CH-47D Chinook speeds through the Sierra Nevada Mountains at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, near Bridgeport, California., Courtesy Ed Darack I learned about the camaraderie of those throughout the world of Army Aviation and the reverence that pilots, crew, and maintainers of Chinooks and other Army helicopters have for ground units like the Marines with whom I was embedded. I learned about the people of Extortion 17 themselves – about Bryan Nichols, a close personal friend of Buddy’s and one of the Extortion 17 pilots killed. In late June 2011, Buddy and Bryan piloted a CH-47D Chinook that was downed just a few miles from the location of the downing of Turbine 33—all survived. I learned about Dave Carter, co-pilot of Extortion 17, with whom Buddy flew a mission the night before Extortion 17’s shoot down. I learned the stories of the helicopter’s crew: Spencer Duncan, Pat Hamburger, and Alex Bennett; all hailed from different backgrounds, but all were bound by their common love of the Chinook and dedication to national service, the Army, and Army Aviation. I also learned of the passengers on board Extortion that dark early morning, and the close relationship and deep trust that Extortion Company shared with the special operations personnel they flew night after night—members of SEAL Team Six, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and Air Force Special Operations personnel. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uy3GlTWDArw I learned of the details of the mission itself, and how the operation was developed. I learned the second-by-second details of the downing, and then the tragic aftermath experienced by those near and far to those lost. I also learned of the story how American forces identified, tracked, and then struck back at those responsible for the downing—an incredibly gripping, seldom-discussed, aspect of the Extortion 17 story. Most importantly, I learned that far more than just a terrible tragedy noted in history, and far more than just a vital chapter in the enduring legacy of the Chinook and those who fly, crew, and maintain these incredible aircraft in the skies over Afghanistan and beyond, the Extortion 17 story opens a door of full-spectrum understanding of a world of human experience at its most extreme, war, like few stories ever have before.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of its new job as the lead U.S. military organization managing responses to possible crises involving weapons of mass destruction, the Pentagon’s top special operations headquarters is running a dedicated office to gather intelligence and information about these potential threats. Since President George W. Bush’s administration made the case for its invasion of Iraq, “WMDs” has become something of a dirty word, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t real concerns about hostile foreign powers and other groups getting hold such arms, including nuclear , radiological, chemical , and biological weapons . There’s a certain alphabet soup to the arrangement, with U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction-Fusion Center (CWMD-FC) being situated somewhere in the greater Washington, D.C. area, known to the U.S. military as the National Capital Region (NCR), which is already home to another secretive special operations counter-terrorism element, sometimes referred to as SOCOM-NCR . The mission of “countering” these deadly weapons can be somewhat confusing, as well. The fusion center’s job is to provide “a persistent focus on the weapons of mass destruction problem set,” Ken McGraw, a spokesman for SOCOM, explained in an Email. An extension of the work the command does at its headquarters in Tampa, Florida, the personnel actively work with their counterparts across the rest of the U.S. military, the Intelligence Community, and law enforcement agencies, among others, as well as foreign governments, he added. From this description, the fusion center’s role sounds utterly banal. But coordinating the Pentagon’s strategy to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction, which is essentially equal arms control and direct action, is a complicated and multi-faceted mission. A US special operator in protective gear maneuvers during a training exercise involving a chemical or biological threat., SOCEUR Preventing countries or other hostile actors from acquiring or transferring WMDs involves monitoring the movement and flow of weapons, precursor materials, and funding, helping to secure and destroy these items when necessary, and making sure foreign governments abide by various international agreements, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty. At the same time, SOCOM has to take the lead if the U.S. military ends up responding to related crises as diverse as a weapon accidently going off at home or abroad or there is a need to neutralize a hostile WMD capability. It’s an amazingly complex set of problems and that’s part of the reason why President Barack Obama’s administration, as one of its final official acts, shifted the job from U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) to SOCOM in December 2016. Critics were concerned that STRATCOM, which manages America’s nuclear deterrent, strategic intelligence, and military space activities, was either unwilling or unable to give countering WMDs the attention it deserved. STRATCOM “rarely invested the necessary political and intellectual capital,” one anonymous U.S. defense official told The Washington Post when it first reported on the shift in December 2016. As a whole, they said the U.S. military gave WMD threats an “overall low sense of priority as compared to its other missions.” A US Army special forces soldier cuts their way through a metal barrier with a rotary saw during a training exercise., US Army An additional factor was the difficulty in coordinating the activities of a myriad number of U.S. military elements charged with the mission, but not necessarily working directly together. These include the U.S. Army’s 20th Support Command and 21st Ordnance Company, the latter dedicated specifically to defusing WMDs, and the U.S. Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force , among others. There is also the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), a separate agency with the Department of Defense focused on responding to WMD threats. Many of these units and offices have individual agreements with other U.S. government agencies to better mesh their respective activities, too. According to a Memorandum of Understanding The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, U.S. Special Operations Command North, which oversees special operations missions in North America, has had a contract expert working within the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate since 2015. NORTHCOM via FOIA In part, SOCOM’s fusion center has the job of making sure these various parties are working together smoothly. With U.S. special operations forces themselves heavily committed, with some suggesting they are close to their breaking point organizationally under the strain of near constant operations, it’s possible that SOCOM could find struggling with many of the same problems. The command does have a long-standing relationship with the counter-WMD mission itself, though. One of the “ core activities ” of U.S. special operations forces is supporting U.S. government efforts to stem the proliferation of WMDs, according to SOCOM’s website. US special operators wearing protective gear with a self-contained breathing system carry a simulated casualty during a training exercise., SOCEUR According to Sean Naylor’s Relentless Strike , the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) spent much the 1990s preparing to respond to a “loose nuke” or similar scenario. This is not particularly surprising, given the increased fear after the fall o the Soviet Union in 1991 that Russia or other former Soviet republics had limited control of their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and material. While we don’t know how much time JSOC continues to devote to this mission, we do know the U.S. military still practices for these types of contingencies. In 2015, American personnel reportedly stopped a mock nuclear or radiological attack in Canada as part of an annual counter-terrorism exercise called Vital Archer. And while the idea that Saddam Hussein had an active set of WMD development programs in 2003 turned out to be bogus, there have been a host of very real world examples of these potential dangers since then. Most notably, in 2013, the U.S. military participated in a failed international effort to destroy the Syrian government’s chemical weapon stockpiles and production capability. DTRA worked with the U.S. Army to develop and provide a mobile system to destroy the dangerous arms on board the M/V Cape Ray , a ship from the U.S. government’s Ready Reserve Force, which keeps various ships storage until just such a need arises. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lejtV4_4iwY In addition to the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad, ISIS has employed chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria. It is very possible that American special operators have already worked with local forces in both countries to identify and manage chemical weapons and hazardous materials as they’ve pushed back the terrorist organization. In 2011, American troops had also deployed to Libya to guard that country’s chemical arsenal after the dramatic fall of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, a mission known as Operation Odyssey Guard. In February 2014, the U.S. government announced it had finished safely destroying the remaining weapons and associated materials, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorists or other militants. There is evidence that these organizations continue to be interested in radiological weapons, more commonly known as “ dirty bombs ,” as well, even though many experts suggest the biggest danger they pose is from panic . Just in August 2017, Indonesia authorities told Reuters that the country’s security forces had broken up a terror cell that was trying to make one of these devices. ISIS terrorists almost stumbled upon a potential source of radioactive material during their occupation of the city of Mosul in Iraq. Regardless of whether or not these plans would work, it still makes sense to tightly control radioactive material as part of the counter-WMD mission. In August 2015, a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane quietly arrived at an undisclosed airport in Mexico to load up three irradiators, which the country had previously used to eliminate agricultural pests, full of cesium-137 and spirited them away to a secure disposal site in the United States. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators on board a US Air Force C-17, destined for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site, in 2015., USAF There are an increasing number of much larger potential threats, as well. Any talk of military action against North Korea, no matter how remote , has to include a discussion of what to do about that country’s growing nuclear arsenal, as well as its existing stockpile of chemical weapons. So, it’s very likely that SOCOM’s D.C.-area fusion center has been part of the inter-agency work in response to the ever growing tensions with North Korea, especially after its sixth nuclear weapons test . In addition, the office no doubt at least followed the reported Israeli air strike on Syria’s Scientific Studies and Researchers Center, which leads that country’s chemical weapon development work and has probably talked with DTRA about its operation to make sure WMD materials don’t slip across the border from Syria into Jordan , the same country where JSOC has reportedly situated some portion of its effort to target and eliminate ISIS leaders, known as Operation Gallant Phoenix. US Army The center could be contributing information about Iran’s compliance with the international agreement about its controversial nuclear program, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). On Sept. 19, 2017, President Donald Trump called the Iran Deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” However, “the facts are that Iran is operating under the agreements the we signed up for under the JCPOA,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of STRATCOM, told a gathering at the Hudson Institute event on Sept. 20, 2017. “But at the same time they are rapidly, rapidly deploying and developing a whole series of ballistic missiles and testing ballistic missiles at all ranges that provide significant concerns to not just the United States, but our allies.” And there’s always the possibility of a completely naturally occurring WMD emergency, whether it be serious damage to a nuclear power plant from a natural disaster, as happened to the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan after an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2011, or an outbreak of deadly disease such as the Ebola outbreak that turned into a regional pandemic in West Africa in 2014. Both incidents resulted in massive U.S. government responses that involved American military personnel. All in all, WMD-related security concerns seem to have been expanding rather than receding in the past few years. It’s now SOCOM’s job to lead the U.S. military’s numerous efforts to counter that trend and Counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction-Fusion Center looks set to be an important part of staying on top of the issues.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 18, 2019",Over 100 A-10s Face Groundings While Dozens of F-35s Might Not Ever Be Able To Fight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is warning that it may have to ground more than 100 A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft as early as next year, even if Congress does decide to add billions to its budget for critical replacement wings . At the same time, the service, along with the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy, are considering halting upgrade work on possibly dozens of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, the Warthog’s ostensible replacement, which would leave them unable to fight. The two revelations came separately over the course of the Air Force Association’s (AFA) 2017 Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, which began on Sept. 18, the Air Force’s birthday, and ends on Sept. 20, 2017. The annual event offers senior leaders an opportunity to speak on the state of the service, their priorities, and their concerns. “We’re trying to work through to see if we can get to the point where we will not have to ground airplanes waiting to get wings, but as it stands right now, we will have to ground airplanes while we work through getting additional wings,” U.S. Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, head of Air Force Materiel Command, told Defense News in an interview on the sidelines of AFA conference. “What we will do, is we will have to manage the fleet in order to provide sufficient jets, particularly for the squadrons that are deploying in support to operations. But aircraft availability will be impacted due to the fact that we will not have sufficient wings to maintain the current aircraft availability.” At present, the Air Force has more than 280 A-10s in total, with nearly 110 of them still awaiting new wings. The service just lost two aircraft in an accident earlier in September 2017. An A-10 Warthog., USAF A-10s continue to be an important part of the fight against ISIS in Iraq and the standing defense of South Korea , and the jets routinely travel to Europe and elsewhere around the world to reassure American allies concerned about regional security threats. Air Force Materiel Command said the unmodified aircraft could end up grounded as early as the 2018 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2017. There is a possibility that new wings scavenged from aircraft in storage at the Bone Yard could alleviate some of the issues, but Air Force Materiel Command’s top officer said that option would only give the aircraft “a few more hours.” Echoing comments from Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and other Air Force officials at AFA, General Pawlikowski laid the blame for the situation squarely on budget cuts and caps, along with the inability of Congress to approve a full, fiscal year-long budget, instead relying on short-term funding bills, known as “continuing resolutions.” In addition, she cited delays at Boeing, where a parts defect had slowed the production of the new wing sections. Contractors take away a wing from one of the A-10s at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., USAF “Our opportunity to go get moving on that competition to award a new contract to get those additional wings is delayed until we can get an actual appropriation,” Pawlikowski told Defense News. “I can’t do that work under a continuing resolution.” While these budget problems were certain factors, she did not mention how the Air Force had consciously cut funding for any major upgrade work or even depot-level maintenance across he A-10 fleet during the 1990s. The service effectively waited right until the last moment in 2007 to begin the rewing process at all, which it had understood would be necessary for some time, issues I have noted many times in the past. Contractors work on new A-10 wings in 2009., USAF Working from this existing, self-imposed disadvantage, the Air Force had compounded the issue by deciding to focus its limited resources on other projects, despite the relatively low cost of the rewing effort. In 2011, the service itself said that it would save a modest $500 million – the difference between keeping more than hundred capable aircraft airworthy or buying, at most, around fjve F-35 stealth fighters – by ending the upgrade program early, leaving dozens of Warthogs without the replacement spans. This is not to mention the Air Force’s repeated attempts to send the aircraft to the boneyard since then, too. The service even suggested it was actively working on a direct replacement for the Warthogs, when it apparently quietly stopped that effort without telling anyone . In its latest budget request for the 2018 fiscal year, the Air Force again declined to request any money for new A-10 wings, instead shunting it into its “ unfunded priorities list .” Each service sends one of these wish lists to Congress every fiscal year, hoping legislators will decide to add additional money for these projects. The problem now is that even if Congress does pass a full budget, decides to inject more cash into the Air Force for the A-10 rewing program, and does so in a timely manner, Warthogs without the new wings will likely hit their maximum safe flight hours before the new spans even arrive. This means that even under a best case scenario, the unmodified jets will be sitting idle under the work is done. An A-10 lands on a dry river bed during an exercise., USAF The Air Force has long argued that upgrading the Warthogs is an easy thing to cut since it expects to replace the fleet of ground attackers with the F-35 in the near future, anyways. Unfortunately, as the service grapples with the almost inevitable grounding of more than a third of the A-10s for some amount of time, the U.S. military as a whole is apparently beginning to question whether or not it is cost effective to update potentially dozens of the Joint Strike Fighters the services already own and make them combat capable. “From a production perspective, we have literally 150 to 160 modifications that have to occur on some of our tails to get it to a Block 3 configuration,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) oversee the project for the Air Force, Marines, and Navy, said on Sept. 18, 2017 at the AFA conference. “Our mods program is almost as exciting and dwarfing our production program.” Winter didn’t explain what would happen to the aircraft left running the older Block 2 software versions, but it is likely that they would continue to perform testing or training missions. However, the planes would not be able to help train pilots on a variety of functions that are absent from the older code , including employment of many types of weapons, including the internal 25mm cannon on the Air Force’s A model. “You’re going to see us continuing to do a business-case analysis of retrofit of these aircraft,” Air Force Chief of Staff General David Golfein said in a separate AFA speech on Sept. 19, 2017. He stressed that the service had made similar decisions with regards to the upgrade of other fighter jets in the past, according to Aviation Week . A US Air Force F-35A., USAF While this is true, the Lockheed Martin and the F-35 JPO have specifically pitched the idea of buying the aircraft up front and upgrading them later, a concept known as concurrency , as a cost-saving measure for years now. It was the entire point of buying so many aircraft up front to begin with. If the steady drop in F-35 unit prices make it cheaper to buy new than to update a significant number of Joint Strike Fighters it will be a clear admission that the concurrency plan did not save money. On top of that, it will prove what many have argued for some time, that the cost of upgrades and reworks, which the U.S. military largely hid from public scrutiny , was in many cases exhaustively expensive. In 2015, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, predicted this outcome, writing : Putting an aircraft, especially one of the most complex on the planet, into production before testing is even close to being complete also results in fleet management and sustainability hell. This is because the myriad of retrofits required to jets of different blocks result in “fleets within fleets within fleets” of the same aircraft type. These post production fixes also represent a very expensive opportunity cost as the customer (the DoD, the American government, and by extension, average Americans) ends up buying literally throngs of incredibly costly, patched-up aircraft that will never fully meet their later production cousins design capabilities or lifespan. Keep in mind that these retrofits and post-production fixes, many of which happen at a depot level, do not include other upgrades that will be needed to give the F-35 parity in some respects to 4th generation fighters it intends to replace. So to clarify, because of the large production run of the item, the F-35 in this case, concurrency may be fiscal and organizational insanity, but the problems found during testing are theoretically solvable if you are willing to throw away many very expensive stealth jets and burn through lots of precious flight time on your existing, already overused and aging , fighter fleet in the process. Some upgrades may be unavoidable, as well. Whether or not the earlier models are as durable and have an overall airframe lifespan similar to more recent examples is a reasonable question. Beyond that, various F-35s are experiencing issues with their on-board oxygen generation systems ( OBOGS ) and there continue to be serious concerns about the safety of the aircraft’s ejection seat and other components of the overall pilot egress system. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ag591vjVa5M In May 2017, the Air Force announced the ejection seat issues were over, even though it had only installed a new seat in one F-35 . On Sept. 18, 2017, Roll Call revealed that the service had accepted a significant amount of continued risk to its pilots, which would remain the case even after contractors finished the ejection system modifications. A risk analysis report Roll Call obtained said that an estimated more than 20 pilots were still statistically likely to die or suffer injuries in “off-nominal” conditions. The experts suggested that additional tests over the course of nine to 12 months, costing less $1 million, would help eliminate these concerns. The Air Force declined to go that route. Also on Sept. 18, 2017, the Air Force announced it was making changes to the flight vest and breathing mask pilots flying the F-35, to help reduce hypoxia-like symptoms as it keeps searching for the root cause of the problems. The modifications to the vest reduce its overall weight and therefore the strain it might take to breath under certain conditions. Investigators identified a faulty valve in the mask that could be choking fliers, as well. A US Air Force F-35A pilot straps on his helmet., USAF All told, is that it is possible that the Air Force may end up with far fewer combat capable F-35As than it planned to have in service as it phased out the A-10s. It already seemed clear that the service had largely abandoned the idea of getting hundreds of Joint Strike Fighters into service any time soon when it decided it would dramatically extend the service life of hundreds of F-16 Viper fighter jets. In turn, with so many Warthogs expected to end up sidelines, this could have an impact on the ability of units to deploy for routine training missions, to support existing operations, or be ready for future contingencies. The Air Force claims its Joint Strike Fighters will be “fully combat capable” by the end of 2017, but you can read The War Zone’s in-depth analysis of that claim here . Suffice to say, the jets still require a significant amount of testing before they enter full service. All of this could only have a direct impact on the decision making regarding the fate of the A-10s, as well as the F-15C fleet, which the Air Force is also considering retiring over the course of the next few years. Reports suggest the service will finalize both of those plans before the end of 2017, but they both rely in no small part on the availability of F-35As to take the place of the older aircraft. Front to back, an A-10, an F-15E Strike Eagle, an F-35A, and an F-16C Viper., USAF As always, there is a larger question of where the money and personnel for any of these future force structures will come from in the end. In addition to its budget concerns, the Air Force is scrambling to stop the exodus of pilots and make up for a serious shortfall of hundreds of aviators. It’s a perfect storm of sorts and it may be too late to stop, at least in the near term. There’s already very real concern that the Air Force won’t be able to afford its present fighter jet fleets past 2021 and there may not be pilots to fly them, either. Whatever happens, it’s safe to say the Air Force has a number of hard choices ahead of it.

The United States plans to deliver a total of nearly 160 of the helicopters over the next four to six years as part of a broad modernization program known as the Afghan Aviation Transition Plan (AATP). “Transitioning to U.S. air frames will provide a more sustainable fleet and enhance Afghanistan’s ability to operate independently of coalition forces,” according to a video the Resolute Support Mission’s Train Advise Assist Command-Air (TAAC-Air) released earlier in September 2017. “The future of Afghan rotary wing operations: the UH-60 Black Hawk.” There is no debate about the Afghan military’s need for more air mobility to be able to adequately respond to the threats of various terrorist and insurgent groups. Much of the country, which is roughly the size of the state of Texas, is difficult for troops on the ground to access even in lightweight vehicles. Mountains, deserts and other terrain can easily slow operations in a country with limited road infrastructure. As such, helicopters and other air support have long been essential for coalition and Afghan missions, providing the speed necessary to respond on short notice to rapidly developing situations and the flexibility to establish and maintain forward bases in otherwise inhospitable areas. It’s also true that the Afghan Air Force simply doesn’t have enough Mi-17s to meet this demand. The U.S. military’s logic is that, given logistical and political realities , it is easier for it to support and work with an Afghan Air Force that flies the same aircraft that it does. But as we at The War Zone have explained in detail before, the Black Hawk is a significantly more complicated helicopter, with less carrying capacity compared to the Hip, and one that the Afghans have little to no functional experience flying or maintaining. In May 2017, when U.S. and Afghan officials first revealed this part of the AATP, I wrote : Even more worrisome, it seems debatable that the force could rapidly integrate an entirely new type of helicopter, and more complicated one at that, without significant assistance – or an upsurge in potentially deadly accidents. In December 2016, Afghan General Mohayedin Ghori, head of the country’s 207th Corps, died when the Hip he was riding in crashed near the town Muri Chaq in Badghis Province. The incident was reportedly the result of poor maintenance. The UH-60 is significantly more complex and maintenance intensive than the Mi-17 and the existing corps of Afghan flight and ground crews have no experience with any version of the aircraft. By comparison, the AAF as an institution has decades of time with the Hips, which could only have benefited existing personnel and new trainees. To fly and repair Black Hawks, the force would need all-new training. In the meantime, contractors would need to continue running things to avoid a dangerous slip in operational capabilities. It is worth noting that the United States has put Afghan military and police personnel through UH-60 maintenance courses in the past . This appears to have been mainly to give them basic skill sets, though, since neither organization has had any Black Hawks before now. And in the same presentation where it extolled the bright future of an Afghan Air Force flying the UH-60, TAAC-Air seemed to concede and even highlight many of these basic points. Not only is the Mi-17 fleet the backbone of the force, it’s one of their “most advanced programs.” A TAAC-Air advisor watches US Air Force personnel unload on of the first two Afghan Air Force UH-60s at Kandahar Air Field on Sept. 18, 2017., USAF “Afghan crews plan, manage, and execute all aspects of routine flying and maintenance operations [on the Hip], while experienced air advisors offer assistance and work hand-in-hand with mission leads,” the video noted. “The aircraft fly more than 40 hours per month and require maintenance every 25 hours – with major maintenance inspections every 100 hours.” It’s hard to imagine the Afghan UH-60 fleet will be able to match that level of independent operation any time soon and the transition could throw the relative stability of the “advanced” Mi-17 program into disarray. Captain Salvin told Military Times that the U.S. military plans to provide training more than 60 future UH-60 pilots in both Afghanistan and the United States, starting between October and November. An Afghan Air Force Mi-17., USAF But it’s not at all clear where these aviators would come from and Salvin suggested this would be separate for transition training for existing Hip crews. As of July 2017, the Afghan Air Force had 82 Hip pilots in total , including 39 co-pilots and 11 instructors, according to a quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a top U.S. government watchdog. If the U.S. military plans to pull a significant number of Mi-17 pilots and crews off the line for these training courses, it will have to fill in the obvious and immediate gap with American aircraft or contractors, or otherwise accept that the Afghan military will have a significant shortfall in air mobility capability. SIGAR said in its July 2017 quarterly report that the Hips had flown 50 percent of all Afghan Air Force missions in the preceding four months despite reportedly having the lowest operational readiness rate of any of the service’s airframes. American officials blamed the low availability on the age of the aircraft, but it seems very likely that this heavily utilization was a significant factor, as well. An Afghan Air Force mechanic works on an Mi-17., USAF There’s also no indication of how long the training programs will last and how long it will be before the Afghans can routinely conduct missions and necessary repairs independent of coalition advisers and contractor support with the UH-60. We do know that it took years for both the Afghan military and police to reach their existing proficiency with the Mi-17, despite it being a significantly simpler aircraft and there being an existing Soviet-trained experience base. Thanks to a U.S. Army accident investigation report into the crash of Mi-8MTV-1 helicopter – another designation for the Mi-17V1 – in April 2012 in Kabul, which we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, we have gotten a deeper look into some of those past operations. In this case, the aircraft ostensibly belonged to the Afghan Ministry of Interior’s Afghan Interdiction Unit, a counter-narcotics aviation element receiving support from American and British military advisers and private contractors. A grainy photo of the AIU’s crashed Mi-8MTV-1 in Kabul in April 2012., US Army via FOIA During the accident, which occurred during a dual training and reconnaissance mission, a Northrop Grumman contractor was the pilot-in-command, with a member of the AIU as the co-pilot. Massive private military company DynCorp, which recently argued for an increase in contractor support in Afghanistan alongside infamous mercenary Erik Prince , was providing maintenance for the helicopters. At this time, the AIU had been reportedly conducting “Afghan-only” operations for nearly two years . It seems reasonable to expect the Afghan Air Force’s UH-60 units will operate with a similar arrangement as they begin operations with the type. With the Afghan’s long standing political and societal issues, which some have described in the past as “The Afghan Condition,” the complete transition process could realistically take years to complete. This again, was something TAAC-Air seemed to accept in its presentation on the Hip. “Until the transition is complete, Afghan Air Force maintainers will keep the Mi-17 fit for flight.” Whether there will be enough personnel to adequately support the Mi-17 and UH-60 programs simultaneously remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",Here Are Some Technical Highlights We Saw at the Air Force Association Expo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Association’s (AFA) annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference is an opportunity for senior U.S. Air Force leaders, along with other important voices in military aviation and the private sector, to get together and share their thoughts on the future of air power. It’s combined with an technology exhibition where defense contractors come to show off their latest military aircraft, aviation systems, and other relevant products. We took to the show floor to take pictures of what was on offer and talk with representatives at the various booths. We found a lot of interesting items and picked up a number of tidbits along the way. Here’s a sampling of what we found. A model of the proposed JSTARS replacement aircraft from the team at Northrop Grumman, Gulfstream, and L3., Joseph Trevithick One of the hot topics at the 2017 Air, Space, and Cyber Conference was the Air Force’s ongoing efforts to replace its aging E-8C JSTARS radar planes. One of the competitors is a team led by Northrop Grumman, which also includes Gulfstream and L3. At Gulfstream’s booth we found a model of the proposed aircraft, which will use the G550 series airframe , seen above, as well as concept art, seen below. Gulfstream’s artwork of the JSTARS replacement aircraft., Joseph Trevithick You’ll note that the two don’t look the same. Understandably, as time goes on, requirements and plans change, and we learned from the representatives at the booth that the model was quite old and that the artwork was more recent. Most notably, the rendering in the background showed the plane’s mid-air refueling receptacle in the nose. Apparently, Northrop Grumman has gone back and forth on exactly where they think it would be best to position for this feature, which would allow the aircraft to stay on station for a extended period of time, a key capability for this type of sensor platform orbiting the battlefield. Northrop Grumman’s JSTARS replacement model, the one they’re building with Gulfstream, had the refueling receptacle on top of the fuselage., Joseph Trevithick Joseph Trevithick Gulfstream also had a model of another G550 the company is working on for the U.S. Navy. Commonly known as the NC-37B, to patrol and otherwise monitor testing grounds to keep out civilians and gather research data. L3 recently chose to use a similar airframe as the basis for a replacement for the Air Force’s EC-130H Compass Call jamming aircraft. A model of the future NC-37B for the US Navy., Joseph Trevithick The models for the JSTARS replacement concept from a team consisting of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bombardier, and the Sierra Nevada Corporation were much more consistent. The basic aircraft at the core of the proposal is Bombadier’s Global 6000 series. Lockheed Martin’s model of its JSTARS replacement proposal, which is it working on a part of a team., Joseph Trevithick Bombardier’s model of the same proposed aircraft., Joseph Trevithick Another big project attracting the attention of major defense contractors is the Air Force’s search for a new basic jet trainer, a program known as T-X . Teams made up of Boeing and Saab , Lockheed Martin and Korean Aerospace Industries, and Sierra Nevada and Turkish Aerospace Industries have all submitted proposals. Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems dropped out of the competition suddenly last winter. Italian firm Leonardo, formerly known as Alenia Aermacchi has also been working on a T-X submission, initially pair up with first General Dynamics and then Raytheon, before settling on its own U.S. subsidiary DRS as its path into the competition. All of the entrants brought models of their offerings – Boeing even brought 1:1 scale mock up and offered to take pictures in front of it illuminated by garish, multi-color stage lights – but only Leonardo painted theirs in something other than the standard scheme worn by the Air Force’s existing T-38s. The T-100 model wore colors similar to those of the “Red Tails” of the famed 332nd Fighter Group . The equally famous African American Tuskegee Airmen piloted P-51 Mustangs with this same paint scheme during World War II. Leonardo’s model of the T-100 wearing colors similar to the World War II-era 332nd Fighter Group., Joseph Trevithick L3 brought two models of the AT-802L Longsword , a modified Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster, each with a different camouflage scheme. This aircraft recently took part in the Air Force’s OA-X experiment . Sierra Nevada and Textron also had models of the A-29 Super Tucano and Scorpion light attack jet respectively, the two firms entrants into the light attack tests. Textron had submitted the AT-6 Wolverine, as well. A model of the AT-802L in a desert digital camouflage paint job., Joseph Trevithick A model of the AT-802L, seen at trade shows before, wearing a tiger-stripe paint scheme., Joseph Trevithick The Air Force is has also been struggling to replace its aging fleet of UH-1N Twin Hueys, which perform a host of specialized functions, including helping provide security for remote intercontinental ballistic missile sites and VIP transport duties, including being on hand to spirit senior U.S. government officials off to secure facilities in a crisis. Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, has long pitched various versions of the venerable UH-60 Black Hawk for these roles, most recently new versions based on the HH-60U rescue helicopter. We didn’t get a chance to ask any company representatives whether or not they knew why the Air Force hates the “U” designation so much, an odd detail we at The War Zone discovered thanks to a Freedom of Information Act Request. USAF via FOIA In 2010, the Aeronautical Systems Center – now called the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center – asked for the designation HH-60W for the new helicopters, and if that was unavailable, for HH-60P, because of an unspecified “negative connotation” surrounding the letter U in the personnel recovery community. Of queries to various Air Force command and and sources have turned up no answers, so if you know why, feel free to let us know! The Air Force’s top headquarters, which has the final say on these decisions rejected the request and stuck with HH-60U. However, the service is separately buying new combat search and rescue helicopters , which finally have its preferred “W” nomenclature. At the AFA conference, though, Sierra Nevada brought along the model of an apparent competitor, an updated UH-60L it has dubbed the Force Hawk, which features new avionics and missions systems, as well as uprated engines. The configuration sounds very much like the U.S. Army’s UH-60V upgrade package . The model on the show floor wore a similar paint scheme as the UH-1Ns assigned to the Air Force’s 1st Helicopter Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C. A model of Sierra Nevada’s UH-60L Force Hawk., Joseph Trevithick Other contractors seemed to have arranged their displays without any particular program in mind, with an eye toward fulfilling specialized requirements, or in an apparent desire to draw the attention of the many foreign military personnel in attendance. For instance, Airbus had a large model of its A400M airlifter outfitted as a tanker with a refueling pod for the probe-and-drogue system under each wing and painted in fictional Air Force colors. The European aviation consortium has pitched the aircraft to the Air Force in the past and recently delivered tanker variants to the German Luftwaffe, but there doesn’t appear to be a existing American requirement for such a plane. A model of a notional US Air Force Airbus A400M tanker., Joseph Trevithick Similarly, the US Air Force isn’t likely to be interested in buying Kawaski’s C-2 cargo aircraft. Japan is increasingly interested in entering the global arms market and this aircraft could be a competitive option, especially given that Boeing has shuttered the C-17 production line. The cutaway model of the plane shows a cargo of construction equipment, possibly highlighting its utility in humanitarian relief and disaster response mission sets. A model of the Kawasaki C-2., Joseph Trevithick Perhaps more interesting were the various contractors offering aviation services for testing and training purposes , a very lucrative and expanding market. Though there were reports that Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) had purchased a lot of ex-French Air Force Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jets to fly “Red Air” adversary missions, it was Draken International that featured the aircraft in its company literature. Neither firm had a model of the aircraft at their booth, though ATAC did have one of the firm’s Israeli Aircraft Industries Kfirs . A model of one of ATAC’s Kfirs., Joseph Trevithick Omega had a model of a aerial refueling equipped McDonnell Douglas DC-10, seen below, and a Boeing 707. The company says it got many of its DC-10s second hand from Japan Airlines, while at least one 707 came from a wealthy Middle Eastern oil magnate. The representative at the booth said that AFA wouldn’t allow them to serve beer, which they often do at other events. In those cases, a tap runs to a keg through the model rear end of a 707, mimicking the probe-and-drogue refueling system, but dispensing something entirely different. A model of one of Omega’s DC-10 tankers., Joseph Trevithick nnn In addition to manned aircraft, drones were, unsurprisingly, a major feature on the floor of the expo. Textron had a mock up of their recently unveiled Nightwarden unmanned aircraft hanging above their booth. Derived from AAI’s enlarged Shadow M2, Nightwarden expands on the original design, adding improved payload capacity for more powerful sensors and lightweight weapons . A mockup of the Nightwarden drone., Joseph Trevithick Beyond aircraft and drones, there were also weapons. Aerojet Rocketdyne had inert display versions of their Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) and BLU-129/B composite bomb casings, both of which produce little shrapnel, reducing the potential for collateral damage. The FLM is a warhead option for the 250-pound class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb, while the BLU-129/B forms the core of the Very Low Collateral Damage Bomb (VLCDB) variant of the 500-pound class Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), also known as the GBU-38(V)5/B . An inert FLM bomb body., Joseph Trevithick An inert BLU-129/B composite bomb casing., Joseph Trevithick Again, the displays weren’t just limited to American defense contractors focused on Air Force contracts. Turkish firm Roketsan had a model of their SOM-J cruise missile . The J variant of the weapon is a shared development with Lockheed Martin specifically sized to fit in the internal weapons bay on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters the Turkish Air Force is looking to buy. Joseph Trevithick There were podded sensor and electronic warfare systems, as well. Harris had a cutaway of the podded version of its Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite (AIDEWS), the AN/ALQ-211(V)9. The company makes internal versions of the same system for F-16 Viper fighter jet and the CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor. Joseph Trevithick Lockheed Martin had the Legion Pod on display at its booth. On Sept. 19, 2017, the company announced the Air Force had chosen this system as the winner of a competition to add infrared search-and-track (IRST) capability to its F-15C Eagle fighter jets . In addition to the IRST functionality, the pod is modular , meaning that the Air Force could decide to add additional sensors or other equipment, like sensors or data-links, to potentially make the older Eagles even more capable. Joseph Trevithick Lastly, a number of vendors were pitching hand-held jammers specifically to defeat small drones. The potential threat of commercially available quad- and hex-copter type unmanned aircraft has become increasingly apparen t in recent years and the Air Force in particular has been looking for ways to keep them out of its bases at home and abroad. Many of these devices, including the one from Battelle seen below, look and handle similarly to standard combat rifles. The firm’s mock up had a number of “kill” markings, but when we asked, the representative at the booth said they were unfortunately only for show and did not reflect any successes in tests. Joseph Trevithick Joseph Trevithick This is just some of what was on display and without a doubt there is even more advanced technology that remains hidden away from the public.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 24, 2019",Watch This Russian KA-52 Attack Chopper Accidentally Fire Rockets at Exercise Observers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video footage has leaked on social media showing a Russian Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter accidentally firing rockets at observers during a training exercise, reportedly part of the larger Zapad 2017 events happening along the country’s western borders. Though it acknowledged the incident occurred, the Kremlin has denied that it was related to the massive war game, but declined to give any other details. The clips that initially emerged on Sept. 19, 2017, show a pair of Ka-52s flying toward a ground of troops and civilians apparently watching a military maneuver. One of them then unexpectedly fires a pair of rocket into the onlookers, damaging a number of vehicles, including a civilian car and what appears to be a mobile command center truck. Another video subsequently appeared online, showing what looked like the view through the Ka-52’s Heads Up Display system. The exact circumstances of the incident are still unclear. One unconfirmed written statement said that the helicopter had inadvertently fired two S-8 80mm rockets damaging the car and truck, as well as wounding three bystanders, during a training mission on Sept. 16, 2017.

No known version of the S-8 has any sort of guidance system at all, especially one that would require a positive lock-on before launch. The Western Military distract didn’t say where or when the incident occurred if not at a Zapad-2017-related drill. That larger exercise, which began on Sept. 14, 2017, occurs only once every four years and simulates a major conventional conflict .

The Kremlin insists that the event is purely defensive in nature, but NATO members and other European countries that share borders with Russia, particularly Finland , Sweden , and Ukraine see it as a provocative display of military force. Given its size and significant, the Russians have been keen to downplay any incidents, including the “hard landing” of a Tu-22M bomber. If this friendly fire accident did happen at Zapad 2017, it would be particularly embarrassing.

Putin observes Zapad related exercises on the Luzhsky Range, near St. Petersburg,, AP Thankfully no one got injured and the helicopter only suffered “superficial damage,” according to the Army. In that case, the circumstances were especially confusing, since so-called “ opposing force ” units would not receive live ammunition during exercises.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 30, 2020",US Army Opens Permanent Base in Southern Israel as Trump Slams Iran Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States and Israel have a long history of close military cooperation , but much of it remains secretive or under-publicized in nature. Now, however, the U.S. military has an officially acknowledged permanent base of sorts, a possible signal of an expanding air and missile defense partnership as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration continues to challenge Iran over its advanced weapons programs, including development of ballistic missiles. On Sept. 18, 2017, the U.S. Army’s top command in Europe and the Israeli Air Force held a ceremony to officially break ground on what they described as a “life support area,” which generally refers to barracks-like facilities where personnel can eat, sleep, and bathe, among other things. The “LSA” will be situated within the Israel Defense Forces Air Defense School, located at Bislach Air Base near Beersheba in southern Israel’s Negev Desert, but will be an entirely American-run affair. “I would like to note that this life support area represents the first ever stationing of a United States Army unit on Israeli soil,” U.S. Army Major General John Gronski, Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe for Army National Guard and a member of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, said in a speech. “The United States and Israel have long planned together, exercised together, trained together – and now with the opening of this site, these crucial interactions will occur every day.” “A few dozens of soldiers of our American allies will be stationed here permanently,” Israeli Air Force Brigadier General Zvika Haimovich, head of the Israel Defense Force’s air defense arm, added. “They are part of an American task force that will be stationed here.” US Army Major General John Gronski, left, and Israeli Air Force Brigadier General Zvika Haimovich at the ceremony announcing Site 883., IDF This announcement came on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, New York. The two leaders talked about mutual security interests, including the situation in Syria and concerns about Iran growing influence in the region, according to an official readout of the meeting. Trump has long criticized Iran and the deal his predecessor President Barack Obama struck with that country over its controversial nuclear program, especially intensifying his push to isolate the government in Terhan following a visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. He has threatened to scrap arrangement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ). A truck carries a locally modified S-200 surface-to-air missile during a military parade in Iran in 2016., AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi “We cannot let a murderous regime like Iran build nuclear weapons, and we cannot let them use a deal as a cover for nuclear warfare,” he told the United Nations General Assembly is his first ever speech before the body on Sept. 19, 2017. “The nuclear deal was an embarrassment to the United States.” Critics warn that getting rid of the Iran Deal would only hasten Iranian nuclear and missile developments, unconstrained by any international oversight , no matter how limited or problematic. Their arguments often point to the example of North Korea, which the collapse of talks and an interim agreement has now led to a pariah state that possesses a working hydrogen bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching much of the United States. Regardless, Israel said the opening of the American base in the Negev, also known as Site 883, was two years in the making, meaning the Obama administration had set the plan in motion. It makes sense, since the parties to the JCPOA did not structure the agreement to cover conventional weapons development, including long ballistic missiles that could potentially threaten Israel or other countries in the Middle East and beyond. Though this new site may be technically permanent, it expands on an existing forward deployed base at the top of Israel’s Mount Har Keren, also in the Negev. For nearly a decade, members of the U.S. Army’s 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command have maintained a long-range X-band AN/TPY-2 radar, primarily associated with the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System ( THAAD ), at a so-called “cooperative security location” known as Site 512 . A map of American military facilities in Europe and the Near East as of 2015, showing Site 512 in Israel. , US Army While the U.S. military has no THAAD interceptors in Israel at present, the radar helps provide additional situational awareness for both American and Israeli forces. It feeds information into at least one of the Israel Defense Forces’ command centers responsible for operating the Arrow 3 ballistic missile defense system. On top of that, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has facilitated a significant amount of other construction projects in Israel through the Foreign Military Sales program, including at least two massive underground command and control bunkers. In 2015, the Corps told the author that it was awarding contracts for an average of 10 to 14 major building programs on behalf of the Israeli Ministry of Defense each year . Site 883 looks set to improve upon that existing cooperation, possibly helping to streamline the flow of data from Site 512, as well as other U.S. intelligence sources, such as Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) early warning satellites. Of course, its existence “would not hamper the IDFs ability to act independently against any threat to the security of the State of Israel,” Brigadier General Haimovich stressed . At the same time, the United States is continuing to facilitate the development of the Arrow 3 interceptor . In June 2017, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral J.D. Syring, head of the Missile Defense Agency, said the next test of that system would occur at the contractor-operated Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska (PCSA) in Kodiak, Alaska, in 2018. Separately, the U.S. Army has been testing the Israeli Tamir interceptor, the weapon behind the country’s much touted Iron Dome system, as a possible load out for its truck-mounted Indirect Fire Protection Capability launcher. Iron Dome is a short range system that Israel primarily uses to knock down incoming rockets that militants often fire into the country or disputed border territories. It is possible that Tamir could have a role in defeating the increasing threat of small unmanned aerial vehicles, as well. Earlier in September 2017, State-owned Israeli defense contractor Rafael announced it was planning to demonstrate the full Iron Dome system for the U.S. Army as a possible interim solution to the service’s glaring short- and medium-range air defense gap, an issue that The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has recently explored in depth . The U.S. Army’s Site 883, along with Site 512, within Israel seem primarily focused on the growing threat of ballistic missiles, though. In June 2017, Iranian forces launched a short-range ballistic missile strike against ISIS terrorists in Syria, which served to demonstrate the capability against a real world target for all to see. The next month, it officially opened the Imam Khomeini Space Center in Semnan with the launch of a space launch vehicle, which critics of the country argue is simply a cover for the development of a long-range ballistic missile. In an Email to The War Zone, the U.S. Strategic Command said its Joint Space Operations Center did not record any new satellite entering orbit after the launch, suggesting the Simorgh or its payload had failed to function as intended. Perhaps more worrisome, there is compelling evidence that Iran has been working with the Syrian government to establish new ballistic missile production facilities within Syria. These could supply either Bashar Al Assad’s regime or the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Underscoring the potential danger, on Sept. 19, 2017, Israeli air defense forces said they knocked down a Hezbollah drone over the Golan Heights region along the border with Syria using a Patriot surface-to-air missile. An Israeli Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher., IDF Israel has been interdicting deliveries of advanced weapons bound for Hezbollah via Syria for some time, prompting Assad to threaten a massive ballistic missile volley in response in March 2017. Israeli aircraft have not stopped their strikes, though, launching an especially notable mission against a Syrian facility linked to both its chemical weapons and ballistic missile development programs earlier in September 2017. As conflicts in the region, especially in Syria, continue to evolve, it’s entirely possible that new threats may emerge connected to Iran or not. Ballistic missile technology has steadily proliferated in the region in recent years, being an important factor in both the Syrian and Yemeni conflicts. Though small at present, Site 883 is a clear signal that the United States is taking these issues seriously, especially as it looks to continue putting pressure on Iran and its proxies, and is seeking even closer coordination with its allies in the region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a quirk of fate that I happen to share a birthday with the U.S. Air Force, but it’s one that only helps drive home Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson’s comment that the service has been constantly flying combat missions for 26 years, since Operation Desert Storm in 1991. That’s more than a third of its 70 year history and nearly four fifths of my entire life . Wilson made her remarks on the first day of the Air Force Association’s (AFA) annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference in Maryland. Wilson went on to stress the need to restore the Air Force’s readiness, stabilize its budgets, and completely rethink how the service goes about conducting science and technology research. Her comments, as well as those of other senior leaders and industry partners who spoke at a number of panels, depicted an organization heavily engaged in present matters of national security – from tensions with North Korea to the ongoing fight against ISIS – as well as looking to transform itself to stay superior to any potential foe. Here are four takeaways from the opening day of the conference we at The War Zone think are especially important. AP Readiness and budgets Heather Wilson spent considerable time during her speech detailing a readiness crisis within her service. She said the Air Force was doing all it could to meet its operational demands, especially in the Middle East, as well as keep proficient in core national defense missions, such as nuclear deterrence. “It is not fair for this nation to ask our commanders to keep saying ‘We got this’ right up to the point of failure, because we don’t got this,” Wilson declared. “Low readiness for a crisis doesn’t mean we won’t go. We will go. What it means is that fewer will come back.” Wilson highlighted the issue with an anecdote from a recent trip to visit Air Force units service in the Middle East in the fight against ISIS. She noted how some B-52 bombers had flown more than 570 sorties without any routine maintenance and performed more than 700 “danger close” strikes that could potentially put the friendly forces they’re supporting at risk. She explained it was a mission Boeing never intended the aircraft to perform when it finished the design in the 1950s and that the same crews would have a nuclear readiness review upon returning to their home station at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. A B-52 bomber touches down at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in 2016., USAF It’s no secret that the tempo of operations, especially since the 9/11 terrorist attacks have put a serious strain on the Air Force in general. There are no shortage of reports about low morale and an increasingly severe shortage of pilots. In August 2017, the Air Force announced it would increase monetary incentives and bonus payments, along with looking to ask retired personnel to return to uniform, to try and make up the shortfall . As of the 2016 fiscal year, the service was in need of more than 1,500 additional pilots, the bulk of which it needed for its fighter squadrons. Wilson said the shortage had a cyclical impact on readiness, reducing overall dwell time and opportunities for both vital training and leave. She laid the blame for this at the feet of the inability of Congress to pass a traditional budget, instead relying on 31 continuing resolutions over nine of the past ten years, as well as the spending caps the 2011 Budget Control Act imposed on the U.S. military as a whole, commonly known as sequestration. It is also fair to note that the law forced all of the services to make hard choices and the Air Force’s own decisions often exacerbated the situation. “This is how we lose the warfighting advantage for the citizens we seek to protect,” she added. “The United States must get beyond the Budget Control Act in order to protect the country.” An F-16 fighter jet on a mission against ISIS over Iraq. , USAF Science and technology review At the same time, Wilson stressed that the service was working to modernize and transform to meet emerging threats in the air and on the ground, in space , and in cyberspace . To that end, she announced that there would be a year-long review of the Air Force’s overall science and technology strategy. The Air Force Research Laboratory would lead the effort, but in cooperation with other organizations, including Air Force Scientific Advisory Board . The overall objective would be to begin exploring what the Air Force might look in the next decade or two and put the service on a steady course to still over-match its opponents. “We will listen broadly and engage those who are on the cutting edge of science so that we can focus our research efforts on the pathways that are vital to our future as a service,” Wilson explained. But, most importantly, the service’s top civilian leader explained that she wanted to reinvigorate cooperation with America’s top research universities. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson speaks at another AFA event in June 2017., USAF The U.S. military as a whole has made a big show of its partnerships with industry, in particularly the tech sector, through organizations such as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) and the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), as part of a strategy known as the “ Third Offset .” Similar work to expand on long-standing links with academic institutions has received less attention. That doesn’t mean it has been any less significant, though. In 2014, the SCO organized an experiment where Air Force pilots in F-16 fighter jets deployed miniature drones from modified flare dispensers. In 2016, U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets conducted a similar exercise , dropping more than 100 of the miniature unmanned flying machines, which then acted as a single swarm. The concept and the basic design of the remotely operated craft, the Perdix, had originally come from a group of students at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Wilson said that she wanted the Air Force to become “the sponsor of choice” for these kinds of cooperative developments with university faculty and students following the 12-month review of science and technology priorities. She has previously suggested she is unfamiliar with the Third Offset concept and did not mention the term specifically during her remarks. The Air Force hasn’t given up on the ICBM Wilson stressed that none of this meant the Air Force will abandon its present modernization priorities, including continued development of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , B-21 Raider stealth bomber , and KC-46A Pegasus tanker . At a separate panel on the service’s Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program, U.S. Air Force General Robin Rand, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, along with other senior leaders and members of industry signaled unequivocal support for the third leg of the so-called nuclear triad, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. In August 2017, the Air Force awarded both Boeing and Northrop Grumman contracts to mature their GBSD proposals and reduce potential risks in their respective designs. At the 2017 Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, General Rand and his other panel members, including representatives from both firms vying for the final deal to build the new missiles, argued that ICBMs still offer a cost-effective and survivable component of America’s nuclear deterrent, which has seen renewed relevance of late. “The men and women who are performing this ICBM mission, I believe, are what’s keeps the world from completely spinning off its axis,” Rand said. “We are dealing with craziness in the East and the South China Sea, with what’s going on in Iran, certainly with what’s happening in Russia is they’re proliferating their nuclear and conventional enterprise, [and] everyone’s well aware of the challenges we’re facing now with North Korea.” Rand called the Air Force’s nuclear deterrent forces, both the ICBM and nuclear-armed bomber components, as well as their support elements, “silent assassins,” suggesting that like assassins, they don’t brag about their work. Retired U.S. Air Force General Roger Burg, who was previously in charge of 20th Air Force, which controls the esrvice’s entire strategic missile force, argued that the land-based portion of the triad is the only leg where every single weapon system is on a state of alert 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. US Air Force personnel prepare to remove an ICBM from its silo as part of the terms of the New START Treaty in June 2017, USAF In contrast, Burg said that the U.S. Navy’s nuclear ballistic missile submarines effectively take shifts sailing secretive deterrence patrols, and can only spend approximately 70 days under water – insulated from enemy observation and potential attack – at a time at maximum before needing to return to the surface. He also noted concerns about the idea of keep planes loaded with hydrogen bombs sitting behind a protective screen of little more than a barbed wire fence and a dozen airmen with M16 rifles in today’s “threat environment.” In addition, Burg added that the visibility of the ICBM made them a stabilizing deterrent force in the eyes of many potential opponents, including Russia and China. Those countries, he said, saw the ballistic missile submarine force as a destabilizing factor since it had the capability to launch a virtually no-notice first strike. Rand, Burg, and the others aren’t making unusual arguments, either. After recently suggesting he might be considering dropping the missile leg of the triad, Secretary of Defense James Mattis now appears to be on board, as well. “I’ve questioned the triad,” Mattis told reporters earlier in September 2017. “I cannot solve the deterrent problem reducing it from a triad. If I want to send the most compelling message, I have been persuaded that the triad in its framework is the right way to go.” Of course, we at The War Zone have written at length about the potential benefits of reducing the triad to a diad, debating how survivable the ICBM force really is and challenging its ability to respond to rapidly changing situations, including emergency orders to stand down. Still, these issues, especially the one Burg raised about promoting a stable deterrent environment, are interesting to consider in the wider debate. A Minuteman III ICBM blasts off during a test in 2008., USAF A new world of intelligence Effective deterrence, just like any of the Air Force’s missions relies on effective intelligence gathering about just what enemies and potential enemies are actually planning to do. So it’s no surprise that another panel focused on the future of service’s so-called “Iron Triad” of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, the E-3 Sentry airborne command and control platform, the E-8 JSTARS radar plane, and the RC-135 spy plane family. The basic airframes for all three of these are derivatives of the Boeing 707 airliner, just like the Air Force’s KC-135 tanker fleet , and many of which first rolled off the production line more than a half century ago. Despite continual upgrades over the decades, the need to either overhaul or outright replace these planes has become ever more apparent. There is already a project in the works to develop a JSTARS replacement, a fleet that has already provided more than 130,000 combat hours of support in the Middle East and Central Asia since Operation Desert Storm in 1991. As that and other programs get underway, though, the Air Force has to consider how best to improve and expand its mix of platforms and sensors to meet the evolving needs of commanders in the air and on the ground. “Modern conflict will likely involve far more dynamic, rapidly evolving problem sets than those posed by the former Soviet Union,” retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula, who is now the Dean of the AFA’s Mitchell Institute of Aerospace Power Studies and was the panel’s moderator, explained in opening the talk. “Furthermore, recent and future developments conceive nearly every aircraft in the Air Force inventory able to gather data and fuse it with a host of actors.” An E-8 JSTARS., USAF The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has talked about how this could easily be the case with regards to the F-35’s on board sensor suite . On top of that, the near future Deptula described might require the Air Force to have systems and units focused on gathering intelligence that previously have no even been there to capture, including in cyberspace. “Regardless of the operation, whether it’s highly contested such as North Korea, whether it’s the humanitarian relief operation that we have just conducted in Texas and in Florida, or whether it is on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, we have harnessed publicly available information,” Lieutenant General VeraLinn Jamieson, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, said. “Some call that social media, blogs, newspapers, discussions – and [we have] been able to use that data to get decision making quality information to the tactical edge to create the desired effect that we want.” Jamieson wasn’t talking figuratively about the benefits of combing through this information, either. In June 2015, U.S. Air Force General Herbert Carlisle, then head of Air Combat Command, revealed that an air strike had killed ISIS members in either Iraq or Syria after intelligence analysts figured out the location of a command center from pictures one terrorist fighter had posted online. The growing ubiquity, and therefore importance, of social media is just one small, but significant factor the Air Force will need to incorporate into its future plans. From what we saw at the first day of the AFA’s 2017 Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, after 70 years of war and peace, the service seems to be in the midst of an important and broad watershed moment that could potentially define it for the next seven decades and beyond.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 16, 2019",All You Need to Know After North Korea’s Longest Downrange Missile Launch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has successfully conducted its longest downrange ballistic missile test ever with yet another provocative launch over Japan , showing it has at least the range to hit the U.S. Pacific Ocean territory of Guam . The incident came after the United Nations Security Council hit the increasingly isolated country with the toughest sanctions to date. At the same time there’s an ongoing debate between the United states and its allies all about how to constrain the Hermit Kingdom amid concerns that whatever they decide could provoke an arms race in East Asia. On Sept. 14, 2017, the North Koreans fired what appeared to be another Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missile. It reached a maximum altitude of approximately almost 480 miles and traveled a total distance of around 2,300 miles, over the Japanese home island of Hokkaido, before falling into the Pacific Ocean some 17 minutes later. This was particularly notable since it was a much shallower launch envelope than in previous tests and more representative of what one might expect to see in an actual strike. U.S. Pacific Command said North Korea launched the liquid-fuel missile from the Sunan district of the country’s capital Pyongyang, which is home to its international airport and that it posed no threat to North America or Guam. “We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment and we will provide a public update if warranted,” the official statement said. Though the missile did not represent an imminent threat to Guam, observers and researchers were quick to point out that the launch conclusively proved the Hwasong-12 had the range to hit the island. In August 2017, North Korea had threatened to fire the weapons near the American possession following U.S. President Donald Trump’s now infamous “ fire and fury ” comments. It was also the second time in three weeks that the North Koreans had sent a missile flying over Japanese territory, widely seen as a significant escalation in their provocations. This in turn had prompted the U.N. Security Council to impose new and more severe sanctions on the country, curtailing oil imports, banning textile exports, and placing major restrictions on its the ability of its government and citizens to conduct business abroad. North Korean state media responded to the announcement with its traditional bluster , threatening to use its nuclear arsenals to send Japan “into the sea” and turn the United States into “ashes and darkness.” Though these threats thankfully seem remote, North Korea has successfully demonstrated an intercontinental ballistic missile with the potential to hit the continental United States, the Hwasong-14 , as well as tested what experts believe is a thermonuclear warhead able to fit inside the weapon. “I‘m assuming it was a hydrogen bomb,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command told reporters shortly before learning of the latest missile launch. “I have to make that assumption as a military officer.” Secretary of Defense James Mattis, left, and U.S. Air Force General John Hyten stand in front of U.S. Strategic Command headquarters on Sept. 14, 2017., AP Photo/Nati Harnik This was the first official statement from the U.S. military on the type of weapon involved in North Korea’s sixth nuclear test. Previous U.S. government comments about the device, which had an explosive force of at least 160 kilotons according to some government estimates , had described it simply as “ advanced. ” Hyten was answering questions from members of the press who had accompanied Secretary of Defense James Mattis to the command’s headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Personnel quickly ushered Hyten off to his command center and press off the base after it became apparent the North Koreans had fired another missile. “Is there something going on?” Hyten reportedly asked . “Yeah,” an aide responded matter-of-factly. Beyond just the missile launch itself, what was going on was North Korea was demonstrating its continued defiance in the face of increasing international pressure. Even before the new sanctions, the country’s state media reported that Premier Kim Jong Un had demanded his weapon designers and strategic forces push forward in their development programs and plan for more tests across Japan and into the Pacific Ocean. “It was nothing novel to our ability to observe and orient ourselves,” Secretary of Defense Mattis told reporters in Nebraska after reconnecting with the pool following the launch. Still, it “sent millions of Japanese into duck-and-cover.” So, needless to say, this has prompted renewed debate among the major parties in the region, namely Japan, South Korea, China, and Russia, as well as the United States, about how to move forward. Chinese and Russian officials reportedly pushed their American counterparts to drop some of their sanctions demands, namely a complete halt in oil deliveries to North Korea, in exchange for their votes at the United Nations. However, it was clear the United States had not necessarily been pleased with the outcome. At a Congressional hearing earlier in September 2017, Marshall Billingslea, Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Terrorist Financing, described how North Korea had been able to skirt sanctions with a network of shadowy shipping companies. Marshall Billingslea, Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Terrorist Financing, points to a chart showing evidence of North Korea’s sanction busting during a hearing in September 2017., AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Ships would illegally switch their transponders on and off before entering Chinese and Russian ports to load and unload prohibited cargoes, sometimes leaving them to be picked up by a different ship for further transshipment. Chinese and Russian officials seemed unwilling or unable to do much about this, suggesting the long-term efficacy of sanctions regimes would be limited unless something changed in those policies. This has led to calls for a more proactive blockade around North Korea, which we have suggested is one potential means of exerting additional pressure on the Kim regime. “China supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labor,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson subsequently said in a statement after the Sept. 14 missile launch. “China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.” Chinese and Russian officials dismissed the criticism, pointing instead to the United States and its allies and their own military maneuvers, which they say are only inflaming the situation. Echoing its long standing position, China urged all sides to accept their individual responsibilities to reduce tensions without naming any side in particular. “We are demonstrating not only our intolerance towards the illegal launches, but also our willingness to settle the situation in the Korean peninsula,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in response to Tillerson’s remarks. “Regrettably, aggressive rhetoric is the only thing coming from Washington.” A North Korean patrol boat sails on the Yalu River, which separates it from China., Chinatopix via AP But if sanctions can’t or won’t work in the immediate future, then the United States and its allies will increasingly feel they need to entertain other options and it’s not clear that the U.S., Japanese, and South Korean governments agree on the alternatives. After its sixth nuclear weapon test, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway ran through the available options short of an all-out confrontation, writing : Things have moved so fast over the last 18 months when it comes to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs that it seems as if many are in denial of just how perilous the situation has become. Above all else, the summer has underlined one cold and harsh reality – Kim Jong Un clearly has a plan and the U.S. and its allies clearly don’t. For their part, the Japanese have sought to downplay the obvious impact of North Korean missiles routinely flying past overhead. The country’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that there had been no attempt to shoot down the missile on Sept. 14, because there was no risk of it coming down on Japanese territory. However, it might’ve been more a product of the lack of any readily available means to do so reliably. Though Japan has is working to acquire more advanced ballistic missile defenses, its present primary air defense system, the Patriot surface-to-air missile, has at best a limited utility against larger ballistic missiles such as the Hwasong-12. The country’s planned future fleet Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense-equipped ships, along with equally capable shore sites , may change that calculus. Perhaps more notably, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has gone on the record to say that his country is not looking to develop its own nuclear weapons or allow the United States to bring its nuclear weapons back. “To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia,” he told CNN in an interview on Sept. 14, 2017. South Korean President Moon Jae-in speaks to his country’s National Security Council on Sept. 15, 2017., Yonhap via AP At the same time, though, Moon has overseen a continued expansion of South Korea’s conventional arsenal, notably continuing the development of the increasingly capable Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile , and maintained a three-tier response plan his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, put into place. This includes a standing threat to “ decapitate ” the Kim regime’s senior leadership during a crisis, meant, it seems, to hobble its ability to function out of fear of constant attack, as we have previously explained in detail. He has also reversed course of a previous desire to slow or outright halt the U.S. military’s deployment of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) ballistic missile interceptors into the country. So, while South Korea seems intent on avoid a nuclear arms race, it seems to be perfectly content to match North Korea’s provocations with conventional responses of increasingly dubious impact. On Sept. 15, 2017, in what has become a routine maneuver , South Korean forces fired a pair of Hyunmoo-2s, ostensibly demonstrating their ability to hit Pyongyang’s airport, as well as a seperate conventional artillery drill near the demilitarized zone. Earlier in September, the South Korean Air Force had also conducted a live-fire test of its new German-Swedish-designed Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile, another component of the so-called “Kill Chain” aimed at North Korean targets. “Dialogue is impossible in a situation like this,” Moon said during a meeting of the country’s National Security Council on Sept. 15, 2017, according to Yonhap News . “In case North Korea undertakes provocations against us or our ally, we have the power to destroy [the North] beyond recovery.” As we at The War Zone have noted many times before, these tit-for-tat shows of force are unlikely to have any impact unless backed by a more credible willingness to act. North Korea may have chosen the dual-use civilian-military Pyongyang International Airport, situated inside a populated area full of innocent bystanders, as a launch site specifically to further deter any actual forceful response. But the U.S. government may be increasingly anxious to find a way to act. “We’re out of time,” U.S. Army General H. R. McMaster, presently serving as Trump’s National Security Adviser said at a White House press conference on Sept. 15, 2017. “We’re out of road,” he continued before stressing that “there is a military option.” As North Korea continues to defy sanctions and international condemnation, it seems be increasingly hard to ignore the need to seek different means of exerting pressure on the reclusive Communist regime without having to resort to an open conflict that would be disastrous for all parties in the region. Hopefully, the United States and its allies will explore all of potential the avenues before resorting to a military option.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 13, 2019",This Combat Diver Delivery Unit Is a Crazy Fast Speed Boat That Turns Into a Sub,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s something of an open secret that maritime special operations forces around the world rely on a wide array of highly specialized water craft, such as high-speed, low-profile speed boats, miniature submarines, and more . Now, one company, SubSea, is trying to combine a number of these features into single design it calls the Diver Delivery Unit (DDU), which can transform from a speedboat to a mini sub and back again. The DDU concept is centered on a symmetrical twin-hull design, both of which could carry personnel or other equipment. The United Kingdom-based firm says the final arrangement will be both modular and scalable to allow for a wide variety of missions, including special operations raids, hunting drug smugglers, patrolling ports, and even performing research and exploration tasks. Eight electric fans will power the boat underwater, with two at the rear of each hull and another two in each of the twin bows. The front pairs retract into the hulls when the craft is riding on the surface so it can maintain its streamlined profile. SubSea says that battery technology from high-performance Formula-E electric race cars will power these engines. Multi-fuel diesel engines will power water jet drives in both hulls for high-speed travel on the surface. SubSea doesn’t say on its website what the craft’s top speed might be, either on the surface, or below the water, or what kind of range it could have in its final form. The company does say the design will allow for “full hydrodynamic control” at depths of almost 115 feet. A low quality image showing the prototype DDU’s forward motors deployed while the craft is submerged., SubSea The design suggests it could be an extremely fast. Both hulls have a very slender shape designed to cut through the water rather than skip on top like many other high-performance speed boats. Not only does this help improve performance, but it reduces the strain on operators as well, who end up slamming up and down in most high-speed watercraft. Shock absorbing seats can only do so much to alleviate this battering. @AbraxasSpa The SubSea Diver Delivery Unit (DDU) model at #DSEI provides a good indication of the planned operational configuration pic.twitter.com/lL2WNiuqds — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) September 13, 2017 As of 2017, there are a number of these so-called “Very Slender Vessels,” or VSVs in military service around the world. One of the best known types is the sleek looking and stealthy WP-18 strike craft , which is reportedly the fastest naval watercraft in the world. Manufactured by Abu Dhabi MAR in the United Arab Emirates, the WP-18 has a top speed of more than 75 miles per hour and a range of approximately 400 miles even at a brisk cruising speed of only 54 miles per hour. The UAE’s military operates these and the Abu Dhabi MAR exported additional examples to Mozambique’s Navy. In January 2017, Safehaven Marine in Ireland, already well known for its sleek Baraccuda patrol boats, launched its own VSV design, the XSV-17 “ Thunder Child .” Slightly slower than the WP-18, it still has a cruising speed of more than 45 miles per hour and is capable of accelerating up to nearly 70 miles per hour when necessary. The basic concept is by no means new, with the U.K.’s Special Boat Squadron having acquired a single experimental VSV in 1999 and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency starting a similar project that same year, according to GlobalSecurity.org . Satellite imagery shows North Korea is experimenting with the VSV concept and there is at least one known example of drug smugglers making use of an amazingly slender-hulled craft . But SubSea’s design looks to be the first time someone has attempted to build a fully-submersible craft using these design principles. It’s an idea that makes perfect sense if the firm can make it work. Rapidly improving shore-based defenses, including long-range cruise and ballistic anti-ship missiles , integrated air defenses, and precision artillery, mean that sea-borne raiders and larger amphibious forces both face increasing risks, especially in narrow or otherwise constrained waterways. Simply building craft with low-observable shapes offers some protection against radar and other sensors, but doesn’t necessarily reduce the visual, sound, or infrared signatures of the craft. A craft like the DDU, which can utilize high speed or the ability to hide under the waves, would give special operations forces multiple options to try and avoid detection during a single mission, allowing them to get close to targets to both gather intelligence or strike. SubSea also says it will be possible to air drop the craft or sling it underneath a helicopter. The company hopes the final version will be able to operate autonomously, able to drop off divers and then return to a mothership , sea base , or other preset location automatically, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6TLU6xCxeQg It’s the same sort of logic behind the HSP Technologies’ Hypersub , which the U.S. Marine Corps evaluated in April 2017. However, this craft has a much slower top speed on the surface, just 30 miles per hour, than what SubSea looks to be aiming for with its DDU. So far, SubSea doesn’t appear to have attracted any consumers and its craft is still very much in the prototype phase. It built the initial version in 2016 and had successfully tested it on the surface earlier in 2017. The company then began submerged trials ahead of the annual Defense and Security Equipment International (DESI) exhibition, which began on Sept. 12, 2017 in London, England, according to IHS Jane’s . It remains to be seen if the company can generate interest in a military version or if the final version might end up a plaything for billionaire oligarchs who are looking for something new to add to their fleets of private mega yachts and submarines.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Watch Never Before Seen Clips of Chinook Helicopters Supporting SEAL Team Six Overseas,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dust swirls as military helicopters come in to land and pick up troops and their vehicles from nondescript fields. To the untrained eye, the grainy video clips may not seem particularly noteworthy. But what you’re looking at is an especially rare glimpse of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command in action in Afghanistan. Ed Darack, a writer and photographer who has spent time in both Iraq and Afghanistan embedded with infantry and aviation units released this never before seen footage to accompany his new book, The Final Mission of Extortion 17 . The work builds off an earlier article in Air & Space Magazine focusing on the infamous crash of a CH-47D with the callsign “Extortion 17” in Afghanistan in 2011, but goes above and beyond to provide previously unknown details about the U.S. military’s controversial kill-or-capture missions targeting so-called “high value individuals” in the country. For those who might not be familiar with the story, on Aug. 6, 2011, Taliban insurgents shot down the CH-47 piloted by members of the Colorado Army National Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 135th Aviation Regiment during a raid to nab Qari Tahir in the Tangi Valley of Afghanistan’s Wardak province. At the time, the helicopter, assigned to an element known as “Extortion Company,” was carrying a quick reaction for of U.S. Navy SEALs from the famous Naval Special Warfare Development Group, better known as SEAL Team Six. The incident, which came three months after another raid into Pakistan led to the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, resulted in the deaths of 38 American personnel, along with a military working dog. It was and still is the single worst loss of life the U.S. military has suffered in more than 15 years of fighting in Afghanistan. Many have pored over the event and it has become the subject of a number of conspiracy theories. Darack’s 2015 feature article is a great primer on the actual facts of the case. His book goes into further detail about the circumstances that led up to the shoot down and provides immense detail about how the Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, has operated over the course of America’s longest war , gleaned from research and interviews with sources closely involved in the operations. The first of his two videos, seen above, shows a pair of the CH-47D Chinooks from Extortion Company arriving to pick up members of SEAL Team Six after another raid in Logar Province in 2011. According to a captioned still in his book, you can briefly see the target of the raid in custody before the clip cuts to the special operators loading their all terrain vehicles and specially modified motorcycles onto one of the Chinooks. This was a mission by what was known as the “Logar Set,” which included two task forces, Task Force Red and Blue, also known as Team Darby and Team Logar respectively. Task Force Blue consisted of SEAL Team Six operators and Air Force special tactics combat controllers from the 24th Special Tactics Squadrons. Task Force Red substituted the SEALs with troops from the Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment. The units would also work with Afghanistan equally secretive and elite Ktah Khas battalion and received aviation support from Extortion Company. “They would take turns,” one of Darack’s sources explained, according to his book. “One night Darby would conduct a raid, with Logar remaining behind to handout as an immediate reaction force if needed. Then Logar would do a raid, with Darby standing by as an immediate reaction force.” When Extortion 17 went down, Logar was acting as the supporting force, while Darby had taken the lead on grabbing Qari Tahir. Though special purpose MH-47 Chinooks from the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment supported many special operations activities in Afghanistan, the conventional Task Force Knighthawk,help ease the strain on those crews and worked with JSOC in Logar Province. Though this may seem odd that National Guard personnel would work with America’s most elite forces, 2nd Battalion, 135th Aviation actively trains to support special operations missions, as well as other unique contingencies at home and around the world. It’s the successor to earlier National Guard special operations helicopter elements, including the 45th Aviation Battalion and the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation Regiment, both formerly part of the Oklahoma National Guard. As seen in Darack’s second and less action-packed video clip, JSOC did make good use of the 160th’s MH-47s, as well. JSOC continues to operate in Afghanistan and the majority of its missions remain as secretive as ever, but thanks to Darack’s book we now have a much better understanding of its operations and the fate of Extortion 17. Editor’s note: Ed Darack has been nice enough to pen a special guest piece about the Chinook’s exploits in Afghanistan that will run next week, so stay tuned for that.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though ISIS has shown itself to be more than capable of developing new forms of improvised weaponry, including the use of small armed drones , it continues to rely heavily on old standbys such as roadside bombs, which remain a serious threat to the U.S.-led coalition and its partners in Iraq and Syria. Photos made available by The Associated Press show the situation in Syria became serious enough that the U.S. Army sent in conventional combat engineers, also known as sappers, with specialized mine clearing vehicles to help clear of hazards for American special operators and the forces they’re advising. On July 26, 2017, photographer Hussein Malla spotted a convoy of Americans moving along a road toward Raqqa. The markings on the vehicles identified them as a route clearance team from the 3rd Engineer Battalion, an element of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. In December 2016, the Army announced the brigade was heading for a rotation in Kuwait “in support of combatant commander mission requirements,” which apparently included looking for improvised explosive devices in Syria. The procession of American troops Malla observed included two M1270 Medium Mine Protected Vehicles , two M1231 Huskies , and an M1272 Buffalo . All three are part of what the Army calls the Mine Protection Vehicle Family and are associated with route clearing operations and it is a standard organization. The M1270s provide security and help spot objects of interest, while the M1231 and the M1272 assist in clearing any actual bombs. In addition to the combat engineers, bomb-sniffing dog teams, explosive ordnance disposal personnel, medics, aviation support, and special operations and intelligence personnel can all aid in the operations, though none appeared to be present in the pictures. The convoy did not appear to be conducting actual clearance activities at the time and may have been on the move to support operations inside Raqqa and we don’t know how long they stayed in Syria or if they are still in the country. A portion of the American convoy near Raqqa in July 2017, two M1270s and an M1272 Buffalo in between., AP Photo/Hussein Malla Here is a video of a route clearing operations in Afghanistan in 2014 that show these various vehicles and associated personnel at work: As the threat to American troops from improvised explosive devices grew in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 2000s, the Army began to expand its own dedicated route clearing elements and acquired a variety of unique and purpose-built vehicles to support the mission. These purchases included armored trucks with v-shaped hulls to deflect explosive blasts, many of which would become more commonly associated with the separate Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) program. The M1270 is a variant of the South African-designed RG-31 Mk 5E mine-protected vehicle, a variant of the original RG-31 with a longer chassis offering more room for passengers and cargo. One of the vehicles had a remote controlled turret on top that would allow the crew to engage enemy forces from within the safety of the truck. The other had a conventional manned turret, but carried an electro-optical sensor turret on a telescoping mast, which allows specialists to investigate potential hazards from a safe distance. One of the convoy’s M1270s with its mast-mounted sensor turret., AP Photo/Hussein Malla Neither of the two M1270s had an optional remotely operated arm that can help shift debris and other objects to expose potential mines and roadside bombs. They did have special “net” armor to offer additional protection against rocket propelled grenades and other light anti-armor weapons. The shaped charges in many anti-tank rounds need to detonate a certain distance from the target to be most effective. The high tensile webbing “catches” the rounds, setting them off early or preventing them from going off at all. The M1272, another mine-resistant vehicle derived from a South African design, does have the “interrogator arm,” as well as short-range video cameras so troops can observe the work from safely inside the vehicle.  The sides of the Buffalo near Raqqa were shielded behind fixed “slat” armor, which serves the same purpose as the netting on the M1270s. The last vehicle in the convoy, the Husky, is yet another design of South African origin, and is perhaps the most unique one in the entire Mine Protection Vehicle Family. Officially described as a “tractor,” crews can fit the M1231 with a wide array of different mine-detecting sensors. It has exceptionally low ground pressure, which allows it to drive straight over mines that would detonate under the weight of many other vehicles. The 3rd’s Husky in Syria carried what the Army calls the Husky Mounted Detection System, a powerful ground-penetrating radar that can detect buried objects. Once the system spots a potential threat, the operator can activate a separate system to mark the spot with a bright dye. Once again, slat armor protected the driver from the danger of light anti-tank rockets. One of the Huskies near Raqqa., AP Photo/Hussein Malla All of the vehicles in the convoy had jamming devices to prevent terrorists from remotely detonating any improvised weapons and otherwise scramble their operation. We don’t know how well these electronic defenses would be against other trigging methods, including motion-sensor activated booby traps that U.S.-support forces had encountered within Raqqa itself. But their presence in Syria in July 2017 does underscore reports that ISIS’ defenses in and around the city had been hard for the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to counter on their own. At that time, these elements had already been fighting to dislodge the terrorists from their de facto capital for more than a month. A US soldier wearing the insignia of the 1st Cavalry Division, stands guard as the convoy moves along a road near Raqqa., AP Photo/Hussein Malla Earlier that month, witnesses near Raqqa spotted a convoy of trucks carrying mine-resistant trucks specifically associated with American special operations forces. Also present were bulldozers, which have been another key component in defeating ISIS’ improvised explosive devices, including massive suicide car bombs. It’s also been important to keep the supply lines to and from the front lines open. Observers often spot trucks carrying armored vehicles and other equipment moving around northern Syria in support of the SDF’s operations. U.S. artillery units in particular appear to run regular logistics convoys between various temporary bases and their forward positions in order to keep up their vital fire support missions. “I’d like to reiterate that once you reach this type of urban environment, this type of urban combat, progress becomes – it comes by building by building and block by block,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the top spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, said during a briefing to reporters on Sept. 7, 2017. “And this is a very deliberate process and requires great care to also avoid collateral damage and harm to noncombatants.” And while conventional troops have been supporting U.S. military operations in Syria for some time , the Army engineers being so close to the front lines is also notable. The U.S. military has repeatedly stressed its personnel in the country are not involved in combat, but this proximity to the front lines can only increase the risk of them becoming directly involved in the fighting, as well as becoming further embroiled in the complicated political situation , as we at The War Zone have noted many times in the past. “We cannot determine the time period in which the battle of Raqqa will end precisely because war has its conditions,” Nowruz Ahmed, a member of the SDF’s general command overseeing the Raqqa operations, told Reuters in August 2017. “But we do not expect it to last long, and according to our plans the battle will not take longer than two months from now.” Until then, both U.S. conventional and special operations forces will undoubtedly continue to provide a wide range of support to the SDF, including keep important routes clear of obstacles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 4, 2019",US-Backed Forces and Syrian Troops Get Dangerously Close in Deir ez-Zor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the threat of ISIS continues to recede in Syria, there’s a scramble on between U.S.-backed and pro-Syrian government factions to secure control of the country’s eastern desert regions ahead of whatever conflict or negotiated settlement comes next. At the same time, the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad , along with his Russian and Iranian allies and their proxies, continue to consolidate their respective positions to the west. On Sept. 9, 2017, the top U.S. military command leading the fight against ISIS, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), announced that the American-backed Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC), a component of the larger Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), had launched its long planned offensive into Deir ez-Zor governorate, also written Dayr Az Zawr. This came after the Assad regime and its Russian partners declared they had broken the siege of the province’s capital of the same name and were continuing to clear the terrorists from the surrounding area on Sept. 5, 2017. The terrorists had surrounded the strategic city since April 2014. Flashpoint in Dei ez-Zor “The multi-ethnic SAC is a battle-tested, proven partner force in the Coalition’s fight to defeat ISIS in northern Syria,” CJTF-OIR said in their official statement. “Coalition forces will support the SAC during the Khabur River valley offensive as part of their ‘advise and assist’ mission, providing equipment, training, intelligence and logistics support, precision fires and battlefield advice.” The press release made no mention of the nearby Syrian or Russian forces, or their associated militias, or any potential risks of the SAC and their coalition advisers coming into contact with these parties. An official correction, which came along with a second Email highlighting the change in language, effectively underscored the complexities and potential dangers of having the two separate and distinct operations uncoordinated in such close proximity. “The draft indicated that anti-Syrian regime forces are marching to Dawyr Az Zawyr,” U.S. Army Colonel Thomas Veale, CJTF-OIR’s director of public affairs, explained, while using yet another different spelling of the governorate’s name. “This is not the case. What our partners are calling ‘Operation Jazeera Storm’ is, in fact, an operation to clear the Khabur River valley north of Dawyr Az Zawyr, and not into Dawyr Az Zawyr itself.” This is not a small issue. The United States insists its only interest in Syria is defeating ISIS and that it is only supporting local groups in this pursuit. It has severed ties or otherwise distanced itself from factions that have disregarded this mission in favor of attacking the regime or other groups in Syria, including Turkish forces and their allied militias. The official message seems clear, that the U.S. military has ceded the actual city of Deir ez-Zor to the Syrian government. American officials claim to have assurances from the SAC that after it defeats ISIS in areas north of the provincial capital, the group will turn over control to local civilian authorities, but there was no indication if these councils would be loyal to the central government in Damascus, the SAC, or other independent actors. “Once the Khabur River valley is cleared of ISIS, the SAC states the region will be turned over to representative bodies of local civilians who will then oversee security and governance as with Tabqa and Manbij ,” CJTF-OIR’s revised press release explained. “The SAC is operating along two corridors, and the local citizens and non-combatants in those areas are evacuating northward to SAC-controlled safe areas.” Through its on again-off again hotline with the Russians, the U.S.-led coalition has working to “ deconflict ” the situation before any dangerous mistakes occur. As ISIS position weakens, it may be increasingly difficult to keep the SAC and other U.S.-support factions focused, too. Conflicting agendas Both the Pentagon and the State Department have stressed that the United States has little interest in Syria beyond defeating the terrorists, but neither has elaborated on what will happen to the local groups it has been working with, many of whom have significant grievances with Assad and his allies, in the long term. It’s very possible that the Pentagon was motivated in its decision to let the SAC move into Deir ez-Zor, something it had just weeks earlier suggested was off the table until the SDF had liberated the city of Raqqa to the north, in no small part because of concerns that the rebels might decide to move in on their own, as well as a desire to check the rapid advances of Assad and his benefactors. As it stands now, the U.S. military has communicated to the Russians that their forces, along with the Syrians and the Iranians, need to stay west of the Euphrates River and the SAC keep to other bank. But it looks as if the two sides will move right to the edge of this boundary, well within striking distance of each other, raising concerns about mistake and miscalculations by both coalitions. “As most of you know, there is a deconfliction line that runs south of Tabqa and goes all the way across – somewhat parallel – irregularly, but parallel to the Euphrates River, so that we can maintain our focus, both the Russians and the regime and the coalition and the SDF, on defeating ISIS,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon explained to reporters during a press conference on Sept. 7, 2017. “We will continue to deconflict and, as necessary and as required, we’ll continue to draw a – that line, if you will, further on down the Middle Euphrates River Valley, if necessary.” However, in the past, we’ve seen that the message doesn’t always filter down to Iranian-backed pro-Assad militias, which has led to violent skirmishes in the past near the town of At Tanf . There’s no indication that the Syrian government has acquiesced to the idea that it cannot continue to exercise its sovereignty all the way to the border with Iraq, regardless of the presence of American troops, which it says are illegally operating in the country anyways. Syrian Arab Army troops link up with their comrades in Deir ez-Zor in September 2017. , Михаил Алаеддин/Sputnik  via AP The convoy in the desert There’s also a limit to what the United States can reasonably do if it truly intends to adhere to its stated policy of focusing exclusively on ISIS in Syria. Nowhere has this has been more apparent than with regards to a beleaguered convoy of ISIS fighters and their families, which is presently stranded in the desert west of the city of Deir ez-Zor. This bizarre situation is a microcosm of the increasing absurdity of Syria’s multi-faceted conflict. In August 2017, Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah cut a deal with ISIS fighters near the border with Lebanon that allowed them safe passage east in exchange for the bodies of members of the group, as well as Lebanese troops, who had gotten captured during fighting in the area. A still image of the buses waiting to take ISIS fighters east, taken from a video the Syrian government released of the event., Syrian Central Military Media, via AP The arrangement had the approval of the Assad government and the tacit support of the Lebanese government, but was rejected out of hand by the U.S.-led coalition – which includes Lebanon. American aircraft promptly bombed roads and bridges to hamper the convoy’s progress. Unable to attack the buses themselves for fear of killing innocent women and children, the United States has instead monitored its status and attacked any ISIS fighters that attempt to make contact with it. Someone has been supplying food and water to the stranded travelers, but CJTF-OIR said it was not directly involved in this humanitarian effort even as it allowed the care packages to reach the convoy. The U.S. government then received criticism for stepping aside and temporarily stopping its surveillance of the convoy as a Syrian government military contingent, supported by Russian forces, including aircraft, moved through the area, bypassing the ISIS members on their way to Deir ez-Zor. Realistically, it could have been no other way, since the American-led coalition has stressed its unwillingness to challenge or engage the regime directly for any other reason than immediate self defense. All of this only underscores the increasing difficulty the United States is having operating in Syria as it tries to crush ISIS, but stay removed from the country’s ongoing civil war. The American-backed coalition seems to have all but conceded that Assad has solidified his position in the eastern coastal regions with the help of Russia and the Iran. Sensing the changing nature of the situation, U.S. government partners in the region have increasingly begun to exploring working with Assad, or at least his foreign allies. In August 2017, Russian troops even moved into the northeastern town of Afrin after striking a deal with the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, who also form the core of the U.S.-supported SDF. Turkey, who sees the YPG as a dangerous terrorist group, has also been coordinating with the Kremlin about potential deconfliction zones in northern Syria. An Israeli Air Force F-16I Soufa multi-role combat jet., Israeli Air Force Israel’s role Israel, which is concerned about Iran’s increased influence in the region, has been the only one to consistently challenge the developments in Syria’s more stable eastern provinces. Earlier in September 2017, Israeli aircraft reportedly attacked the Syrian Scientific Studies and Researchers Center in Masyaf, as well as nearby warehouses containing short-range ballistic missiles. This entity is responsible for Syria’s chemical and ballistic missile programs , as well as other advanced military research. The attack, which Israel has refused to confirm it conducted, was actually on the 10 year anniversary of a similar Israeli strike on a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. “The strike reported last night is not routine,” retired Israeli Air Force General Amos Yadlin, who previously served as the head of the Israel Defense Force’s Military Intelligence Directorate, wrote on Twitter after the attack. He dismissed the idea that anyone should see the operation as an extension of earlier Israeli interventions during the Syrian civil war, which mainly sought to disrupt arms deliveries to Hezbollah. “It targeted a Syrian military-scientific center for the development and manufacture of, among other things, precision missiles, which will have a significant role in the next round of conflict,” he continued. “The attack sent 3 important messages: 1. Israel won’t allow for empowerment and production of strategic arms. 2. Israel intends to enforce its redlines despite the fact that the great powers are ignoring them. 3. The presence of Russian air defense does not prevent airstrikes attributed to Israel.” The last two points are especially important. U.S. President Barack Obama has received widespread criticism for threatening to intervene if Assad crossed the “red line” and continued to use of chemical weapons against his own people. He eventually backed down from that position, ostensibly in order not to upset parallel negotiations with Iran over its controversial nuclear program. Separately, in August 2017, Russia announced it had formally linked its considerable air defenses in Syria with those of the country’s government. Many, including us at The War Zone, interpreted this as an attempt to establish deterrent to any future international interventions against Assad. For their parts, Syria and Russia appear to have contented themselves to lodge formal protests and criticize Israel’s actions, without any apparent intent to retaliate in the near term. That being said, the Russian contingent in the country did expand air defense capabilities yet again on Sept. 13, 2017, with the deployment of advanced MiG-29SMT fighter jets to its base in Latakia governorate . The MiG-29SMTs join an already capable force that includes Su-27SM3, Su-30, Su-35S Flanker fighter variants, Su-34 Fullback multi-role combat aircraft, as well as Su-24 Fencer and Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft. On the ground, Russian troops operate an array of additional defenses, including the S-300 and S-400 long range surface-to-air missiles, the Pantsir-S1 air defense system, and associated radars. In addition to their functional purpose, the MiG-29SMTs add to to an already diverse mix of aircraft that is in line with Russia’s publicly stated desire to show off as much of its top of the line military hardware in action as possible. Vladimir Putin has described the Syrian conflict as a “ priceless ” testing ground for tactics and equipment. Still, beyond just just being an arms show, having all of these assets in place will definitely be an important factor for the Syrians and their allies as the conflict evolves into its next phase, whatever that is. How well they deter outside attacks, including those from Israel, will also be a significant indication of things to come, as Yadlin noted. A Hezbollah militant sits in an all terrain vehicle along the Syria-Lebanon border., AP Photo/Bilal Hussein What comes next in Syria “Iran, which wishes to establish a foothold on our border, is flooding the area with lethal arms and an ideology which is no less lethal,” Israeli Army Major General Herzl Halevi, the present head of the IDF’s military intelligence arm, said during a memorial ceremony after the reported Syria strike, though he declined to speak directly about the attack. “The IDF is working to keep the war back, and prepare for it.” While the United States continues to say that it wants to stay out of the broader conflict brewing in the region, Israel seems consistent in its opposition to expanding Iranian influence and Tehran’s apparent desire for a stable, over-land route between its territory and Syria, by way of Iraq. With the Israelis apparently able to act as spoilers in any potential final settlement, it remains to be seen how well the U.S. government will be able to avoid the larger implications of the fighting as time goes on. “As far as Syria is concerned, we have very little to do with Syria other than killing ISIS,” President Trump insisted on Sept. 7, 2017 during a shared press conference with Kuwaiti Emir Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah. “What we do is we kill ISIS, and we have succeeded in that respect.” However, it seems like the United States is only getting closer to having to make a decision about whether or not this holds true even after the terrorist group ceases to be a significant threat.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",B-52s Are Back In The Skies Of Afghanistan Dropping Bombs Once Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s iconic B-52 Stratofortress bomber has been flying continuous missions over Afghanistan for months, as the American aerial campaign in the country expands in the face of resurgent and emerging threats , including Taliban insurgents and ISIS-linked terrorists. The flights have been part of an existing surge in air support as the service says it is still looking at how best to contribute to President Donald Trump’s new U.S. strategy for the region. Since March 2017, the B-52s, or BUFFs, have dropped more than 800 individual weapons on Taliban, Al Qaeda, and ISIS-K targets in support of U.S. forces and the NATO-led coalition, U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), the top Air Force command for operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, told The War Zone in an Email. This works out to an average of approximately 150 bombs dropped every month. ISIS-K, or ISIS-Khorasan, is the terrorist group’s franchise in Afghanistan, which first appeared in January 2015. The bombers had already been striking at the main body of the organization in Iraq and Syria from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar since April 2016. At the time of writing, AFCENT’s public affairs office had not yet responded to a query about what specific types of weapons the bombers had been dropping in Afghanistan. In sorties against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the BUFFs have been carrying a mixture of 500-pound class GBU-38/B and 2,000 GBU-31/B GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). These have been among the Air Force’s most commonly employed weapons in Afghanistan for close air support and other missions, according to an official presentation from earlier in 2017. A B-52 prepares to depart Al Udeid Air Base on a mission against ISIS terrorists in June 2017., USAF In addition to directly attacking targets, the aircraft can provide limited surveillance capabilities thanks to the infrared camera in its Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod. The bombers can drop inert bombs full of propaganda leaflets to help with psychological warfare missions , as well. Regardless of the particular weapons they’ve employed, the aging B-52s have been able to use their large bomb load, long range, and ability to orbit the battlefield for extended periods, even when flying all the way from Qatar, to their advantage over Afghanistan. The bombers have reportedly carried as many as 30 bombs, which would require the use of upgrades to their bomb bays that allows the aircraft to carry precision guided munitions internally. “In essence, if we had 30 targets, we could hit 30 targets,” U.S. Air Force Major General James Hecker, who runs the coalition air war in Afghanistan, told Air Force Magazine in an interview earlier in 2017. “It gives us a fairly large capability.” Still, the distance, along with a lack of tankers situated within or in the immediate vicinity of the country, does impact the regularity of these operations. As of June 2017, the bombers were flying an average of just one mission a week, according to Air Force Magazine. A B-52 sits at Al Udeid Air Base in June 2017., USAF This hasn’t prevented the BUFFs from contributing to the most intensive month of U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan in five years. In August 2017, American aircraft released more than 500 weapons in total over the country, according to official statistics . This was the most since August 2012, when the figure reached almost 600. After a sharp decline following the transition of the NATO-led mission from combat to advisory functions in January 2015, these numbers have been steadily rising since earlier in 2017. The increase does coincide with the reappearance of the B-52s over Afghanistan, but it is unclear just how significant the appearance of the bombers has been to the overall operation. This broad uptick also included the first ever combat drop of the so-called “ Mother of All Bombs ” on ISIS-K fighters in April 2017. Beyond their large payloads and other capabilities, the lumbering BUFFs may have intangible benefits, as well, having been an important component of the U.S. military’s early operations in Afghanistan starting after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The bombers played a key and visible role in driving the Taliban from power and chasing the militants and their Al Qaeda allies into the mountains. The aircraft notably carpet bombed enemy positions in the mountains around Tora Bora in December 2001. In June 2017, ISIS-K took control of the area , which had once served as a base of operations for Osama Bin Laden. The Air Force reportedly stopped routinely employing the B-52s over Afghanistan in 2005, but some additional missions appear to have occurred in the subsequent years, as well. During 2016, the bombers briefly flew a number of missions specifically targeting ISIS-K before another apparent halt. At this time, AFCENT has not yet responded to a request for more information about when the bomber flights ended before they resumed in March 2017. A B-52 head out for a mission over Afghanistan in 2006., USAF In addition, the sporadic nature of the new missions seems to have led to some additional confusion about their present use in the country. After President Trump announced his new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia in August 2017, the U.S. military as a whole began reviewing possible options for expanding their operations. Requests for more air support have been a common theme in those deliberations. Later in August 2017, The Washington Post , citing unnamed officials, said that this could include the deployment of additional F-16 Viper fighter jets , A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft, or additional support from the B-52s in Qatar, or some combination of these assets. Earlier in September 2017, Afghanistan’s Khaama Press reported that the country’s defense ministry had responded positively to the news. Specifically, Defense Ministry spokesperson Mohammad Radmanish “said the return of bomber aircrafts could play a key role in eliminating the militants,” despite the B-52s having already been flying overhead for almost six months at that time. Of course, it is entirely possible that there was some confusion in translation or another error in paraphrasing his Radmanish’s statements. The Air Force itself has played down the significant of any potential changes, insisting it is still reviewing its available options. In an interview with Military.com , Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein said that the total number of air strikes in Afghanistan “remained steady” despite the increase in the total number of weapons that the aircraft actually employed. “I don’t think you’re going to see it change that much,” Goldfein said. “We’ve never come back. We’ve been engaged in Afghanistan the entire time.” A B-52 touches down at Al Udeid in April 2016., USAF But given the visible trend, it seems almost guaranteed that additional air power in some form will be a core component of any new surge of operations in Afghanistan. Whether or not additional air strikes or other increases in the U.S. military posture in the country will be able to change the existing dynamic in the country is another matter entirely . While serving as the top intelligence officer for the NATO-led coalition and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Major General Mark Quantock once “used the term ‘Afghan Condition’ to describe circumstances in Afghanistan culture that restrict or limit their progress,” according to a Department of Defense Inspector General report we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. “The Afghan condition includes high illiteracy rates, internal language barriers, gender inequality, tribal or family influences, corruption, and security concerns.” While dropping more bombs might keep Taliban insurgents and ISIS-K terrorists at bay temporarily, these are the issues that will continue to make or break the chances of any real resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 16, 2019",The South Koreans Want Kim Jong Un to Live in Fear of “Decapitation”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea, as well as its American allies, appear to be actively preparing to attack North Korean premier Kim Jong Un and his top associates in a “decapitation strike,” or at least they want the reclusive regime to think that’s what they’re doing. This strategy of trying to hobble the government in Pyongyang by making its members fear for their lives is one that may or not pay off and will play into the propaganda coming out of North Korea that routinely accuses its enemies of planning a preemptive attack. On Sept. 4, 2017, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo suggested the country’s military might create a new special operations element specifically for the task of hunting down North Korean regime members in the event of a crisis. The unit would reportedly work closely with American counterparts training for the same mission, as part of the secretive Operations Plan 5015 . Earlier in 2017, the Pentagon denied a report that the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, better known as SEAL Team Six, was in the country training for these potential targeted raids. “We are in the process of conceptualizing the plan,” Song explained in response to a question from lawmakers about how the South Korean could figuratively decapitate the Kim government, according to The Korea Herald . “I believe we can create the unit by Dec. 1 and have it become operational.” A separate report by The New York Times said that a brigade-sized unit, known as The Spartan 3000, would form the bulk of this force. The 2,000 to 4,000 member strong force would be able to quickly infiltrate into North Korea in the dead of night using a variety of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, not unlike the North Korean military’s own plans to launch massive commando raids using its fleet of aging An-2 biplanes. South Korean Army Special Forces rappel from a helicopter during a training exercise., ROK Ministry of National Defense The South Korean Marine Corps had previously formed a rapid-reaction organization with this name in March 2016, but it was unclear how the two were related to each other. This element had the ability to reach anywhere on the Peninsula within 24 hours, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported at the time. Their main mission would be destroying key targets in North Korea during an actual conflict, but would also be on standby in case of other contingencies, including natural disasters. “In the past, the battalion-level unit took 24 hours to be deployed across the Korean Peninsula, while the regimental-level unit took 48 hours,” an anonymous South Korean official explained, according to Yonhap. “However, the new unit will be able to operate within 24 hours even at the regimental level.” South Korean Marines during a training exercise., ROK Ministry of National Defense The specialized Marine unit had also come into existence near the end of the tenure of South Korean President Park Geun-hye, a conservative hardliner known for her tough stance against North Korea. After North Korea’s fifth nuclear weapons test in September 2016, she oversaw the establishment of a three level response plan for future provocations from the regime in Pyongyang. The first operational concept was a preemptive attack on missile- and nuclear-related sites called “Kill Chain,” primarily involving air, ship, shore-launched missiles, such as the domestically produced Hyunmoo-2 ground-launched ballistic missile and the German-Swedish built Taurus KEPD 350 air-launched cruise missile. South Korea would put this plan into action if satellites and other intelligence systems detected an imminent threat. The South Korean government plans to launch five spy satellites between 2021 and 2023 and could rent commercial-grade space-based assets in the meantime. In addition, the country’s military is in the process of buying a number of long-range, high altitude RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones. To help make up for any gaps in the meantime, South Korea could no doubt make use of information sharing arrangements with the United states, which heavily monitors North Korea . The second component was the establishment of an air and missile defense shield, known as Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD), focused on defeating any incoming North Korean ballistic missile barrage. Lastly, there was a plan for a massive retaliatory strike, dubbed Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR), mainly targeting Pyongyang in the event of a nuclear strike. South Korean F-15K multi-role combat jets., ROK Ministry of Defense It would seem that the special operations brigade would be a complement to the Kill Chain preemptive strike, striking at senior leadership before or as they attempted to launch an attack. However, The New York Times says South Korean expects to integrate it with the KMPR operation. In December 2016, South Korea’s National Assembly impeached Park over abuses of power. Moon Jae-in, head of the country’s more liberal Democratic Party, won the subsequent election and observers initially posited he might seek a rapprochement with North Korea. After months of missile tests and a sixth nuclear weapons experiment, likely involving a hydrogen bomb , Moon has continued the military buildup in support of the three operational plans. On Sept. 5, 2017, just a day after Defense Minister Song revealed the decapitation force plans, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he would push for the sale of “a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States” to both South Korea and Japan. He did not specify what might be in any future arms deals, but it seems likely that the government in Seoul would be interested in purchasing systems to support its three-tier response plans, possibly including ballistic missile defense systems such as the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense missiles, as well as more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters . I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2017 More importantly, Trump also voiced a willingness to end American opposition to South Korea designing larger warheads for its ballistic missiles. At present, a U.S.-South Korean deal sets the maximum weight at approximately 1,100 pounds. There was no word on whether the new arrangement would expand the range restrictions in the existing pact, but South Korea is already developing a version on its Hyunmoo-2 missile that can reach anywhere inside North Korea . On top of that, authorities in Seoul have released video footage of these weapons, as well as KEPD 350 cruise missiles, penetrating mock underground bunkers, similar to those the Kim regime has built to defend itself. For his part, the American president has repeatedly said that he feels talking with North Korea is not useful . Even after the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to hit the reclusive country with a new and even harsher round of sanctions on Sept. 12, 2017, Trump was dismissive. The new restrictions limited the amount of oil the country could import, banned it from exporting textiles, put new limitations on its citizens working abroad, and trimmed back allowable foreign investments, technology transfers, and other economic cooperation arrangements. “We think it’s just another very small step – not a big deal,” Trump said during a shared press conference with the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak on the same time. “I don’t know if it has any impact. … But those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.” North Korean premier Kim Jong Un., KCNA So, whether or not anyone is laying any actual groundwork for a decapitation attack on North Korea, it seems clear that both South Korea and its American allies want it to appear this way. There is a clear belief that forcing Kim and his closest colleagues to constantly fear for their safety will limit their ability to conduct day-to-day activities related to weapons research or anything else. “Kim is so engrossed with collecting information about the ‘decapitation operation’ through his intelligence agency,” South Korean Representative Lee Cheol-woo, a member of the opposition Liberty Party of Korea, told The Korea Herald after a briefing from a member of the country’s National Intelligence Service in June 2017. “The number of Kim Jong-un’s public activities was 51, a 32 percent decrease from last year,” Lee said the NIS official had explained. Whether or not the threats have really prompted Kim to avoid a significant number of public engagements is unclear. There do appear to be increased sightings of possible body doubles though, including at least two individuals with similar haircuts and suits who joined the North Korean leader during the second test of the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 28, 2017. 「火星ー14」ICBM発射の報道。 #北朝鮮 #NorthKorea pic.twitter.com/RG8MFnQZE8 — Tarao Goo⭐︎にゃんだふる (@GreatPoppo) July 29, 2017 But even if it is working, there is danger the plan could ultimately backfire. North Korea’s propaganda has for years claimed that the United States and its South Korean allies are secretly preparing an invasion, a trend that started well before Kim Jong Un took power. Fueling a debilitating paranoia seems to be the immediate goal, but it’s might not ultimately have the desired outcome, especially if Kim comes to believe that there is an immediate danger to his regime that requires some sort of direct action. The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway recently summed up this volatile situation in a larger piece examining what options the U.S. government and its partners realistically had when responding to North Korea, writing : The President [of the United States, Donald Trump,] learned the hard way that bellicose rhetoric does nothing but encourage North Korea to redouble their weapons development efforts and to lash out in an escalating manner. It also works to help validate their own propaganda and innate paranoia. So where do we go from here? Kim Jong Un clearly has a plan as to what he aims to accomplish. Some say it is to create a grand bargaining chip, others say it is to establish a credible nuclear deterrent, while some even argue Kim has even darker goals in mind. Regardless of what his end game actually is, it primarily involves the survival of his regime. In short, the South Korean plan, with obvious American backing seems to be to hobble the North Korean regime’s capacity to function, but while threatening that which it holds most dear, its very existence. This might have made sense when South Korea devised its three prong strategy in 2016. Since then, its opponents to the north have demonstrated a workable ICBM and a very real looking hydrogen bomb to put on top of it, as well as a host of other increasingly capable ballistic missile types . The number of targets that South Korean troops and their American allies that would fall into a “must destroy” category during even a limited decapitation operation is only going up. Kim Jong Un inspects an apparent hydrogen bomb., KCNA Kim has to know this and it’s undoubtedly driving, at least in part, his push to demonstrate increasingly advanced threats and build more of the ones he already has ready to go. If his goal is truly regime survival, then there’s no incentive not to use all of the weapons available in response to any perceived attempt to remove him from power. “The best deterrence we can have, next to having our own nukes, is to make Kim Jong-un fear for his life,” Shin Won-sik, a retired general who served as the top operational strategist in South Korea’s military told The New York Times . “In the medieval system like North Korea, Kim Jong-un’s life is as valuable as hundreds of thousands of ordinary people whose lives would be threatened in a nuclear attack.” For this to work, both South Korea and the United States will have to walk a very fine line, so as to keep Kim guessing what might happen to him, but not push him to launch his own preemptive strike. It’s a strategy that will require clear and consistent messaging, which we unfortunately have not seen a whole lot of lately.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 4, 2023",Obscure National Guard Spy Plane Assesses Hurricane Harvey’s Aftermath,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, a number of U.S. government agencies, as well as the military and the National Guard, have sent a variety of less well known specialized aircraft to assist in the ongoing recovery efforts , including the RC-26B Condor surveillance aircraft. A product of the controversial war on drugs, and one that almost didn’t come to be, these planes have become an important resource for disaster response missions, as well as tracking drug runners and even terrorists overseas. As of Sept. 11, 2017, there was at least one RC-26B, assigned to the Texas Air National Guard’s 111th Attack Squadron based at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base in Houston, flying missions over impacted areas. The 147th Attack Wing, which controls the 111th, set up an ad hoc command center at the U.S. Coast Guard station in Houston within three days of Harvey slamming into the area to coordinate rescue and reconnaissance efforts, according to the Texas Air National Guard . The 147th’s main aircraft is the MQ-9 Reaper drone. In addition, the Air National Guard had established another element within the federal emergency operations center in Austin to the West, where personnel could “help with the downlink and downfeed from our flying unmanned assets to analyze the data, and present it to the state saying, ‘Here’s the problem set. How are we going to solve this?’” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Scott Rice, director of the Air National Guard, explained in an interview with Military.com. “That’s how we got a lot of people out there to do all those rescues we did.” These procedures, and the deployment of the RC-26B, are part of a well established National Guard playbook for the aftermath of a disaster, natural or otherwise. It’s important in these situations to quickly assess and monitor the situation in order to make sure often limited resources are directed to places where they are most needed and can do the most good. Unfortunately, by the very nature of these situations, it may not be possible to safely check the most seriously impacted areas on the ground. An view of the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey as seen by the sensor operator in an RC-26B. , Texas ANG Based on the Fairchild Swearingen SA-227 Metroliner twin engine turboprop, the five Block 20 RC-26Bs have a sensor turret with both color electro-optical and infrared cameras. Crews can send the full motion video feed to personnel on the ground in near real time via either the U.S. military’s hand held Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) system or the RC-26-specific Dragoon data link. A sample of the infrared imagery the RC-26B can capture with its sensor turret., National Guard Bureau via FOIA According to a 2013 National Guard Incident Awareness and Assessment manual, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, a typical RC-26 “package” would include a single aircraft with a crew of three – pilot, copilot, and sensor operate – along with a ground component, staffed from an Air National Guard intelligence squadron, to man the Dragoon equipment. Lieutenant General Rice told Military.com that personnel were using the Distributed Common Ground Station intelligence sharing network to pass information and video feeds where ever it might need to go, as well. A member of the 111th Attack Squadron monitors operations from their ad hoc operations center in Houston., Texas ANG The Air National Guard has deployed MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft to the disaster response mission as well, but said to Military.com that, at present, manned surveillance planes offered important advantages. Most importantly, in the congested air space in the areas that Harvey hit, the RC-26B crew was better able to “sense and avoid” other aircraft or hazards, which might not be immediately apparent to drone pilots and sensor operators looking through the “ soda-straw ” view from their aircraft’s sensor turret. This may not be the case for long, as both the U.S. military and private industry are steadily improving the ability for pilotless planes and their crews on the ground to detect and dodge potential dangers in flight. That being said, the Block 20 RC-26Bs are limited in how well they can observe the situation down below due to only having having the imagery provided by the similarly narrow view from the turreted cameras. A wide-area aerial surveillance setup with multiple cameras able to quickly gather a much broader scope of imagery would be far more ideal for assessing the destruction left by major disasters like Harvey. Beyond any added situational awareness or the limitations of their sensors, the Condors main benefit is being available and ready to go for domestic emergencies. Primarily tasked with supporting counter-drug efforts, the RC-26Bs rotate around bases in the contiguous United States under the control of National Guard units in various states and governors can easily redirect them to help out after a storm like Hurricane Harvey. In an curious arrangement, the Air National Guard tucks away individual planes within established units like the 147th in Texas, which otherwise fly various types of aircraft, including F-16 fighter jets, KC-135 tankers, C-130 cargo aircraft, and MQ-9 drones. Pre-positioned across the country, the RC-26Bs have been an important and routine part of disaster response missions for years. RC-26Bs deployed to assess and monitor damage after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, helped keep watch during the especially destructive 2007 wildfire season in California, flew over the Midwest during the flooding in 2008 , and participated in the response to the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in 2010, among other incidents. On top of that and in addition to their counter-drug role, the RC-26B fleet, which includes six more Block 25R aircraft that have the ability to locate and listen in on enemy communications, has flown missions tracking terrorists in both Iraq and Afghanistan supporting conventional and special operations forces. Between 2007 and 2013, one of the units flying Condors overseas, the 745th Special Operations Squadron, racked up approximately 46,000 flight hours across more than 10,000 individual sorties. What appears to be a Block 25R RC-26B, lacking the sensor turret underneath the fuselage, in 2013., Jonathan Payne via Wikimedia It’s an impressive resume for a fleet that does not have particularly auspicious beginnings and could easily have succumbed to budget cuts and shortfalls in personnel since their introduction in the 1990s. In 1989, in response to specific requests from units in Texas and California, the Air National Guard initiated the project to convert its existing C-26B aircraft, which had initially served in a variety of administrative and logistics roles, into a counter-drug surveillance aircraft. At the time, Air and Army National Guard units had deployed a hodgepodge of aircraft and “sensors” to support this mission, ranging from RF-4C reconnaissance jets to UH-1H helicopter carrying troops with commercial video and 35mm still cameras. The Air National Guard bought a single Metroliner as a testbed for the conversions, which received the designation UC-26C. A Block 20 RC-26B., USAF In the rush to get the aircraft into operation, the project ran afoul of U.S. military auditors, who concluded the Air National Guard had begun buying planes without properly analyzing whether or not the current mix was adequate or if other, cheaper alternatives existed to the multi-million dollar conversion program. In 1994, the Department of Defense’s Inspector General recommended National Guard officials halt any further purchases and conversions until they had sufficiently answered those questions. The project did ultimately move forward, but with an obtuse arrangement that saw the National Guard pass official ownership of the aircraft to a contractor, Air Cerberus, and place them in the U.S. civilian aircraft register. The planes, then referred to as C-26B(Counter Drug) or C-26B(CD), flew with civilian registrations for a number of years. That the address given to the Federal Aviation Administration for Air Cerberus in some cases was the same as the National Guard Bureau’s headquarters in Virginia has led some to describe the company as a dubiously legal “ front ” and the exact relationship between the two remains unclear. An official “Air Cerberus” logo from the 115th Operations Group, 115th Fighter Wing, Wisconsin Air National Guard., Wisconsin Air National Guard In 2005, the U.S. military formally designated the planes the RC-26B and they eventually transferred back to full military ownership, though contractors remain involved in the maintenance and upkeep of the fleet. Initially, some of the Condors carried a large sensor pod underneath the fuselage, containing a radar imaging sensor, but this appears to have largely given way to the more simplified present Block 20 and 25R configurations. Some of the planes appear to have retained a discreet civilian-style paint scheme as opposed to a military-standard overall gray camouflage, too. An earlier RC-26B configuration with the ventral sensor pod., Air National Guard As of 2017, the Air National Guard had a total of 13 aircraft in the Condor fleet, including two older C-26As that it was planning to modify to a RC-26B standard. In addition, it had outlined plans to convert all the aircraft to a single, common Block 25R+ standard to make the aircraft more flexible. “Split configurations create inefficient aircraft and manpower utilization in addition to the training and planning difficulties brought about by the acute capability differences between aircraft,” the Air National Guard argued in a document outlining its 2017 modernization priorities . The proposed new arrangement would include improved turreted sensors across all the aircraft, upgraded electronics and antenna arrays, and the addition of the U.S. military standard Link-16 data link. The modifications would include specific design decisions to allow personnel or contractors to quickly update software or install new hardware, including newer sensors , to “ensure lasting relevance,” as well. With the one aircraft flying over Texas, and the very likely possibility that other RC-26Bs will be part of the response to the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Florida, the planes already seem to be proving they’re still relevant for a wide variety of missions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the campaign trail and since his election victory, President Donald Trump’s “shoot-from-the-hip” speaking style has made for a number of controversial , dubious , and outright false statements about a number of U.S. military protects. Now, it appears that the U.S. Air Force is slashing key requirements, including mid-air refueling, for its new presidential aircraft, the future Air Force Ones , to try and make good on his claim about cutting the cost of the program by $1 billion. Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber, who has been following this ongoing saga uncovered the new details , as the Air Force tries to match Trump’s boast that he trimmed $1 billion from the program’s still unknown final price tag after an hour of negotiations with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. The president made the comments during a rally in Florida in February 2017 and no one had been able to definitely explain where the specific figure came from . According to Defense One, during their December 2016 meeting, Muilenburg gave trump four separate options for how to go about purchasing the pair of new Air Force Ones, ranging in cost from approximately $4.2 billion to $2.28 billion. “Understandably, all these modifications and customizations, implemented in the appropriately secure facility with all personnel cleared to the highest level, drive considerable cost into the aircraft so as to make Air Force One the ‘flying White House’ it is,” one of the briefly slides reportedly explained. The Air Force subsequently rejected every single one of the plans, including the most expensive, which involved purchasing two new 747-8i aircraft , but only equipping one with the full “presidential cabin configuration.” This makes perfect sense, since the entire point of having two of the planes in the first place is to be able to tight scheduling requirements and an often high operational tempo. With a pair of aircraft, its easier to make sure there’s always one ready to go, especially if one suddenly ends up out of action, which can happen surprisingly easily . Air Force One, with Donald Trump aboard, lands in Germany ahead of the G20 Summit in July 2017., Carsten Rehder/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images But rather than insisting that the design specifications were largely locked down by the unique requirements of Air Force One – namely the need for an airplane that can safely transport the president and his staff in the middle of a doomsday scenario while keeping them in constant, secure contact with the outside world so that the United States government can continue to function throughout – the service has apparently begun trimming capabilities to try and save $1 billion in total costs. The Air Force had already managed to save some money by purchasing a pair of 747-8is that Boeing originally built for a now defunct Russian airline as the base airframes for the presidential conversions. The cost-cutting is continuing and most notably has resulted in plans to strip the aerial refueling capability requirement, which is a feature on the existing VC-25As that presently perform the presidential airlift mission, from the new Air Force Ones. The Air Force downplayed the significance of this decision to Defense One, while the Muilenburg’s briefing pointed out that the standard 787-8i had the range to reach all by some parts of Asia from Washington, D.C. Weisgerber’s sources added that it wasn’t a major problem since “the current aircraft have never made use of that capability.” But that claim appears to be false. In 2014, a former U.S. Air Force boom operator told The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, that he had topped up Air Force One on more than one occasion . One of these instances involved a nighttime link up with the tanker as President George W. Bush traveled to Baghdad, Iraq for a surprise visit in November 2003. An E-4B Nightwatch refuels in mid-air. The two VC-25A Air Force Ones had a similar system., USAF But whether or not Air Force One has had to use the feature shouldn’t be a determining factor. The capability exists specifically in order to make sure the president and his closest advisors do not have to set foot on the ground and expose themselves to a host of potential dangers during a major crisis. Mid-air refueling is essential for the aircraft to be able to play its part in the “continuity of government” mission – which you can read about in depth here – and operate in the most demanding situations, including a nuclear apocalypse. That no president has had to use it would be something to be thankful for, not an excuse to get rid of it. Without an integral aerial refueling system, the president would have to rely on another aircraft, most likely the E-4B Nightwatch airborne command post or a future replacement for it, during an actual emergency. In turn, this would mean that one of these aircraft would have to shadow Air Force One at all times, not just on long-distance trips, or risk having to rendezvous with the president on the ground somewhere, the very kind of scenario the refueling system is there to prevent from ever happening in the first place. At present, during domestic flights, the Air Force usually dispatches one of its secretive C-20C aircraft, but this small business jet sized aircraft is a poor substitute for Air Force One and wouldn’t be able to provide nearly the same capabilities or protection during a major incident, such as a nuclear attack. Aerial refueling gives the president and his staff time to best assess their options. Without it, despite the fact that the 747-8i, with its engines, offers more than 3 hours of additional flight time, the crew would be on a very fixed timetable to figure things out. One also wonders how much the Air Force could really hope to save by omitting this well-established technology. Part of the service’s decision to stick with Boeing and its 747 platform, even as major airlines are increasingly ditching it in favor of more cost-effective aircraft, was that the company was already intimately aware of Air Force One’s highly classified requirements and this existing knowledge relative to the 747 design would save the taxpayer money. On top of gutting the mid-air refueling components, Air Force spokesperson Stefanek told Defense One that the new Air Force Ones would use a commercial grade environmental climate control system and that there had been other modifications to reduce each aircraft’s power requirements. The service’s decision to use an off-the-shelf environmental control system, which would include air filtration and recycling components, for Air Force One seems like it could only carry additional risks. It is reasonable to assume that the present VC-25As have a system purpose built to keep out a range of hazards including chemical and biological agents and nuclear fallout. We can only wonder what else has been left out in order to cut the plane’s power generation needs. When Trump initially took aim at Air Force One’s costs in December 2016, Tyler Rogoway wrote succinctly about the mountain of indispensable requirements and just what was at stake when considering changes to the future presidential aircraft: Pressed into Air Force service, these new aircraft will require a massive amount of systems integration work to be able to handle the job of Air Force One. This includes adapting them to host the most advanced flying communications suite there is, and making them hardened against the electromagnetic pulses given off by exploding nuclear weapons. It will also include building in and testing aerial refueling capabilities, lots of power generation, and integrating a self defense suite made up of the most complex constellation of missile countermeasures found on any aircraft in the world. Not just that, but the aircraft will also be subject to an avalanche of specific requirements, many from emanating from disparate agencies, which will all have to be folded into a single design that will only be replicated two or three times. Finally, the design has to take future expansion and upgradability into account at every turn—an expensive task upfront aimed at saving money down the road. In other words, this is tough and expensive work that has America’s national security relying on it. If Air Force One cannot act as a reliable flying command center, even during a nuclear exchange, the credibility of America’s nuclear deterrent erodes. It also seems worth asking how much the Air Force will ultimately save given the amount of manhours it is apparently expending trying to cut the littlest corners to find that magic $1 billion in savings. Stefanek told Defense One the service is even trying to find cut rate deals on seats and other rudimentary fittings to trim costs. This will be time spent haggling over things that cost tens of thousands of dollars, not hundreds of thousands, let alone millions. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly stands in the doorway of Air Force One during Trump’s visit to Reno, Nevada in August 2017., AP Photo/Alex Brandon Whether the goal itself is worth the effort is debatable from a practical point of view. There’s no real suggestion that Air Force One’s costs were seriously “out of control” as Trump had suggested, especially compared to other ongoing projects , even if there is always a very real possibility for feature creep in defense programs. Shaving a quarter of the cost of the planes might sound nice in general, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the Pentagon’s overall budget, which the Trump Administration insists it wants to increase dramatically anyways. In addition to being a relatively small portion of overall defense spending, Air Force One isn’t one of those things you want to cut just for the sake of cutting, either. If there are reasonable things to eliminate, then by all means they should go. The aerial refueling capability and environmental safety features are hardly superfluous, though. More to the point, adhering to an arbitrary number for purely political reasons, which seems from all accounts to be the real compelling issue for the Air Force here, should never be the motivation when making decisions that could put the president and his successors, who will likely be flying in the new Air Force Ones for decades to come, at unnecessary risk.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019","It’s Official, the USAF’s Next Jamming Plane Will Be a Gulfstream BizJet","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After weathering Congressional backlash and industry protests , the U.S. Air Force has awarded a contract for new jamming aircraft based on the Gulfstream G550 business jet. The decision puts the service on a road to finally replacing the aging, but important EC-130H Compass Call fleet and could prompt an increasing use of similar aircraft for specialized missions throughout the U.S. military. On Sept. 7, 2017, the Air Force confirmed it had signed the long awaited deal with L3 to migrate the Compass Call equipment onto a new plane. As part of the plan, the defense contractor had the authority to choose the final platform, in this case the G550. “After their analysis and sharing that with the program office, L3 has decided to use the Gulfstream 550 Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft as the new platform,” Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said, according to DOD Buzz . “This new Compass Call platform is being referred to as EC-X.” The total value of the project remains unclear, as the contract is a so-called “undefinitized” arrangement that puts L3 to work immediately while it negotiates the final price tag with the Air Force. At present, there is not apparent intention to make significant modifications to the Compass Call capabilities, with the primary goal simply being to move the systems onto a newer aircraft. The basic layout of the G550 Airborne Early Warning aircraft, also known as the Conformal Airborne Early Warning aircraft., Gulfstream The Air Force received the first EC-130H aircraft, based on the C-130H Hercules cargo aircraft, in 1982. Since then, the service has put the 14-aircraft fleet through two major modernization cycles, as well as adding a host of minor improvements. The aircraft’s exact capabilities and nature of the modifications are classified, but Compass Call’s mission is to disrupt enemy communications, radars, and other electronic emitters, both in support of air and ground operations. Most recently, the EC-130Hs have been flying over Iraq scrambling ISIS’ radios and cell phones and possibly preventing improvised explosive devices from going off and knocking down small drones . Since they have the ability to spot and track various signals in order to jam them, the Compass Call system also has the ability to provide limited intelligence on enemy positions and movements. Even before the U.S. military began its campaign against ISIS started in 2014, EC-130Hs had already flown more than 60,000 flight hours in both Iraq and Afghanistan in the preceding decade. A pair of EC-130Hs, along with an EC-130J Commando Solo propaganda plane, at left, at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait in June 2017., USAF Unfortunately, as important as they’ve been, the aircraft are getting older and more difficult to maintain. At one point, the Air Force even considered scrapping half the Compass Call fleet without any immediate plans for a replacement. It then faced opposition from members of Congress over subsequent plans to award a sole-source deal straight to Gulfstream for a new platform, which it referred to in 2016 as the EC-37B. The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard operate a number of earlier Gulfstream Vs and G550s as VIP transports under the designations C-37A and C-37B respectively. The legislators, especially those from states that are home to other aircraft manufacturers, pressed for a competitive process, instead. The Air Force countered with a unique plan to hire L3 to come up with a modernization solution and pick the aircraft itself. The service was already paying the company to maintain the existing EC-130Hs. An EC-130H Compass Call aircraft., USAF Despite protests from American plane maker Boeing and Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier, who had hoped to pitch versions of their 737 and Global 6000 aircraft respectively, the Air Force has succeeded in moving ahead with the project. On Aug. 25, 2017, the Government Accountability Office, a top Congressional watchdog, rejected formal protests from both firms, which had in part asserted that L3 would be unduly biased in favor of the G550 based on its own history of work with Gulfstream. Of course, the use of Gulfstream 550s or other business jets for special missions, including airborne early warning and control and intelligence gathering, is hardly new. The Gulfstream’s own Special Missions Department previously worked with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to develop a platform for exactly these roles for the Israeli military, which became known as the Conformal Airborne Early Warning (CAEW) aircraft, the plane now slated to serve as the a basis for the Air Force’s EC-X. Italy and Singapore now operate their own derivatives using the CAEW airframe and Australia is in the process of acquiring its own G550-based electronic warfare aircraft . But whether or not the process was appropriate, the decision could have implications for various special mission aircraft projects going forward. In general, relatively small business jet type aircraft like the G550 are becoming increasingly cost-effective, thanks in no small part to steady improvements in jet engine technology . Moving Compass Call onto this sort of platform follows the U.S. Navy’s plan to replace its old NP-3D “Billboard” aircraft with a new plane using the Gulfstream G550 special mission design, which some have referred to as the NC-37B. These aircraft monitor missile tests and conduct other research, as well as keep an eye for unwanted visitors over the testing grounds. An artist’s rendering of the US Navy’s future “NC-37B.”, Gulfstream At the same time, L3 and Gulfstream have partnered with Northrop Grumman on a joint proposal in response to the Air Force’s competition to recapitalize the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) radar aircraft. The team’s pitch also uses the G550, but with a single ventral “canoe” to hold the powerful radar rather than the CAEW’s various radomes. Still, there is commonality between the two aircraft, which could make the Northrop Grumman bid option more enticing. Combined with the EC-X plans, Australia’s aforementioned plans to buy its own G550 electronic attackers could become a factor, as well. The Pentagon is facilitating that deal through the Foreign Military Sales process and combining it with any planned purchases for the U.S. military could only help drive down costs. The Air Force and other services have a vested interest in operating systems that share commonalities with allied equipment, as well, which makes combined operations simpler and safer in a crisis. Any future business jet-based aircraft will join the Air Force’s small fleet of E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) communications aircraft, which are based on the Bombardier Global 6000. There are also a number of additional VIP business jets spread across the services, including the aforementioned C-37s and the secretive C-20Cs that support the president, among others. There will likely be an increasing number of opportunities for business jets to take over other roles in the future, as well. This size of aircraft would easily offer a lower cost option over existing intelligence and surveillance platforms. They would definitely makes more sense than the existing practice of deploying heavy bombers for basic reconnaissance duties. One of the US Air Force’s E-11A BACN aircraft., USAF At present, the U.S. Army has committed to using second-hand Bombardier Dash-8 twin engine turboprops as the basis for its Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced intelligence aircraft, expecting to have these new RO-6A aircraft fully operational before the end of 2023. But the specific models the service is using are out of production, so there may eventually be a desire to migrate the systems over to a platform like the G550 just as the Air Force has done with Compass Call. U.S. Special Operations Command is also exploring possibly options for a new manned intelligence gathering platform to supplement and potentially replace its own existing U-28A and Beechcraft King Air-based turboprop spy planes. In cooperation with the Air Force’s 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, the special projects office better known by the nickname Big Safari, SOCOM operates a single Dornier Do-328 twin engine turboprop, called Cougar , as a test bed for new sensors and other systems, too. There are even more secretive manned systems in operation that could eventually need replacement, as well. A plane such as the G550 CAEW, especially if it is already in U.S. military service in other roles, would be an obvious option for any “next-generation” SOCOM airborne intelligence platform. The Air Force Special Operations Command’s existing use of civilian-style aircraft for discreet operations could make a business jet type even more attractive. All told, it seems very likely that the new EC-X is part of a broader trend within the U.S. military that will see business jet sized aircraft increasingly take on more specialized missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 4, 2020",Rumors Fly That Russia Has Dropped “The Father of All Bombs” in Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A rumor has appeared on social media suggesting that Russia has dropped its most powerful non-nuclear bomb, nicknamed the Father of All Bombs, on ISIS terrorists in Syria . If confirmed, this would be the first time Russia has employed this weapon, which is has otherwise revealed very little about, in combat. On Sept. 7, 2017, posts appeared on Twitter alleging that witnesses and activists near the Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor , had seen the weapon in action.. As yet, though, there has been no reporting in English language Russian news outlets or an official statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense. There are few concrete details about the FOAB , formally known as the Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power (ATBIP), and almost no official pictures or video of the bomb – one Tweet even used a picture of a mockup of the Soviet hydrogen bomb Tsar Bomba instead. It apparently uses a high explosive filler boosted with a mixture of aluminium powder and ethylene oxide, components common to other known thermobaric weapons , to create the high-intensity blast and associated shockwave. The Russians say the complete weapon weighs just over 14,000 pounds and can create a blast equivalent to 44 tons of TNT. This would make it lighter, but more devastating that than U.S. Air Force’s 22,000 pound GBU-43/B Mother of All Bombs (MOAB), which the Russians were clearly referencing with their own nickname. “Tests show its effectiveness and capabilities are comparable to nuclear weapons,” Russian General Colonel Alexander Rukshin, then Deputy Chief of the country’s Armed Forces General Staff, said after the first field test on Sept. 11, 2007. “At the same time, the use of this weapon doesn’t damage or pollute the environment.” Russia claims that the Tu-160 Blackjack super-sonic heavy bomber is the primary means to delivering this massive bomb, but that seems highly unlikely. Official film of the test is heavily edited to show a Tu-160’s bomb bay opening, before cutting abruptly to what looks like the bomb falling way straight out the back of different plane. https://youtube.com/watch?v=S2FGA3Z-oYM It is much more likely that an Il-76 cargo plane, or even the larger An-124, would carry the weapon to the target area and releases its out its rear cargo door like other air-dropped cargo. This is similar to the arrangement the U.S. Air Force uses to drop the GBU-43/B and had employed with the previous BLU-82/B Daisy Cutter. Like the BLU-82/B the FOAB uses a parachute to slow its descent and allow the delivery aircraft to fly low and escape the blast. The Russians claim the bomb is guided by their own GLONASS satellite navigation system, similar to GPS, but this delivery profile strongly suggests the weapon is actually unguided. Otherwise, the aircraft could drop it accurately while flying at a safe altitude and have no need for the parachute beyond possibly initially stabilizing the weapon in a downward orientation. The American MOAB, unlike the older Daisy Cutter, is GPS-guided and does not use a retarding parachute or other similar system. The U.S. military employed the MOAB for the first time in combat in Afghanistan in April 2017 on a tunnel network occupied by members of ISIS’ franchise in the country, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. The main terrorist group in Syria and Iraq is also known to favor subterranean networks to escape air and artillery strikes and move around undetected, so it is possible that the Russians could have decided to use it near Deir ez-Zor for similar reasons. In August 2017, the Syrian government claimed it had finally begun to link up with besieged government forces in a portion of the city, which ISIS has surrounded since April 2014. The regime of brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad officially declared the siege over on Sept. 5, 2017, but fighting in and around the city continued according to witnesses and activists in the country. If the reports of the Russian air strike turn out to be true, it is also possible that dropping the FOAB was a message intended for another party. U.S.-supported Syrian rebels belonging to the Syrian Democratic Forces have been suggesting they are on the verge of beginning an offensive into Deir ez-Zor governorate , ostensibly to attack ISIS. An Il-76 cargo plane at Hmeymim Air Base in Syria., Russian Ministry of Defense However, those operations could potentially put them in a position to eventually launch attacks against the Syrian government and its allies. The massive Russian strike could be seen as a warning to any anti-regime forces interested in moving into the area as ISIS falls back. Regardless of whether or not the Russians have actually dropped a FOAB in Syria, the Kremlin has already decided to use the country as a proving ground to show off its latest weaponry, even if they’re poorly suited to the situation at hand. So, it’s very likely that if the FOAB is indeed operational, we could eventually see it used in the war-torn country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",Afghanistan Is Getting More Ill-Suited Attack Choppers it May Not Even Be Able to Fly,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army signed a deal to buy as many 150 MD 530F light attack helicopters, as well as a host of related mission equipment, specifically for American allies and partners, over the next five years. The first deliveries will go to Afghanistan, where some officials have previously criticized the tiny gunship’s performance in the country and which simply may not have the manpower to effectively make use of them at all. On Sept. 5, 2017, the Pentagon announced the Army’s contract award to MD Helicopters, worth almost $1.4 billion, in its daily contracting press release. This initial notice suggested that all the helicopters were bound for Afghanistan, but the Arizona-headquartered manufacturer said the purchases would be for any qualifying foreign partner, which the service also later confirmed to IHS Jane’s . “This Contract is … a testament to the effective, efficient role the MD 530 Armed Scout Attack Helicopters play in the global fight against terror,” MD Helicopters Lynn Tilton said in a statement . “The MD 530F Cayuse Warrior has been a proven performer in support of ground operations and in the execution of close air support interactions since it first arrived in Kabul.” MD Helicopters says the first 30 aircraft – a fifth of the estimated total under the deal with the Army – will go to Afghanistan to join the aircraft already flying there against the Taliban and other insurgents and terrorists. The company will outfit these new helicopters with digital “glass” cockpits, auxiliary fuel tanks, tactical radios, and weapon mounts able to carry either forward firing .50 caliber machine gun pods or 70mm rockets , among other mission equipment. The U.S. military had already planned to help deliver these aircraft as part of the existing Afghan Aviation Transition Plan (AATP) modernization effort, which began during President Barack Obama’s administration and is not linked to President Donald Trump’s 2017 Afghanistan and South Asia policy announcement . For more than two years, the MD 530F has been an important part of American-supported plans to help Afghanistan’s military operate independently of foreign support. However, the small helicopters, derived from the iconic Vietnam-era OH-6A Cayuse scout helicopter and similar to the AH-6 and MH-6 Little Birds that American special operators use, already have a complicated history in Afghanistan’s air force. In 2014, the U.S. military first decided to facilitate the delivery of a dozen armed MD 530Fs to Afghanistan bolster the capabilities of the country’s air force, which at the time was relying entirely on armed Mi-8 and -17 series assault transports and a handful of aging Mi-35 Hind gunships to provide close air support for troops on the ground. The plan was to also arm and armor five more MD 530Fs the Afghans already had, but were using as trainers, as well as supply a separate fleet of A-29 light attack aircraft . The initial batch of six helicopter arrived in Kabul in March 2015, but in the rush to get them into action they arrived without any sighting equipment or the ability to fire rockets. Afghan pilots initially flew missions only with the .50 caliber gun pods, aiming the weapons using crude crosshairs they applied directly to the gunship’s front windshield with a grease pencil. The first batch of armed 530Fs arrives in Afghanistan 2015., USAF It was an inauspicious beginning that prompted severe and public criticism from Afghanistan’s military establishment. On top of that, the issues magnified those officials’ views that the smaller and lighter armed and armored helicopters were an especially poor substitute for the Russian-made designs they were much more familiar with. “This plane is a total mess,” Afghan Air Force Colonel Qalandar Shah Qalandari told The New York Times in September 2015. “To be honest, I don’t know why we have this plane here.” “It’s unsafe to fly, the engine is too weak, the tail rotor is defective and it’s not armored,” he continued. “If we go down after the enemy we’re going to have enemy return fire, which we can’t survive. If we go up higher, we can’t visually target the enemy.” Qalandari, a Soviet-trained officer who was Afghanistan’s most highly decorated pilot at the time, argued in favor of more Hinds while also criticizing other American-funded purchases for the country’s Air Force. His complaints about the helicopter’s performance in Afghanistan were not unreasonable. An Afghan Air Force Mi-35 Hind during operations in 2013., US Army Much of the country is mountainous and during the summer temperatures in some regions can get extremely high. More so than fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters are particularly sensitive to the density of the air and these so-called “hot-and-high” conditions can severely curtail how much weight they can carry, which in turns limits their overall range and capabilities. Qalandari told The New York Times that an MD 530F with a full load of ammunition couldn’t reliably or safely get to an altitude of 7,000 or 8,000 feet above sea level during the summer months. Kabul is already at an elevation of approximately 6,000 feet, which meant that the helicopters couldn’t fly over the mountain ranges that surrounded the capital city. “When my pilots fly in this, only God and I know what they’re going through,” he added. “And I don’t know whether they’ll make it back.” The Afghan Air Force’s work-around in many cases has been to fly the helicopters to forward sites inside its C-130 cargo planes. Still, with only machine guns, pilots had to get within relatively close range of their targets to even have a chance of hitting anything. The MD 530Fs eventually got reflector gun sights and rockets, but lack the ability to employ laser guided version or an other precision guided munitions that would limit the vulnerability of the aircraft and otherwise expand its capabilities. And while the MD 530F’s armament system can accommodate multiple types of weapons at a time, Afghanistan’s helicopters only appear to fly missions with two machine gun pods or two seven-tube rocket pods, likely to keep the overall weight down. Without even a basic infrared camera or similar sensor, crews would have to rely on night vision googles to fly at night and find their targets, again hampering the ability of the helicopters to attack insurgents when they are most active. Coalition air power has long used its ability to operate after the sun goes down to help keep the Taliban and other militants at bay. One option might have been to send Afghanistan now surplus OH-58D Kiowa Warriors, which have sensors and the ability to employ precision guided munitions, in lieu of the MD 530Fs. However, the U.S. Army’s decision to retire the type came after plans were already in place to provide the Afghan Air Force with Cayuse Warriors and it is possible American advisors were loathe to add another type of aircraft into the mix. USAF From the information available, it’s hard to assess how effective the helicopters have been in combat overall, though. On Aug. 29, 2017, Afghanistan’s Tolo News reported that the country’s air force had flown 120 air strikes in the preceding 24 hours as part of surge in operations, but did not say whether any MD 530Fs took part in the missions. It’s not always easy to know how many of the helicopters are still flying As of July 2017, insurgents had shot down two and another was out of service due to a hard landing, according to a report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). The U.S. government watchdog, which keeps track of military and other support to the country, said for some inexplicable reason no one had yet stricken the two crashed aircraft from the official inventory lists. After the Qalandari’s interview, American officials defended the MD 530Fs, as well as the other aircraft, saying that were best suited for both the country’s needs and what it could realistically operate and maintain, something we at The War Zone have addressed before regarding Afghanistan’s air force in general . What they declined to mention, though, was the increasing difficultly the United States was having in purchasing Russian helicopter types in light of heightened tensions with the Kremlin and economic sanctions over its activities in Ukraine, including the outright seizure of the Crimea region. But the overall utility of the aircraft may be limited due to the chronic problems Afghanistan’s military had and still does with regards to keeping its more advanced equipment, including aircraft and helicopters, operational. This is in no small part due to persistent shortages of trained personnel and other resources, as well as endemic corruption and other political factors. So, it’s hard to understand how the country expects to absorb another 30 aircraft on top of the 25 it already has, either. An Afghan Air Force MD 530F flies over the service’s ramp at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul., USAF According to one of the Pentagon’s routine reports to Congress in of June 2017 the Afghan Air Force only had 20 fully qualified air crews – a pilot and a co-pilot – for its entire existing fleet of MD 530Fs. The next month, SIGAR reported that there were 58 pilots qualified to fly the helicopters, along with another 16 who had yet to receive their full certifications. At that time, the country’s air arm had approximately 215 fully qualified pilots in total . Private contractors were responsible for the bulk of the maintenance duties to keep the helicopters operational. The U.S. military had no formal timeline for when they expected that to change. “Full aircrew manning is forecasted to be achieved by 2018,” the Pentagon explained in its June 2017 report. “Although this is important progress in the transition to a self-sustaining MD-530 fleet, maintenance capability will likely take longer than aircrew capability to develop fully.” Doubling the fleet now will only put more pressure on both of these training pipelines and there’s are systemic issues that limit the ability for Afghanistan’s military to realistically ramp up those processes, namely persistently high illiteracy rates. It was one of the issues infamous military contractor Erik Prince cited in his proposal to provide Afghanistan with a new, privately operated air force . USAF These underlying problems are so severe that U.S. Army Major General Mark Quantock once described them collectively as the “Afghan Condition.” He made the comments while serving as the top intelligence officer for the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan. “Quantock used the term ‘Afghan Condition’ to describe circumstances in Afghanistan culture that restrict or limit their progress,” according to a Department of Defense Inspector General report regarding the training of Afghan intelligence personnel. “The Afghan condition includes high illiteracy rates, internal language barriers, gender inequality, tribal or family influences, corruption, and security concerns.” We obtained a highly redacted copy of this classified review via the Freedom of Information Act. The public affairs office for the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission did not respond to a query about whether or not it considered this assessment, which Quantock made in 2015 or 2016, to still be valid. The major general went on to become the top intelligence officer for U.S. Central Command. In his policy announcement in August 2017, President Trump insisted that the United States would continue its support for the Afghan military, but that it was not a blank check, which previous administrations had also insisted was the case. Afghanistan had to show it was willing to carry its own burdens and able to make “real progress.” Whether the Afghan air force can make good use of new 530Fs will be a good indication of the state of the country’s military overall and offer a test of the Trump administration’s resolve to hold limit further support if they can’t perform.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2019",Let’s Talk About The USAF’s Claim Of ‘Fully Combat Capable’ F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of all the issues surrounding the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, perhaps the most hotly contested is the criteria the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy are using to judge when the jets will be ready for combat and whether certain milestones accurately reflect the stealth fighter’s capabilities . The Air Force has now reignited this debate by stating that it will have “fully combat capable” F-35As by the end of September 2017 even though the jet hasn’t even started independent operational test and evaluation trials. On Aug. 25, 2017, Aviation Week reported that the Air Force would begin receiving A model aircraft able to “employ its full suite of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons,” including its internal 25mm cannon. To achieve this milestone, the new aircraft would come with a critical new software update, which the service referred to simply as Block 3F. In September 2016, the service announced this would occur by the beginning of the 2018 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1, 2017. “We now just passed 100,000 flying hours with the F-35, and it is doing very well,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson told reporters during a press conference , also on Aug. 25, 2017. “In any contingency, if there were a problem, they’re ready to go – ready to go to combat.” Wilson was responding in part to questions about Air Force capabilities to respond to heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea continues to test advanced ballistic missiles and has now claims to have a functional hydrogen bomb . On Aug. 31, 2017, Marine Corps F-35Bs, which the service has forward deployed to Japan, joined a show of force over both Japan and South Korea for the first time. An F-35A drops a training version of a GBU-31/B JDAM during an exercise., USAF As we at The War Zone have noted before, low observable aircraft such as the F-35 would be an important component of any actual strike on North Korea, owing to the country’s dense, if dated air defense network. A fully-combat capable Joint Strike Fighter would give Air Force commanders in the Pacific, as well as other hot spots around the world , additional flexibility to respond to crises. The 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, a combat coded unit, is slated to receive the jets with the Block 3F software first, according to Aviation Week. The three training squadrons at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona – the 61st, 62nd, and 63rd Fighter Squadrons – will then start getting the updated aircraft. An F-35A drops a practice GBU-12/B laser guided bomb during an exercise., USAF Still, it’s not entirely clear how the Air Force is defining “fully combat capable” in this case. None of the three F-35 variants have even begun the mandatory testing process run by the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), which is independent of the individual services. What is clear is that this is not the same, nor is the service claiming it is, as a formal declaration of “full operational capability,” or FOC. The Pentagon-standard definition for FOC is when every unit that is supposed to receive a certain weapon system has gotten that piece of equipment and can both operate and maintain it. This announcement is generally only supposed to come after the system passes DOT&E’s rigorous independent testing regime. The Air Force had already added confusion to this process by declaring initial operational capability (IOC), which is supposed to reflect a basic operational capability, for the F-35A before the end of developmental testing and without any operational evaluations. The service seems to be again obfuscating the situation, intentionally or unintentionally, by using a term that sounds similar to FOC, but isn’t, which has already led to confusion in the media about what this new announcement realistically means. “This may very well be an effort to undermine the operational testing  process,” Dan Grazier, the Jack Shanahan Fellow at the Project On Government Oversight, a non-partisan watchdog that has been highly critical of the F-35 program, told The War Zone by Email. “All the services have been hostile to the idea of having an outside testing official evaluating their work. I see this as an attempt to marginalize DOT&E’s role in the acquisition process.” USAF Of the three services purchasing F-35 variants, the U.S. Navy is the only one that has not declared IOC with its jets, continuing to link that milestone to the successful completion of operational testing. The U.S. Marine Corps and the Air Force say they have achieved this with their F-35s and now the Air Force curiously says it plans to declare IOC for the Block 3F software itself once the code begins reaching operational and training units. “Declaring ‘initial operational capability’ after each of the program’s steps rather diminishes the pronouncement,” Grazier added. “I’m sure most people are really only interested in ‘full operational capability’ as that is what we are paying for.” Beyond that, based on the publicly available information, it’s hard to say whether or not the Block 3F software package will provide a truly complete suite of combat capabilities. We have no reason to doubt the new code will finally allow F-35A pilots to employ the fuller range of existing operational weapons the Air Force wants the aircraft to carry by the end of the ongoing developmental testing process. As of 2015, this list of planned weapon options was relatively short, including the AIM-9X and AIM-120C air-to-air missiles, GBU-12/B 500-pound class laser-guided bombs, GBU-31/B 2,000-pound class GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs, the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), and the GAU-22/A 25mm cannon . There are now plans to integrate 500- and 1,000-pound class JDAMs and the GBU-49/B dual-mode version of the GBU-12. F-35 JPO The F-35As can only carry some of these weapons, such as the AIM-9X, on external pylons that severely degrade the aircraft’s low-observable characteristics. The Air Force hopes its final, full operational capability Joint Strike Fighters – running the still notional Block 4 software – will be able to carry dual-mode Laser JDAMs and the still-in-development SDB II , as well. That being said, there’s no guarantee that the Block 3F software will allow F-35A pilots to effectively employ some or all of these weapons. We don’t even know for sure what specific version of it the Air Force will distribute for its software “IOC.” As of December 2016, the service had already gone through six different revisions of the update. According to DOT&E’s annual report on the program for 2016, the central joint service F-35 program office initially planned for this latest code, known as Block 3FR6, to be ready in February 2016, but it only arrived 10 months behind schedule. In 2016, “DOT&E reported there were 270 high-priority deficiencies in the Block 3F software for each variant [of the F-35],” Grazier noted. “The Air Force’s own test pilots rated the Block 3F as ‘red’ or not ready for operational testing, not to mention actual combat, in all mission areas.” It is important to note that what specifically the Air Force had negatively rated was two subversions of the earlier Block 3FR5 software, 3FR5.03 and 3FR5.05. It is possible that the present edition of Revision 6 has fixed most, if not all of the issues. However, it’s hard to give the service the benefit of the doubt that this has been the case. As with the Block 3FR5 software, Air Force itself determined the Block 3i package for the IOC jets was unacceptable for actual combat operations, according to DOT&E’s review of the program. This prompts serious questions about the validity of Air Force Secretary Wilson’s comments in August 2017, as well as the IOC decision itself and what we can expect from the new 3FR6 code. An F-35A fires an AIM-120C missile during a test., Lockheed Martin This is further compounded by the fact that the Air Force says it already expects to deliver a string of Block 3F updates as continued testing exposes more problems despite its insistence that they will have “full combat capability.” This is actually something DOT&E recommended the F-35 program as a whole do after developmental phase ended, but as part of the subsequent operational evaluation process and before any service even considered deploying the jets on operational missions or training exercises – something both the Air Force and Marine Corps have now been doing for months. “Several essential capabilities – including aimed gunshots and Air-to-Air Range Infrastructure – had not yet been flight tested or did not yet work properly when Block 3FR6 was released,” according to DOT&E’s review. “The services [Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy] … designated 276 deficiencies in combat performance as ‘critical to correct’ in Block 3F, but less than half of the critical deficiencies were addressed with attempted corrections in 3FR6.” On top of that, DOT&E said that the delays with Revision 6, coupled with funding problems, had forced the F-35 program office to scrap its own existing plans for two follow-on software blocks, 3FR7 and 3FR8. At this point, it seems almost impossible to assess the true capabilities of any “Block 3F” code, positively or negatively, based on public descriptions, especially given the sheer number of major revisions and minor changes. But most significantly, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, we do know that the service already deliberately watered down its capability criteria to meet its own, self-imposed schedule for declaring IOC with the F-35A in August 2016. This was mainly out of fear that delaying the milestone any further would become a political and public relations nightmare that could’ve potentially impacted Congressional support and foreign sales. USAF via FOIA In June 2010, the official schedule was to have a final version of the Block 3 software pass the independent operational test and evaluation process no later than October 2016 and then make the IOC announcement. By May 2013, this had changed to having an aircraft ready with any block of software that would allow pilots a limited capability to destroy enemy air defenses and perform basic close air support, with no mention whatsoever of air-to-air combat. At present, the Air Force does not have a firm date of when the jets will be ready for the more rigorous operational testing and evaluations. It is entirely possible we’re seeing this situation crop up again. The Air Force’s statements came ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend and before Congress returned to continue work on, among other things, the defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year. “The Senate version [of the annual National Defense Authorization Act] would have the American taxpayers purchase 94 F-35s, 24 more than the president requested,” Grazier noted. “I am sure this move is an effort to make people believe the program is worth the investment.” This argument would help explain why the U.S. Marine Corps made a similar declaration shortly after the Air Force announcement. The service said that their F-35Bs in Japan would also be getting some version of the Block 3F software, gaining a similar full combat capability to the Air Force models. A US Marine Corps F-35B., USN None of this is to say that the ultimate version of the Block 3F software won’t perform as required and provide the services with an F-35 that is highly capable, one that is even ready for combat in an emergency. The concern is that the rush to get the jets into service could put pilots in the seat of a jet that just isn’t ready yet, exposing them to unnecessary risks, which is why the operational test and evaluation process exists in the first place. This does means the F-35 program isn’t necessarily progressing forward and meeting its goals, either. However, as we at The War Zone have noted before, it can be difficult to judge official statements regarding the Joint Strike Fighter, which often seem to rely on obtuse and “technically correct” claims that confuse the obvious and significant issues that project continues to face , often serving to diminish any actual positive news that emerges. Back in July 2017, Tyler Rogoway noted this after the Navy released some of the most candid and useful official information to date about test of the Marine Corps’ F-35B, writing : After watching this video, it’s hard not feel that if the F-35 program would have just consistently published this type of information as the program advanced, for better or worse, it probably would have gone a long way to help – not hurt – the controversial aircraft’s plight. One of the major criticisms of the F-35 program has been the fog surrounding its delayed development. Massive swathes of issues would periodically emerge through leaks, congressional hearings, and watchdog or pentagon test and evaluation reports. At the same time, straight answers from the aircraft’s manufacturer or the F-35 program office were seemingly few and far between. Instead, we got glitzy videos with idealized snippets of the jet in action and those involved with the program singing its praises, which seemed totally tone deaf, especially as the aircraft’s development was clearly headed towards the edge of the abyss. One has to wonder whether the Air Force and the Marines Corps are now making the same mistake by trying to drum up support for the aircraft with this largely undefined claim, which is undoubtedly technically accurate based on the services’ internal criteria, of fielding fully combat capable F-35s before the independent operational test and evaluation process has even begun.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As federal, state, and local agencies continue to respond to the damage and flooding wrought by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, as well as neighboring Louisiana, one of the more contentious questions has been the danger posed to communities by heavily polluted sites within the disaster zone. As part of its response, the Environmental Protection Agency has deployed the unique Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology surveillance aircraft, which can spot chemical and radiological material from the air, to help assess the situation. More commonly known by the acronym ASPECT, contractor owned and operated system is configured to collect chemical and radiological information, as well as both color visual and infrared imagery. EPA has had it on call for more than a decade, sending it out in the past to either actively monitor disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, or be ready in the event of an emergency during a major public event, such as multiple presidential inaugurations, Super Bowls, and other large gatherings. “ASPECT is the nation’s only airborne real-time chemical and radiological detection, infrared and photographic imagery platform,” EPA says on its website . “ASPECT is available to assist local, national, and international agencies supporting hazardous substance response, radiological incidents, and situational awareness.” Similar to many military intelligence and reconnaissance aircraft , the APSECT aircraft carries a wide-angle mapping camera and an infrared line scanner that can create thermal imagery of the ground below as the plane flies along. Analysts can put the basic color images together form even larger maps of a specific area, well. Airborne ASPECT In addition, EPA’s surveillance aircraft has less common gamma ray and multi-spectral chemical spectrometers. This allows the crew to collect information about spreading hazards that may not be visible to the human eye. The chemical sensor can help determine what compounds are present and how densely they’re concentrated in the air. The Department of Energy also has aircraft for mapping radiological incidents, in particular a small fleet of Bell 412 helicopters specifically outfitted for the role. But these aircraft lack the ability to keep tabs on other toxic chemicals that may be airborne and they don’t have ASPECT’s multi-spectral imaging capabilities. From the EPA’s website: “The National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Department of Energy, does operate the Aerial Measuring System. However, this only collects radiological data in real time, while ASPECT provides a multi-sensor capability.” Initially, the contractor used a twin engine Aero Commander 690, seen in the video below, to carry all of these systems. This eventually gave way to a simpler and cheaper to operate Cessna C208B Grand Cavaran, which is the present platform. As of April 2014, it cost EPA $1,500 per flight hour to operate the ASPECT Cessna. Contractor Airborne ASPECT says it can have the plane up in the air from its home base near Dallas, Texas and on its way to a disaster are within an hour. Within nine hours, the aircraft can reach anywhere in the country. According to EPA, it only takes one phone call to the company to get the whole process started. In or near an affected area, a team of scientists and other specialists set up a processing center on the ground to pore over the data. It only takes approximately five minutes for the crew of the aircraft to send the compressed information to this team via a satellite link. ASPECT can produce traditional visuals, left, and multi-spectral imagery showing chemical plumes., National Guard Bureau via FOIA Though EPA runs the ASPECT program, other agencies, including the National Guard, can request support from the aircraft through the Department of Homeland Security’s Interagency Remote Sensing Coordination Cell. According to a 2013 National Guard handbook on incident awareness and assessment, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, the plane’s capabilities could be useful in general after earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and terror attacks, as well as hurricanes. Already situated in Texas, ASPECT was quickly on the scene over Houston after Harvey hit. More importantly, it has given EPA a way to quickly inspect the toxic Houston-area zones, known as Superfund sites. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 designated these areas for cleanup as part of the Superfund program . Texas is home to 66 Superfund sites, more than 40 of which were within Hurricane Harvey’s impact area, according to Buzzfeed News . There is no indication that any of these contain radioactive materials, so ASPECT is likely gathering information on potential chemical releases, as well as basic information about the state of the areas. The Superfund areas in the site mainly contain waste from oil, gas, and other petrochemical related activities, as well as farming and ranching. As such, they can contain dangerous, toxic, and carcinogenic substances, such as sulfuric acid, heavy metals, now-banned pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls, better known as PCBs. The concern is that the floodwaters could spread hazardous material and poison soil and groundwater for years to come. The storm and subsequent flooding had damaged more than a dozen, inundating the areas and limiting the ability of specialists to gain access on the ground. ASPECT can monitor at least some of this danger from the air, though it would not be able to see pollution seeping down into ground below or necessarily be able to accurately discriminate pollutants mixing with the water above. The plane’s operations have been an important part of the EPA’s response to the disaster, which has received criticism from the press. In a now controversial article, The Associated Press said it had managed to reach seven of the sites by boat, but had not received an explanation from EPA about why its inspectors had been unable to do the same. EPA said that its personnel would visit the sites on the ground once it was safe to do so and in the meantime would continue collecting data via ASPECT. The piece noted that in 2012, under President Barack Obama, the environmental agency had completed a report warning about the risk to Superfund sites from flooding and rising sea levels related to climate change. President Donald Trump’s first budget request proposes a 30 percent cut to funding for the Superfund Program and his administration’s EPA Director Scott Pruitt has previously denied any scientific consensus on the existence on global climate change. In response to the Associated Press story and subsequent reporting, the agency issued an unusually personalized public rebuke , suggesting that one of the article’s authors, Michael Biesecker, had deliberately left out numerous key details, including that it had worked with authorities in Texas to secure the Superfund sites before Harvey made landfall. The news wire issued its own statement afterwards, standing by work of its team and their on-the-ground reporting. Regardless, neither the EPA nor independent observers may know the exact extent of the damage and resulting danger to nearby communities for some time. Despite previous warnings, no Superfund site has ever experienced this level of flooding, Buzzfeed reported, making it a completely unprecedented situation. “We don’t have any precedent to figuring out what the cumulative effect is going to be on someone’s health,” Jennifer Horney, an associate professor of epidemiology at Texas A&M University who has led her own team to collect water and soil samples for analysis, told Buzzfeed. “They’re [residents of Houston] not going to get cancer tomorrow – they may get asthma in three months.” In the meantime, it seems likely that the aircraft will continue to monitor the status of the Superfund sites, at least until the floodwaters begin to recede, which may take weeks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019","Under New Deal, US Allies Will Keep Getting The Ever Adaptable Humvee","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military may be replacing the iconic Humvee with the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, but it’s also positioning itself to still be able to send thousands of the older trucks to allies and partners around the globe. This is probably welcome news for countries who continue to use them as everything from patrol vehicles to ambulances to mobile rocket launchers. On Aug. 29, 2017, AM General announced it had received a U.S. Army contract worth approximately $2.2 billion to produce as many as 11,560 Humvees – formally known as the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle, or HMMWV – for foreign customers over the next five years. The deal would allow the U.S. government to quickly facilitate the delivery of the trucks through the Foreign Military Sales process and other established international assistance programs. “The HMMWV continues to be the most sought after light tactical vehicle for military and government customers around the world,” AM General President and CEO Andy Hove boasted in a company press release . “Today’s contract announcement once again highlights the HMMWV as a modern, proven, highly deployable, versatile, rugged and affordable light tactical vehicle.” It’s definitely true that the Humvee has proven to be a particularly versatile platform over the years. The U.S. military as a whole began purchasing the trucks in 1983 as a replacement for a host of older light wheeled vehicles, including the Ford M151 jeep , and subsequently purchased thousands in more than a dozen standard configurations. These included weapon carriers, heavy duty cargo versions, special operations specific types, and the carrier for the Avenger short-range air defense system. Armored version of various types eventually appeared, culminated with the famous – or infamous depending on your opinion of the vehicle – up-armored Humvees that became fixture in the War on Terror before ending up replaced by a new family of mine-protected trucks. A row of M1167 TOW carriers, an Expanded Capacity Vehicle Humvee type., US Army The extra weight of the armor kits prompted AM General to develop increasingly heavier chassis and axels to handle the strain. These so-called Expanded Capacity Vehicles only offers more room to expand on the design and its capabilities. This chart shows just a portion of the U.S. military’s official Humvee types, circa the early 2010s. , US Army via HMMWV in Scale In more than three decades of service, the U.S. military tested a host of experimental weapons technologies on the Humvee, too, such as hybrid-electric engines , lasers , light-weight artillery , and various types of armor. The popularity of the truck means that private companies often use the chassis when demonstrating their own systems. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YrZ6RxBhma0 So, it’s not surprising that, to spice things up, AM General is essentially offering what is effectively a build-your-own Humvee derivative called the Multi-Purpose Truck (MPT). The company first revealed this concept at the annual International Defense Exhibition earlier this year in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in February 2017. One version of AM General’s Multi-Purpose Truck., AM General We don’t know if the contract with the Army could cover MPTs, but AM General says it will build “a wide range of variants including protected weapons carriers, cargo transporters, communications vehicles and ambulances” under the terms of the deal. Of course, there’s no guarantee that any of these trucks will stay in their original configuration after they arrive with their new owners. The versatility AM General offers from the factory is matched and likely exceeded by what various American allies have done to their vehicles. Israel’s military and other security forces alone, which refer to the basic truck as the “ Hamer ,” have come up with dozens more variants, including vehicles carrying radio jammers and equipment to launch small drones, as well as surveillance trucks with electro-optical sensors on an extendable mast. Israeli soldiers patrol the border with Lebanon in 2011 in an armored “Hamer Memugan” Humvee variant., AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari More recently, heavily modified Humvees have become a key component of the Iraqi operations against ISIS terrorists, with each component helpfully painting their vehicles in a distinct way. The country’s elite Counter Terrorism Service generally drives all-black trucks, while the regular Army has more traditional vehicles in the U.S. military’s standard overall desert sand color. The Iraqi Federal Police drive versions in a flashy, if dubiously useful blue-and-white camouflage pattern, while the Ministry of Interior’s specialized Rapid Response Division has variants in solid green. A heavily modified Iraqi Army Humvee patrols a liberated section of Mosul in January 2017, AP Photo/ Khalid Mohammed We’ve seen these vehicles, largely based on a variety of early and late Expanded Capacity Vehicle variants, sport any number of semi-standardized armor packages, most notably including reinforcements to the hood and radiator cover, as well as shields over the wheel wells to protect the tires against shrapnel and small arms fire, all leading to comparisons. Another common addition is a huge, boxy turret, mounted either on top or toward the rear, containing a Soviet-era 23mm ZU-23 anti-aircraft cannon, which is also devastating against individuals and light vehicles, such as the technicals ISIS favors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Xatq7E9i39c At least some of the Rapid Response Division’s vehicles have home-made improvised rocket launcher in the back similar in basic design to the types popular with Shia militia in Iraq. The Federal Police salvaged the fully-enclosed turret from a Ukrainian-built BTR-94 armored personnel carrier, which also has a twin 23mm cannon, and put it on top of one of its Humvees. Iraqi Rapid Response Division members launch an improvised rocket from a Humvee in Mosul in March 2017., AP Photo/Felipe Dana How the trucks handle all this added weight and strain is anyone’s guess, but based on the U.S. military’s experience with the up-armored variants, it seems likely that the additions wreak havoc with the chassis, suspension, and transmission components.  The relatively light vehicles are unlikely to be a particularly stable or accurate for firing the heavier weapons, especially the improvised rocket artillery, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=sp4h3yw5iZo And there’s no way the thin add-on armor the Iraqi have been installing would shield the occupants from the kind of guided anti-tank missiles and massive suicide car bombs ISIS routinely employs, which are a threat to even heavy armored vehicles and up-armored bulldozers . One Iraqi Army unit may have spray painted the silhouette of an M1 Abrams on the side of a Humvee, but it definitely couldn’t take the place of an actual tank. The United States has also been sending Humvees to its local partners in Syria , as well as other militaries battling ISIS and other terrorists throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. The trucks have been a part of military assistance and aid to NATO allies and other European partners, including Ukraine , too. Some allies even produce their own versions . Given AM General’s new contract, there are almost guaranteed to be more deliveries in the coming years. We’ll be sure to keep our eyes out for new and interesting modifications to the venerable trucks. There have already become too many different Humvee types for any one person to keep track of, so feel free to share your own favorites in the comments.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 3, 2019",US Navy Doubles Down On Range Requirements For Its MQ-25 Tanker Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s top aviation officer, Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, has offered new details about what the service expects from its future MQ-25 Stingray tanker drones . Based on his comments, the plan is for the final unmanned aircraft to nearly double the operational range of carrier-based F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , a significant increase over the initial requirements. In an interview with the U.S. Naval Institute’s magazine Proceedings , Shoemaker, who holds the position of Commander, Naval Air Forces, said the goal was for each MQ-25 to be able to dispense more than approximately 2,200 gallons, or nearly 15,000 pounds, of fuel 500 miles from the carrier. At present, the Super Hornets have an effective combat radius of around 450 miles . “The MQ-25 will give us the ability to extend the air wing out probably 300 or 400 miles beyond where we typically go,” Shoemaker explained. “That will extend the reach of the air wing, and when we combine that with additional weapons we are buying, we will get an impressive reach.” The fuel load Shoemaker described is 50 percent greater than the minimum figure the Navy had provided in the materials it submitted as justification for the multi-mission MQ-25 designation in 2016. The service had asked for the new moniker after deciding to change the pilotless plane’s mission from long-range strike and reconnaissance to tanking following the end of tests of Northrop Grumman’s X-47B as part of the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program and the cancellation of the follow-on Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) project. One of the X-47B demonstrators lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush in 2013., USN It also appears that the idea is for the drones to fly more than twice as far before refueling any aircraft. Based on the interview questions in Proceedings , an initial concept of operations saw the unmanned tankers providing fuel only 200 miles out from the carrier. And when Shoemaker mentioned new weapons, he was most likely referring to the Navy’s interest in advanced stand-off bombs and missiles, such as the AGM-154C Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb and AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Combined with the extended range the Stingrays would provide, these could give F/A-18E/Fs, and eventually F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, the ability to engage targets at even greater distances. These new details reinforce earlier reporting that suggested the Navy was focusing almost exclusively on the MQ-25 as a tanker, which could free up the carrier air wing’s Super Hornets from having to fly that mission, at least in the near term. Initially, the service said the Stingray would be a mix of tanker and reconnaissance aircraft, reflected in its multi-mission designation. “Right now the focus is to make it [the MQ-25] a tanker to extend the reach of the  air wing and reduce some of the fatigue life expenditure on our Super  Hornets,” Shoemaker said. “The only tankers we have in the air wing are the Rhinos [Super Hornets].” An F/A-18E Super Hornet deploys the probe-and-drogue from a Cobham air refueling pod., USN On top of that, it seems that the service is looking to further downplay the recovery tanking portion of that mission in favor of mission tanking, as well. Mission tanking involves refueling aircraft well away from an aircraft carrier or land base in order reach targets at longer distances. For the Navy, recovery tanking has the aerial refuelers flying closer to the carrier in case returning planes are running low on gas. Landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier, a moving target that can be changing position dramatically in rough seas, can be a difficult proposition in general , with pilots needing to make multiple passes in some instances. A recovery tanker protects against a pilot running out of fuel and having to bail out, risking injury or death and losing a multi-million dollar aircraft, before they can safely touch down on the ship. In 2016, the Navy suggested that recovery tanking versus mission tanking would be the primary job of the MQ-25. In July 2017, the service revealed to new emphasis on providing fuel during actual missions, declaring it to be one of just two key requirements for the Stingray. According to Shoemaker, this shift in focus is due in no small part to the Navy’s development of new technology to simplify carrier landings, aptly nicknamed Magic Carpet. The new software handles more of the work, making it easier for pilots in Super Hornets and other manned aircraft to safely and accurately plot their course. Studies showed that Super Hornet pilots made an average of 200 to 300 course corrections in the final 18 seconds of their landing approach, U.S. Navy Captain David Kindley, the service’s F/A-18 and EA-18G Program Manager, told USNI News in 2016. With Magic Carpet, even new pilots with no experience with the system had cut that down to around 20 corrections. As a result, Navy expects the overall need for recovery tanking to drop. Still, we don’t know if the fuel and range figure Shoemaker gave Proceedings were minimum thresholds a prototype aircraft would have to meet or a less firm goal the Navy wants competitors to do their best to meet. Regardless, it does raise additional questions about whether or not the four companies vying for the final contract – Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman – will be able to offer the desired capabilities with their present designs. All four firms had initially developed concepts based on the idea of a strike and intelligence gathering platform that could break through enemy air defenses at long range. As such, they were generally low-observable aircraft with space for relatively modest payloads. If Shoemaker’s parameters represent the baseline requirements, each design will have to find space for more than 2,200 gallons of additional fuel – approximately 15,000 pounds – while still being able to fly more than 1,000 miles per sortie. Pictures recently emerged of Northrop Grumman testing its X-47B demonstrator with a Cobham air refueling pod under one wing and what looked to be either a standard 330- or 480-gallon drop tank under the other. Lockheed Martin’s MQ-25 “concept art,” prominently showing the Cobham refueling pod., Lockheed Martin The Cobham pod, which the Navy says the MQ-25 has to use , can hold 300 gallons of fuel itself, along with the probe-and-drogue system to connect to another aircraft. At most the two under wing stores would hold less than 800 gallons of fuel in total. The aircraft would need to carry another 1,400 gallons, plus what it needs to fly the mission itself. However, the X-47B only has 4,500 pounds of internal payload capacity – equal to less than 700 gallons of fuel – and it’s not clear if all of those spaces can accommodate tanks full of gas. It was likely this combination of emerging requirements and existing constraints that led Rob Weiss, head of Lockheed’s Skunk Works advanced projects office, to suggest in March 2017 that all the companies working on the Stingray program would have to fundamentally rework their submissions . In August 2017, General Atomics rebuked this notion , saying it had great confidence in its Sea Avenger design, derived from the existing Avenger drone, no doubt owing to the drone’s existing internal payload bays and provision for six under wing pylons, each of which could carry a drop tank. General Atomics Avenger., General Atomics There’s still no definitive word on whether or not the MQ-25 will still have a secondary reconnaissance and surveillance mission, as the Navy had originally outlined in 2016. In his interview, Shoemaker effectively confirmed that the plan was to start with a tanker first and then explore other options in the future. “The MQ-25 will start primarily as a tanker, but we will keep our options open in terms of additional capacity or capabilities,” he explained. However, as we at The War Zone have noted in the past, by focusing on the one mission almost exclusively, it is very possible that the Stingrays will not be readily adaptable to other mission sets. According to USNI News, the U.S. Navy top officer, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson, is interested in having the unmanned aircraft flying from carriers as early as some time in 2019.  The laser-like focus on the tanking mission could definitely help competitors meet this relatively truncated timeline, but might limit the drone’s flexibility in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 25, 2020",USAF Breathing New Life Into Ancient KC-135 Tankers With This New Glass Cockpit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we’ve said many times before, one of the U.S. military’s greatest strengths is its ability to respond on short notice to crises anywhere in the world. It has that capability in no small part thanks to a fleet aerial refueling tankers give bombers , multi-role combat aircraft , and cargo planes essentially unlimited range. So, it’s no surprise that the U.S. Air Force is looking to keep at least a portion of its fleet of KC-135R Stratotankers flying for at least two more decades, if not longer. On Aug. 25, 2017, a KC-135R from the Iowa Air National Guard’s 185th Air Refueling Wing returned to its base in Sioux City after receiving a series of upgrades to bring it up to the Block 45 standard. With the upgrade package, the tankers get completely glass cockpits with large, central digital display, as well as upgraded radio altimeters, autopilots, and digital flight directors, and upgrades for various computer modules. “The jet that we are bringing home was built in 1958 and most of the instrumentation is original to the aircraft,” Lieutenant Colonel Shawn Streck, the maintenance commander for the 185th, said, according to Avionics . “This upgrade will put our aircraft on par with its civilian counterpart.” The Block 45 upgrade relies heavily on commercially available systems to both reduce cost and simplify up the modification process, which takes less than two months on average. The modifications make the jets safer and more reliable, as well as just providing a good opportunity to replace obsolete gear. The modernized KC-135R Block 45 cockpit., USAF Specifically, the improved KC-135s have systems that can connect seamlessly with civil navigation and air traffic control setups around the world, allowing them to safely transit through both civilian and military air space without any undue risk of accidents. The digital computers allow ground crews to easily install software updates to keep these systems up to date, too. On top of that, the new systems allow for the aircraft to take over some of the work KC-135 crews used to have to do manually, including transferring information from analog systems into digital ones. The updated equipment also provides more accurate maintenance alerts and data, speeding up the repair process if something breaks. The older KC-135R cockpit, full of analog dials and gauges, which is still in service as the Block 45 upgrades continue., USAF “Rather than us trying to troubleshoot and figure out what’s wrong with the system, the system is now better able to tell us exactly what’s wrong with it and what we need to replace,” Staff Sergeant Daniel Swinehart, a technician from the 507th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, part of the Air Force Reserve’s 507th Air Refueling Wing, said in an interview in 2016 . “Instead of analog gauges trying to talk with digital signals, it’s all digital now, so we don’t have to convert from one to the other.” The Air Force says these additions could keep the aircraft airworthy and capable through at least the 2040 fiscal year and possibly for another decade after that. As of 2014, the Air Force had more than 400 KC-135 in service across the active component, reserve, and Air National Guard. The present plan is to convert the entire fleet of KC-135s to the new standard by the end of 2024. Given both the increasing age of this fleet and the high demand for its services, it’s hard to overstate the importance of the Block 45 upgrade. The Air Force’s KC-135Rs are upgraded versions of older KC-135 models, the last of which rolled off Boeing’s production line in the early 1960s. The big change was the replacement of the older aircraft’s jet engines, four Pratt & Whitney J57s, with an equal number of more powerful and efficient CFM-56s. A KC-135R., USAF Much of the avionics and other cockpit components remained the same, just as they were when the Boeing engineers designed it in the early 1950s. Beyond the engine upgrades, there have been other, smaller upgrade programs over the years. The last of these, nicknamed Pacer Crag, ran from 1997 until 2001 and replaced various portions of the cockpit and fuel management system. In 2001, of course, the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred, kicking off what has now been nearly two decades of near constant conflict. Tanker support has been in high demand to support aerial campaigns across the Middle East , Central Asia , and Africa . On top of that, routine missions in Europe and the Pacific have also increased in response to a host a different security concerns, including, but not limited to international terrorism. The KC-135 provides by far the bulk of the aerial refueling for all of these missions. The Air Force has less than 60 KC-10 Extenders , which is its other major tanker. The service, along with the U.S. Marine Corps, has a number of smaller tankers based on the C-130 Hercules cargo plane, but primarily to support helicopter operations. So, in 2010, the Air Force began work on developing what turned into the Block 45 upgrade program. Between 2010 and 2016, the service spent more than $900 million doing the research and development on what it would take to upgrade the KC-135s, building the initial prototypes, and then starting to the kits in active, reserve, and Guard tankers, including the one from the 185th. One of the first two KC-135R Block 45 prototypes takes off in 2013., USAF The age of the aircraft meant adding the new equipment wasn’t as easy as it might sound. Engineers spent a significant amount of time working out how to fit everything into the early Cold War-era airframe. “Gutting old wiring and then reinstalling new kits, liquid crystal display screens, and supporting equipment is a multi-person job,” Belinda Schantz, the Block 45 unit chief at Tinker, said in an interview the Air Force published in January 2017. “Complicating the installation is having to work around installed controls such as the throttle quadrant and trim wheel located in the middle of the flight deck.” But by the end of 2016, the program had hit an important milestone, having converted 45 total tankers to the new standard. The year before, the Air Force had moved all of the upgrade work, which defense contractor Rockwell Collins provides, to a single shop at Tinker Air Force Base. At present, Rockwell Collins has secured more than $105 million to do the actual upgrade work, but its not clear whether this initial contract covers updating the entire KC-135 fleet. Still, this lucrative and long-term deal is probably among the many reasons why United Technologies Corporation, already a massive supplier of aircraft equipment that owns engine maker Pratt & Whitney, is interested in buying Rockwell Collins. A technician prepares the wiring ahead of the installation of Block 45 upgrades into the cockpit of a KC-135R., USAF There is a concern that at some point the KC-135’s basic structure will just give out, no matter how advanced the gear inside gets. The KC-135 turned 60 in 2016. If the Air Force does keep them in operation through to 2050, the very youngest ones will be nearly 90 years old. There’s also a reasonable debate to be had about the vulnerability of a decidedly non-stealthy support plane in an era of rapidly improving long-range integrated air defenses and low-observable multi-role combat aircraft. That doesn’t mean that even decades into the future there won’t be a role for these tankers, they will be just as useful for operations in permissive environments, tanking in otherwise well protected areas, and for testing and training purposes. Also, if the USAF doesn’t pursue a stealthy tanker, tactics and procurement will have to be adapted to accommodate the changing realities of the modern battlefield. The KC-135 could end up receiving survivability upgrades, like electronic warfare capabilities and surveillance systems that will allow them to better understand the threats around them. Even a laser defense system is a possibility. Perhaps more importantly, demand has only increased while the Air Force has struggled to purchase newer tankers. Delays have plagued Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus and it’s still unclear when the first of these will be ready for active service, let alone available in sufficient quantities to begin really easing the strain on the KC-135 fleet. As it stands now, the service is only expecting to purchase nearly 180 of the aircraft, with the first batch arriving in 2018 , too. It’s possible that contractor-operated tankers could help make up some remaining capability provided by the KC-135s, but not necessarily all of what a fleet of more than 400 planes provides. This means that, unless the global situation changes dramatically, there will be a need for many of the KC-135s for the foreseeable future and the Block 45 upgrade will help make sure they’re ready to go.

For the first time ever, U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters the service had forward deployed in Japan flew with U.S. Air Force B-1 bombers and Japanese and South Korean F-15s fighters in a show of force . The demonstration, which came after North Korea fired a missile over Japan , seems almost guaranteed to prompt a response from the reclusive Communist regime, but it might not be one the three allies would prefer. The mission, which lasted approximately 10 hours in total, occurred on Aug. 30, 2017.

O’Shaughnessy, head of the service’s top command in the Pacific, said in a statement . “This complex mission clearly demonstrates our solidarity with our allies and underscores the broadening cooperation to defend against this common regional threat.” Aerial demonstrations of force after North Korean missile launches have been a common occurrence for years , with B-1s flying from Guam long being an important component, often flying the missions with other U.S. and allied aircraft or even by themselves. Before this combined flight, the South Korean Air Force itself had already sent its F-15Ks to drop bombs out on the Pil-sung range in a somewhat dubious display of “ overwhelming force .” US Marine Corps F-35Bs fly with South Korean F-15Ks., Republic of Korea Air Force But the addition of the F-35Bs to the mix is a significant change. Though much of North Korea’s arsenal is aging, but it’s densely packed in very rugged terrain, meaning it could still pose a significant threat to non-stealthy aircraft in the opening phases of any conflict on the Korean Peninsula. There is also evidence that Pyongyang is looking at improving their air defenses, as well. In May 2017, they demonstrated the KN-06 surface-to-air missile , an apparent copy of the Chinese HQ-9, itself a clone of the Russian S-300. US Air Force B-1s, US Marine F-35Bs, and Japanese F-15Js in formation together., Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-35s have already taken part in other exercises in and around Japan and South Korea, though these have not been directly in response to North Korean actions. Japan is also a part of the of the Joint Strike Fighter program, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries unveiled the first F-35A it assembled in the country in June 2017 . The Japanese Air Self Defense Force expects to receive a total of 42 of the aircraft. Low observable aircraft would be essential in the open stages of any large-scale strike on North Korea, as the War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway explained in detail earlier in August 2017, noting: Finally, the B-1B is not going to gallantly waltz into North Korea and hit a series of targets around the country as part of a targeted preemptive strike against Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. And it definitely is not going to lead off a protracted air war over the country either. At best it would launch a series of cruise missiles from outside North Korean borders against lightly fortified targets, that is until corridors through North Korea’s air defenses have been opened up, or it would attack artillery positions along the DMZ. North Korea’s air defenses may not be advanced, although that too is changing to some degree, but they are dense and some of their systems are of the unpredictable road-mobile variety. Even with electronic warfare support and its low-altitude penetration capabilities, the B-1 is still vulnerable. Stealthy or expendable assets, such as the B-2, F-22 and cruise missiles, would initiate strikes, followed eventually by F-16CJs Wild Weasels and strike fighters to begin wiping up non-fixed surface-to-air missile and other integrated air defense system targets. All this will be supported by the full array of America’s space-based surveillance and cyber warfare capabilities. However, during this particular mission, the F-35s carried radar reflectors, which would make them visible to even civilian air traffic controllers, no doubt primarily to make sure the flight was as safe as possible. It also means that the North Koreans wouldn’t have been able to get a good sense of the aircraft’s actual radar signature. As we’ve noted in the past about other exercises involving the Joint Strike Fighter, there is the possibility that the Joint Strike Fighters may have been gathering useful intelligence on North Korea’s defenses themselves with their own extensive sensor suite . Still, though clearly intended to send a message to North Korea and its premier Kim Jong-un, the structure of the actual exercise seemed more focused on reassuring Japan and South Korea of America’s commitments to their security than on intimidating anyone. Though impressive looking for the camera, the large, tight formation flying is hardly what one would expect to see during any actual strikes on North Korean targets. South Korean F-15Ks release strings of dumb bombs on Pil-sung., Republic of Korea Air Force The B-1s and South Korean F-15Ks only dropped dumb bombs over Pil-sung – which translates to “Sure Victory” by the way – rather than any of the guided or stand-off weapons that either of the aircraft can carry. The Marine F-35Bs did drop 1,000lb GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions practice bombs, the largest weapon the B models can carry. Marine F-35Bs drop training JDAMs over Pil-sung., Republic of Korea Air Force The mission, which fits perfectly with long-standing North Korean propaganda that the United States and its “puppet” allies are actively preparing an attack, will almost assuredly provoke a reaction from Kim Jong-un, but it seems unlikely that it will be conciliatory in nature. North Korea already said it only shot the Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missile past the Japanese home islands in response to the annual U.S.-South Korean Ulchi-Freedom Guardian military drills. Mixed messaging from the Trump Administration and President Donald Trump himself can only make it more difficult for these shows of force to convey whatever the Pentagon truly wants to signal. Despite weeks of U.S. officials stressing that diplomacy was their preferred solution to the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Trump took to Twitter on Aug. 30, 2017 to declare that “talking is not the answer!” It’s one thing when the President and the military appear to disagree and another entirely when the military itself seems to be contradicting itself over the situation, which seems to have been the case in recent weeks, adding to the potential confusion. Ahead of this year’s Ulchi-Freedom Guardian exercise, many observers noted that the drills looked set to be significantly muted, possibly with an eye toward downplaying tensions and encouraging the regime in Pyongyang to similar show restraint. Secretary of Defense James Mattis insisted this wasn’t the case when talking to reporters on Aug. 21, 2017. “The numbers are by design to achieve the exercise objectives,” he said. “You know, the exercise is set up months in advance.” Japan Air Self-Defense Force Afterwards, though, the U.S. military went on the record to say that it had deliberately decided not to send any B-1s to take part in Ulchi-Freedom Guardian specifically hoping to generate some good will with the North Koreans. The only problem is that there were no public statements about these changes ahead of the start of Ulchi-Freedom Guardian that we can discern. “The U.S. did not dispatch bombers during the recently concluded exercise in hopes that the reduced scale would send a positive signal to North Korea and the region,” U.S. Army General Vincent K. Brooks, head of U.S. Forces Korea and head of the U.S. South Korean Combined Forces Command, said in a notice his command released on Aug. 31, 2017. “Instead, North Korea responded to the gesture with rehearsals of special operations raids against South Korean islands, three short range missile firings, and one intermediate range ballistic missile that overflew Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. Apparently the changes in the exercise did not matter.” Republic of Korea Air Force It not difficult to understand how North Korea could have missed this “gesture,” especially when American officials were otherwise downplaying the change. On top of that, B-1 bombers had been making repeated flights to the Peninsula earlier in August 2017 as part of other routine training missions and earlier other shows of force, so their absence from Ulchi-Freedom Guardian may not have been as obvious as General Brooks and others may have hoped. We don’t know how North Korea will respond to the message of this new, major show of force, but it’s hard to believe they’ll let it go unchallenged. On Aug. 29, 2017, North Korean state media described its provocative missile launch past Japan as a “ meaningful prelude ” to containing the U.S. military forces on the island of Guam. They had previously threatened to launch their own show of force near the American territory with multiple IRBMs, but then decided to take a “ wait and see ” approach. Now we’re all waiting to see what message actually got across to the North Koreans and what their response will be in return.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 6, 2020",U.S. Navy’s Hugely Versatile SM-6 Missile Keeps Scoring Hits,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Navy have successfully intercepted a surrogate medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) with a pair of Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) surface-to-air missiles during a test off the coast of Hawaii. This is the second time the SM-6 has knocked down an MRBM-type weapon and the third time it has hit a ballistic missile of any kind. It also comes as concerns about ballistic missile programs in North Korea and elsewhere around the world are growing. As part of the continued development of the complete Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, U.S. military personnel launched the mock MRBM from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii early on Aug. 30, 2017. The Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS John Paul Jones subsequently tracked the missile using its on board AN/SPY-1 radar and then fired two SM-6s at it during the experiment, also known as Flight Test Standard Missile-27 Event 2 (FTM-27 E2). Ballistic missile target being fired from Kauai for FTM-27 E2., MDA “We are working closely with the fleet to develop this important new capability, and this was a key milestone in giving our Aegis BMD ships an enhanced capability to defeat ballistic missiles in their terminal phase,” MDA Director U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Sam Greaves said in a statement . “We will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves.” In August 2015, an SM-6 intercepted a short-range ballistic missile target. Then, in December 2016, one of the missiles successfully destroyed a surrogate MRBM for the first time. The U.S. Navy has had SM-6, also known as the RIM-174A Extended Range Active Missile (ERAM), in service since 2013, but primarily as a traditional air defense weapon targeting air-breathing threats such as aircraft and cruise missiles. Since then, the weapon’s manufacturer Raytheon has been working with MDA to expand its ability to intercept both MBRM and shorter-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phases of flight, as they fall onto their targets. SM-6 fits into any standard Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cell and also now features a secondary surface- and land-attack capability. The overall concept is for the SM-6 to complement the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), which is a dedicated ballistic missile interceptor. Also known as the RIM-161A, SM-3 has the ability to engage intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBM), as well as hit shorter-ranged ballistic missiles in the middle of their flight, owing to its own higher altitude performance. This is called mid-course intercept capability. MDA “Earlier this year, our customer requested an enhanced capability to deal with a sophisticated medium-range ballistic missile threat,” Mike Campisi, Raytheon’s SM-6 senior program director, said in a separate statement about the August 30 test. “We did all this – the analysis, coding and testing – in seven months; a process that normally takes one to two years.” MDA stressed it had planned the test long in advance and that it was not in response to any particular world events. Still, it is difficult, especially given Raytheon’s statement, not to see it in light of North Korea’s increasingly advanced ballistic missile development programs . North Korea launches a Hwasong-12 IRBM on Aug. 29, 2017., KCNA On Aug. 28, 2017, the reclusive dictatorship sent a Hwasong-12 IRBM flying straight over Japan’s Hokkaido Island, prompting warnings in that country about a potential incoming attack, before the missile plunged into the Pacific Ocean. This was the latest and perhaps most provocative test of the year, which has also seen multiple successful launches of North Korea’s first real ICBM design, known as the Hwasong-14 , which can likely reach significant portions of the continental United States. Unless a SM-6 equipped U.S. Navy surface combatant was patrolling in an enemy missile’s target areas, their SM-6 missiles would likely not be of much use and the SM-6 has not been tested against IRBMs or ICBMs, such as the Hwasong-12 and -14 respectively. Still, it is an important part of the U.S. military’s plans for a layered missile defense shield, able to take down the kind of shorter-range weapons that North Korea fired off earlier in August 2017 in protest to annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises. BMD With enhanced terminal intercept capability, Aegis BMD ships can also be deployed near suspected targets areas, like say off the coast off Okinawa, where the U.S. has large air bases. With a combination of SM-3 and SM-6 onboard, a single vessel could provide both mid-course and terminal ballistic missile defense capabilities once on station. Given North Korea’s increasing belligerence, Japan had already been exploring the possibility adding Aegis Ashore missile defense sites to supplement its Aegis-equipped ships, most of which have ballistic missile capability, too. In May 2017, the War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway provided an in depth look at why this made particularly good sense, especially when employing both SM-3 and SM-6 missiles. Notably, Japan is already working together with the United States on the development of the SM-3 interceptor , contributing to the design and production of components. The addition of the SM-6, which the U.S. government has approved its sale to allies, to the Japanese military’s arsenal would only make its ships and any shore-based facilities more versatile. In the case of Aegis ashore, it would also make the installations more survivable against high-volume saturation attacks. On Aug. 30, 2017, Reuters report s that three unnamed sources had confirmed the Japanese military was pushing ahead with plans to have Aegis Ashore batteries operational by 2023. In addition, Japan had reportedly asked the U.S. government for the ability to purchase Raytheon’s advanced AN/SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) to go along with them. Already in development for the U.S. Navy, the radar is eminently scalable system, being made up of a number of self-contained emitters, each inside its own two square foot container. The standard AMDR has 37 of these so-called “radar modular assemblies,” but the design means Raytheon could reconfigure same gallium-nitride-based technology to fit almost any platform. These electronically scanned units can perform individual functions or operate linked together to focus their combined energy on a single task. Concerns about how sending the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile system to South Korea might impact relations with the Chinese government had been a major consideration ahead of that deployment. There is the possibility that similar issues could have an impact on sales of Aegis Ashore and SPY-6 radar to Japan. But with the Trump Administration’s increasing sanctions on Chinese nationals and businesses over North Korea weapons programs, as well as President Donald Trump himself often criticizing China over North Korea situation, this may not be the issue it once was, though. And considering that North Korea is now sending ballistic missiles over Japan’s population centers, the arguments against a need for Aegis Ashore would be dubious at best. But beyond North Korea, the SM-6 represents an increasingly important capability for the U.S. Navy, and its allies, broadly, as ballistic missile threats proliferate around the world. Most seriously, China has been expanding its own arsenal of these long range weapons, including the DF-21D anti-ship MRBM and the DF-26 anti-ship IRBM. Both types are specifically designed for engaging large maritime targets, such as aircraft carriers, over great distances. MDA There have even been reports that the People’s Liberation Army is interested in developing an air-launch capability for the DF-21D, as well. Equipped with SM-6s, Aegis BMD capable surface combatants escorting Navy carrier battle groups would be able to offer an important additional defense against these weapons and any other similar future anti-ship ballistic missile designs. With SM-3s and SM-6s, the ships could also stand watch against threats inbound to other strategic American facilities throughout the Pacific, including Guam . In all of these cases, ships with the missiles could make use of the U.S. Navy’s increasingly networked sensor architecture to extend their target detection and engagement ranges. In a not too distant future, this integrated network, now dubbed Navy Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA), could include information coming in from other ships in a carrier battle group or other naval surface task forces, E-2 Hawkeye radar aircraft, P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , drones, as well as assets from other services in the air and on land. Road-mobile DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles., Imaginechina via AP Images Under this concept, a Super Hornet operating outside the radar range of a U.S. Navy cruiser can use its own sensors to detect and engage an aerial target, but instead of firing its own missile, a SM-6 from said cruiser flies out and kills the target. This is accomplished all via data link architecture, and the SM-6 is uniquely capable of supporting such a concept. On top of that, the SM-6 could give the Arleigh Burkes the Navy has tasked in part with missile defense more flexibility to operate in more tightly constrained areas elsewhere, including the Baltic and Black Seas in Europe, which Russia would be able to quickly saturate with aircraft and shore-based defenses in any potential conflict. Especially in the Black Sea, where an international treaty limits the total number of warships the U.S. Navy can operate there at any one time, the versatility of the SM-6 would be especially significant, offering American commanders anti-aircraft, anti-surface, and limited ballistic missile defense all in one weapon. The Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Carney departs the Black Sea in July 2017., USN For allies, the missiles could similarly improve the capabilities of existing ships, especially smaller surface combatants with limited  Mark 41 Vertical Launch System space for weapons to begin with. Though they might not have the necessary sensors to take advantage of its ballistic missile defense features, the SM-6 would still be a dual purpose anti-aircraft and surface- or land-attack weapon. And as with the notional Aegis Ashore systems in Japan, the facility in Romania and the up-coming site in Poland could gain the ability to take on an expanded scope of targets, and better protect themselves, with a combination of SM-3s and SM-6s. This latest SM-6 test increases overall confidence in the Aegis BMD concept and underscores the missile’s growing flexibility and value. It will be interesting to see how the missile continues to evolve. But already, just half a decade into its operational life, its multi-pronged abilities are downright impressive and they are only going to get better. Maybe a next generation SM-6 will take advantage of the SM-3 Block IIA’s thicker rocket “stack,” increasing its range against air, surface, and land targets, and its ability to swat down incoming ballistic missiles. The bottom line is that the SM-6 looks like it is primed to be the Navy’s multi-role networked missile of choice for the foreseeable future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 25, 2019",Hezbollah Buses ISIS Fighters Across Syria As US Mulls Striking Convoy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tensions in southern Syria have flared following an agreement between Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah militants and ISIS that sent air-conditioned bus loads of the terrorists and their families east toward the Iraqi border. The deal has sparked anger in Iraq and with its U.S.-led coalition allies, who launched air strikes to block its progress, but not destroy it directly. On Aug. 28, 2017, approximately 300 ISIS members and an equal number of family members, including young children, began to depart their camps in the Qalamoun Mountains near the Lebanon-Syria border civilian buses with the message “happy journey” emblazoned on their sides, as well as ambulances and other small trucks. The next day, the convoy had begun to enter Syria’s Deir al-Zor governorate to the east. Having monitored the progress of the convoy, U.S. military aircraft cratered a road and bombed at least one bridge in order to slow its progress, but did not directly attack the convoy, according to an official statement. Separate air strikes in Deir al-Zor did destroy “individual vehicles and fighters that were clearly identified as ISIS.” “The coalition was not party to this agreement between Lebanon, Hezbollah and ISIS,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the top spokesman for the U.S.-led task force fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, had told reporters earlier on Aug. 30, 2017. “ISIS is a global threat, and relocating terrorists from one place to another is not a lasting solution.” Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant organization that the United States, the European Union and others consider to be a terrorist group, brokered the deal, which saw the return of the bodies of eight soldiers from Lebanon’s national military. ISIS had captured and murdered them during their initial incursion into Lebanese territory in 2014. Hezbollah, which receives funding, weapons, and other support from Iran and Syria, has been fighting both rebels and terrorists on behalf of the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad since 2012. It is also a member of Lebanon’s democratically elected government, though observers question its commitment to those institutions since it maintains a number of parallel organizations, including its own separate standing military. A armored personnel vehicle belonging to Hezbollah forces in Syria., AP Photo/Bilal Hussein “We came and took responsibility by going to negotiations,” Hezbollah’s leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, who lives in hiding to avoid targeted strikes from Israel, said about the arrangement. “Hezbollah’s answer was categorical, that is, any solution, whether it be partial or whole, must first include the fate of the soldiers.” Whether this is true or not, removing the ISIS members from the border area helps Hezbollah secure and consolidate its position in the region, as well as giving the Syrian government important breathing room to focus its energies on anti-regime rebels. It also allows the Lebanese military to declare victory in its own mission to remove the terrorists from the area with a minimum of effort. The United States has been helping supply Lebanese military with millions of dollars worth of new military equipment in order to fight and defeat the terrorists, as well as improve its overall capabilities compared to Hezbollah, most recently delivering an initial batch of M2 Bradley infantry fight vehicles earlier in August 2017. At the same time, while Lebanon has staunchly denied it is actively working with Hezbollah and Syrian forces in the operation along the border, it is difficult to believe that the three groups could be fighting in the same area and avoid each other without significant coordination. As such, other parties in the region were not inclined to take a less than charitable view of the terrorist busing, especially since the recent Lebanese military offensive into their side of the Qalamoun Mountains had largely pushed the remaining terrorists into a small pocket on the other side of the border in areas under the control of Hezbollah and the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad. “Honestly speaking, we are unhappy and consider it incorrect,” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters on Aug. 29, 2017. “Transferring terrorists from Qalamoun to the Iraqi-Syrian border is worrying and an insult to the [Iraqi] people.” Iraq’s Kurdish Regional Government registered similar complaints and the U.S. special presidential envoy for the coalition to defeat ISIS, Brett McGurk, took to Twitter to decry the deal. McGurk slammed the decision to give “irreconcilable” terrorists safe passage and said the American-led coalition would never let them enter Iraq or otherwise “escape from what remains of their dwindling ‘caliphate.’” But as is increasingly the case in Syria, the United States and its allies and partners face an increasingly difficult set of questions about how to proceed. At present, based on the information that has been made available, the U.S. military’s rules of engagement in Syria allow them to strike ISIS targets directly, support partner forces who are engaged in operations against the terrorist group, and exercise their right of self defense against any party that threatens American personnel or the forces they’re working with in the country. But any decision to further attack the convoy, which contains innocent civilians, could create significant problems in of itself. “We’ve seen ISIS use protective sites like hospitals and mosques, seen them drive in ambulances,” Colonel Dillon added . “So if we do identify and find ISIS fighters who have weapons – and like I said, we can discriminate between civilians and ISIS fighters – we will strike when we can. If we are able to do so, we will.” So far, there have been no reports of collateral damage during air strikes against the convoy and those intended to impede its movement. Still, independent monitoring groups may challenge this assertion that the coalition can so readily determine who is a terrorist and who isn’t, which often a painfully difficult process at the best of times. There has been an apparent spike in innocents inadvertently caught in coalition air strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent months. While reported civilian casualties appeared to decline between June and July 2017, it was still the fourth worst month on record for such incidents since the coalition air campaign against ISIS began in 2014, according to Airwars , a leading organization that tracks and seeks to determine the veracity of such claims. The situation in Deir al-Zor is already complicated without the arrival of new ISIS fighters and their dependents. The Syrian government, along with its Russian and Iranian allies, is actively seeking to wrest control of the strategic province from ISIS and rebel forces and has been for years. At the same, the U.S.-led coalition is supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the governorate, a coalition of Kurdish and Arab groups, to fight ISIS, but who are generally opposed to the Assad regime. Earlier in August 2017, the SDF’s Deir al-Zor council suggested it was about to begin operations against ISIS in the governorate. Colonel Dillon downplayed this suggestion to Reuters, insisting the focus remained singularly on ejecting the terrorists from their de facto capital in Raqqa to the north. A Syrian Arab Army T-72 tank rolls out in Deir al-Zor., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik  via AP It wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. military has given apparent mixed signals about an offensive in the area either. In June 2016, the U.S. military had briefly supported a push by the New Syrian Army (NSA) rebel group into the Syrian city of Al Bukamal near the Iraqi border. However, after assisting the initial offensive, reports suggested that American commanders redirected critical air support to other fighting in Iraq, leaving the NSA to the mercy of ISIS, who swiftly defeated them and retook control of the area. The Daily Beast described the events at the time as a “ Bay-of-Pigs-style fiasco ,” referring to the abortive attempt by U.S.-trained Cuban émigrés to invade Cuba and depose Fidel Castro in 1961. Perhaps more importantly, the movement of ISIS fighters threatens to upset the U.S.-coalition’s priorities while giving the Syrian government and Hezbollah, as well as Assad’s other allies, space to consolidate their gains . This in turn could worry America’s partners, including the SDF, who appear increasingly concerned about what will happen in Syria after the United States declares victory against the terrorists. US-supported SDF fighters take up positions in Raqqa., Morukc Umnaber/picture-alliance/dpa/AP This is something we at The War Zone have recently explored in detail with regards to the multi-party conflict, one separate from the one against ISIS, that is threatening to emerge in northern Syria. Many of these same issues, including the danger of differing agendas causing dangerous rifts between the United States and the SDF as the threat of ISIS declines, apply equally to the growing tensions along Syria’s southern flanks. With the differing factions already operating in Deir al-Zor, the U.S.-led coalition’s desire to halt the movement of the ISIS convoy could yet again increase the risk for a dangerous interaction with any number of other potentially hostile groups. We have already seen Iranian-backed militias repeatedly challenge American forces and their partners further south in the town of At Tanf. Whatever happens with the convoy specifically, it seems that every day only brings more complexities to the fight against ISIS in Syria, even as the terrorist group loses more ground.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2019",Russian Armor Rolls Into Kurdish Town As US and Turkish-Backed Forces Skirmish,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. forces in northern Syria have exchanged fire with Turkish-backed rebels for the first time ever as the situation in the country continues to become ever more complex. To the west, Russian troops have moved into another area along the Syrian-Turkish border, cutting a deal with Kurdish fighters and effectively blocking both Turkish and American forces from entering the area, while exposing possible rifts between the United States and the groups it supports in the region. The firefight involving American troops occurred near the contested city of Manbij in Syria, which has been a focal point for simmering tensions between United States and Turkish-supported factions since March 2017 . This was the first time U.S. personnel had been directly involved in a clash, though, and thankfully no one was injured on either side. “Our forces did receive fire and return fire and then moved to a secure location,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillion, the top spokesman for the U.S.-led task force fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, told the The Telegraph . “We have told Turkey it is not acceptable.” U.S. officials have not named the specific group they faced off against, though they have made it clear they understand it was one from a loose coalition of ethnic Arab and Turkmen organizations that Turkish authorities are working with in Syria sometimes referred to as the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA). SDF snipers in Raqqa., Morukc Umnaber/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images Between August 2016 and March 2017, Turkey had conducted its own unilateral operation against various Kurdish groups northern Syria, called Operation Euphrates Shield . After that ended, the country continued to support the TFSA as a hedge against the Kurds making further gains. The Turkish government sees the Kurdish factions in Syria as an extension of a domestic terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, better known by its Kurdish acronym PKK. Though the United States has also formally designated the PKK as terrorists, it insists the Kurds it is working with in Syria against ISIS, known as the People’s Protection Units or YPG, are separate and distinct. The video below succinctly outlines Turkey’s position on the connections between the PKK and the YPG, which the United States disputes. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7J0zFSRWRsk We at The War Zone have written at length in the past about how these complicated and often shifting allegiances, combined with the lack of clarity over America’s role in Syria after the defeat of ISIS – whatever that looks like – have increased the chances of U.S. troops and their partners ending up in a risky situation. With American special operators acting as de facto peacekeepers for months , this firefight near Manbij has seemed almost inevitable. “Coalition troops will continue performing patrols within the Manbij Military Council area of control,” Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, told CNN after the incident with the Turkish-support rebels. “Coalition forces are there to monitor, deter hostilities and ensure all parties remain focused on our common enemy and the greatest threat to regional and world security, ISIS.” Keeping the focus on ISIS is important for the United States, which has special operations forces closely assisting the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as they work to secure the city of Raqqa, which has been the terrorist group’s de facto capital. The SDF predominantly consists of element of the YPG, along with a smaller number of Arab fighters. SDF fighters take cover in a building in Raqqa., Morukc Umnaber/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images The fighting in Raqqa has been hard going and any diversion of effort or dangerous infighting might slow the offensive down even further. In July 2017, the Trump Administration ended support for certain Arab members of the so-called Vetted Syrian Opposition (VSO), a separate U.S. supported coalition, who had refused to stop battling the brutal regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and refocus on ISIS. Earlier in August 2017, Jaish al Thuwar, a Kurdish faction aligned with the YPG and the SDF, reportedly fired a U.S.-supplied TOW anti-tank missile at Turkish-backed rebels as part of ongoing skirmishes. In that instance, the U.S. military said that while the Kurdish group was known to have connections with the SDF, it was not an American-supported group itself. The United States also trying to distance itself from these breakaway Kurdish elements. In line with keeping things laser focused on crushing ISIS, earlier in August 2017, the United States said it would establish a shared ceasefire monitoring center with Russian and Jordanian personnel in Jordan’s capital Amman. The U.S. government had previously brokered a deal with the Kremlin, along with Jordan and Israel, to establish a safe zone of sorts in southern Syria. Turkish troops head toward the Syrian border in an armored vehicle in 2016., Ismail Coskun, IHA via AP But as the threat of ISIS begins to recede, it seems clear that many factions in Syria are already looking to the future, if they haven’t been before now.  At the same time, there appear to be serious rifts starting to form between the United States and its Syrian partners, many of whom have their own agendas. One of the first indications of this was on Aug. 23, 2017, when an SDF spokesman suggested the U.S. military was planning to have a long-term presence in Syria after ISIS was gone. The Pentagon and the State Department quickly refuted this claim . Then, on Aug. 25, 2017, the SDF’s Deir al-Zor Council, further to the west of Raqqa, said it would soon begin a separate offensive against ISIS in that province, according to its commander Ahmed Abu Khawla. This Arab component of the U.S.-supported rebel coalition said it had just bolstered its ranks with approximately 800 new fighters from the Syrian Elite Army, yet another separate, but SDF-aligned faction. When asked about this, though, Colonel Dillon told Reuters that the focus remained on Raqqa alone. It was unclear what, if any support the U.S. military would be willing to provide for a push into Deir al-Zor, where Russian troops and Iranian-backed militias are also seeking control. Iran in particular is interested in creating a physical lifeline between itself and its allies in Syria and Lebanon , via Iraq. Now it also seems that the YPG may be growing concerned about the U.S. government’s intentions in the country and its willingness or ability to guarantee the group’s security. On Aug. 29, 2017, Russian troops moved into the town of Afrin, a major hub for the Kurdish group, mimicking in many ways the appearance of U.S. Army Rangers in Strykers in and around Manbij four moths earlier. Most notably, the Russian vehicles, like their American counterparts , also sported large national flags making sure there was no confusion about the vehicles’ operators. Russia and the YPG’s leadership struck a deal that appeared to effectively keep Turkey and its allies, as well as the United States and its coalition, out of the area. “The duty of the military observers is to maintain security conditions,” the Kurdish group said, according to Iraqi Kurdish news outlet Rudaw . The arrangement comes less than a month after the YPG warned that harassment from Turkish supported groups could threaten the Raqqa offensive, adding that it had informed its American partners about the issue. “If the Turkish state continued its occupation attacks against Afrin and Shahba, the Raqqa operation will not continue,” the YPG’s General Ccmmander Sipan Hemo declared. However, if this weren’t complicated enough, there were reports in July 2017 that this might be part of a larger agreement between the Kremlin and Turkish officials, which would see Russian and Syrian troops cede the city of Idlib to Turkey’s Arab and Turkmen partners. Russia, Turkey and Iran have all been separately negotiating for a series of so-called “ de-escalation zones ” throughout Syria. On Aug. 24, 2017, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a new safe zone would soon appear around Idlib , but made no mention of any plans for Afrin. Militiamen with the Pro-Syrian government Desert Falcons in Palmyra in 2016., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP Syria, Russia, and Iran are separately looking to be coordinating their efforts in order to shore up their relative positions and protect their increasingly intertwined interests in the region. Most worrisome, Iran appears to be actively supporting the Syrian government’s work on new arms factories , which may be able to produce ballistic missiles . There is evidence that Russia, or Syria with Russian-supplied weaponry, may have positioned long-range surface-to-air missiles at this site to provide an active defense. On Aug. 25, 2017, the Russian military announced it had formally linked its air defense assets in the country with Assad’s own air defense network. Needless to say, the United States was already in the middle of a complex multi-side conflict in Syria. The situation is only getting more complicated by the day and the temerity of the various factions seems to be growing at an equal pace as they attempt to begin staking their claims for whatever happens when ISIS finally breaks. “You’ve got to really play this thing very carefully. … The closer we get [to defeating ISIS] the more complex it gets,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis said back in June 2017. “We just refuse to get drawn into a fight there in the Syria civil war.” These first remarks are as true as ever and don’t look to be changing any time soon. However, the United States is increasingly in danger of getting pulled into the country’s long-running civil conflict, whether it says it doesn’t want to be involved or not. The act of not getting involved carries its own weight, too, which runs the risk of alienating important partners before the coalition declares victory against ISIS.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 25, 2019",US Air Force B-1 Bombers Are Hunting Drug Smugglers From Key West,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you happened to glance at Google Earth’s satellite imagery of Naval Air Station Key West in Florida recently, you may have noticed something that might seem odd. A trio of B-1 Bones from the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas are sitting on the flight line. The swing-wing bombers aren’t there poised for a strike on Cuba or somewhere else in the Caribbean, but instead as part of a routine, if largely unknown mission that has them looking for drug smugglers. For more than a decade, the U.S. Air Force has deployed B-1s, as well as B-52H Stratofortresses, E-3 AWACS, E-8C JSTARS (JSTARS), and supporting KC-135 tankers in support of counterdrug efforts in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Unique interagency task forces – Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) situated in Key West and Joint Interagency Task Force-West (JIATF-W) in Hawaii – coordinate these missions as part of a whole-of-government approach. These headquarters bring together members of the U.S. military, U.S. Intelligence Community, and American law enforcement agencies, as well as representatives from other nations in their respective regions. “Obviously finding boats doesn’t seem like something a bomber would do,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Nick Yates, then commander of the 9th Bomb Squadron at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, said in an official interview in 2016. “We look at this as an opportunity to – we are flying over large amounts of water, which we don’t have in West Texas and integrating with multiple naval-coast guard-type assets.” “Part of our current mission is to go out and find all types of different targets,” U.S. Air Force Major Michael Flick, Weapons and Tactics Chief for the 9th Bomb Squadron at the time, added. “This gives an opportunity to go down to an area that we don’t typically operate out of and it’s a good opportunity for us to go exercise those combat capabilities that we have and are ready to execute, but don’t necessarily get the opportunity to very much.” Three B-1s sit on the ramp at Naval Air Station Key West in March 2017., Google Earth Both men were speaking after Operation Big Week, a week-long surge in existing efforts in support of JIATF-S and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in August 2016. These missions also included Air Force manned and unmanned reconnaissance aircraft one might otherwise expect to be involved, along with land-based radar sites the service operates in the Caribbean and Latin America in cooperation with America’s regional allies. U.S. forces and their partners seized or “disrupted” the smuggling of a total of six tons of cocaine during the operation. Disruption in this case commonly means that the drug traffickers chose to dump their cargo into the sea before trying to flee. The six tons in this one week was two percent of the total amount JIATF-S seized – 282 tons – in the entire 2016 fiscal year. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Aq6KNpYaLQ Unable to directly engage the traffickers, since the goal is to detain them not kill them, the bombers look for the boats, monitor their movements, and pass the information along to naval and coast guard elements on the surface via a centralized air operations centers. Those forces then disrupt or apprehend the suspected criminals. The use of Air Force and other U.S. military aircraft to hunt for drug smugglers isn’t new, of course. Since the earliest days of America’s controversial War on Drugs, spy planes and other surveillance aircraft in particular have been key components of the effort. The United States has arranged deals with various countries to operate a network of so-called “cooperation security locations” and “forward operative locations” around the Caribbean, Central, and South America as launching pads for these reconnaissance sorties. Over the years, the Air Force has deployed RC-135V/W Rivet Joint and C-130 Senior Scout signals intelligence aircraft, U-2 Dragon Lady spy planes, and RQ-4 drones “south of the border” for counter-drug related tasks, with the flights referred to with  colorful nicknames such as Palmetto Emerald, Seminole Wind, and Shark Axe. Two E-3 AWACS, a RC-135V/W Rivet Joint, and two KC-135 tankers share the ramp at the forward operating location in Curacao in The Netherlands Antilles., USAF These assets are always in high demand and there’s always a desire for more intelligence. This is especially true when it comes to trying to keep tabs on huge swaths of open ocean in the dead of night. Over the years, drug smugglers have only made themselves more difficult to spot, constructing semi-submersible “ narco subs ” and other heavily customized boats . “For the past several years, our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and other force requirements have not been met due to competing global priorities,” U.S. Navy Admiral Kurt Tidd, head of SOUTHCOM, explained in his annual posture statement in April 2017. “We have felt these impacts most acutely in our Detection and Monitoring (D&M) mission, where we have long received less than a quarter of our maritime and airborne requirements.” This is where so-called “non-traditional” ISR have come into play. This refers to using combat aircraft, including high performance multi-role fighter jets, in a reconnaissance role, making use of their existing electro-optical, infrared, radars, and other sensors. The targeting pods on F-16 Viper and F/A-18 Hornet fighters for instance can easily double as a surveillance tool. This briefing slide gives a sense of the scope of activity SOUTHCOM has to try and monitor., SOUTHCOM During the 1990s, the Air National Guard rotated F-15 and F-16 squadrons through deployments to Howard Air Force Base in the Panama Canal Zone for exactly this reason. This mission, nicknamed Coronet Nighthawk, provided what was effectively a realistic training exercise given that drug traffickers had no way to challenge the high-flying aircraft. But in November 1999, the United States returned the Panama Canal to the Panama and shut down its permanent military presence in the country. When operating from bases in the continental United States and Puerto Rico, the limited range of fighter jets for the over-water surveillance mission became readily apparent. The Air National Guard ended Coronet Nighthawk deployments entirely in August 2001. After 9/11, the demands on fighter squadrons increased as the domestic alert role gained renewed significance, as well. A B-52 intercepts the US Navy logistics ship USNS 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo during a demonstration in 2007., USAF Even so, bombers and larger radar aircraft like the E-8C, especially when supported by KC-135 tankers, offer significantly more time on station when operating from state-side bases compared to fighters or attack aircraft. As part of their increasing close air support role, both the B-1B and B-52H now carry the same kind of targeting pods as those smaller Air Force aircraft, as well. On top of that, there has been a push to revitalize the anti-ship and maritime interdiction roles for American bombers. This is especially true in light of growing operational demands in the Western Pacific with a particular eye towards countering Chinese claims in regions such as the South China Sea . In June 2014, the Air Force revealed that it had tested the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye active electronically-scanned radar pod on a B-52 bomber, specifically focusing on improving its ability to find and track hostile ships. More recently, earlier in August 2017, a B-1 successfully fired an AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), demonstrating its own expanding maritime capability . https://youtube.com/watch?v=sgX27QnitLo As Major Flick noted after Big Week in 2016, having bombers, as well as JSTARS, fly counter-drug missions in the Caribbean and elsewhere gives crews an opportunity to hone these skill sets against real world targets, but in a permissive environment. It’s also a readily available option in the absence of other alternatives. “A single JSTARS sortie can cover the same search area as 10 maritime patrol aircraft sorties,” U.S. Marine Corps General John Kelly, then commander of SOUTHCOM, said in his own annual posture statement in 2015. “The use of these types of assets is a ‘win-win’ for U.S. Southern Command and the Services; we receive much-needed assets while the Services receive pre-deployment training opportunities in a ‘target-rich’ environment.” It’s not necessarily the most cost-effective solution to chronic shortfalls, though, given how expensive it is to fly B-1 and B-52 bombers and the relatively limited “soda-straw” surveillance capability they provide with their targeting pods. A smaller business jet or multi-engine turboprop could easily carry similar equipment at significantly lower cost. The B-1’s Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, seen here, provides the bulk of the aircraft’s “surveillance” capability., USAF So, it’s not surprising that in his 2017 posture review, Admiral Tidd noted that the Air Force had secured contractor-operated maritime surveillance aircraft to help off-set additional reductions in his already limited airborne intelligence resources. The service has already been working with the Sierra Nevada Corporation for years to operate and maintain a small number of Bombardier Dash-8 reconnaissance aircraft as part of a project first known as Prospector and then renamed Pale Ale. One of these aircraft crashed along the Colombia-Panama border in October 2013 , tragically killing four of the six individuals on board. However, it’s unclear whether the new aircraft have or will fulfill all of Tidd’s command’s reconnaissance needs. In the meantime, As the satellite imagery from March 2017 shows, Air Force bombers continue to be an important, if non-traditional, option.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",Trump Says Finland Is Buying New F/A-18 Hornets. They’re Not.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In shared remarks with the President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, President Donald Trump has praised the Scandinavian country’s military and its modernization project. In answer questions, he appeared to either misspeak about or outright misstate the status a key component of those efforts, suggesting incorrectly that the Finnish Air Force was in the process of buying new F/A-18 Hornet or Super Hornet fighter jets to replace its existing Hornet fleet. The comments came near the end of a joint press conference at the White House following a bi-lateral meeting between the two presidents. A Finnish journalist asked what support the United States would be willing to provide if its relationship with Russia deteriorated to a dangerous level. We at The War Zone have written numerous times in the past the Kremlin’s revanchist foreign policy, especially in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea region , which has included veiled threats against Finland . “Our relationship with Finland is a very close one and we’re always ready to help Finland,” Trump said. “One of the things that is happening is you’re purchasing large amounts of our great F-18 aircraft from Boeing and it’s one of the great planes, the great fighter jets.” Notwithstanding that this would be a weapons sale, not direct support from the U.S. military or other elements of the U.S. government, Finland is not purchasing new F/A-18 aircraft at this time, though they do operate more than 60 Hornets already. It is unclear what Trump thought he was referring to with the unscripted response. A Finnish F-18C, in front, refuels, while an F-18D flights in the background., USAF Trump’s talk of a major purchase seemed to indicate he was referring to Finland’s fighter replacement project, known in the country as HX.  However, Finland does not even expect to formally request bids for that project until sometime in the first half of 2018. Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is in the running, along with Lockheed Martin’s F-16 and F-35 stealth fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon , France’s Dassault Rafale , and Sweden’s Gripen E . Needless to say, it’s a competitive field and there’s no guarantee that even if Boeing wins that the F/A-18E/F will be the plane it delivers. So far, Finland has budgeted between $7 and $11 billion for the project as a whole. The F/A-18E/F could have a slight advantage because of Finland’s experience with the Hornet, but the Super Hornet is substantially different from the older aircraft, even with the MLU upgrades. Finland hopes to complete tests of the competitors’ aircraft in 2019 and then, combined with the information from their bids, make a final selection in 2021. If all goes according to plan, the new jets would begin replacing the older F-18C/Ds entirely by 2025. We may not have noticed the apparent gaffe, but Trump slowly and pointedly made the comment, making sure to highlight Boeing, with which has as a complicated relationship with in the press. He has both criticized the company over the cost of Air Force One and repeatedly raised the possibility of halting purchases of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in favor of new derivatives of the Super Hornet, a set of issues we’ve already explored in detail . It is possible that he was referring to the Finnish Air Force’s purchase of additional upgrades for its existing Hornets. In December 2016, the State Department approved the sale of an upgrade package for the country’s F-18C/D Hornets, as well as associated equipment, and support and training services. At present the Finnish Air Force has 54 F-18C Hornet single seat fighter jets and seven F-18D two-seat trainers. Finland initially purchased the aircraft primarily for air defense, so Boeing did not apply the “fighter-attack” or “F/A” nomenclature the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps use to refer to their aircraft. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon’s top arms brokers, estimated the deal would be worth approximately $156 million. This was a follow-on project to the Mid-Life Upgrade 2 (MLU 2) program that the Finnish Air Force completed in December 2016 . The main focus of the MLU 2 upgrade was on giving the jet an expanded air-to-ground capability, including the ability to drop GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs, AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bombs, and AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM). The jets also gained the ability to fire newer versions of the AIM-120 air-to-air missile. To make the best use of these weapons and improve their ability to communicate with each other and allied jets, the Hornets got Litening targeting pods, Link-16 data links, new digital multifunction displays in the cockpit, and other improvements to the aircraft’s sensor and mission systems. USAF The new upgrade will add Rockwell Collins Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System, or MIDS-J, to the aircraft, further improving their communications capabilities. The Pentagon said the arms deal would include installing radios onto the Hornets, software upgrades, flight testing, spares, and variety of other ancillary costs. As such, the deal is set to benefit a host of contractors, not just Boeing, the current owner and manufacturer of the Hornet design. The full list of principle firms includes Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE North America, General Electric, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, ViaSat, and Data Link Solutions, in addition to Rockwell Collins – a veritable who’s who of top American defense contractors. “The Finnish Air Force (FAF) intend[s] to purchase this MLU program equipment and services to extend the useful life of its F/A-18 fighter aircraft and enhance their survivability and communications connectivity,” the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement “The FDF [Finnish Defense Forces] needs this upgrade to keep pace with technology advances in sensors, weaponry, and communications.” Finnish President Sauli Niinistö listens to Trump speak during their joint press conference on Aug. 28, 2017., AP But it’s hard to give Trump the benefit of the doubt here, when he insisted he knew all there was to know about the topic. And He followed up that assertion by rambling incoherently about the size of Finland’s military. “And you’re purchasing lots of other military equipment and I think purchasing very wisely. I know all of the military equipment and I actually agree with everything you’re purchased,” Trump said. “I think Finland’s really a respected country militarily. It’s got large armed forces for its size as a country. Really [it’s] proportionally probably one of the biggest in the world if you think about it.” This comment is also misleading. Finland’s active military, approximately 33,000 individuals, represents a similar percentage of the country’s population as the active component of the U.S. military does to the rest of America. It’s only when one takes in account the country’s massive conscript reserves that the figure goes up dramatically. But then again, so does the proportional representation in countries like North Korea. The Finnish Defense Forces are in the midst of a number of upgrade programs, though, estimated to be worth $20 billion in total. This includes the HX fighter replacement, as well as counter-battery radars for finding enemy artillery positions, precision guided missiles, new torpedoes the country’s four Hamina -class fast attack boats to improve their anti-submarine warfare capabilities, and the addition of the Squadron 2020 battle management system to various ships throughout the Finnish Navy. President Niinistö was diplomatic about the claim, simply saying “I guess so.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air F/A-18 Fighters"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 5, 2020","It’s Official, Russia and Syria Have Linked Their Air Defense Networks","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it has formally linked its air defenses in Syria together with those of the regime of Bashar Al Assad . This could potentially limit the U.S. military’s ability to support its local partners fighting ISIS, increases the risk of a dangerous confrontation , and just add yet another layer to an ever more complicated situation on the ground. Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces Major-General Sergey Meshcheryakov made the announcement during a press roundtable at the Army-2017 International-Military Technical Forum on Aug. 25, 2017, according to state-run media outlet TASS . The event at the Patriot Expocentre in the Moscow Region is an annual military trade show and this year also includes a pavilion dedicated to the Kremlin’s intervention in Syria. “Today, a unified integrated air defense system has been set up in Syria,” Meshcheryakov said. “We have ensured the information and technical interlinkage of the Russian and Syrian air reconnaissance systems. All information on the situation in the air comes from Syrian radar stations to the control points of the Russian force grouping.” Russia’s air defense assets in Syria include S-300 and S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles, as well as Pantsir-S1 short-to-medium range air defense systems. The bulk of these weapons are situated at Hmeimim Air Base south of Latakia, which also hosts Moscow’s air contingent , including advanced Su-27SM3 Flanker and Su-35S Super Flanker fighter jets and Su-34 Fullback multi-role combat aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ylEmQLBQokk Meshcheryakov claims that his troops can hit targets nearly 250 miles away and at altitudes above 100,000 feet. This maximum range theoretically gives Russia the ability to engage targets nearly anywhere in the country, as well as over neighboring Turkey and Lebanon. Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles at Hmeimim Air Base in Syria., Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP When linked together with whatever additional radar coverage Assad’s forces might be able to provide, the systems present a significant threat to anyone flying over the country, including the U.S. military and its coalition partners. At the Army-2017 expo, the Syrian operations pavilion had a display that suggested the short-range Pantsir-S1s had already been very active in the country, possibly even engaging American or other coalition drones. Though unconfirmed, the Russians claimed the systems had knocked down incoming rockets, small unmanned aerial vehicles, and surveillance balloons, according to one placard. On June 17, 2017, one of these anti-aircraft weapons reportedly knocked down an RQ-21A “Integrator” near their naval base at Tartus. Also known as the Blackjack, this system is in service with U.S. special operations forces . Russian troops demonstrate a Pantsir-S1 at the Army-2017 expo., Sputnik via AP But whether these reports are accurate or not, Russia’s decision to deploy its air defense elements have already been a concern, as evidenced by a number of heavily redacted weekly intelligence summaries from the U.S. Air Forces Central Command’s Coalition Intelligence Fusion Cell, which the author previously obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. These reports show, unsurprisingly, that this office at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar – which also hosts the so-called “hotline” with Russian forces in Syria – routinely tracks reports of “air-to-air encounter and SAM events affecting Coalition aircraft” and other threats to the aerial campaign against ISIS, including at least one report of “ GPS jamming .” Part of the table of contents from a Combined Intelligence Fusion Center report from December 2016., USAF via FOIA Now that the Russians are connected directly to their Syrian counterparts, the presence of their air defense assets can only give the American-led coalition additional pause when planning operations in the country against terrorists in Syria. It adds new possibilities for a confrontation between U.S.-supported forces, or the U.S. military itself, to rapidly escalate into an even more dangerous situation, too. Already this year, American multi-role combat aircraft have shot down two Iranian drones and a Syrian Arab Air Force Su-22 ground attack aircraft that were menacing U.S.-supported Syrian groups. This highlighted the increasing danger U.S. troops faced while operating in close proximity to the Syrians and their allies, who are openly hostile, at least rhetorically, to their very presence in the country. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MSyE-Afcm4M We at The War Zone have noted for some time that these and other incidents had pushed Russia and Syria toward even closer cooperation, which in turn could only limit the flexibility of U.S. forces and put them in riskier situations. After the United States’ pinprick attack at Shayrat Air Base in Syria in April 2017, following a reported chemical attack on civilians, Assad had already relocated most of his own Air Force behind the protective umbrella of Russia’s air defenses. The Russia-Syria integrated air defense arrangement, which may have existed in some form before on an ad hoc level, only reinforces this status quo and makes it more difficult for the United States to apply pressure on Assad now and in the future. It has probably all but eliminated any meaningful discussion of imposing a no-fly zone against Assad’s air force in the near term. The Russians have already been able to dictate the prosecution of much of the conflict in western Syria. Russia’s proposed “de-escalation zones” in Syria., Russian MoD The Kremlin has also pushed to set up “de-escalation zones,” together with Iran and Turkey, which that benefit their collective interests . Earlier in August 2017, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told members of the press after a diplomatic meeting in Cambodia that he expected the safe area in Idlib, along the border with Turkey , to come into effect soon . The United States has already agreed to support some portion of these ceasefire deals in southwestern Syria, along the borders with Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon. On Aug. 23, 2017, the U.S. State Department announced that it would establish a shared monitoring office with Russian and Jordan personnel in the Jordanian capital Amman. It is unclear how any of this increasing cooperation, especially the new Russian-Syrian air defense deal, will necessarily impact the American-led campaign against ISIS in Syria. At present, U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are in the midst of a pitched battle to eject the terrorists from their de facto capital in Raqqa. An SDF fighter pauses during the fighting in Raqqa., AP There are indications that this relationship may be increasingly strained, though. Earlier in August 2017, an SDF spokesman told Reuters that American forces would remain in Syria after the defeat of ISIS, an assertion that both the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department subsequently refuted . Still, the U.S. government has yet to clearly articulate how it intends to transition its activities in the country if and when it deems to the terrorists are no longer a threat. Needless to say, the situation in Syria is complex and often fluid. However, the Russians and the Syrians seem to be intent on making sure that American involvement in the country stays is limited and ends as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2019",U.S. Military Wants Tech Companies To Battle Each Other in the ‘ThunderDrone’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. SOFWERX, a public-private technology incubator with funding from U.S. Special Operations Command, is gearing up to kick off a series of unorthodox events to gather information and data about new developments in the world of small drones that will wrap up with an apparent drone demolition derby. The goal is to explore systems and equipment that could be a benefit to U.S. military operations, but looking at the participants, it also seems like an opportunity to highlight the growing threat of tiny unmanned aircraft to American troops. According to its website , SOFWERX – a techy contraction of Special Operations Forces Works – plans to run four main ThunderDrone events, starting with a technology expo in September 2017, along with three “senior leader reviews” to update SOCOM’s leadership. The main focus areas are broad, including technology related to unmanned aircraft that can operate anywhere – including in space – drone swarms, and weapons and other payloads, as well as associated rapid prototyping and 3D printing capabilities . The organization will host all of this in a 7,000 square foot warehouse it rented in Tampa, Florida, which is also where its main office is located. The project will end with the battle royale style “Prototype Rodeo” in November 2017. “Are you ready to rumble?” the ThunderDrone page asks. Though first announced earlier in August 2017, the plan didn’t get much attention until Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Heather Wilson mentioned it while visiting Holloman Air Force Base for her service’s ongoing light attack aircraft experiment. SOFWERX’ website did not specifically mention the Air Force would be involved at all. Here is a video of a separate experiment by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that could be similar to what SOFWERX has planned for ThunderDrone. “In two months, we’re going to have a big competition. They’ve rented out a big warehouse,” she said in a speech on Aug. 16, 2017. “It’s a rapid prototyping event, and basically it’s to investigate swarms and platforms and effects and data science of small unmanned aerial vehicles. There’s even one [event] that says, ‘Ok, bring your stuff, we’ll see who the last drone standing is.’” The name “ThunderDrone” itself seems to be a play on this final showdown. In the 1985 movie Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome , Mel Gibson’s titular character has to fight for his life in the Thunderdome, a post-apocalyptic battle arena run by Tina Turner’s Aunty Entity. They’ve got an amazing logo, too, featuring a cross between a skull and quad-copter with a Ka-bar combat knife in its mouth. SOFWERX And in keeping with this theme, SOFWERX has encouraged companies large and small, as well as academics and students, to sign up if they think they have something to offer. Single individuals have even received invitations to be pilots in the “ThunderDrone Squadron” after submitting their applications. Earlier in August 2017, the Tampa Bay Times published a brief interview with local “droneographer” and artist Nicole Abbett , who runs a company called From Where I Fly and had signed up to pilot craft for the event. They asked her if she had any reservations about working with the military and possibility helping develop armed drones. “Of course not,” she told them. “My dad is a Vietnam vet who earned two Purple Heart medals.” But Abbett and her fellow pilots might end up demonstrating the danger small drones increasingly pose to American troops and their allies in warzones around the world or ways to defeat that threat. One of the participants, the Florida-headquarterd Explotrain, LLC, specializes in simulating improvised explosive devices for training exercises. The company says its Explodrone is the “first and only” simulator mimicking armed hobbyist quad- and hex-copters, such as the ones ISIS have increasingly used to attack security forces in Iraq and Syria.  The firm’s website specifically cites the terrorist group’s development of this tactic as an example of the emerging dangers. The threat is real, as we at The War Zone have noted many times, and ThunderDrone seems like a perfect place to run through very possible scenarios. Earlier in August 2017, Tyler Rogoway wrote this as part of a larger discussion about the U.S. military’s need for new short-range air defenses: Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots. It’s entirely possible that SOFWERX’s rodeo could include something exactly like this, with pilots trying to knock each others’ small drones out of the air. Other countermeasures, including jammers , could be a factor, too. The ThunderDrone project seems intent on letting participants make the case for their technology and then force them to prove it works. The freeform nature of the whole event is in keeping with the basic ideas behind SOFWERX, which clearly has its marching orders from the U.S. military, but operates like a hipster tech startup. The “front office” space it occupies in Tampa was previously a tattoo parlor, while the back of the stylish brick building is a former telephone book factory. No, really, this is the inside of SOFWERX’s Tampa office., SOFWERX SOFWERX opened its doors in 2016 with a $2 million in funding, according to a profile by The Washington Post . Day-to-day operations are organized by The Doolittle Institute , a Florida-based non-profit that had worked in the past to connect leaders in various technological fields with elements of the U.S. military. SOFWERX It’s named after U.S. Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel James “Jimmy” Doolittle, who led the legendary aerial raid on the Japanese capital Tokyo in the immediate aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack. After World War II, he became an advocate for advancements in aviation and space technology, serving for a time as the chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Pentagon, especially under former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work , made engagement with private technology firms a key part of the so-called “ Third Offset ” strategy, which focuses on equipment and operating concepts that will help persevere America’s military dominance even as its overall size shrinks. This most notably led to the creation of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx, with offices in technology hubs such as Silicon Valley and Boston. Unmanned aircraft have been a huge component of the Third Offset, including swarms of small drones and tiny craft that can be operated easily by a single individual . In May 2017, James “Hondo” Geurts, SOCOM’s top acquisition executive, announced a plan to establish another organization similar to SOFWERX, called DRONEWERX, in collaboration with the Pentagon’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO). SCO has been a major driver of Third Offset technologies and organized an air-deployed drone swarm demonstration in October 2016. In that experiment, U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets dropped more than 100 Perdix mini-drones over the China Lake test range in California, which then performed various tasks as a single entity. This desire for advanced drone technology for a wide variety of uses, and more of it, as well as drone defenses, especially ones made in America, is only likely to increase for the foreseeable future. Unmanned aircraft are only becoming more ubiquitous in general. In addition to participating in ThunderDrone, the U.S. Air Force is also sponsoring the Drone Racing League , a startup that is producing slick neon-lighted quad-copter races broadcast in ESPN as an analogue to car racing events such as NASCAR – something I’ve actually managed to find myself watching at a bar. The hope is that it will promote interest in both drone technology and the service. “We’re the exclusive sponsor in the finals as it goes through, and we’re looking for a venue where we can host a race on an Air Force facility,” U.S. Air Force General James “Mike” Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, told National Defense . “They’re looking for venues that are colorful and attractive on television – we’ve got some of those.” This will in turn expose all new vulnerabilities, which the U.S. military needs to address, including some factors that may not have necessarily been immediately apparent. Earlier in August 2017, Defense One reported that the U.S. Army had banned its personnel from using commercial unnamed aircraft and associated software from Chinese firm DJI, citing concerns that it could open its personnel up to cyber attacks or data breaches, as well as possibly just sending sensitive video or other information straight back to the company’s headquarters. “There is no doubt in my mind that DIUx will not only continue to exist, it will actually – it will grow in its influence and its impact on the Department of Defense,” Secretary of Defense James Mattis said during a visit to the unit’s offices in Mountain View, California. “One of the ways you make certain that you don’t have bad processes eat up good peoples’ ideas is you make certain that you remove the bad processes and organize for success.” SOFWERX’s ThunderDrone project could be a good opportunity to see if this new way of doing business has potential. If nothing else, we’re looking forward to official video of the drone rodeo.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian research university is developing a new light, 4×4 truck that it hopes to pitch to the country’s military , saying it’s hardened against the elements, corrosive chemicals, and apparently X-ray radiation. But the best selling point of the DSE-1700A Sergeant might be that it’s based on the chassis of the long popular Lada Niva. Earlier in August 2017, a group of engineers at Togliatti State University revealed the vehicle at their campus in Russia’s Samara Oblast. They offered few specifics, but the design, which only seats two individuals, looks fantastically lightweight and the designers reportedly made the frame from an unspecified polymer composite material. Togliatti State University “The car’s designers claim it’s resistant to almost everything including corrosion, fire, frost, chemicals, and X-Ray radiation,” according to Russia Beyond the Headlines . The team from Togliatti officially debuted the vehicle at Russia’s annual International-Military Technical Forum, this year known as Army-2017, which runs from Aug. 22 to 27, 2017 at the Patriot Expocentre in the Moscow Region. At the expo, the team explained that they would offer the Sergeant with various levels of armor, a reinforced underbody, and light weapons mounts. They claimed that it would have twice the payload of the standard Niva, despite its lightweight frame, as well. A regular 3-door Niva straight from the factory is just over 12 feet long, five and half feet wide, less than six feet tall, with a gross weight of approximately 3,550 pounds. For comparison, the U.S. Marine Corp’s M1161 Growler lightweight vehicle is a little over 13.5 feet long, less than five feet wide, and around six feet high at its tallest point, with a curb weight of around 4,500 pounds. The ultra-light chassis of Togliatti’s 4×4 light truck., Togliatti State University We don’t know whether or not the chassis’ protection against those environment threats extends to the crew of the vehicle. Protection against chemical corrosion and X-rays could be a description of defenses against nuclear and chemical weapons, the latter of which are often corrosive, that got lost in translation. The mention of X-ray defenses could also be misunderstanding or mistranslation of “X-Band” and be a reference to reduced signature or low observable features of some sort based on the DSE-1700A’s polymer construction. Russia Beyond the Headlines’ writer did note themselves that it seemed difficult to imagine the prototype design could be so safe given that it had no roof or doors. “If the car is fire, frost, and radiation resistant, shouldn’t it at least have a roof?!” they wrote. “Nah, it’s just a prototype after all.” Togliatti State University Togliatti’s DSE-1700A has the looks of something that would be ideal for Russia’s elite airborne and special operations forces. These groups could make good use a lightweight air-droppable off-road design that might also fit inside their Mi-17 armed utility helicopters. But any final design will need to prove its protective features, and its overall utility, if it wants to garner any actual interest from the Russian military or other of the country’s security services, who already operate a wide assortment of light wheeled vehicles – armored and not – as well as armed dune buggies and all-terrain vehicles . They’ve also tested many more and not adopted them. There’s no word on cost, either, which is always a factor when it comes to Russian military procurement. The UAZ-3132 is an example of the similar vehicles Russian security services already have in service., Vitaly Kuzmin Otherwise, the Sergeant’s most attractive feature might be its Lada lineage and the appeal to national nostalgia. The brand, an imprint of state automotive giant AvtoVAZ, is an icon of Soviet-era Russia that has continued to be an important business for country since the fall of Communism. The four-door Lada sedan is the quintessentially Russian car. The brand remains popular in the country, despite its reputation for low quality. One owner turned one into a fully-tracked snow mobile . Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stumped for Lada, test driving various cars and trucks to promote AvtoVAZ at home and abroad. These haven’t always worked out well. In 2010, Putin drove around the country in a compact Lada Kalina, touting its reliability among other things. Unfortunately, bystanders eventually caught glimpse of his full convoy, which included a second identical yellow car as an apparent spare and a tow truck lugging a third that had broken down already. The next year, he struggled to start a new Lada Granta sedan to start during another publicity stunt. He’s also been pictured driving a Niva , the vehicle that Togliatti based their lightweight military version on, with various off-road extras including a snorkel for the engine intake so he could drive across shallow water. In 2015, three Russian artillery troops who won the titles of “The best artillery specialist” during the “Masters of artillery fire” competition at that year’s Tank Biathlon – another quintessentially Russian event – each received one of the trucks as their prize. Putin looks longingly at his Lada Niva, RIA Novosti via AP Since introducing it in 1977, AvtoVAZ has licensed its production at one time or another to concerns in Ecuador, Greece, Jordan, and Uruguay, among others. In 1998, a joint venture company between AvtoVAZ and Chevrolet began produced a derivative in Russia as the Chevrolet Niva . One of the small trucks even made it into the Pierce Brosnan James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough . Some Russian government agencies and domestic security forces do drive the rugged 4x4s. This includes elements with the Otdel Spetsialnogo Naznacheniya Saturn, more commonly known as OSN Saturn or “Jail Spetnaz,” the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service’s special purpose detachment. The door of one of OSN Saturn’s Nivas, with the branding prominently, but oddly visible at the bottom in Roman script rather than Cyrillic., Vitaly Kuzmin And it’s little surprise that Togliatti chose the Niva chassis as their starting point. The research institute has worked directly with AvtoVAZ as part of a partnership that first started in 1966. We’ll have to wait and find out whether or not the existing popularity of the Niva is enough to propel the new lightweight DSE-1700A into actual military service.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Everything You Need To Know About The USAF’s New Nuclear Cruise Missile Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a week where it had already awarded major contracts for new work on replacing its nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) stockpile, the U.S. Air Force has announced two more major deals regarding the Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) nuclear-tipped cruise missile. There is an ongoing debate about whether the weapon is redundant, overly expensive, or increases the risk of a dangerous miscalculation, but it may offer a number of benefits, especially if the Pentagon’s latest nuclear posture review actively considers eliminating a leg of U.S. military’s Nuclear Triad. Late on Aug. 23, 2017, the Air Force revealed the new contract awards to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to continue design work on their respective LRSO designs. Both deals were valued at an even $900 million. The service rejected at bid from Boeing and it is possible that Northrop Grumman may have unsuccessfully submitted an entry, as well. These two firms had just beaten out Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to proceed with work on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) ICBM replacement program . “The LRSO will be a reliable, long-ranging and survivable weapon system and an absolutely essential element of the nuclear triad,” U.S. Air Force General Robin Rand, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, had told members of Congress in May 2017. “The LRSO missile will ensure the bomber force continues to hold high-value targets at risk in an evolving threat environment, including targets deep within an area-denied environment.” So far, the Air Force has released little information about its LRSO program’s basic requirements or the proposed designs. Contractors have been equally tight lipped about their proposals and Raytheon has even declined to issue any official statement regarding its newly won contract. A display of the B-52H and the weapons it can carry, with AGM-86s on a rotary launcher in the center and under the right wing., USAF The most anyone seems willing to say is that the new design will be able to penetrate through even the most heavily defended target areas worldwide. As such it seems almost certain that the LRSO will be a low-observable design, but the Air Force has refused to confirm or deny if it will have subsonic, supersonic, or even hypersonic performance capabilities. The new cruise missile will replace the existing nuclear and conventionally armed AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM). The subsonic AGM-86B carries a W80-1 thermonuclear warhead, while the AGM-86C and D have high explosive and bunker-busting payloads, respectively. The W80 series of warheads have a so-called “variable yield” and Air Force personnel can set it to explode with the force of between 5 and 150 kilotons of TNT. The LRSO will also use the W80-1 , as well as have the option to carry conventional warheads for non-nuclear missions. As such, it is a dual role weapon system that can significantly expand the long-range conventional strike options for the USAF. Boeing designed and built the AGM-86 family and the nuclear B model first entered service in 1981. It’s been a core component of the U.S. military’s nuclear deterrence capabilities since then. The Air Force wants to have the new LRSO missile ready to go by 2030, when it expects the existing ALCMs will reach the end of their service lives. The service’s present plan is to make a final choice between the Lockheed Martin and Raytheon designs sometime between 2021 and 2022. The Air Force’s iconic B-52H BUFFs, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, and the up-coming B-21 Raider will all be able to carry the new missile. “This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in a statement. “Deterrence works if our adversaries know that we can hold at risk things they value. This weapon will enhance our ability to do so, and we must modernize it cost-effectively.” But these assertions are clearly a response to wide-spread criticism of the project from both independent analysts and members of Congress . The main complaints are that LRSO provides a redundant deterrent capability, could potentially make it easier for the United States to accidentally find itself in the middle of a catastrophic nuclear exchange, and is simply too expensive. An airman prepares to lift a rotary launcher loaded with AGM-86s into the bomb bay of a B-52., USAF It’s also important to remember that the existing AGM-86B missiles are one of the Air Force’s two remaining air-launched nuclear weapons, with the other being the B61 gravity bomb. The U.S. military, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, is separately working on an improved version of that weapon, known as the B61 Mod 12 or B61-12, which will feature a GPS guidance tail kit similar in concept to the conventional Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) family. Critics suggest that since the B-2 or B-21 has the ability to sneak past advanced air defenses carrying a B61 nuclear bomb there’s no need for them to carry a stealth cruise missile. The main point of a long-range stand-off capability is to keep the launch platform away from these defenses in the first place. The argument continues that though the decidedly non-stealthy B-52 would need the protection afforded by the LRSO, it will be on its way out by the time the missile is ready anyways. As it stands now, the BUFF is the only aircraft that can carry AGM-86 and this is the only nuclear weapon the aircraft can carry at all. Those who oppose the LRSO note that the Air Force did have a stealthy stand-off weapon, the AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile , but retired it in 2012. However, this decision was driven in large part by the need to reduce the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile in line by 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, rather than the basics capabilities of the weapon. The Pentagon chose to scrap the AGM-129s rather than another system because they had experienced reliability issues and were more expensive to operate compared to the older AGM-86s. An AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force., USAF USAF These arguments also dismiss the reality that any missile-armed bomber could hit multiple targets faster than a bomb-carrying aircraft. At present, each B-52H can lug as many as 20 AGM-86s at a time, spread between racks under the wings and a rotary launcher in the bomb bay. The contention is that if the target is truly time-sensitive, an IBCM or a submarine-launched ballistic missile would be a better choice to destroy it. As we at The War Zone explained in detail in our discussion of the potential game-changing nature of hypersonic weapons, this isn’t really the case, as ballistic weapons follow largely predicable trajectories and can have difficulties hitting small or otherwise complex targets. In arguing the need for an ICBM replacement, the Air Force has itself alluded to a future full of ballistic missile defenses or other obstacles that could potentially reduce the capability of that class of weapons in a deterrent scenario. “The Minuteman III [ICBM] will have a difficult time surviving in the active anti-access, area denial environment that we will be dealing with in the 2030 and beyond time period,” General Rand informed Congress during a hearing in March 2016. Bombers offer a more flexible option over ballistic missiles, as well, since they can stay on alert near a target area for an extended period, offering a visible deterrent without necessarily having to even fire a weapon. The time it takes to get them into position can be beneficial, too, since it gives commanders additional time to respond to a change in the situations and recall them before they release a weapon. And compared to a rocket motor igniting, bombers present a far smaller significant infrared signature, which could allow them to avoid detection by many space-based early warning systems . USAF As networked anti-aircraft weapons and radars , as well as fighter jets and airborne sensors , continue to improve, stealth may not guarantee safety, either. In a deterrence situation, the U.S. military might not have time to soften up an enemy’s defenses so a B-2 or B-21 would be able to slip through completely unmolested. On top of that, there’s always the possibility the B-21 will not be ready on time and there is no plan for them to immediately replace the B-52 entirely in the nuclear deterrence mission by 2030. The Air Force only hopes the Raider will reach initial operating capability at that time and expects to buy between 80 and 100 examples at minimum. USAF If the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the costs of operating the existing B-2 fleet are any indicators, the new Raider could be an immensely complicated and expensive endeavor, and that’s not even touching the potential political issues . Based on these experiences, though, the Air Force has created a development concept for the B-21 specifically to at least try and prevent debilitating technical delays. At the same time, in combination with a re-engine program , the remaining 58 BUFFs could easily stay in service through 2050. Without an improved stand-off nuclear weapon, the Air Force would be forced to relegate them to entirely non-nuclear missions. In May 2017, the Federation of American scientists discovered that the U.S. military had already quietly ended the BUFF’s B61-dropping mission in the face of the plane’s increasing vulnerability to enemy air defenses. Of course, there is a reasonable question of whether the Air Force, which is already committed to a number of other modernization projects, including Nuclear Triad-related programs like the B-21 and new IBCMs, can afford the LRSO. The complete plan to overhaul America’s Nuclear Triad , which President Barack Obama initiated in his second term, could ultimately set taxpayers back $1 trillion. LRSO has an estimated total price tag of around $20 billion. Critics say that it would be more logical to funnel those funds into other programs, including conventional-only stand-off weapons, or simply cut it out of the defense budget entirely. But much of the redundancy and cost debate assumes in large part that the Pentagon will continue with its existing Nuclear Triad concept for the foreseeable future. As we’ve noted at The War Zone before, this is not necessarily a given . There could be significant benefits in switching to a Nuclear Dyad instead, especially when taking into account the potential capabilities of the LRSO. When described as an alternative rather than a supplement to other weapons, such as ICBMs, a nuclear- and conventionally-armed cruise missile does begin to present a differently useful and cost-effective option. The Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program could cost five times more than the LRSO project and would only have one real use – an apocalyptic doomsday mission . In fact, those missiles are as much of a strategic sponge for enemy missiles than anything else. If the Pentagon decided to recommend ditching the siloed missiles for good, it could fundamentally change the nature of the discussion about a new nuclear-capable cruise missile. Still, none of this necessarily answers the serious question or whether or not a cruise missile, able to carry a nuclear or a conventional warhead without any visible difference in its appearance, presented a potential for miscalculation on the part of America’s enemies. The common scenario that independent analysts put forward is one where an enemy mistakes a conventional attack for a nuclear first strike. This has been a long-running concern and remains a major question when it comes to American deterrence options, which may or may not have both conventional and nuclear components. The War Zone, thanks to documents obtained via The Freedom of Information Act, has already been able to take a closer look into these potential issues here . That being said, the U.S. military has and continues to employ conventional cruise missiles on multiple occasions in unannounced strikes without issue. More specifically, the Air Force has fired conventional AGM-86C and D missiles during operations in both the Balkans and Iraq in the 1990s without triggering a doomsday scenario. AGM-86s under the wing of a B-52., USAF It is possible that a hypersonic LRSO could add an entirely new dimension to the equation, since opponents would have less time to try and determine the true nature of a strike. In addition, there is a tangential concern that American commanders might be more inclined to recommend using the the fast-flying missile, believing they could conduct a “surgical first strike” without giving the enemy time to react regardless of the payload. There is already a fear that Russia has already adopted a similar attitude , thinking it might be able to use a small nuclear strike to halt a conflict on its terms without the threat of world-ending escalation. However, it seems that at least some the U.S. military have opposed this notion of “escalating to de-escalate.” “Anyone who thinks that they can control escalation through the use of nuclear weapons is literally playing with fire,” then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work assured Congress in 2015, trying to allay those sorts of fears. “Escalation is escalation, and nuclear use would be the ultimate escalation.” For the time being, though, in spite of vocal criticism, the Air Force is still pushing ahead with modernizing both of its legs of the Nuclear Triad. It may eventually have to decide whether its future deterrence capabilities lie with ICBMs or nuclear-armed cruise missiles.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery appears to confirm earlier reports that Syria is building a new ballistic missile production complex near the city of Baniyas. Various features at the site suggest that the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad is actively working with the Iranian government on its construction and that it may be part of a larger regional effort by Iran to bolster its allies’ capacities, especially against Israel . Earlier in August 2017, ImageSat International (iSi), a private satellite imagery and geospatial intelligence firm, published the images , taken with its EROS-B satellite, of the area in western Syria, along with its own analysis.  Based on the imagery alone, the company’s analysts concluded that the buildings were very similar to structures seen in Iran that are associated with the production of short range ballistic missiles, but that the exact extent of Iranian involvement as unclear. Work on at least one portion of the facility seemed to be still ongoing, as well. “According to ISI’s intelligence team, the site still under construction includes one entrance that leads to the road to the site,” the firm noted in its report. “The site includes administration area, production area and storage area. The site also has an area that is apparently dedicated to the production of ammunition.” iSi ISI did not identify the exact location of the comparative sites in Iran, but other analysis shows that they are buildings at the Iranian military’s secretive Parchin complex situated nearly 20 miles southeast of the country’s capital Tehran. The particular portions of the facility that are similar to those in Syria are reportedly associated with the production of solid fuel Scud, Fateh 110, and Zelzal short-range ballistic missiles. iSi The earthen berms around many of the buildings were perhaps the most significant comparative features. This type of physical protection is commonly associated with factories making ammunition, solid fuel rocket motors, and similar items and is designed to spare nearby structures from damage in the event of an accident. iSi The first report of the existence of this new complex came from a website, zamanalwsl.net , which is associated with the Syrian opposition groups, on June 28, 2017. The activists said that their sources had informed them that Assad himself had visited the missile factories earlier in the month under the cover of visiting the families of supporters in the area. “The sources mailed us aerial photographs of the area which show the facility, consisting of several buildings, and noted that it is under the direct supervision of the Iranians,” the writers on zamanalwsl.net explained, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute. “It is a facility for developing and manufacturing long-range missiles, and the sources assess that it will be officially opened at the end of this year. According to them, during his visit to the facility Assad held an extensive meeting with several ‘Iranian and Syrian experts,’ lasting about two hours.” Iranian Fateh-110 short-range ballistic missiles., M-ATF via Wikimedia In June 2017, MEMRI said it was unable independently verify any of the claims. Though the imagery now shows that the site near Baniyas is almost certainly a missile factory, it less clear as to the exact reason why Syria opted to construct the facility there or do so now, and the exact nature of any cooperation with Iran. There are, however, a number of logical explanations, most of which are not mutually exclusive. The most obvious is that the Syrians may simply not have the existing production capacity to keep their arsenal of short range ballistic missiles steady as they may have used as much as 90 percent of their original stockpile by 2015. In their initial report, zamanalwsl.net said its sources had also informed them that the construction was part of a larger plan on the part of the Assad regime to consolidate arms production, especially with regards to advanced weapons and weapons of mass destruction, in areas with predominantly Alawite Shia Muslim populations that are solidly loyal to the Assad regime. This makes good sense. Though Assad continues to boast successes against rebels and terrorist groups, including the recent victory over opposition forces in Aleppo, and continues to enjoy the support and relative safety provided by the Russian military, his regime remains in a tenuous position. Bashar Al Assad in the cockpit of a Russian Su-35 fighter jet in during a visit to Hmeimim Air Base in June 2017., AP On top of that, as the civil conflict has dragged on and become increasingly brutal, Israel has launched an increasing number of air strikes in Syria. These are primarily aimed at destroying missiles and other advanced weapons bound for ostensibly pro-regime groups, most notably Hezbollah, which Israeli authorities see as a direct threat to their own security interests. Baniyas is effectively half way between Tartus, where Russian forces maintain a strategic port facility, and Latakia, home of Hmeimim Air Base and the bulk of Russia’s contingent in the country, including S-300 and S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles and Pantsir-S1 short-to-medium range air defense systems. By building the missile production complex there, it is well protected from both insurgents and preemptive strikes. For Iran, a cooperative missile factory in Syria could help it skirt the scrutiny of the international community and sanctions on its advanced weapons programs. Iranian officials have long been under pressure to allow arms inspectors into Parchin to look for evidence of banned nuclear weapons work. The government in Tehran has resisted this, insisting that the site is related only to conventional military efforts and is therefore not covered by agreements, such as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), more commonly known as the Iran Deal. A different Fateh-110 launcher configuration., M-ATF via Wikimedia “If you look … at past Iranian behavior, what you’ve seen is there have been covert actions at military sites, at universities, things like that,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley told Reuters in an interview published on Aug. 22, 2017. “There were already issues in those locations, so are they [the International Atomic Energy Agency] including that in what they look at to make sure that those issues no longer remain?” Iran might not just have to worry about inspectors prying into restricted military sites, either. In October 2014, there was a massive explosion at Parchin, which many believed was the result of sabotage by Israeli or American intelligence services. A similar “accident” at another facility had killed 17 people, including Iranian General Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, a top official in charge of ballistic missile developments, in 2011. Dispersing missile production, and possibly other advanced weapons development work, outside of Iran could help both conceal and protect it from unwanted attention. Experts believe that Syria has hosted similar sites in the past, as well as, such as a nuclear facility possibly linked to North Korea that Israel destroyed in an air strike in 2007 . For both the Syria, cooperation with Iran on ballistic missiles could lead to advancements in its own arsenals with relatively little investment necessary. This would help explain growing evidence of similar sites in Hezbollah-controlled territory in Lebanon, as well. It is possible the facilities in Syria and Lebanon could eventually move beyond producing just short-range designs in the future, too. This in turn could improve the Assad regime and Hezbollah’s deterrent capabilities against Israel. Localized missile production would be a boon for Hezbollah in particular, which presently has to rely on covert shipments from Iran and Syria, which as we already noted, are often intercepted by the Israelis. Hezbollah fighters and a small child stand on top of a truck with large unguided rockets during a rally., AP In March 2017, Assad threatened Israel with a flurry of Scud missiles if it didn’t stop attacking targets within Syrian territory, but didn’t follow through. In June 2017, Iran did launch a number of Zulfiqar missiles, a version of the Fateh 110, which the factories in Syria could reasonably produce, ostensibly against ISIS terrorists. However, as The War Zone explained at the time , it seemed likely that this was more an opportunity for Iran to show off the capabilities of these missiles. For its part, the Israeli military is continuing to develop its own David’s Sling and Arrow ballistic missile systems against exactly these sorts of potential threats. Whether these systems could protect against a large barrage of even short-range missiles coming from Iran, Syria, and Lebanon altogether is another matter. “We are fully aware” of the missile factories, Israel’s hawkish Defense Minister Avidgor Liberman said at a briefing in Tel Aviv in July 2017. “We know what needs to be done… We won’t ignore the establishment of Iranian weapons factories in Lebanon.” So, it remains to be seen whether Israel will ultimately feel it can tolerate these new missile factories supplying its enemies with new and possibly increasingly capable weapons.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has released pictures that appear to reveal is has either completed or is in the process of developing even more significant ballistic missile designs that use solid fuel rocket motors. Though the two events do not appear to be directly related, the reclusive regime put out the images on the same day the U.S. government officials publicly insisted that sanctions and other pressure had prompted a certain amount of “restraint” on their counterparts in Pyongyang, which could call those assessments into question. On Aug. 23, 2017, the state-run Korean Central News Agency posted pictures along with details about North Korean premier Kim Jong-un’s visit to the Chemical Material Institute of Academy of Defense Science, which is important component of the country’s ballistic missile projects.

Of all the images, two stood out most to experts, who immediately highlighted their significant on social media. One showed Kim in a room with two posters depicting heretofore unknown ballistic missiles types, the Hwasong-13 and Pukguksong-3, while another had him walking past what looked to be a wound filament solid fuel rocket fuel motor. Kim Jong-un gestures to objects in a room with posters depicting the Hwasong-13, left, and Pukguksong-3, right., KCNA Based on North Korea’s established naming conventions, the Hwasong-13 should be a liquid-fueled design, while the Pukguksong-3 would use a solid fuel rocket engine. However, the associated displays suggested that both weapons could be solid-fueled. Along with the wound filament motor, the new designs are especially concerning. Kim Jong-un walks past what appears to be a wound filament rocket motor casing., KCNA The existing members of the Pukguksong family are the Pukguksong-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile, also known as the KN-11, and the land-mobile Pukguksong-2 , or KN-15, a two-stage derivative of the earlier design that troops can fire from a tracked transporter-erector-launcher. North Korea first demonstrated the KN-11 in 2016 and the KN-15 in February 2017. The important difference between these weapons and many of North Korea’s other ballistic missiles, including the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), is their solid fuel propellant. This means troops have to spend far less time preparing them to fire. Combined with a mobile launcher, this could make it harder for the country’s enemies, such as the United States, to detect and track the movement of the missiles prior to launch. Solid fuel motors are also essentially a perquisite for a robust submarine launched ballistic missile capability. The tight confines of a submarine do not lend themselves to storing and pumping liquid rocket fuel into missiles and it would be an especially risky proposition in general given the volatile and corrosive nature of the propellant. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vBqo9eS4tSw This would likely have informed the development of the Pukguksong-1 in the first place. And with even a small fleet of small submarines carrying nuclear-armed solid fuel missiles, the North Korean regime would have a credible second-strike option in the event of any pre-emptive attack on its land-based missile infrastructure. By firing ballistic missiles off shore, North Korea can also defeat the THAAD anti-ballistic missile system’s engagement envelope. So far, however, both Pukguksong-1 and -2 have demonstrated relatively limited range compared to the Hwasong-14 ICBM and the Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), the latter of which North Korea has threatened to test fire near Guam. Both weapons have enough fuel to travel estimated distances of less than 1,000 miles based on existing observations about North Korean tests, though we may not have seen them fly with full fuel loads. This would still put all of South Korea and much of Japan well within range. KCNA This is where the picture of the wound filament motor comes in. This technology is essential to producing longer-range solid fuel ballistic missiles. The casing is lighter than traditional metal shells, but still strong enough to withstand similar forces. Simply by inserting one of these new lightweight motors, the rocket’s power remains the same, but it doesn’t have to lift as much weight, translating to a longer overall range. On top of that, North Korea’s weaponeers could fill the newly freed “throw weight” with more fuel, additional missile sections, or extra payloads, which could result in even longer-range missiles with deadlier warheads. Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Monterey Institute of International Studies’ James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, told CNN that when the U.S. Navy switched to wound filament engines for their submarine-launched weapons in the 1960s, they immediately gained 50 percent more range. He noted that this was also because the service loaded its new casings with a more powerful propellant. KCNA The other poster, showing off the Hwasong-13, is ominous in its own right, showing a three-stage missile. Based on its numbering, this could easily be a missing link between the Hwasong-12 and Hwasong-14 and represent a second workable North Korean ICBM design. On July 4, 2017, North Korea first launched the Hwasong-14, which experts have come to believe has the ability to carry a nuclear warhead deep into the continental United States. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZVIbYiWAHE If it does feature solid-fuel motors in wound casings, the Hwasong-13 might be significantly more dangerous. The Hwasong-14 is liquid fueled and uses a wheeled transporter-erector, which stands the missile up on a static platform for firing. A lighter weight Hwasong-13 could potentially make use of a full transporter-erector-launcher, giving North Korea its first road-mobile ICBM capability that is readily usable on relatively short notice. Experts had already peculated that North Korea’s decision to test fire a second Hwasong-14 at night was an attempt to show off their capability to launch a nuclear response at any time. During the country’s annual Day of The Sun military parade , North Korean troops did display two containerized ballistic missile designs, neither of which has been on public display since. It is not clear whether the Hwasong-13 or Pukguksong-3 missiles or the new lightweight rocket motor casing are already available or are even in active development. Still, the pictures do suggest that the North Koreans have not slowed in their pursuit of even more ballistic missile designs and other technologies to improve their capabilities. And given how heavily North Korea manages the transmission of any information in and out of the country, it unlikely that these pictures were taken at random, though there is the possibility they could be part of an active disinformation campaign. More likely, though, they are deliberate display of the country’s continued ballistic missile work in the face of sanctions and other international pressure, including President Donald Trump’s now infamous “ fire and fury ” remarks earlier in August 2017. Kim Jong-un receives a standing ovation from the employees at the Chemical Material Institute of Academy of Defense Science., KCNA As noted, North Korea threatened to launch a flurry of missiles near Guam over the comments, but eventually decided against it. This gave the regime in Pyongyang space to claim a moral victory for showing restraint amid the escalating rhetoric. While there was no evidence his threat had impacted their decision either way, on Twitter on Aug. 16, 2017, Trump took credit for forcing the North Koreans to make what he called “a wise and well reasoned decision” in the face of an otherwise “catastrophic and unacceptable” outcome. The Trump Administration, however, insists that its sanctions regime and other diplomatic pressure, including on China and Russia, are producing results. On Aug. 22, 2017, the day before KCNA released the pictures, the U.S. Treasury Department announced yet another round of sanctions against 10 companies and six individuals, including Chinese and Russian entities, connected with North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. At the same time, the U.S. Justice Department announced it was working to seize approximately $11 million in assets from two of the companies, which it accused of money laundering. Kim Jong Un inspects a carbon-carbon nosecone which uses ablative material science that may be key to North Korea fielding a reliable reentry system., AP “Treasury will continue to increase pressure on North Korea by targeting those who support the advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and isolating them from the American financial system,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a press release .  “It is unacceptable for individuals and companies in China, Russia, and elsewhere to enable North Korea to generate income used to develop weapons of mass destruction and destabilize the region.” Later that day, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took time during a press conference primarily concern the Trump Administrations new Afghanistan policy to talk about the continued pressure on North Korea. He highlighted the lack of recent provocative ballistic missile tests as possible evidence authorities in Pyongyang were getting the right message and were looking to negotiate. US Secretary of state Rex Tillerson speaks to the press on Aug. 22, 2017., AP “I am pleased to see that the regime in Pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint that we’ve not seen in the past,” Tillerson said. “We hope that this is the beginning of this signal that we’ve been looking for that they are ready to restrain their level of tensions, they’re ready to restrain their provocative acts, and that perhaps we are seeing our pathway to sometime in the near future having some dialogue.” Still, it has always been hard to imagine that North Korean regime would negotiate away the weapons it repeatedly describes as fundamental to its security. And while Tillerson and others are right to point out Kim Jong-un’s recent restrained actions, the Trump administration’s demand for the total nuclear and missile disarmament of North Korea remains almost certainly a non-starter when it comes to any chances of a successful negotiation. Whatever the case, North Korea clearly wants the United States and everyone else to know that it has not stopped its ballistic missile development work and that it is actively pursuing new technology that would make its weapons even more credible threats both in East Asia and beyond.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 12, 2019",Does the U.S. Air Force Secretary Really Not Know What the Third Offset Is?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that that the U.S. military loves its jargon and acronyms , which can be painfully obtuse and hard to explain at times. So it’s either worrisome, oddly cathartic, or both, when a top American defense official like Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson appears unable explain something as important as the Pentagon’s so-called “ Third Offset ” strategy. The apparent revelation came in a series of posts on Twitter on Aug. 22, 2017. Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber‏‎ had complained about the U.S. Air Force’s choice of language as it announced the latest developments in its project to buy all-new intercontinental ballistic missiles . Secretary Wilson, or at least her official Twitter account, responded to the post, agreeing that the official statement had been jargon heavy and offering a clarification. Dave Brown, a senior editor at the Washington Examiner than jumped in to ask about the Third Offset. “Wait, wait. Don’t leave! Can you explain the Third Offset Strategy?” Brown wrote. “Funny, Dave, I asked the same thing recently!” Wilson Tweeted back. We don’t know for sure if this means she is or was unaware of the Third Offset. It does sound like she had recently asked someone to break down the strategy for her because she was unclear as to what it entailed. For those who don’t know, the Third Offset is the U.S. military’s plan for how to continue outmatching its opponents even in the face of a shrinking overall force size and increasing technological developments abroad. It’s a central consideration for both research and development and actual military equipment purchases. At least initially, there were six main focus areas, the most important being developing ways to defeat increasingly advanced, long-range, and networked enemy defenses, known collectively by the equally jargony term “ anti-access/area-denial ” threats, or A2AD. The other five areas dealt with precision guided munitions, manned and unmanned underwater technology, cyber and electronic warfare systems, teams of manned and unmanned vehicles, and new concepts of operation that would bring all of this advanced technology together. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., AP The strategy applies to the Pentagon broadly, but the U.S. Navy and Air Force have been its primary benefactors. A significant portion of Third Offset developments are apparently so advanced that U.S. military officials only make vague references to them and have yet to put them on public display. The secretive Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), which answers directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, facilitates many of these efforts. Now, it’s true that the Third Offset may seem complicated to the average American. It’s also hardly the first time a senior U.S. defense official has admitted publicly to getting lost in the alphabet soup of American military acronyms and their associated jargon. In February 2016, U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, Jr., head of U.S. Pacific Command, was in the middle of a congressional hearing when, in a moment of frustration, he explained he couldn’t remember that “LRS-B” stood for the “Long Range Strike Bomber.” This was the project that led to the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, itself a product of the Third Offset strategy U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, Jr. at another congressional hearing in April 2017., AP “[I’m] so glad to hear someone in your position who doesn’t know one of the acronyms that’s being used,” Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic Senator for New Hampshire, told Admiral Harris. “Makes me feel so much better.” “ Acronyms kill, ma’am ,” Harris told her. Later on in the hearing, he admitted he couldn’t remember that “ CFIUS ” was “The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.” However, he could explain the organization’s purpose, which is to examine foreign investments and economic transactions for potential threats to American national security. But understanding the Third Offset seems like it would be a critical part of being the top civilian official in the U.S. Air Force. Some may even wonder if this speaks to previous concerns about Secretary Wilson’s suitability for the job, which advocacy groups had raised during the nomination process . USAF Wilson, a long-time Republican member the House of Representatives, left Congress in 2009 and established a one-woman consulting firm. She secured contracts, totaling $450,000, for work at four U.S. national nuclear laboratories, Sandia National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Nevada National Security Site. However, a 2013 investigation could not determine what, if any work she had actually done. Faced with this issue, the contractors who had brought her on simply opted to refund all of the money they had spent on her consulting fees to the federal government. The Department of Energy also looked into her work as part of a separate investigation into an illegal lobbying scheme, but could not determine conclusively if she was involved or not. There’s no reason to imagine any of this would lead her to be ignorant of the Third Offset issue, though. Wilson is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and an Air Force veteran who went on to serve as the director for European Defense Policy and Arms Control on the National Security Council staff under President George H.W. Bush. She also holds a PhD in international relations from Oxford University. There is always the possibility Wilson was making a lighthearted remark like Harris’ comment about acronyms. Whatever the case, there’s undoubtedly at least one person in the Air Force who can run through the Third Offset strategy for her if necessary. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Authors note: The original version of this article wrongly identified Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber‏‎ as “Marcus Weinberger.” It also incorrectly stated that the LRS-B was a SCO project, when it was a in fact run through the unrelated Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 24, 2019","USAF Awards Contractors Big Bucks for New ICBMs, But Future of Missiles is Uncertain","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has awarded two new major contracts as part of its plans to replace America’s existing and aging nuclear-tipped LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) arsenal, one of the three legs in the country’s “ Nuclear Triad ” deterrence concept. The announcements come amidst an on-going Pentagon-wide nuclear posture review, which could potentially have an impact on the future of the land-based missile force as a whole. On Aug. 21, 2017, in its daily contracting alert , the Pentagon announced the deals with Boeing and Northrop Grumman to mature their respective designs and conduct additional risk reduction work as part of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program, which aims to develop an all-new replacement for the Minuteman IIIs. Boeing’s contract was valued at more than $349 million, with Northrop Grumman’s deal was worth almost $329 million. It is not immediately clear why the two contracts, ostensibly for the same work, differ by such a significant amount . The Air Force declined to pursue an offer from a third bidder , top defense contractor Lockheed Martin, which had also been the only competitor to name its main sub-contractor partners, which included General Dynamics, Draper Laboratories, Moog, and Bechtel. Lockheed Martin also planned to work with both Orbital ATK and Aerojet Rocketdyne to procure the rocket motors for its new missiles. However, in 2016, the Air Force had already banned competitors from making exclusive arrangements with either firm. LGM-30 Minuteman III launch., USAF “We are moving forward with modernization of the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in an official statement . “Things just wear out, and it becomes more expensive to maintain them than to replace them. We need to cost-effectively modernize.” “GBSD is the most cost-effective ICBM replacement strategy, leveraging existing infrastructure while also implementing mature, modern technologies and more efficient operations, maintenance and security concepts,” U.S. Air Force General Robin Rand, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, the service’s top strategic headquarters, added. The new ICBMs are expected to replace the Air Force’s present arsenal of approximately 500 LGM-30G Minuteman III missiles. Per international agreements , the present missiles contain either a single W78 or W87 thermonuclear warhead . The W78 has an estimated yield of up to 350 kilotons of TNT, while the W87 may have a boosted yield of up to 475 kilotons. It is unclear whether the more powerful W87 variant was actually fielded or was just a prototype design. The original Minuteman entered service in the 1960s and received regular improvements, eventually leading to the Minuteman III configuration in the 1970s. The Air Force says it is no longer feasibly to simply upgrade the existing missiles to defeat future threats. USAF “The warfighter needs these capabilities and we can’t just make incremental improvements to Minuteman III,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Heath Collins,  the System Program Manager for the GBSD program at the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center’s ICBM Systems Directorate at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, explained earlier in 2017 . “It would be like taking your VHS player and trying to make it a Blu-Ray player by swapping out parts.” Boeing But as Secretary Wilson noted, these weapons are simply getting old and are therefore in need of a complete replacement . Based on the information available, Boeing and Northrop Grumman are looking to develop new designs that are more reliable and feature improved protections against emerging threats, specifically cyber attacks . On top of that, there is a concern that the dated Minuteman III design could be increasingly vulnerable to future enemy ballistic missile defenses. Spurred on by their concerns about such developments in the United States, both Russia and China appear to be working on new ballistic missile defenses, along with other anti-satellite weapons and advanced networked air defenses . “The Minuteman III will have a difficult time surviving in the active anti-access, area denial environment that we will be dealing with in the 2030 and beyond time period,” General Rand told members of Congress during a hearing in March 2016. Three months later, there were unconfirmed reports that the Chinese military had tested a new missile defense interceptor . As such, the Air Force could be looking for missiles with improved countermeasures systems to defeat a variety of ground, airborne, and space-based anti-ballistic missile systems and early warning sensors. Since the Cold War, the service has been actively working on steadily improving physical decoys, effectively metallic balloons that mimic the shape and characteristics of an actual warhead, that make it harder for defenders to target the real threat. Much of the actual design requirements for the new GBSD are classified, which isn’t surprising given the sensitivity of America’s nuclear deterrent. The Air Force has made it clear that it is looking to save money on its new weapons by focusing on modular components that can easily accept upgrades throughout the weapon’s lifetime. As General Rand alluded to, it is likely that the new missiles will fit in the Minuteman III silos and make use of other existing systems, at least initially. The Air Force is pursuing a separate program to upgrade various portions of its nuclear command and control architecture and is working with the U.S. Navy on updating communication systems both services operate jointly to assure U.S. officials can talk with ballistic missile submarines during a crisis. A Minuteman III in its silo., USAF On top of that, the Air Force clearly hopes to leverage the existing experience of Boeing and Northrop Grumman to help keep costs down. Both companies have long been involved in the Minuteman III program. “Since the first Minuteman launch in 1961, the U.S. Air Force has relied on our technologies for a safe, secure and reliable ICBM force,” Frank McCall, Boeing’s director of Strategic Deterrence Systems and the program manager for the company’s GBSD project, said in a statement . “As the Air Force prepares to replace the Minuteman III, we will once again answer the call by drawing on the best of Boeing to deliver the capability, flexibility and affordability the mission requires.” “We look forward to the opportunity to provide the nation with a modern strategic deterrent system that is secure, resilient and affordable,” Wes Bush, chairman, chief executive officer, and president of Northrop Grumman, said in a separate release . “As a trusted partner and technical integrator for the Air Force’s ICBM systems for more than 60 years, we are proud to continue our work to protect and defend our nation through its strategic deterrent capabilities.” A US Air Force transporter-erector vehicle prepares to extract a Minuteman III missile from its silo., USAF The Air Force has estimated the entire GBSD project could cost more than $62 billion. The Pentagon’s office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation arrived at a significantly higher estimate, placing the final price tag for the program at between $85 and $100 billion. In addition, these figures do not necessarily take into account the full spectrum of funds necessary for routine maintenance and regular improvements after the new missiles enter service. The total program cost is an especially important consideration in this case since the Air Force is presently in the midst of a host of other expensive modernization projects, including continued development of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, work on the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber and follow-on sixth generation stealth fighter jet concepts , and other critical assets like the KC-46 tanker and possible successors . There’s also just the need to maintain and update existing fleets of aircraft to support immediate operational needs. All of this begs the question of whether the service can afford to spend hundreds of millions to replace hundreds of missiles of potentially dubious utility. Sustaining the missile force isn’t just a matter of the IBCMs, their silos, and the command and control systems, as well. The vast missile fields require a significant security presence that needs modernizing, too. Most notably, the Air Force has struggled to find the necessary resources to replace aging UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters that patrol the sites and are on call to respond to an emergency. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NqZ9XvzFiqw There’s also a long-standing and serious concern about the morale of missile units, with many missileers describing it as a “ dead-end career ” in a service that unsurprisingly gives preference for promotion to its members who fly airplanes, and fast ones in particular. In 2013, the ICBM force suffered a particularly damning string of high profile scandals that prompted a major Air Force review of the conditions throughout the missile force. Ahead of the Pentagon’s announcement of its latest nuclear posture review , The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway explained the issues with modernizing ICBM force in detail, writing: What I propose is controversial, but I think it is wise. At the very least, the Pentagon needs to deeply review options for reorganizing America’s nuclear triad into a nuclear dyad. America’s tired land based intercontinental ballistic missile program could be retired, and those many tens of billions of dollars could refocused to build a larger, far better funded nuclear ballistic missile submarine force. The Air Force would also receive a large portion of those savings to buy the B-21 Raider stealth bomber force it says it desperately needs, as well as a new very stealthy and smart nuclear-tipped cruise missile to go along with it. There is no doubt that some will oppose screwing with the nuclear triad at all, but the fact is hundreds of billions of dollars are required over the next decade to modernize the triad, and still capability sacrifices will have to be made. Yes, America’s ICBMs would theoretically work as a strategic “sponge” to soak up hundreds of enemy warheads during a nuclear exchange, but that strategy can be viewed as flawed on multiple levels. The fact is, the land-based leg of our nuclear arsenal is disposable, and the money it sucks up and will continue to suck up can be used to bolster the other two legs of the triad to an extreme degree. Also, by eliminating the land-based ICBM leg of the triad, not only can the other two legs be greatly improved, but advances in conventional war fighting capability can also be realized as a secondary result. US Air Force missileers train on a launch control simulator system., USAF With all of these considerations it’s not surprising that there’s some indication that support for at least considering eliminating the ICBM force might be growing within the U.S. military. Earlier in August 2017, during a gathering at Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State, a U.S. Navy sailor pointedly asked Secretary of Defense James Mattis about whether the Pentagon really planned to maintain all three legs of the nuclear triad. “I think we’re going to keep all three legs of the deterrent,” Mattis said, but immediately left open the possibility that the nuclear posture review could recommend otherwise. “I think we need the other two legs [bombers and IBCMs].  But I’ve got to wait until the posture review is done.” In the meantime, Boeing and Northrop Grumman will continue refining their GBSD designs. But by the time they’re ready to move onto the next phase of the program, the very future of America’s ICBM force may have changed itself.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2019",This Lakeside Border Brawl Between Indian And Chinese Troops Has Sent Tensions Soaring,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fallout from a brawl on the shores of Pangong Tso , a lake along the border between China’s Tibet autonomous region and India’s Ladakh province, has threatened to add a new dimension to a weeks-long stand-off between the two countries over a portion of territory further east known as the Dolam Plateau, or Doklam or Doka La . Though Indian and Chinese authorities have disputed the boundaries for decades, the latest tensions are especially serious and have prompted concerns about the potential for more serious skirmishes. The latest incident occurred on Aug. 15, 2017, when Chinese and Indian troops physically attacked each other with poles and rocks near Pangong Tso, which sits along the so-called Line of Actual Control, or LAC, the de facto border as pending a final, negotiated settlement. No one was serious injured, but both sides blamed the other for serious violations of the established quo, with China’s Foreign Ministry making an especially terse statement nearly a week later. Members of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were conducting “normal” patrols of the Chinese side of the LAC along Pangong Tso when “they were obstructed by Indian border forces,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunyin said at a press conference on Aug. 21, 2017. “The Indian side took fierce actions, colliding with the Chinese personnel and having contact with their bodies, injuring the Chinese border personnel.” An Indian source told Reuters that Indian troops had actually blocked an attempted incursion into Ladakh along the lake. This then devolved into the scuffle when the Chinese troops refused to depart. Hua seemed to categorically dismiss any assertion that China had sent its forces beyond the status quo boundaries, calling on India to make sure its border troops followed the spirit of existing border agreements. She added that “China is extremely dissatisfied and had lodged solemn representations,” according to Chinese state media outlet Xinhua . As noted, this is not the first time the two countries have clashed along Pangong Tso, nor is it the only time a skirmish has erupted between China and India in Ladakh, despite a number of agreements, including a protocol outlining specific confidence-building measures in 2005. In 2013 and in 2014, there were stand-offs over various military construction projects in the Depsang Plains area in the northern portion of the province. In 2016, Chinese attempts to expand a canal near Demchok further south. The lack of a final agreement on the boundaries, which have been at issue since the end of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, means that accusations of provocations, outright incursions, and physical scuffles are hardly uncommon. India and China cite a host of historical claims , colonial-era agreements, and the long-established status quo to defend their rhetorical positions. Indian Minister of External Affairs Vijay Kumar Singh, left, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi shake hands before a meeting in June 2017., AP What makes this latest situation more worrisome is that it seems to build off a separate stand-off over the status of the Dolam Plateau, which sits in the middle of the tri-border area between China, India, and small Kingdom of Bhutan. Though control of this area too has long been in dispute, the nature of the latest incursion appears more significant and serious than those in the past. This altercation began on June 16, 2017, when Indian troops situated in Bhutan as part of a collective security agreement between those countries, crossed over the LAC into Chinese controlled territory to prevent PLA engineers from extending a road toward the Bhutanese border. Neither India nor China seems to dispute that the construction was fully within the Chinese side of the boundary, but Indian officials seem to have acted preemptively out of concern that the new roadway could pose a real threat to their own claims on the region. AP This has created a complex political and diplomatic conundrum, with Indian and Chinese authorities effectively arguing cross-purposes, both unwilling to give any rhetorical ground. It’s hard to suggest that India has not violated China’s sovereignty and the spirit of the 2004 confidence-building measures, as well as other existing agreements on the status quo of the two countries shared borders. However, India says the real issue that China, rather than negotiating in good faith, is actually stalling any attempts a final settlement while it seizes control of more territory. Indian troops arrive to help reopen the the Nathu La border crossing with China, southwest of the Dolam Plateau, in 2006. , AP The strategic importance of the otherwise obscure region cannot be overstated. The Indian government sees a direct threat to its security from any Chinese moves to gain greater control over the Dolam Plateau. The mountainous area would give the PLA an advantageous position over the Siliguri Corridor , a stretch of land less than 15 miles wide between Nepal and Bangladesh that forms India’s narrowest point. In any large-scale conflict, it could easily be a chokepoint, effectively severing India’s far eastern provinces from the rest of the country. The Chinese, understanding the importance of region, too, have vastly expanded road and rail networks on their side of the LAC since 1962. If completed, the new road would only add to the PLA’s ability to quickly move troops into the gap during a war. Private geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor has argued that China’s existing infrastructure developments already give its military a significant advantage in any theoretical fight. In July 2017, the PLA conducted a live-fire artillery exercise in Tibet, seen as a demonstration of its combat capabilities in the region. The month before, the Chinese military had begun testing a new light tank , optimized for operations in mountainous terrain, in the autonomous region, as well. The ZTQ tank is the successor to the Type 62 , which the PLA developed in the late 1950s specifically for operations along the country’s southern borders, which feature large mountain ranges, rivers and lakes, and heavily irrigated rice paddies and associated canals, all of which are generally poor terrain for heavy armored vehicles. The PLA’s new ZTQ light mountain tank., Via China Defense Blog Thankfully, there doesn’t seem to be an immediate threat of all out war. That’s not to say it isn’t lingering the background, though. Both India and China have been steadily reinforcing their respective positions around the Dolam Plateau clearly to be ready if the crisis escalates. The PLA has been able to make good use of their existing road and rail networks already, again reinforcing the importance of this new construction in their overall strategy in the region. The bigger immediate concern is that the Chinese government will increasingly dispense with the status quo elsewhere along the border, using India’s preemption in the Dolam Plateau as an excuse to push elsewhere and seek additional concessions. In turn, India could see this as vindicating evidence that China has never intended to actually negotiate a fair and equal border arrangement, making it even harder to deescalate the situation. This is why the possible incursion into the Indian side of Pangong Tso, though not out of the ordinary in of itself, seems more dangerous than those in the past. China has already scrapped one annual meeting between the PLA and its Indian counterparts that was a significant component of the 2005 confidence-building deal. The new dispute in the tri-border area also has the potential to become a multi-side conflict, with Indian troops stationed in Bhutan and the Chinese actively courting their Bhutanese counterparts with increased economic and infrastructure cooperation. Building the road toward the Bhutanese rather than Indian border appears to have been a deliberate and calculated move to try further drive a wedge between the two countries. Bhutan’s Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, center, meets with Sri Lankan President Maithipala Sirisena, right, in 2015., AP Earlier in August 2017, Global Times, an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, ran an editorial slamming India’s treatment of its neighbors, including Bhutan, and reinforcing the potential benefits of cooperation with China. For its part, tiny Bhutan has been trying to stay neutral, but there is a question of whether this relative silence amounts to a tactic approval of China’s position. “If you raise the Doklam issue, you will not get any response,” the personal secretary of Bhutan’s Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay reportedly told The Week’s Rabi Banerjee. “It is a calculated decision, which has come from the top. No one would speak a word.” After more than eight weeks, neither China nor India looks inclined to concede the issue, while Bhutan appears content to try and wait out the crisis. Hopefully, all of the parties will be able to find a way to break the deadlock and find a solution to the impasse short of an actual war.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 5, 2023",Back To Back U.S. Drones Crashes in Turkey as Tensions Simmer Between the Two Countries,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two MQ-1B Predator drones flying from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey have crashed in three days, possibly cutting the total number of operational drones the U.S. Air Force has situated at the base in half. Combined with the pending retirement of the Predator across the service and tensions between the two countries over support for Kurdish groups in Syria, the accidents might have an immediate impact on operations, as well as feed into increasingly strained U.S.-Turkish relations. On Aug. 18, 2017, the Air Force confirmed that an MQ-1 had crashed in southern Turkey near Incirlik. On Aug. 21, 2017, the service acknowledged a second Predator had come down in southeastern Turkey. “At this time the safety of our host nation civilians and the recovery and security of our asset is paramount,” Air Force Colonel David Eaglin, head of the 39th Air Base Wing, which oversees U.S. military activity at Incirlik, said after the first accident. “Our Airmen train continuously to respond to incidents such as this, and we are working closely with our host nation partners to ensure this is resolved without conflict.” There are no details as yet as to why the aircraft crashed and both mishaps are under investigation. Though there were no reported injuries or fatalities in either case, the 39th put out a notice saying that anyone who believed they had suffered other damages could call their legal office in order to report them and make a claim for potential reimbursement. Pictures on social media of the second incident did show the Predator wreckage in what appeared to be a private cornfield. It’s not immediately clear if this will have any impact on Predator operations from Incirlik or U.S. military missions, including the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, in general. But there is the possibility that the Air Force’s Predator force at the Turkish base may now be at half strength. In November 2011, coinciding with the formal withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, the United States agreed to relocate one combat air patrol, or CAP, of Predators to Incirlik. An MQ-1 CAP has four drones in total. We don’t know if the Air Force subsequently deployed any additional CAPs to Incirlik on top of this first one. A slide from a 2013 briefing describing the original deployment of Predators to Incirlik in 2011., DOD Regardless, the Air Force now likely faces a complicated decision about the future of the unmanned aircraft mission in Turkey. It is possible that the service could continue with a half-strength CAP, at least for the moment, but it would greatly limit the unit’s ability to perform the kind of persistent surveillance that has become a hallmark of American drone operations. The four-ship model is based on the idea that one aircraft is always on station over a target area, with another one preparing to take over and a third heading back to base to refuel. The fourth aircraft is in reserve to take over in the case of an accident or maintenance issue. But if the Air Force does decide to shift additional Predators to Incirlik to make up for the shortfall, it will have effectively replaced 100 percent of the MQ-1s there over the past five years. In September 2012, one of the drones flying from Turkish base crashed , followed by another mishap in October 2015. An MQ-1 Predator., USAF With plans to completely retire the Predator by 2018, the Air Force may decide that this is an ideal moment to transition the unit in Turkey to the more capable MQ-9 Reaper or to simply shutter the drone operations there altogether. Though the service has steadily been retiring MQ-1s, it has not always replaced them one for one. In December 2015, the Air Force stood down the 60th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron in Djibouti, which had flown the Predator over Africa for five years. Instead of sending additional Reapers, the service decided to simply continue operations with the MQ-9s that it already had at the country’s Chabelley Airfield . At that time, the seemed to make good sense given the Air Force’s chronic shortage of drone pilots and sensor operators, as well as aviators in general, along with what seemed like a general reduction in drone missions over Yemen and Somalia, a trend that quickly reversed itself in 2016. Those operations have only continued to expand even more under President Donald Trump’s administration. The demand for unmanned aircraft over Iraq and Syria doesn’t appear to be waning now or look like it will do so any time soon. So, in July 2017, when the Air Force’s 361st Expeditionary Attack Squadron, situated in Kuwait, stopped flying Predators , it immediately replaced them with Reapers. An MQ-9 Reaper., USAF Beyond the operational considerations, though, there may be a political dimension to a decision either continue or halt drone operations from Incirlik. After first arriving there in 2011, the 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron spent at least two and half years flying unarmed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions targeting the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, better known by its Kurdish acronym PKK, along the Turkey-Iraq border. The U.S. military would then share relevant intelligence information with their Turkish counterparts, who would launch direct attacks on the group’s camps and fighting positions. Both the United States and Turkey have formally designated the PKK as a terrorist organization. According to heavily redacted documents the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, this mission, known as Operation Nomad Shadow, was still ongoing in some form as of July 2014. However, Nomad Shadow was not on a list of active U.S. European Command operations released in response to another FOIA request three months later. A portion of a 2014 fragmentary order (FRAGORD) to the main Operation Nomad Shadow consolidated operations order (OPORD)., EUCOM via FOIA Whether or not the United States curtailed its support for Turkey’s fight against the PKK, the two countries have increasingly sparred over how to handle that organization, as well as support for Kurdish groups across the border in Syria. As we at The War Zone have explained in detail in the past, Turkish authorities see no distinction between the PKK and People’s Protection Units, more commonly known by the acronym YPG, who form the core element of U.S.-supported now pushing their way deeper into ISIS de facto capital of Raqqa and other areas. The dispute has already pushed Turkey to cooperate closer with Russia, including helping develop a plan for so-called “ de-escalation zones ” in Syria. YPG fighters with the SDF battle ISIS in Raqqa in July 2017., AP In May 2017, the U.S. government told its Turkish counterparts that it had no intention of cutting off support for the YPG. The next month, American officials announced plans to charge members of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s security detail over their actions during a brawl with activists outside the country’s embassy in Washington, D.C. Then, in July 2017, Anadolu , a Turkish state-run news outlet, ran a story detailing the locations of American forces in Syria, which many saw as retaliation for the U.S. military’s continued support for the Syrian Kurds. Earlier in August 2017, the YPG’s official media arm posted a video online of Kurdish fighters attacking Turkish-backed rebels in Syria, further inflaming the existing tensions. As such, planning to remove the MQ-1s from Turkey without a direct replacement or continuing the operation at Incirlik could both have a diplomatic impact, both on U.S. government relations with Turkish officials and with Kurdish groups in Syria. There is already the possibility the situation across the border is becoming increasingly complex, with a spokesman for the American-supported Syrian Democratic Forces telling Reuters that the U.S. military was expecting to remain in the country for the foreseeable future. The Pentagon subsequently denied it had any plans for operations in Syria beyond the defeat of ISIS. On top of that, there has been a general debate over the future of operations at Incirlik following an attempted coup in 2016 and the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of the Turkish government under Erdoğan since then. The United States has so far declined to extradite Fethullah Gülen, who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania and who Turkish authorities have accused of fomenting the uprising in the first place. In the end, how the Air Force approaches the future of its drone mission at Incirlik could turn out to be especially important for setting the tone of relations with Turkey immediately and in the long term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","President Trump Orders Pentagon to Elevate Cyber Command, But That’s the Easy Part","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Putting new emphasis on military cyber operations, President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to elevate its top cyberspace headquarters, U.S. Cyber Command, to a so-called “unified combatant command,” putting it on the same level with other functional unified commands such as U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). This decision has been long in the making, predating the Trump Administration, and is only one small part of a larger, ongoing discussion about the exact roles and responsibilities of U.S. military “ cyber ” forces. Trump and the Department of Defense both made separate announcements about the transformation of Cyber Command, or CYBERCOM, on Aug. 18, 2017. Previously, the headquarters had been subordinate to U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) . “This new Unified Combatant Command will strengthen our cyberspace operations and create more opportunities to improve our Nation’s defense,” Trump said in a written statement . “The elevation of United States Cyber Command demonstrates our increased resolve against cyberspace threats and will help reassure our allies and partners and deter our adversaries. United States Cyber Command’s elevation will also help streamline command and control of time-sensitive cyberspace operations by consolidating them under a single commander with authorities commensurate with the importance of such operations.” The “elevation of U.S. Cyber Command … reflects the growing centrality of cyberspace to U.S. national security,” the Pentagon said in its own release . “Raising the organizational status of U.S. Cyber Command is intended to demonstrate visibly DoD’s long-term commitment to cyberspace as a warfighting domain. It also signals the department’s resolve to embrace the changing nature of warfare – thus helping to reassure partners and deter adversaries.” The US Army’s Cyber Operations Center at Fort Gordon, Georgia., US Army This change reflects the latest transition for CYBERCOM since the decision to create it in the first place in 2009. After reaching full operational capability in 2010, the command quickly absorbed even older cyber defense entities, the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations ( JTF-GNO ) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare ( JFCC-NW ). JTF-GNO had stood up in 1998, followed by JFCC-NW in 2005. More importantly, at present, the Pentagon requires the head of CYBERCOM to be the same individual who runs the National Security Agency (NSA). The decision to make the cyber headquarters its own separate entity has no effect on this command structure. So what is CYBERCOM turning into? The decision to elevate the status of CYBERCOM changes very little and a lot, all at once. As far as the average person is concerned, there probably won’t be a lot of visible differences in the new command structure. The cyber operations headquarters isn’t getting a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as has been suggested could happen as part of plans for a new Space Corps , and its stated mission is unlikely to be any different from what it is now. The command’s main jobs will remain protecting U.S. military computer networks and conducting other offensive and defensive military missions in cyberspace – a nebulous mission set and a separate issue we’ll come back to later. CYBERCOM will continue to oversee the activities of the cyber elements of all the services – U.S. Army Cyber Command, the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Cyber Command, U.S. Air Force Cyber Command, and U.S. Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace – and directly support U.S. Coast Guard Cyber Command, even though that unit technically falls under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It will still coordinate with DHS, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the other 16 members of the U.S. Intelligence Community. There may be some paperwork involved, but CYBERCOM and its components won’t stop handling Operation Gladiator Shield , the official nickname for the Pentagon’s over-arching global network defense mission. The more than 130 national Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams will keep on doing whatever it is that they do . There’s no reason to assume that the established arrangements that have the different service cyber components support specific U.S. military’s regional commands and SOCOM will change in the near future. USAF But pulling CYBERCOM out from under STRATCOM gives the head of America’s military cyberspace forces significantly more authority and stature. Instead of being as subordinate to STRATCOM’s top officer, they’ll be an equal. As Trump noted in his statement, this could dramatically speed up the response to a massive data breach, denial of service attack against military networks, or other cyberspace crisis since the command will be able to make many more decisions on its own. CYBERCOM’s commander no longer has to go through STRATCOM’s chain of command, which was additionally awkward given their other status as head of the separate NSA. In addition, the four-star officer at the top of CYBERCOM’s leadership becomes a single, top manager to coordinate the purchase of the often unique equipment it needs, setting core standards for training specialized personal for cyber jobs, and other mundane, but no less critical administrative duties. They’ll be in charge of setting the tone for exercises on the U.S. military’s cyberspace training “ranges” and promoting long-standing, but slow moving plans for a single unified environment for online drills. USAF Cyberspace is getting dangerous All of this emphasizes the existing importance of cyberspace for American military operations, which have become heavily reliant on computerized systems and integrated networks. There’s no suggestion that we’ll see a change in this trend and other foreign forces are heading in the same direction. This means that protecting against hostile attacks through cyberspace and launching responses against enemy assets will steadily become a more commonplace component of U.S. military missions. We’ve already seen what this sort warfare might entail and guarding against intrusions won’t just be a matter of updating anti-virus software. Assaulting networks, either to disrupt them or take them over in order to sow misinformation and general chaos, is hardly a new concept. Russia in particular has become a major user of cyber attacks in order to influence foreign elections, including in the United States. In June 2017, I wrote : “Hacking,” which seems to imply directly breaking into a computer network to change an election result , might not necessarily be the most accurate description of the Kremlin’s activities. Foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as well as independent cyber security firms and experts, have more accurately said Russian agents and government sponsored actors have selectively stolen and leaked information to smear certain politicians and political parties, possibly seeded those leaks with or been duped into releasing fabricated documents, actively spread disinformation , and otherwise sought to manipulate the public discourse. Both organizations and individuals have taken responsibility for these operations. Some of these, such as the individual or individuals claiming to be the hacker Guccifer 2.0 , have insisted they’re acting on their own accord despite evidence linking them to Russian intelligence agencies. Notably, in October 2016, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), an element of the Department of Homeland Security, released an unclassified Joint Analysis Report with “details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS).” The review specifically looked at entities known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 and APT 29, better known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear . These two groups are widely understood to be directly under the control of the military Main Intelligence Agency (GRU) and either the civilian Federal Security Service (FSB) or Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), respectively. Cyber-security firms had previously connected the organizations to cyber attacks dating as far back as 2008. DHS said its information was part of a broader investigative operation into “Russian malicious cyber activity,” which it had nicknamed Grizzly Steppe . The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has previously explored how even more active election-day cyber attacks are a virtual inevitably, writing : Even with a broad audience, fear, and uncertainty may not be the goal of some adversaries. Barring the public from accessing information may prove to be just as powerful a tactic as any. On October 21st , hackers used lower-end internet connected devices to stifle access to the net with a series of mass DDoS attacks , affecting tens of millions of Americans. It seems clear that a peer state actor could use more harmful and precise attacks to creatively sway elections. But our vulnerabilities don’t end there. Much in the same way that weather can affect voter turnout , cyber attacks could do the same. Strikes on the power grid in key areas could disrupt the predicted outcome of a Presidential election – especially in key swing states where polling is extremely close. This is especially true in demographically slanted areas, such as big cities. These population centers often lean one way while rural parts of the same state lean the other. Attacking cities’ power grids, transportation arteries or other critical infrastructure, while leaving rural areas untouched, could result in a significant advantage for one candidate over another. In a more military-focused context, Russia appears to be actively experimenting with spoofing and jamming or disabling GPS navigation signals, which could send troops off course, misdirect bombs or missiles, or otherwise impact operations. The U.S. military is becoming increasingly aware of its need to have a plan for working in GPS-denied environments . A member of a US Army cyber electromagnetic activities team mans a piece of equipment during an exercise., US Army Cyberspace as a battlefield In addition to these attacks being known threats, we’ve also heard about U.S. government development of their own similar cyber weapons. There were reportedly plans in place for a massive, widespread cyberspace blitz on a variety of targets in Iran, collectively known as “ Nitro Zeus ,” in case the international deal over that county’s controversial nuclear program fell through. Though that cyber strike never occurred, some of the same tools and tricks might have entered up pointed at ISIS. Back in February 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford gave some important details about those activities during a briefing at the Pentagon. Using another commonly acronym for ISIS, Dunford specifically explained : “The secretary has talked a lot about physically isolating ISIL. In other words, isolating Raqqa, isolating Mosul, keeping the lines of communications between the two being separate, dividing Iraq and Syria up, making life difficult for the – for the – for ISIL. I think conceptually, that’s exactly the same thing we’re trying to do in the cyber world. In other words, we’re trying to both physically and virtually isolate ISIL, limit their ability to conduct command and control, limit their ability to communicate with each other, limit their ability to conduct operations locally and tactically. “But I’ll be one of the first ones arguing that that’s about all we should talk about. Most importantly, we don’t want the enemy to know when, where and how we’re conducting cyber operations. We don’t want them to have information that will allow them to adapt over time. We want them to be surprised when we conduct cyber operations. And frankly, they’re going to experience some friction that’s associated with us and some friction that’s just associated with the normal course of events in dealing in the information age. And frankly, we don’t want them to know the difference. So they – it’s to our advantage to maintain the element of surprise with regard to conducting cyber operations.” Cyber operations against the terrorist group are still ongoing and there have been rumors of new, exotic weapons in Iraq and Syria. “The Cyber Mission Force is making significant contributions in meeting the department’s toughest challenges, including the fight against ISIS,” the Pentagon noted in their statement about the change in CYBERCOM’s status. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, you can read more about how U.S. military commanders in the Middle East define operational cyber warfare here , as well. So, having a central advocate and manager for all of these increasingly important capabilities and in the face of growing threats definitely makes good practical sense. U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Rogers, head of both NSA and CYBERCOM., AP Military operations versus intelligence Unfortunately, elevating CYBERCOM’s stature within the Pentagon doesn’t necessarily get into the more difficult and long-running discussion about just what the U.S. military’s cyber forces are supposed to do and their relationship to other agencies that have a vested interest in cyberspace. This is where the intertwined relationship between CYBERCOM and the NSA comes into question. The reason this arrangement exists is because both organizations are effectively tasked with protecting against cyberspace breaches against military networks and operational cyberspace activities against foreign entities. The problem is that CYBERCOM’s mission is focused on creating more conventional military-style effects – interrupting an enemy’s ability to operate or even actively destroying their capacity to do so – whereas NSA’s goal is to break in and steal information. These two mission sets are tangentially related, but more often than not are in a certain amount of conflict. Maintaining covert access to a network for intelligence purposes is predicated on your opponent not knowing you’re there, which effectively precludes cyber attacks. Inversely, an operational cyber assault that achieves an immediate success might expose a vulnerability that intelligence specialists could’ve exploited, but ends up sealed off from further breaches afterwards. AP “For as long as there has been signals intelligence, there have been tensions of this kind,” Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a detailed exploration of this issue for the blog Lawfare , which is worth reading in its entirety. “When one side has access to the other’s communications, there will always be tension between the temptation to exploit that access for operational effect (with the opportunity cost of risking loss of that access going forward as the enemy realizes it has been monitored) and the temptation to instead exploit it for indirect intelligence advantage (with the opportunity cost of forgoing direct operational advantage in at least some cases).” In theory, having the head of CYBERCOM be the same person in charge of NSA was supposed to help mitigate this inherent conflict of interest, as well as boost coordination between the two intrinsically linked domains. However, critics have long worried that one focus – intelligence or military operations – would always be favored over the other. Given NSA’s substantially greater authority, most assumed intelligence collection would always prevail under the existing system. In September 2016, U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Rogers, who has this so-called “dual hat,” pointedly warned about this situation himself, advocating in front of Congress for the two entities to go their separate ways as soon as feasible. “While USCYBERCOM resides with NSA, the two organizations are distinct entities with separate missions, authorities, and resource streams,” Rogers explained in written testimony that seemed to expose his own bias. ”Neither is an arm of the other, and both perform vital tasks on behalf of our nation.” AP A maze of laws and budgets At the same time, Rogers highlighted the other fundamental issue with this marriage of convenience. CYBERCOM relies heavily on NSA systems and cyber architecture to perform its own missions. While it’s fair to ask whether this is a product of the two being effectively blended together, it does mean that pulling the entities apart could be complicated and require significant time and investment in new resources. It’s hard legally to consider going in the opposite direction and blending CYBERCOM even more closely together with NSA. This is in order to try and keep foreign intelligence collection and military operations separate and distinct for oversight purposes. The law that allows for the elevation of the military cyber headquarters to a unified combatant command makes this clear, stating “this section does not constitute authority to conduct any activity which, if carried out as an intelligence activity by the Department of Defense, would require a notice to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.” Even if CYBERCOM and NSA were to split formally, it seems unlikely that they would be able to ever really operate without constantly consulting with each other. It’s difficult to say how it would be best preserve both of these critical functions and give them equal attention and status, but it’s a question that will be increasingly important to answer. USAF The draft defense budget bills for the 2018 fiscal year now making their way through the House and Senate include sections requiring the Pentagon or CYBERCOM command specifically to provided detailed breakdowns of certain parts of the issue. The House wants a report on the remaining budgetary and statutory hurdles that would need fixing before any split. The Senate is particularly interested in finding out how much this change would cost. As it stands now, since it maintains much of the necessary systems, NSA controls the bulk of the budget. A truly independent CYBERCOM would need its own, complete funding. Legislators will need to reconcile these different provisions before any defense spending plan can become law. On top of that, existing laws make it clear that before any split occurs, both parties have to make sure each can properly advance their own missions independently. When and if the reports make it to Congress it’ll be clearer just how feasible that separation might be. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2018",A-10 Warthogs Drop Bunker Buster Bombs in Combat for the First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For years now, the venerable A-10 Warthog has been one of the most active aircraft in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Despite the U.S. Air Force’s long-standing argument that the blunt-nosed attackers can only perform a limited number of missions , the service continues to expand their capabilities, with the plane’s recently dropping bunker-busting GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions in combat for the first time. Earlier in August 2017, Air Force revealed that A-10s assigned to the the 447th Air Expeditionary Group situated at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey had dropped the first 2,000-pound class GBU-31(V)3/B JDAM, which contains the BLU-109/B hard target penetrating warhead, on ISIS positions either in Iraq or Syria. An official video showed ground crews loading one of the weapons onto a Warthog alongside another GBU-31/B with a regular high explosive warhead. In keeping with a long-standing tradition of adding slogans and other art to bombs, someone painted on the logo of the comic book vigilante anti-hero the Punisher . First introduced in the 1990s, the BLU-109 warhead has a one inch thick hardened steel case that can break through four to six feet of reinforced concrete. Despite its overall weight, the bomb has less than 600 pounds of explosive inside. The Air Force is in the process of purchasing a new, more reliable version of the weapon, known as the BLU-137/B . As of August 2017, A-10s assigned to the 447th were averaging 750 strikes against ISIS every month, according to the Air Force. This makes the Warthogs “one of the most feared and combat effective aircraft in the fight,” U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Andrew Walck explained in the official news segment. US Air Force personnel assemble BLU-109s into complete GBU-31(V)3/Bs during an exercise., USAF The month before, pilots from the 74th Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, the “Flying Tigers,” had brought the Warthogs to take over for elements from the 354th Fighter Squadron out of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. A-10s have been flying over Iraq and Syria continuously since November 2014, making good use of their ability to carry a large and diverse array of stores on each sortie, along with the integral GAU-8/A Avenger cannon , and loiter over target areas for extended periods of time. Based on what we’d seen, their primary weapons had been 500-pound class GBU-38/B JDAMs, GBU-12/B Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and GBU-58/B dual-mode laser JDAMs. AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles and rocket pods loaded with laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II rockets have been common, as well. In March 2017, the Air Force revealed that it spent the first months of its aerial campaign against ISIS using the wrong tactics and weapons . Variants of the GBU-38/Bs with special low-collateral damage warheads in particular were of limited utility against large static targets, such as oil infrastructure, and tunnel networks. In a presentation at the National Defense Industry Association’s Precision Strike Annual Review, U.S. Air Force Major Brian Baker said that this experience had led directly to an increased use of 2,000-pound class BLU-109 penetrating warheads and GBU-31/Bs in general. The main platforms for these weapons were B-1B Bone and then B-52 BUFF bombers , as well as F-15E Strike Eagle multi-role jets. A slide from US Air Force Major Brian Baker’s March 2017 presentation., USAF However, in May 2017, pictures began to emerge of A-10s carrying GBU-31/Bs, but only with the regular high-explosive warheads. Now the Warthogs are bringing bunker busters to the fight, too. We don’t know if the fighting in Iraq or Syria changed in such a way to make integrating the bombs on the A-10 a priority. Adding the capability to the Warthogs would make good sense in general, if just to give commanders the added flexibility of another aircraft that could carry the weapons. An A-10 carrying a GBU-31/B with a regular high explosive warhead along with rockets, an AGM-65 missile, and two GBU-12 Paveway IIs., USAF There doesn’t appear to be any shortage of relevant targets, either. Though the U.S.-led coalition has helped local forces in Iraq and Syria dramatically push back ISIS, the group continues to occupy significant territory. In Syria, the American-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are still fighting to liberate the city of Raqqa, which has been ISIS de facto capital, as well as other areas in Syria,. Iraqi troops and police elements have begun a push to retake the city of Tal Afar, as well. Just on Aug. 17, 2017, coalition aircraft blew up an ISIS headquarters and “media center” near Dayr Az Zawr, Syria, and destroyed two tunnels and damaged three bridges in Iraq’s Tal Afar, according to the Pentagon’s daily strike reporting. These are exactly the kind of targets that Major Baker had identified as requiring 2,000-pound weapons in his March briefing. Terrorist tunnels in particular continue to be major threat and ISIS has stepped up their use in no small part to try and avoid coalition air strikes. In Raqqa specifically, they have been a major impediment for SDF forces, especially combined with improvised explosive devices, car bombs, and other booby-traps. “ISIS has had time to rig up thousands of fiendishly clever explosives and to dig extensive tunnels throughout the city,” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the top spokesman for the U.S. military’s task force fighting ISIS, told members of the press on Aug. 16, 2017. “They are using these tunnels and improvised explosive devices to attack advancing SDF fighters, as well as noncombatants trying to flee their homes. In the last two days, ISIS mounted a planned counterattack through these tunnels, which the SDF managed to repulse.” Another A-10 carrying a regular high explosive GBU-31/B, as well as other weapons., USAF The BLU-109-armed JDAMs are ideally suited to blasting down into these passageways and sealing them up. It seems likely that the A-10s have already been flying from Incrilik in support of the Raqqa operation. “It’s nice to see the bombs get loaded and the jets come back without them,” Senior Airman Joshua Coll, who leads one of the teams that loads weapons onto the Warthogs at the base in Turkey, told the service’s reporters . “That means that hostile targets died. That means we got the mission done. We either took out a high value target or we’re saving our troops on the ground.” With the GBU-31(V)3/Bs added to their arsenal, the A-10s look set to keep flying increasingly diverse missions, and more of them, against ISIS.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 31, 2018",General Atomics Gives First Clues About its MQ-25 Drone Tanker Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More information has already been emerging about the competitors in the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based drone program and now General Atomics has given an official, if vague statement about its up-coming proposal. Depending on what airframe the company ends up going with, reported sales of the Avenger design to the U.S. government and potential foreign deals for that aircraft could improve its chances, especially as the Navy continues to water down its own requirements. David Alexander, president of aircraft systems for General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), disclosed the first details about its MQ-25 plans on Aug. 16, 2017. In addition to working on the Navy project and pitching Avenger to foreign militaries, GA-ASI is the firm responsible for the U.S. Air Force’s iconic MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft, as well as the U.S. Army’s Warrior Alpha and MQ-1C Gray Eagle . “We’ve been following this thing for seven years. I think we’ve got it down and we’ve got the right airplane.” Alexander said, according to USNI News. “Our design is optimized.” He did not offer any additional details about how their design would meet the Navy’s needs, which are presently for an unmanned tanker, or confirm whether or not it would be based around the existing Avenger design. General Atomics has not released any MQ-25-specific concept art or other notional specifications. General Atomic’s Avenger., GA-ASI However, when Alexander says General Atomics has been keeping an eye on the Navy’s developments for seven years, he’s talking about when the company first pitched a version of the Avenger for what became known as the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator (UCAS-D) program. The Navy’s initial plan with that carrier-based drone demonstration project to feed into the follow-on Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) project, which aimed to add a pilotless low-observable reconnaissance and strike aircraft to each carrier air wing. The Navy chose Northrop Grumman’s X-47B for the UCAS-D, but did include GA-ASI and its navalized “Sea Avenger” in the early stages of UCLASS. When the service abandoned UCLASS for the much less ambitious Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS) concept, the company continued as potential contender. An artist’s conception of the General Atomics’ Sea Avenger, GA-ASI In the tanker role, the existing Sea Avenger or another derivative of the basic airframe could start with certain advantages over the existing UCLASS concepts from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, all of which are tail-less stealthy flying wing designs with internal payload storage only. The Avenger platform has both an internal payload bay and the ability to carry stores on six under wing pylons. A theoretical load of five drop tanks and the Cobham buddy store refueling pod, which the Navy says each competitor must use in their proposal, plus additional fuel in the internal payload bay would give the aircraft a significantly larger fuel load over its rivals. Northrop Grumman just recently began testing flying an X-47B with a single drop tank under one wing and the buddy pod under the other. The Avenger has also shown promise as a sensor truck if the Navy decides it is still interested in having limited intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities on the MQ-25. The design could readily accommodate a variety of electro-optical cameras, infrared systems, imaging radars, and signals intelligence packages in its internal payload bay. The ability to carry stores under the wings means it could end up carrying modular, reconfigurable sensor pods , as well. In June 2016, pictures emerged of one of the drones equipped with the MS-177 multispectral sensor system . Avenger during MS-177 sensor testing. , GA-ASI Despite all of these capabilities, the Avenger had been something of a dark horse in the UCLASS program, a no-frills design with a modest price tag that wasn’t necessarily the best suited to the projected deep-penetrating strike and surveillance missions in high risk environments. But the design and its lower cost could actually make it a prime contender since the Navy has already transformed its requirements for the MQ-25 so dramatically. In March 2017, Rob Weiss, head of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects office, suggested the changes might require all four competitors to completely overhaul their proposals . Avenger might actually require the least work to get it set up for the far less demanding tanking mission. Back in 2014, The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, had already suggested this might happen, explaining : General Atomics’ no-frills approach to the low observable, jet powered, unmanned combat air vehicle may actually help when it comes to the Navy’s looming Unmanned Carrier Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS ) bid. This program is the Navy’s first attempt at integrating an operationally relevant advanced combat drone into its carriers’ air wings. Originally it was expected to require a deep penetrating, high subsonic, bat-winged, state of the art design, but now it seems more like its requirements were written based on the Avenger’s sales brochure, with a greater focus on cost, surveillance, endurance, rudimentary capabilities like acting as an aerial tanker, and reliability, than deep interdiction against an enemy with an advanced air defense network. Thus General Atomics’ “Sea Avenger,” an outgrowth design of the baseline Avenger airframe, which was the dark horse in the contest originally, may be poised to take the prize. Even the Avenger’s physical form is low risk in nature, as it borrows the majority of its design attributes from the highly successful, but thirty five year old, “ Tacit Blue ” design. Yet if the Navy wants something that is by its very design low risk in nature, and more of a sensor and weapon truck than a super-fighter-like autonomous drone, then they have an option that also happens to possess the finest pedigree of any other unmanned systems manufacturer. That is not to say that the USAF, and possibly the CIA, are also not highly interested in the Avenger, which may have been a reason for its fading into the “gray world” over the last few years. Such occurrences often happen once a new technology like this lands a “customer.” Additional customers for the Avenger design could only help drive its cost down even further, making it more attractive to the Navy. The drone has apparently already snagged at least one contract. In his August 2017 press call, GS-ASI’s Alexander said that an unspecified U.S. government agency was flying seven of the unmanned aircraft, though he couldn’t say anything more on the subject. This number of planes is larger than one would expect from a flight test program and would imply there is an operational unit. When the US Air Force tested Avenger as part of its abortive MQ-X project , it acquired just a single example, even though it did send the aircraft to Afghanistan for field tests. https://youtube.com/watch?v=v0dHKWjXn-E This would fit with an earlier statement that a GS-ASI vice president, Donald Cattell, made on Oct. 26, 2016, in which he revealed that an Avenger had performed a psychological warfare leaflet drop over Syria. As such, it seems mostly likely that this operator is either the U.S. military’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) or the CIA , which would fit with earlier reporting. The War Zone has already written in detail about a number of secretive aircraft supporting JSOC and other coalition special operations and intelligence activities against ISIS in both Syria and Iraq . Another possibility is the Missile Defense Agency , although we probably would have heard about such a large acquisition. On top of this U.S. government operator, GS-ASI’s Alexander said a foreign customer, whom he again couldn’t name, was interested in as many as 90 Avengers. The most likely prospective buyer would be the Indian Air Force , which reportedly inquired about purchasing as many as 100 of the aircraft, also known as Predator C, in 2016, according to Reuters . GA-ASI In June 2017, the U.S. State Department already approved the potential sale of more than 20 maritime surveillance drones from GS-ASI to the Indian Navy. These aircraft were a derivative of the Reaper known as the MQ-9B Guardian , which has a Raytheon SeaVue multi-mode radar mounted prominently under the fuselage. Other countries could use a stealthy penetrating multi-role medium altitude, medium endurance drone like the Avenger. In particular Israel comes to mind. The Avenger could allow the IAF to field an asset that can be used for everything long-range surveillance to penetrating strike and electronic warfare missions. It could even be configured as a “loyal wingman” or a communications relay node. Still, we don’t know exactly who might be in active negotiations for the type. Of course, the Navy’s MQ-25 program is still evolving and the requirements could easily change again before any of the competirors have a change to finalize their designs. But a capable, relatively affordable and adaptable existing design, such as Avenger, already in U.S. service and with a potentially strong foreign customer base, could be especially attractive no matter what the service ultimately decides it wants from the Stingrays.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2019",We Now Know What Books and Movies are in the Guantanamo Bay Prison Library,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – almost universally known as “Gitmo” and often abbreviated “GTMO” – is controversial to say the least, prompting continued and heated debates over torture and other legal issues , as well being a lightning rod for general criticism of U.S. counter-terrorism operations around the world . But the camp is also a prison with many of the same banal features of any other such facility, including a library, and thanks to an enterprising individual’s Freedom of Information Act Request, we now know what’s in its somewhat eclectic catalog. In July 2015, a private individual submitted a FOIA request for the “GTMO Inmate Library Catalogue of Books” and the “GTMO Inmate Library Catalogue of Videos/Films.” Nearly two years later, U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the Guantanamo Bay naval base and Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), sent along the more than 600 pages listing all the items in the library’s various catalogs, including duplicates. Government transparency website GovernmentAttic.org posted a copy of these records online in August 2017. “Upon completion of our line-by-line review, we determined this information is currently and properly unclassified and releasable in its entirety,” Marco Villalobos, the SOUTHCOM FOIA manager wrote in his official response letter. This process is protocol, but it’s hard to imagine that anything in the inmate library would’ve ever been classified. The catalogs read like the description of something that’s one part foreign archive, one part second-hand book store, and one part middle school library. To be sure, there are items in a host of different languages, catering to what has been an especially diverse inmate population since Gitmo’s detention facility first opened in 2002. There are books in Arabic, Bahasa, Farsi, French, German, Pashtu, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Turkish, Uigher, and Urdu. A significant number of these are just translation dictionaries or textbooks on how to learn English. Detainees at the Camp Delta detention facility at Guantanamo Bay., DOD There are an equally large number of works of history, folk tales, and other classical and other culturally appropriate texts, including discussions of the tenets of Islam and Sharia law. The library has a number of translated works of western fiction, as well, such as some of the Shakespeare’s plays, Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , Dan Brown’s Davinci Code , and dozens of entries from R.L. Stine’s Goosebumps series. Notably, in addition to having them available in English, inmates can read J.K. Rowling’s famous Harry Potter series in Farsi, French, German, Russian, and Spanish. There are two copies of just the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , in Urdu. This may seem odd, but there is at least one report that detainees took heart in the story of the Prisoner of Azkaban , which focuses on one character’s escape from wrongful imprisonment in the Wizarding World’s secretive jail and its Dementors, effectively soulless demons, who patrol and suck the very happiness out of everything around them. Shaker Aamer, a Saudi citizen who was a legal resident of the United Kingdom at the time of his capture in Afghanistan in 2001, had this to say in an interview with the BBC after his release in 2015: “The closest thing for my mind is [a] Harry Potter story. They got an island in Harry Potter, it says ‘Azkaban,’ where there’s no happiness and they just suck all your feelings out of you, and you don’t have no feelings any more. And truly that’s how I felt all the time. Because that’s what they tried, you know. They want to make you feelingless [sic]. They want to deprive you from everything, anything.” Beyond the foreign language items, there are hundreds of books in English. Again there are a lot of secondary histories and cultural classics, but there is also a wide selection of educational, self-help, and hobby related texts, some of which seem to have been put together haphazardly for a prison. It’s not clear how much use the inmates would ever get out of William Dietz’s Guide to Your Child’s Nutrition , Caroline MacPherson’s Sugar Gliders: A Complete Pet Owner’s Manual , or Cal Orey’s The Healing Powers of Olive Oil . Inmates can read story books and comics intended for young adults and teenagers, too. In addition to the tales of Harry Potter, the library has J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ’ trilogy, a collection of Isaac Asimov’s science fiction writing, The Hunger Games books, and the Twilight series. Just some of the books in the Gitmo prison library., Via GovernmentAttic.org This is perhaps less surprising than it might seem at first. Many of the detainees come from backgrounds with limited education and may have trouble reading in their own native languages, let alone English. It helps explain the large selection of picture books with little or no text that are in the catalog, as well. On top of that, for a time, the U.S. military also infamously detained more than a dozen minors, including Mohamed Jawad who may have been as young as 12 or 13 years old when he first entered Gitmo, housing them in a special detention block known as Camp Iguana . The lists of movies and television shows are similarly diverse, including documentaries and other educational programs in English and other languages and recordings of sporting events, mostly soccer matches, including various World Cup matches from before and after 2002. Detainees have access to a wide range of popular media, too, including relative recent blockbusters like Disney’s Frozen and The Lego Movie . A part of the Gitmo prison library’s video catalog., Via GovernmentAttic.org Not surprisingly there are all the Harry Potter movies. There are utterly forgettable movies intended for children and adults, too, such as Alvin and the Chipmunks , The Smurfs , The Lorax , Paul Blart: Mall Cop , and SWAT . There’s also The Will Smith Music Video Collection and I have no idea what Americans Convert to Islam is. The library has impressively broad selection of American television, old and new, including seasons of Battlestar Galactica , The Cosby Show , Star Trek , and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , which is amusingly written as the “Price of Bel-Air.” There seem to be an oddly large amount of procedural crime dramas, such as Bones , CSI and its spin offs, Law and Order , The Mentalist , and Monk . NCIS seems conspicuously absent for a prison on a naval base. However, in this particular case, there may well be a more complex explanation for this inclusion of these and other programs that depict various elements of the United States, its legal system, and other aspects of its society. It is possible that there is a hope that inmates may come to temper their anger at the U.S. government after watching some of these programs. According to a December 2016 report by PBS , North Korean defectors and other activities in South Korea routinely include American crime dramas in media they smuggle into the reclusive communist regime. “Scenes … from NCIS that show police officers reading suspects their rights are especially useful” in countering North Korea’s anti-American propaganda, defector Kang Chol-hwan explained in an interview for the combined print and television special. We don’t know if allowing inmates to watch The Boondock Saints , The Sopranos , House of Cards , Taken , or The Wire would have the same potential impact. Whether Duck Dynasty or Swamp People is an accurate depiction of real America is up for debate, too. It’s all in the Gitmo prison library though, along with hundreds more entries. There are way too many items for us to list them all here, so feel free to browse the list yourself and let us know what else you find in the comments.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2019",This Is the Tech Special Operators Want for Their Light Attack Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released the first details about the kinds of weapons, sensors, and other gear it is interested in exploring as part of a joint light attack aircraft technology project it is running with U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Though a separate and distinct effort not intended to develop an actual plane, the service had said this Light Attack Support Special Operations (LASSO) program will complement its ongoing light attack experiment, commonly known as OA-X . On Aug. 11, 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Fighters and Bombers Directorate posted the first call for LASSO white papers and other proposals on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website. The announcement defined nine specific areas of interest in three broad categories, weapons, sensors, and mission systems. The Air Force explained that any submissions should be focused on solutions that would work with light attack planes in general, but be “platform-agnostic” and able to readily work with any future aircraft design. The service made it clear that there was no plan as yet to buy any equipment based on the proposals, but it was only interested in hearing from firms “capable of providing the design, development, and demonstration” of the systems in question. “The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities” to special operations forces, the notice said. But while there may not be a formal development program in place, the announcement gives a clear idea of what target sets the Air Force and SOCOM expect a light attack aircraft might be best suited for and what capabilities it would need to perform those missions most effectively. Many of the specific technologies on its wish list could have applications beyond light attack aircraft, as well, being suitable for other special operations aircraft, such as drones and fixed wing gunships . Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine sits in a hangar at Holloman Air Force Base during the OA-X experiments in August 2017., USAF The weapon system category includes four actual munitions requirements, as well as a desire for an advanced targeting system. This latter system should be able to receive real-time information about time-sensitive targets, which could include individual terrorists, as well as other threats, friendly forces, and basic waypoints. Though there’s no specific requirement for the system to be helmet-mounted, this configuration would make it easier for the crew to locate and designate targets, and could even conceivably incorporate an augmented setup akin to the Thales Scorpion , which projects color-coded targets and other information on a helmet-mounted display. Air Force pilots flying F-16 Viper multi-role fighter jets and A-10 Warthog ground attackers, as well as crews on the AC-130W Stinger II gunship , already use this cueing system. Once the crew of the notional light attack aircraft marks their target, the Air Force wants them to be able to rapidly engage them in the most appropriation fashion. The command is interested in bombs and missiles with scalable effects that can attack targets, destroying them in the “first pass,” all while avoiding as much collateral damage as possible. This could be particularly useful when striking terrorists or militants in densely populated urban environments. This section also stipulates a desire to be able to get at targets above and below ground, which would include tunnels , something that has become a particular feature of the fight against ISIS in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan . The Air Force wants to be able to reprogram these weapons in flight, via a secure datalink , in order to improve accuracy and provide additional data to help develop follow-on munitions designs. Though not specifically noted, this would give crews additional control after releasing a bomb or missile, allowing them to better direct it away from innocent civilians if they suddenly enter the target area or fine tune their attack if the target moves. Israel already builds a number of weapons that fit this basic description of a man-in-the-loop precision munition, including the Spike NLOS missile . There is a desire for an air-launched, loitering munition, as well, primarily for taking out so-called “high value targets.” The goal of this particular requirement is to develop a weapon that gives U.S. commanders the most time to positively identify the individual in question while at the same time not giving them any advance notice of an impending strike. European missile consortium MBDA’s now canceled Fire Shadow had boasted a similar stand-off loitering capability. “The munition should provide the time necessary to ensure that all of the criteria are met before engaging a target,” this specific section of the announcement explains. “The weapon should have the capability to loiter for a period of time either directly over the target or at a standoff distance to prevent the weapon or host aircraft from making its presence known in the target area.” Textron’s Scorpion light jet, one of the participants in the Air Force’s light attack experiment., USAF Lastly in the weapon systems category, there is a call for designs for precision guided muntions with stand-off range that do not require GPS to work as intended. The navigation system has become one of, if not the predominant guidance method for aerial bombs, missiles, and guided artillery projectiles within the U.S. military. Unfortunately, as The War Zone has reported in the past , there is an increasing threat to the space-based components of the GPS network, as well as a danger of enemy forces jamming or spoofing the signals on the ground. You can read a more in depth discussion of these potential issues here . To help the crew of any future light attack aircraft locate targets and otherwise conduct surveillance missions, the Air Force and SOCOM are interested in both a sensor pod and equipment that would fuze information from that system, as well as any other on board gear. There are not specific for the types of sensors necessary to produce this “multi-intelligence situational awareness.” However, the notice does say it wants proposals that keep size, weight, and power requirements to an absolute minimum. One specific example given is a desire for the capabilities of a 20-inch aperture electro-optical or infrared system, or an improved setup, which fits into a 15-inch package. A modular design, such as the one the Air Force is already testing , could help provide additional functionality. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5M13DUdZ7QA The sensor fusion setup may include artificial intelligence or other machine learning capabilities in order to automate as much of the targeting process as possible and weed out bad or conflicting information. The Air Force and SOCOM say they are willing to accept submissions for systems that can either provide recommendations or simply make targeting decisions on the available information. The two halves of the final category, mission systems, focus on advanced communications across multiple radio or other networks in the air and on the ground, as well as smaller, lighter, and less power intensive defensive systems, including both warning sensors and defensive countermeasures. These appear to be the most mundane focus areas, with no requirements for automated functioning for either group of equipment or specific mention of advanced developments, such as laser-based communications gear or passive or active directed energy defense systems . Of course, this wouldn’t preclude any potential vendor for submitting a proposal to incorporate these types of systems, provided they were small enough to fit within the constraints of a typical light attack aircraft. Given that the over-arching requirement is for these systems to be “platform-agnostic,” it seems possible, if not plausible, that SOCOM could be interested in integrating any successful technology to come out of the LASSO program onto a variety of aircraft. The command has already been working on standardizing the AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight terrain-following radar across the MH-47 and MH-60 special operations helicopters, CV-22 Osprey tiltrotors, and MC-130 special operations transports . The front of an US Army special operations MH-60 with the Silent Knight radar on the nose., US Army Similarly, SOCOM’s air force component, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has been increasingly buying precision guided munitions, such as the AGM-176 Griffin missile and up-coming GBU-69/B glide bomb , which use common launchers that work with both AC-130s and MQ-9 Reaper drones. That existing universal architecture would be easily adaptable to a future light attack aircraft. The universal nature of these systems might help them get into development and production faster , depending on how the Air Force decides to proceed with its light attack test. It might also mean that any planes the service puts into non-special operations units might get the same systems. As it stands now, there is the potential for two of the four participants in the OA-X trials to advance to a second phase, a combat field test . It’s not clear what will happen afterwards, if and when that experimental deployment occurs. “I can use them in combat, I think, we’ll find out,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein recently told reporters at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, which is hosting the light attack trials. “There is also the possibility that AFSOC may come forward and say they want to employ the airplane.” With LASSO working in parallel, if the Air Force does decide to buy a light attack aircraft, there could be a lot of new tech already ready to go into the new planes.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2019",F-22s Team Up With Combat Rescue Personnel to Practice for Quick Deployments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has already demonstrated the potential value of pairing its fifth generation F-22 Raptors with MC-130 special operations tankers . Now, the service is looking into build on that concept by putting a small package of the stealth fighters together with HC-130 search and rescue aircraft and HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. Earlier in August 2017, personnel and aircraft from the Air Force’s 23rd Wing and 325th Fighter Wing teamed up for the exercise, nicknamed Stealth Guardian , at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. The event evolved from an earlier version of the drill that the 23rd had conducted with other Raptors at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia three months earlier. The 325th “saw an opportunity to integrate rapid raptor with rescue because of the capabilities of the HC-130Js,” according to an Air Force officer from the 23rd Wing’s 347th Rescue Group, who the service identified only as Major Tom. “Refining Rapid Raptor increases the Air Force’s flexibility to provide a strategic and tactical response at a moment’s notice,” an F-22 pilot from the 95th Fighter squadron, a Major Ryan, added. During the exercise, a HC-130J Combat King II from the 347th established a forward arming and refueling point (FARP) for the F-22s, as well as supported the HH-60Gs during simulated rescue missions. Crews identified the need for a new version of at least one part of the Rapid Raptor support package that can fit in any C-130 and the Air Force is already reportedly working on a solution. A member of the 347th Rescue Group refuels an F-22 at a FARP during , USAF Rapid Raptor is an operating concept the Air Force has been working on for some time now . It centers on the ability to quickly deploy at least four F-22s anywhere in the world and have them flying combat missions within 24 hours. The central notion is that with an average of only 125 combat-ready Raptors on hand across the Air Force at any one time, it is simply impossible for the service to have them pre-positioned for all potential crises. In addition, it gives American commanders more options for dispersed operations, which could spread out the advantages of the stealth fighters, as well as other aircraft, across a broader area during an actual crisis, while also protecting those assets from enemy counter attacks. In March 2017, following a similar exercise involving F-22s and MC-130J Commando II special operations aircraft, the War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway succinctly summed up the kind of high-threat environments that likely prompted the Air Force to develop the Rapid Raptor concept in the first place: America’s fighter aircraft are born addicted to tanker gas. As enemy long-range defenses evolve, their limited combat radius is increasingly putting lumbering jet tankers and other support assets in harms way—a reality we have discussed in great detail before . Not just that, but considering that all nearby basing, as far as 1,500 miles away from the enemy’s mainland—and even farther in some cases—is vulnerable to cruise- and especially ballistic missile barrages, the idea that the USAF can just stack hundreds of fighters at their master air bases in a region is a dangerous notion indeed. Instead, during a time of war or of greatly increased tensions, American airpower should be dispersed in smaller numbers throughout a region, occupying austere airstrips on small islands that are not normally considered high-value targets. Distributing air combat power throughout a huge theatre like the Pacific, and just getting tactical aircraft from larger bases thousands of miles away, to the target area and back will be no easy task. The USAF is beginning to come to terms with this and is tapping Air Force Special Operations Command for their expertise in setting up a gas station on the ground pretty much anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. This assessment, especially about the threat environment in the Pacific, has only become more pronounced since then, as tensions between the United States and North Korea have soared. Any conflict on the Korean Peninsula would require significant fifth generation aircraft, such as the F-22 to penetrate North Korea’s dense, if largely antiquated air defense network and initiate any attacks. More worrisome in the long term, China is still expanding its far more extensive anti-access/area denial capabilities further out into the region. Deploying aircraft to dispersed locations quickly is just one part of the equation, too, made easier by extensive existing intelligence databases on possible airfields and landing zones that can support different types of aircraft and U.S. government agreements with allies to rapidly move into established “bare bases” or “ cooperative security locations ,” which have minimal, if any permanent American presence. Sustaining operations from these locations for any appreciable amount of time requires moving in the additional fuel and ordnance required for multiple sorties, as well as the other necessary communications and other gear to establish a functioning fighter jet operation. Just some of the operational airfields the US military has identified for potential use during future operations., USAF via FOIA According to the Air Force, a C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft typically carries the first load of this equipment during a Rapid Raptor deployment. As the service’s primary long-range airlifter, these planes are often in high demand. Training to use the smaller MC-130s and HC-130s could give the Air Force more options, as well as the potential ability to use move a Rapid Raptor package into a general area and then taking advantage of a network of smaller FARP closer to the target area. The use of the HC-130J, which serves as both a transport and tanker for rescue forces, as well as the presence of the HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters, adds another dimension to these operations, as well. Rapid Raptor might be able to send F-22s where ever they might need to go, but it could also easily put pilots beyond the reach of help in the event of an accident over hostile territory or if the enemy does manage to shoot them down. An HC-130J Combat King II from the 347th Rescue Group taxies at Moody Air Force Base during Stealth Guardian in August 2017., USAF We’ve already seen some of what we might see in a combination Rapid Raptor and personnel recovery package in and around Syria. In 2015, the Air Force quietly deployed a personnel recovery task force with HC-130Js and HH-60Gs to a cooperative security location co-located with Turkey’s Diyarbakir Air Base, referred to as Site D. This element, detached from the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing in Kuwait, would rush in if F-22s flying from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, or any other coalition aircraft operating in the area, went down in Syria. With similar Air Force rescue units forward deployed near hot spots around the world, the service might be able to combined Rapid Raptor with these existing forces in the future, too. One of the 95th Fighter Squadron’s F-22s at Stealth Guardian in August 2017., USAF Of course, there are also potential problems with combining decidedly non-stealthy aircraft like the C-130 with low-observable designs like the F-22. This only becomes more obvious when considering the idea of sending HC-130Js and HH-60Gs in to grab a downed Raptor pilot in a high-threat area protected by networked air defenses that an F-22 couldn’t survive in. How exactly combat search and rescue will work with F-35 and F-22 crews that will operate deep in defended territory remains a quiet but controversial topic within defense circles. The War Zone has already highlighted the increasing need for stealthy tankers , and the Air Force has already begun to explore these ideas, as well as low-observable special operations transports and rescue helicopters for operations in denied areas. These would be ideal assets to pair with the Rapid Raptor concept. As the Air Force continues to experiment with combinations of F-22s and C-130s, it may only prompt more interest in an entirely low-observable package. Perhaps in the future, we’ll see small groups of Raptors deploy for training exercises like Stealth Guardian along with similarly stealthy support aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air National Guard has released additional details about what sounds like a harrowing and potentially deadly mishap involving an A-10 Warthog in July 2017. In a testament to the plane’s ruggedness, the pilot was able to make a belly landing after an apparent malfunction with the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger cannon coincided with the rear portion of the canopy completely breaking off in mid-air. On July 20, 2017, Captain Brett DeVries, a pilot with the Michigan Air National Guard’s 107th Fighter Squadron, the “Red Devils,” was taking his A-10 through a second strafing run as part of a routine training mission over the Grayling Air Gunnery Range, part of the state’s Camp Grayling’s Joint Maneuver Training Center. Flying nearby in his own Warthog, Major Shannon Vickers reported seeing a “donut of gas” briefly envelop his wingman’s cockpit. The pilot of the stricken A-10 was now rushing out of the potential path of the other aircraft flying down the range. He was climbing while battling the air rushing around him as the plane flew on at approximately 375 miles an hour. “It was like someone sucker punched me,” DeVries said later. “I was just dazed for a moment.” U.S. Air Force Captain Brett DeVries, right, and Major Shannon Vickers pose in front of an A-10 after the mishap., USAF He climbed up to 2,000 feet to put distance between himself and the range and take stock of the situation. At the same time, he dropped his seat down as low as it would go and tried to take cover behind the front windscreen. “There was paper everywhere,” DeVries explained. “And I was afraid to open up my emergency checklist, because I knew that would just blow away and maybe get sucked in to an engine.” The A-10’s engines are mounted above the fuselage at the rear of the aircraft. It wouldn’t have been hard for something to get sucked out of the cockpit by the slipstream and flying into one of the turbofans, potentially causing a catastrophic failure and adding to an already dangerous situation. Realizing his wingman was in trouble, Vickers had flown up to get a visual on DeVries, and noticed whatever had happened had blown open a number of access panels under the other aircraft’s nose. This immediately indicated there had been some sort of malfunction with the A-10’s Avenger cannon. Here is a video of a A-10s training with other U.S. military personnel at the Grayling Air Gunnery Range in 2012: The Warthog’s GAU-8 cannon is a beast in its own right, weighing 700 by itself, not including its ammunition drum, feeding system, and the two hydraulic motors that power everything. The whole system famously dwarfs a Volkswagen Beetle. Fairchild Republic designed the A-10 to accommodate the weapon, not the other way around. As The War Zone explained in detail just recently , getting the gun to work with the aircraft attached to it was a complicated technical feat in of itself. Even today, whenever an A-10 pilot shoots the gun, it spews out a cloud of potentially dangerous gas and violently shakes the entire airframe. USAF We don’t know what happened to DeVries aircraft specifically and the Air Force is still investigating the accident. It’s not clear why the canopy broke away, either. When a Warthog pilot uses the ejection seat, it does detach first. So, it is entirely possible that whatever happened to the cannon caused a reaction so violent that triggered this mechanism or shook it loose. Whatever the case, DeVries and Vickers were more interested in figuring out how to get everyone safely back on the ground. Vickers began his career as an enlisted airman, working with A-10s on the ground, before becoming an officer and a pilot, so he tried to help troubleshoot the situation. Since the canopy had failed, both men were concerned the ejection seat might be compromised in some way. If it didn’t work properly, it could be as much of a liability as a life saver, potentially getting stuck halfway out of the cockpit and trapping DeVries in a plane he no longer had any control over. The mishap had apparently broken the A-10’s two primary radios, leaving DeVries to communicate via a third emergency system. Less than 100 miles away, personnel at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, which shares a runway with Alpena County Airport, ran an ad hoc switchboard between the pilots and maintenance specialists at Selfridge Air National Guard Base further south. The individuals in Alpena’s control tower put the maintainers on speakerphone, placing it next to a radio so they could talk directly to Vickers when possible. Vickers would then relay the information to DeVries. USAF DeVries eventually elected to try and fly to Alpena and make an emergency landing on the runway there, abandoning the idea of trying to eject over an unpopulated area. Then another problem came up, the nose landing gear, which sits right next to the gun, wouldn’t come down all the way and lock safely into place. The Air Force captain retracted the two main wheels and prepared for a belly landing, still battling with the open cockpit. Coming in flat and slow, DeVries made about as smooth a landing as anyone could hope and walked away from the crash unscathed. “I just thought, ‘There is no way this is happening right now,’” Vickers recalled about talking his wingman down onto the runway as he flew closeby. “It all was sort of surreal, but at the same time, we were 100 percent focused on the task ahead of us.” After watching to make sure DeVries had exited safely, Vickers returned to Selfridge without incident. “And I am thinking, did this just happen? That was the longest flight ever back, to Selfridge,” he said. USAF The plane remained intact, though that’s not particularly surprising given the Warthog’s hardy design. In the past, A-10s have survived significant damage to their wings, tails, fuselage, and engine pods, and still made it back to base. In 2015, one of the blunt-nosed attackers made an emergency landing in Iraq after one of its engines suffered a catastrophic failure. With help from a U.S. Marine Corps contingent on the ground, Air Force personnel had the aircraft back in the air with an all-new engine in just five days. The Michigan Air National Guard says that DeVries Warthog is in good enough condition that there are similar plans to repair it at Alpena and put it right back into service. In the meantime, U.S. Air Force Brigadier General John Slocum, commander of the 127th Wing, the 107th’s parent unit, says he will submit recommendations that both DeVries and Vickers receive “appropriate recognition” for the actions during the mishap. “To this day, I really haven’t second guessed anything,” DeVries explained. “In that moment, your training kicks in. The training – that’s what saves you and your wingman.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2019",India Wants To Breathe Extra Life Into Its Old Jaguar Jets By Adding New Radars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India says it has successfully test flown a modified Jaguar multi-role aircraft with a foreign-made active electronically-scanned array (AESA) type radar. Depending on how extensive this upgrade program becomes, it could be a significant boon for the Indian Air Force, which has struggled with modernizing its diverse fleets of fighter and multi-role jets. T. Suvarna Raju, chairman of the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics, Limited (HAL), made the announcement on Aug. 11, 2017, according to a report by The Hindu . HAL would not say what radar it used, but it is reportedly the Israeli Elta ELM-2052 , which that company reportedly agreed to supply in 2015 for both the Jaguar and Indian-designed Tejas fighter jet. HAL said the new radar alone could give the nearly 40-year old Jaguars, which it built under license from the Anglo-French consortium SEPECAT, at least another decade of service at life. “An Indian fighter flying with an AESA radar is in itself a landmark,” Raju told The Hindu . No other Indian multi-role jets, including the country’s Russian-made Mig-29K Fulcrum and license-built Su-30MKI Flanker fighter jets, as well as the Tejas Mk 1 prototypes, have a fast-scanning AESA in the nose. According to Elta , the ELM-2052 has air-to-air, air-to-ground, and air-to-sea modes, which can track multiple targets at once and provide moving target indication and mapping functionality. An Indian Air Force Jaguar IM., HAL Adding an AESA radar to the Jaguars makes good sense and would give pilots the ability to detect more targets at greater ranges and with better fidelity, as well as being better able to resist jamming. Many air forces, including the U.S. Air Force see the new units as a relatively simple way to squeeze more capability of older jets in general .  Perhaps the biggest limiting factor is finding a radar that will fit within the pre-existing radar space on any particular aircraft, but some modern AESA designs, like the ELM-2052, are modular in nature and get substantial capability out of a small radar aperture size. Elta boasts that it can size the ELM-2052’s antenna to fit where ever it needs to go, including in the tight confines of the Jaguar’s nose radome. The Indian radar installation also shows important progress on the broader and long-running Display Attack Ranging Inertial Navigation III (DARIN III) upgrade program for the Jaguars, which began in 2009. The Indian Air Force had launched the first DARIN modernization project in the 1990s followed by a second round of upgrades in the early 2000s. The first DARIN III prototypes didn’t fly until 2012 and reportedly “could not meet expectations,” according to India Today . At that time, HAL wasn’t expected to complete the improvements on an estimated 50 to 60 of India’s approximately 120 Jaguars until 2019. The Indian Air Force said the first two-seat Jaguar IB trainers with the DARIN III modifications had reached initial operational capability in November 2016. It’s is not clear how many of the Jaguars will ultimately receive the AESA radar update, either. India’s 18 Jaguar IM versions, optimized for maritime strike missions carrying Sea Eagle and Harpoon anti-ship missiles , have a traditional profile nose cone, but the IS multi-role variant has a narrower chiseled front end housing a combination laser range finder and  target designator. HAL could have to develop an entirely new nose section to fit the ELM-2052 onto the IS aircraft, which make up the bulk of India’s Jaguar fleet and the majority of the aircraft slated for the DARIN III upgrade package. This is where Elta’s scalable design could really shine. We also don’t know what, if any, of the DARIN upgrades will apply to the dozens of second-hand Jaguars India is looking to acquire from France. The French Air Force operated A and E variants that have a similar nose profile to the IM and could more readily accept the AESA installation. All government officials would say is that “India is actively considering acquiring them after proper refurbishment,” according to Defense News . It is also very possible the 30 or so French jets that are supposedly being eyed could end up being used as spares for India’s upgraded Jaguar fleet. The chisel-nose Jaguar IS., USAF Even if it feasible, though, such a significant modification would slow down the DARIN III project even more and increase its overall cost. The Indian Air Force, which originally hoped to have the upgraded Jaguars start to enter service by December 2012, can little afford to drag the project out longer than it has already. Unfortunately, the DARIN III saga, as well as a separate and equally sluggish push to replace the Jaguars’ engines, seems reflective of the Indian Air Force’s modernization efforts. In January 2017, the country’s Minister of Defense, Manohar Parrikar, announced plans to sign a deal to license produce up to 200 single-engine fighter jets by 2021 at an estimated cost of approximately $45 million apiece. The two major contenders for this tender are Lockheed Martin and its F-16 Block 70 and Saab and its Gripen E . In June 2017, Lockheed Martin separately announced plans to shift a significant portion of its F-16 production line to India, which many observers saw as giving the company an advantage in the domestic fighter competition. Saab has also offered a significant amount of technology transfer to go along with any purchase of Gripen aircraft. But when and even if the Indian Air Force will ultimately receive any new fighter jets is unclear. The reason the country is looking for 200 new aircraft in the first place is because it scaled back purchases of the Dassault Rafale multi-role combat aircraft, which had won an earlier competition in 2012 worth approximately $20 billion, amid accusations of graft . The original plan was to purchase 136 of the French-made fighter jets, but now the Indian Air Force is only slated to get 36 . A French Navy Rafale M multi-role fighter jet., USAF Another factor is the poor performance so far of HAL’s domestically-designed Tejas fighter jet, which first flew in 2001. The Indian Air Force expects to receive the first Tejas Mk 1A aircraft, which will also feature the ELM-2052 AESA radar among other features, by 2020 at the earliest. However, in January 2017, the Indian Navy rejected the navalized Tejas variant, complaining that it is too heavy to operate effectively from the country’s sole aircraft carrier , INS Vikramaditya , as well as the Vikrant -class replacements now under construction. Both Vikramaditya and the Vikrant -class use ski jumps to launch aircraft and the Tejas can’t meet the “thrust-to-weight requirement to take off with a full fuel and arms load,” Indian Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said, according to The Times of India . There’s also a reasonable question of where the money for all of these procurements will come from. In addition to upgrading a significant portion of the Jaguar fleet, the Indian Air Force has been modernizing its Dassault Mirage 2000 at a cost of $43 million per aircraft and needs to replace hundreds of MiG-21s and MiG-27s that are simply becoming too old to fly safely . As of November 2016, the Indian Air Force had only committed to buy approximately 120 Tejas, worth approximately $12 billion, to replace more than 300 of the Soviet-era MiGs. The HAL Tejas., Venkat Mangudi via Wikimedia At the same time, India’s top regional competitor, China, is working on multiple fifth generation stealthy fighter designs , advanced unmanned combat air vehicles , and other new aircraft, to say nothing of its networked air defenses . India has been less than pleased with the result of its cooperation with Russia on the fifth generation PAK-FA fighter jet.  This increasing gap between the two countries’ air arms is more pounced given that they have been engaged in a protracted standoff over a disputed border in the mountainous Sikkim region since June 2017, which observers worry could lead to a more significant conflict. India’s Air Force also has to contend with its Pakistani counterpart, which, though far smaller and less advanced than China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force, has been looking to improve its own capabilities in recent years. Most notably, Pakistan and China had been working together on updating the JF-17 Thunder light multi-role combat aircraft, which first entered Pakistani service in 2008. These upgrades could include an AESA radar and the Block 3 aircraft may be ready for as early as 2019 . There are also reports that Pakistan is interested in buying the Chinese J-31 stealth fighter . Given these regional developments, the DARIN III upgrades, including the AESA radar, are essential for keeping the Jaguars combat capable, even if only as a second-tier multi-role aircraft. Additional upgrades, including improved, Israeli-made podded self-defense jammers could also add more capability to the aircraft. Regardless, given the difficulties India faces in modernizing its Air Force, it’s likely that it will continue to operate the Jaguars, with or without the full suite of upgrades, for the foreseeable future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2019",Lebanon Gets Bradley Fighting Vehicles as it Continues to Battle ISIS,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lebanon has taken delivery of their first M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles from the United States. This is a significant boost for the country’s armed forces who are engaged in a complex and largely forgotten front in the fight against ISIS and reflects otherwise expanding American military involvement in the country. On Aug. 14, 2017, eight M2A2s rolled off a commercial merchant ship onto a pier at the Port of Beirut in the Lebanese capital. The armored vehicles are part of a total order of 32 Bradleys valued at more than $100 million. The M2A2s “will provide the Lebanese Armed Forces with new capabilities to protect Lebanon, to protect its borders, and to fight terrorists,” U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard said at a ceremony to mark the transfer. “Over the next several months, the [Lebanese] Army will undergo intensive training on how to operate and maintain this new, very sophisticated combat system.” The first A2 Bradleys entered U.S. Army service in 1988, but received significant modifications after the Desert Storm in 1991. The subsequent Operation Desert Storm, or ODS, subvariants received an eye-safe laser range finder, GPS-navigation system, an infrared imaging system for the vehicle’s driver, a computerized battle management system, and other upgrades. A Lebanese soldier takes a pictures of another sitting on top of one of the new Bradleys, AP Though hardly new, the vehicles are significantly more capable than the Cold War-era M113A2 and A3 armored personnel carriers that make up the bulk of the Lebanese Armed Forces’ existing armored units. These vehicles are lightly armored and have a single .50 caliber machine gun as their main armament in an open-topped turret. Lebanon has modified some to carry the Soviet-era ZPU-23 23mm anti-aircraft gun, which is deadly against lightly protected ground targets, as well as TOW missiles. Comparatively, the Bradley offers better armor protection against both small arms and light anti-tank weapons and protects the gunner inside a full-enclosed turret. The M2A2’s main armament is a 25mm chain gun, supplemented by a co-axial machine gun and two-tube TOW missile launcher. Perhaps more importantly, the infantry fighting vehicles have electro-optical and thermal imaging sensors. This means the vehicles will be able to help monitor Lebanon’s tense border with Syria and provide accurate more fire support for friendly troops at night. These latter abilities are important as Lebanon has been fighting a low-intensity conflict along its sparely populated boundary with Syria since June 2014, when a force of ISIS and the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front fighters briefly took control of the border town of Arsal . These clashes expanded as the Syrian civil war spilled over more into Lebanese territory. Lebanese troops move toward Arsal in 2014., AP But the conflict quickly became multi-sided and complex as ISIS and Al Nusra ended all attempts at cooperation in 2015 and began fighting each other, as well as other terrorist groups and government security forces in both Lebanon and Syria. In January 2017, Al Nusra merged with four other groups to form a new entity called Tahrir al-Sham, officially breaking off its allegiance with Al Qaeda in the process. Various actors in the region dispute whether the organization has really severed ties with the global Al Qeada entity. At present, the Lebanese armed forces continue to fight ISIS, Tahrir al-Sham, and other militant groups along the border. In July 2017, Lebanon launched its latest offensive into the Qalamoun Mountains , aimed at ISIS and Tahrir al-Sham. Depending on how long this campaign lasts and the speed with which Lebanese troops learn to use their new vehicles, it is possible that the Bradleys could see their first combat against ISIS or Al Qaeda-linked militants, though the heavy armored vehicles are not particularly well suited to the mountainous terrain. Regardless, the vehicles will provide the country’s armed forces with extra firepower in a mobile, protected package for future conflicts and crises. A Lebanese soldier mans a machine gun on top of a tank near Arsal in 2016., AP This delivery, which also included M992 armored ammunition carriers to go along with Lebanon’s M109 self-propelled 155mm howitzers, is the latest example of a long-standing relationship between the country and the United States that dates back to the Cold War. However, the U.S. military has had an especially active relationship with its Lebanese counterparts since 2007, when it rushed military equipment to the country and deployed a small number of special operators in response to an outbreak of fighting with the Palestinian militant group Fatah al-Islam. Since then, the Pentagon has facilitated the delivery of a significant amount of military hardware, including small arms, 155mm howitzers, and Cessna AC-208 light attack planes. U.S. Special Operations Command Central has also maintained a small forward headquarters to continue training and advising Lebanese special operations units. More recently, the U.S. Air Force began training Lebanese pilots how to fly their forthcoming A-29 Super Tucano light attackers at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. Like the Super Tucanos, the Bradleys reflect an increasing willingness on the part of the United States to provide Lebanon more advanced weaponry to help it combat various regional threats. President Donald Trump and his administration have stepped up counter-terrorism efforts across the Middle East and North Africa and this support for the Lebanese military seems likely to continue and possibly expand in the near future. The United States has already sent a new contingent of special operators to advise and assist Lebanese troops fighting ISIS, though there are no reports of American artillery arriving in the country to support the border campaign as there has been in both Iraq and Syria . Unfortunately, as we have already seen in Iraq and Syria , the fight against ISIS is messily intertwined with a number of other conflicts and competing agendas in the region. The situation in Lebanon is no different. “Lebanon is on the front lines in the fight against ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Hizballah,” Trump told Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri during a joint press conference in the White House’s Rose Garden on July 25, 2017. “Hizballah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people, and the entire region.” Given that many believe Hizballah assassinated his father, Rafic, in 2005, Hariri would probably not be inclined to disagree, but there’s still one glaring problem with this statement. The organization, which receives support from Iran for its parallel armed forces and which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, is part of Lebanon’s democratically-elected government and commands the support of a significant portion of the population. The situation has only become more complicated considering the group’s fighters are active participants in Syria’s civil conflict, fighting on behalf of the country’s brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad and working alongside Iran and Iranian-backed militia groups. Despite operating in the same area, Lebanese military officials insist that they are not coordinating their Qalamoun offensive with either the Syrian Arab Army or Hizballah. It’s also worth noting that the “ de-escalation zones ” that Russia, Iran, and Turkey have tried to establish do not cover the border between Syria and Lebanon and it did not appear to be a consideration in a reported US-Russia brokered ceasefire arrangement . A Hizbollah fighter mans a watchtower armed with an anti-tank missile along the Lebanon-Syria border., AP But not everyone appears entirely convinced that there is no connection between the two parties. Hizbollah’s intervention in Syria, as well as the Lebanese government’s apparent unwillingness or inability to stop them from doing so, prompted Saudi Arabia to cut off a $3 billion military aid plan in February 2016. The Saudis see both the Syria Regime and Hizballah as part of the so-called “ Shia Crescent ” and extensions of Iran, their major regional competitor. All of this potentially puts American forces in the country in their own complex position, as the Trump administration is determined to try and check Iran’s influence, including through proxies like Hizbollah, throughout the region, but also fight ISIS and other terrorists. The United States has already had to deal with a similar situation in Northern Syria, playing peacemaker between Turkey and Kurdish groups, both of who are ostensible allies of the U.S. military-led anti-ISIS coalition in the country. “The United States military has been proud to help in that fight [against terrorism in Lebanon] and will continue to do so,” Trump said to Hariri in July. “America’s assistance can help ensure that the Lebanese army is the only defender Lebanon needs. It’s a very effective fighting force.” Right now, however, American troops and their Lebanese partners and U.S.-supplied equipment, such as the new Bradleys, are in the middle of a tense, multi-sided conflict.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 29, 2019",Northrop Grumman MQ-25 Drone Tanker Testbed Emerges At Plant 42 In California,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The four competitors vying to build the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray drone have, so far, not released any official pictures of a mockup or prototype design, as well as very little in the way of concept art. Now, pictures Aviation Week obtained from an anonymous source appear to show Northrop Grumman is using its X-47B demonstrator at least as a testbed for its submission. On Aug. 12, 2017, Aviation Week posted one of an apparent series of images of an X-47B at the U.S. Air Force’s Plant 42 flight test facility situated next to Palmdale Regional Airport in California. The unmanned aircraft appears to have a drop tank under one wing and an air refueling or “buddy” store under the other, which contains a probe-and-drogue aerial refueling system. Major defense contractors use Plant 42 for a variety of advanced flight test and production tasks for not just the Air Force, but other services, as well. Three of the four companies working on the MQ-25 – Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman – have facilities within the site. The Fourth, General Atomics, has been known to use other secretive facilities nearby. Between 2011 and 2015, the U.S. Navy extensively tested the two stealthy X-47Bs as part of a program aimed at exploring the potential of a carrier-launched unmanned combat aerial vehicle , known as the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator (UCAS-D). The service initially expected this would provide a starting point for the now cancelled Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program, which would have led to a final combat-ready design. The War Zone has already written in depth about how service subsequently shifted its requirements away from a drone capable of striking or gathering intelligence about targets in high-threat environments to a pilotless flying gas station, which you can read more about here , here , and here . According to a report by USNI News in July 2017, the Navy has now shifted its focus for the present follow-on Stingray program, also known as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), almost entirely onto aerial refueling. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B drone., USN So, the configuration visible in the pictures would fit perfectly with the Navy’s latest vision for the tanking-focused MQ-25, which requires the use of the service’s existing Cobham air refueling pods . Beyond that, contractors reportedly have significant freedom in their designs. “We are saying that you do have to use the existing aerial refueling store that F/A-18s [and] S-3s have used – and that’s externally carried – and that’s to reduce development, cost and timeline and risk,” U.S. Navy Captain Beau Duarte, the MQ-25 program manager, told USNI News in July 2017. “But how you configure the air vehicle to deliver that fuel is up to industry.” Lockheed Martin’s MQ-25 existing concept art, which essentially just shows Cohbam’s Air Refueling Store., Lockheed Martin However, we don’t know whether Northrop Grumman intends to morph the X-47B into an aerial refueler or is simply using the aircraft to test out the necessary technologies for this mission. The firm transported the two demonstrators from Patuxent River to its facility at Plant 42 earlier in 2017, saying they intended to use them for further test purposes. The probe-and-drogue system uses a length of hose attached to receptacle “basket.” The other aircraft plugs a refueling probe into the basket to receive fuel. The basket can sometimes move erratically around in the air depending on environmental conditions. The X-47B already holds the honor of being the first unmanned aircraft, at least officially , to successfully take on gas from a manned tanker using this method, but systems to help in automated aerial refueling, including stabilized drogues , have been in development for many years. It would make sense that Northrop Grumman would use this advanced experimental plane at least to help develop the software and hardware necessary for a functioning drone tanker. It’s not clear, however, whether the X-47B in its present guise or a derivative thereof could truly fulfill the Navy’s mission tanking requirements. As of 2016, the Navy’s definition of the mission tanking requirement was the ability to provide nearly 1,500 gallons of jet fuel “after reaching an optimum tanking profile,” which it did not define in a notional mission description the author previously obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The U.S. Air Force’s KC-135 and KC-10 tankers provide the bulk of the mission tanking across the U.S. military at present, a mission profile that can involve tankers operating in orbits relatively close to target areas. The Cobham pod itself has a 300 gallon capacity, meaning that the drone would have to carry at least another 1,200 gallons, internally or in drop tanks, of extra fuel. When the X-47B performed its own full aerial refueling test , it took almost 600 gallons of fuel, but we don’t know whether this was the maximum capacity of its internal tanks. Additional under-wing tanks, like the one seen on the aircraft at Plant 42, could possibly limit the unmanned aircraft’s performance, requiring it to carry still more fuel in order to adequately perform its mission depending on the exact mission profile. According to the Navy, the X-47B had at least 4,500 pounds of internal payload space , which Northrop Grumman could potentially fill with additional fuel tanks. USN But whether or not converting the stealthy drone to a tanker is feasible, it still might not be cost effective. Lockheed Martin already speculated in March 2017 that all four firms taking part in the MQ-25 would likely need to completely overhaul their designs, previously all advanced low-observable aircraft with features focused on penetrating through networked air defenses. But there are a variety of issues at play, as I wrote in July 2017 : If the Navy did decide it needed a deep strike unmanned combat air vehicle in the future, an aircraft that may ultimately become essential for operations in heavily defended areas, these new pilotless aircraft could be wholly unsuitable for the task. Whether they could perform the kind of secondary reconnaissance mission the Navy had originally envisioned is debatable with this new primary focus on longer range aerial refueling. A modular design that could accept additional mission equipment would [not] necessarily be a substitute for a purpose-built low observable design. Of course, there is always the possibility one or more of the four contractors could put forward a stealthy tanker design. There is growing evidence that aerial refuelers, manned or unmanned, are increasingly vulnerable in high threat environments in general. In May 2017, a Russian fighter jet intercepted and then did a barrel roll atop an Air Force KC-10 flying over Syria, underscoring this potential danger. But unless all of the competitors decide to go this route, anyone who does might be stuck making an offer that is significantly more expensive and less attractive as a result. In summation, Northrop Grumman could be using the X-47B as a test vehicle for a final, stealthy tanker design that could be more readily adapted to intelligence or strike missions, if necessary. However, this seems unlikely given how far removed that type of aircraft would be from the Navy’s known and far less ambitious CBARS requirements, and how much it will likely cost. It also could be that Northrop Grumman intends to use the same basic platform as the X-47B, albeit simplified and without the need for apertures for sensors or weapons bays. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the X-47B could be used as a surrogate for the subsystems of an entirely new Northrop Grumman C-BARS design. This would lower developmental risk and when added to all the other data the X-47B program has accumulated over the years, it could make even a new airframe design quite mature—at least in terms of what lies beneath its skin—and thus more competitive.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",American Diplomats In Cuba Have Fallen Ill From Mysterious Sonic Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An odd diplomatic spat has erupted between the United States and Cuba in response to a series of bizarre incidents where members of the American diplomatic staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana were reportedly subjected to sonic attacks .  More mysteriously, neither the U.S. government nor their Cuban counterparts say, on or off the record, that they know who is responsible, how the auditory assault was launched specifically, or most importantly why it was executed in the first place. On Aug. 9, 2017, U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert confirmed that the United States had kicked out two Cuban diplomatic staff members in retaliation for the apparent attacks more than two months earlier. She refused to describe the incidents in any details, saying only that they had “caused a variety of physical symptoms.” “We don’t have any definitive answers about the source or the cause of what we consider to be incidents,” Nauert added. “We’re taking that situation seriously and it’s under investigation right now.” According to a report by The Associated Press , citing multiple unnamed sources, the sonic barrage began in late 2016 and an initial investigation subsequently determined an “advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound” pointed a diplomatic residences was most likely the source of the issue. Five members of the American diplomatic staff in Cuba reportedly suffered various symptoms as a result. US Marines raise the American flag during the ceremony marking the re-opening of the US Embassy in Cuba in 2015., AP The harassment was so severe that some of them suffered “severe” hearing loss, in one case causing apparently permanent damage requiring the individual to use a hearing aid. Some even canceled their tours of duty early and returned to the United States. “We have provided medical care and medical treatment and screening to our Americans who have asked for that,” Nauert said during another daily press briefing on Aug. 10, 2017, again declining to provide additional details about the attacks or symptoms. “We don’t have all the answers yet.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service were conducting the American investigation. Its unclear how long they’ve been looking into the issue. “You have that ailment; you maybe decide to put it off for a while, get medical treatment, maybe not. Okay?” Nauert added. “Some of these things take time to investigate, in particular ones that are – people aren’t certain what has caused them.” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert gives her daily briefing on Aug. 9, 2017., AP Cuban authorities had issued their own statement on Aug. 9, saying the U.S. government had made them aware of the issue in February 2017 and that they were looking into the matter themselves. After learning about the incidents, Cuba stepped up its own security presence around the U.S. Embassy, but, insisting it was not behind the attacks, said the United States’ decision to retaliate by expelling its diplomats was “unjustified and baseless.” The State Department’s position was that the Cuban government still bore responsibility for guaranteeing the basic safety of foreign, accredited diplomatic staff per the Vienna Convention. “Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception,” the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared, suggesting its position was that the attack was the work of a third party. As such, there would be an “exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government.” Then, on Aug. 10, 2017, Brianne Maxwell, a Canadian government spokeswoman for global affairs, told The Associated Press that members of Canada’s diplomatic staff in Cuba had suffered their own “unusual symptoms,” though she too declined to offer additional information about the ailments. Maxwell said Canadian authorities were working with their American and Cuban counterparts to investigate the incidents. The same day, additional unnamed sources told CNN that the attacks had stopped for the time being. But, on and off the record, no one would or could say with any certainty what had actually been going on. The US Embassy in Havana, Cuba., AP Now, while we don’t know for sure what happened, the basic idea of a sonic attack is hardly out of the realm of possibility. For more than a decade , military, police, and private security forces have employed so-called “ acoustic hailing devices ” to broadcast alerts and warning sounds over long distances or disperse crowds with painful or disorienting noise. Various companies build these systems, with the most well known being LRAD Corporation’s Long Range Acoustic Device . There are also been readily available commercial “ audio spotlights ” that can focus sound waves on very specific points. This technology uses “ ultrasound ” frequencies that are inaudible to the human ear. So, it’s not hard to imagine a smaller and more efficient variation on these systems, or some other advanced derivative based on similar principles, tuned to emit sound waves either above or below the normal range of what a human being can hear. Given that device caused someone to go nearly deaf, but have an apparently limited area of effect, it seems probably that we’re looking at an exotic weapon we’ve never seen before in action. The bigger question then is who was responsible and why they apparently targeted American and Canadian diplomats specifically. One source told CNN that American investigators were looking into the possibility that a third party was looking “drive a wedge between the U.S. and Cuba” in retaliation for some other American policy or activity, suggesting that U.S. officials were at least willing to entertain the possibility Cuban authorities were not involved. The Russians would be the most obvious actor in this case. After decades of strained relations, the United States formally reestablished diplomatic ties with Cuba on July 20, 2015, and subsequently re-opened an Embassy in Havana that year. Russia, one of Cuba’s most important political and economic partners, could have perceived this as a threat to its own relationship with the country and its ability to continue operating strategic military and intelligence facilities there, including a Soviet-era signals intelligence outpost that restarted operations in 2014. It’s unclear then, why any such attackers would target the Canadians, who have had uninterrupted relations with Cuba since 1945, as well. Canada did help negotiate the reopening of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, though, and attacking their diplomats could simply have been to mask the true nature of the operation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, right, walks with Cuban President Raul Castro during a visit to Havana in 2016., AP On top of that, another anonymous individual rightly pointed out to CNN that it would be extremely difficult for foreign agents to operate without at least the tacit consent of the Cuban government given the country’s robust police state. Cuba is notorious for heavily monitoring any and all activities within its borders in order to silence dissent against its Communist regime. “Specialized units of the ministry’s state security branch are responsible for monitoring, infiltrating, and suppressing independent political activity,” the State Department wrote in the chapter on Cuba in its 2016 report on the state of human rights around the world. “The police supported state security agents by carrying out house searches, arresting persons of interest to the ministry, and providing interrogation facilities.” So, there is another possibility that, depending on when the attacks began in 2016, Cuban authorities could have launched the attacks themselves in response to Donald Trump’s election victory. On the campaign trail, Trump had threatened to cut diplomatic ties again or at least reinstate various economic restrictions. US President Donald Trump gives his speech on relations with Cuba in Miami’s Little Havana District in June 2016., AP “Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,” Trump told a crowd in Miami, Florida’s Little Havana district, in June 2017. Despite those comments, the policy changes will take time to fully implement. But if the Cuban government were responsible directly and in response to Trump, it begs the question of why the attacks stopped even before he made his policy pronouncements months later. Since this capability is likely relatively new, this could just be first we’re seeing of it. Whatever is going on in Cuba, the U.S. government has made it clear that it believes the situation is too serious to dismiss as some odd confluence of benign factors. Hopefully, American officials will release more detailed information once they wrap up their investigations. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 15, 2020",US Army Wants Its Future Automatic Rifle to Adapt to Other Roles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of a slew of new small arms developments , the U.S. Army wants contractors to submit designs for a possible replacement for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) called the Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle (NGSAR). Now, the service has confirmed what it really wants, if possible, is a universal system that can replace a variety of different guns , an ambitious idea that has failed to produce results in the past. On May 31, 2017, the Army posted a special notice on FedBizOpps, the federal government’s main contracting website, announcing plans to hold classified meetings with defense contractors about the NGSAR and solicit proposed designs for the gun. At one of those gatherings, someone asked whether the final weapon would only end up replacing the M249 or if it might end up taking up other roles. The Army posted its answer online , along with responses to other questions from industry representatives, on Aug. 10, 2017. “The Government has a decision point in [Fiscal Year 2019] to determine if the NGSAR will be able to fulfill additional roles such as that of the squad designated marksman, medium machine gun, and the carbine,” it explained. This means, the final gun, or specific versions thereof, could ultimately supplant the standard M4 carbine , precision rifles like the M110 or its own near-term replacements, and even some members of the M240 general purpose machine gun family, including the lightweight M240L. US Army This is a significant change from basic description in the original announcement, which only made reference to replacing the M249. At present, there are two of the belt-fed SAWs in each of the Army’s infantry squads, which allow them to lay down a high volume of fire in both offensive and defensive operations. In its initial posting, the Army said it wanted the notional NGSAR to be able to hit and kill stationary targets or suppress moving targets at ranges of at least nearly 1,970 feet and possibly more than 3,900 feet. The specific accuracy requirements were classified. The proposed guns couldn’t be any more than 12 pounds, unloaded, with a desired weight, if possible, of approximately 8 pounds. With a full-length barrel and standard fixed buttstock, the M249 weighs in at approximately 17 pounds. The Army has already issued shorter barrels and lighter stocks to help lighten the gun. Submitted designs had to be 38 inches long, or less, and feature a folding buttstock that would shorten the gun down to at least 35 inches. There was a goal of eventually getting those dimensions down to 35 inches long overall and 32 inches with the stock stowed away. The full-sized M249 is nearly 41 inches from end to end. https://youtube.com/watch?v=kPzmhryoQ-8 Most notably, the Army’s main ammunition requirement was that the load be at least 20 percent and possibly up to 50 percent lighter than the “tactical brass equivalent” of whatever caliber the submission was set up for. “Note the NGSAR ammunition could be a caliber not currently in use by the U.S. Army,” the notice said. This opened up the possibility that the weapon could use a so-called “ intermediate round ,” generally understood to have characteristics that fall somewhere in between those of the 5.56x45mm cartridge that the M249 uses and larger rounds, such as the 7.62x51mm. When the NGSAR announcement came out, the Army was already in the process of developing just such a projectile as part of a separate project to find a replacement for the M4, which is also chambered for the 5.56x45mm cartridge. Beyond that, the new squad automatic rifle would need a sound suppressor and the ability to accept a host of standard Army accessories, such as optical sights and laser aiming devices. The service stipulated a variety of basic cost and reliability parameters, as well. US Army Though the service made clear it was still in the process of gathering information and had no formal plans to buy any weapons as yet, it said it wanted to begin phasing out the M249s in infantry units sometime in the 2020s. This was apparently a stepped up time frame from the initial development plan. According to Military.com , the Army originally categorized the NGSAR as a “mid-term goal,” which would enter service sometime between 2026 and 2035. “That may be accelerated into the near term as we plan on fielding that first unit equipped in by 2025,” U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Loyd Beal III, the Product Manager for Crew Served Weapons, told the outlet in May 2017 before the release of the NGSAR notice. But there were already hints in the original announcement that the proposed gun might be more than just an M249 substitute, which may have been what provoked the contractor’s question in the first place. The NGSAR “will combine the firepower and range of a machine gun with the precision and ergonomics of a carbine, yielding capability improvements in accuracy, range, and lethality,” the notice on FedBizOpps read. The idea of using one gun for a variety of functions makes perfect sense, at least in theory. Having soldiers using the same weapons and ammunition reduces maintenance, logistics, and training requirements. A single family of carbines, automatic rifles, and machine guns that share a significant number of common parts would have similar benefits. US Army But this has proved to be an overly ambition goal in the past. During the development of what became the M60 light machine gun in the 1950, the Army’s plan was to craft a weapon to replace squad’s existing automatic rifles, aging submachine guns, and a host of World War II-era light and medium machine guns. This didn’t work out and the gun served alongside a variety of weapons in infantry units well into the 1980s. The Army similarly thought that it could use the original M16A1 as both an infantry rifle and squad automatic rifle. Individuals designated for the latter role received a clip-on bipod. The volume of fire from a 5.56mm rifle with a 20 round magazine turned out to be less than impressive. The M249 itself was, in many ways, an attempt to make up for these previous failures. Hoping to take advantage of a common weapon, the Army wanted the SAW to give automatic rifleman significantly more firepower and replace the M60 with a gun that used the same ammunition as its standard infantry weapons. Unfortunately, the 5.56mm cartridge simply didn’t have the range or terminal ballistics to meet the requirements of a true light machine gun and the service bought 7.62mm M240s instead. In search of this universal gun, the Army, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps, both experimented with the modular Stoner 63A family of weapons during the 1960s. With a design based around a common central frame, armorers could readily reconfigure this 5.56mm gun into a rifle, carbine, magazine-fed squad automatic rifle, belt-fed light machine gun, and even a fixed version for use on armored vehicles and aircraft. A scan from a brochure showing the six basic configurations of the Stoner 63A system., Cadillac Gage Both services were pleased with how the guns performed in field tests, but couldn’t justify the cost of replacing thousands of existing 5.56mm M16s so soon after their own introduction with another weapon in the same caliber. Soldiers and Marines weren’t going to be reconfiguring their guns in the field anyways, so the extreme modularity was impressive, but of debatable functional utility. The U.S. Navy SEALs became the most prolific users of the system, with a hybrid configuration that combined the belt-feeding system with a special short, heavy barrel. In many ways the resulting Mk 23 Mod 0 machine gun can be seen as a predecessor to the M249. The Navy’s Special Warfare community began replacing these aging guns in the late 1980s with a mixture of specially configured derivatives of the M60 and M249. The Army tried to develop a similar universal infantry weapon system yet again 1990s. As part of a project primarily aimed at replacing the M16 rifle and M4 carbine, Heckler and Koch proposed additional versions of its XM8 rifle for designated marksman and light support roles. This plan too fell through after the service decided that the new guns didn’t offer substantial enough benefits over the existing M16-pattern weapons. Soldiers pose with the carbine, at top, and sharpshooter versions of the XM8., US Army A new system firing an intermediate cartridge would get past the most glaring hurdle of a weapon chambered 5.56mm simply not having the range or terminal effects to act as a true light or medium machine gun. However, the next question becomes whether the resulting system would still be small and light enough to be suitable for basic infantry roles, especially in a compact carbine format. Interchangeable barrel lengths, as found on the FN SCAR rifle, would be one relatively simple option. Using a drum magazine or similar readily detachable, high capacity feeding mechanism might work for quickly moving from a basic rifle or carbine to a squad automatic weapon or light machine gun role. The Army could easily look at what the Marine Corps’ is doing with the aforementioned M27 IAR , a design that in many ways already seems to fit very well with many of the NGSAR’s basic requirements. Heckler and Koch’s take on the AR-15/M16 platform, the M27 most notably uses a gas-piston to function rather than the original direct-impingement system, which bleeds off propellant gas to cycle the mechanism introducing potentially problematic particulate matter straight into the gun’s inner workings. A Marine fires an M27 IAR., USMC Originally purchased as a substitute for the M249, in 2016, the Marines began looking at expanding the M27’s role, with the possibility of using it as a standard infantry rifle . On top of that, the service has been testing quad-stack 40-round box magazines and 60-round drums to give the IAR more sustained firepower than it presently has with the standard 30-round magazine for the M4. Advances in lightweight ammunition, such as caseless or cased-telescoped ammunition could help keep the weapons overall length and weight down, while still providing improved capabilities over a standard 5.56mm cartridge, as well.  However, these developments have long proved troublesome themselves and, as it stands now, the Army is focused primarily on just lightening ammunition weight with polymer or metal alloy cartridge cases. The big question at the end of the day will be just how much modularity the Army decides it really needs. Troops are unlikely to be swapping configurations in the field. It might not make sense to try again to craft this so far elusive single universal weapon system if the service can find appreciable amount of cost-saving commonality elsewhere in the maintenance and logistics pipelines. With this potential requirement in mind, however, it will be very interesting to see what gun makers put forward in their submissions for the NGSAR project.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2019",The USAF Is Adding a Newish F-22 to its Fleet of Flight Test Raptors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force may have shot down recent plans to restart production of the F-22 Raptor, but it will soon add one more of the stealth fighters to its active fleet. The service has pulled one the jets out of mothballs in order to expand its operational test force as work continues to expand the capabilities of the combat-coded jets. The Air Force confirmed to FlightGlobal that it was in the process of rehabilitating an Raptor, with the serial number 91-4006, at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Edwards is home to the 411th Flight Test Squadron, which oversees the F-22 Combined Test Force (CTF). The Raptor, which is a Block 10 aircraft, had been in flyable storage.  An Air Force spokesperson told FlightGlobal that it would take $25 million bring the plane’s avionics up to Block 20 standards, as well as update its electrical and hydraulics systems and flight controls. In its budget request for the 2018 fiscal year, which it released in May 2017, the Air Force noted the plan to bring the older Raptor back into service. The service also requested $54.6 million for the F-22 CTF, a nearly $6 million increase over money it received for the test force in the previous fiscal cycle. A pair of F-22s assigned the 411th Flight Test Squadron., USAF Expanding the CTF is extremely important for the future of the F-22s, especially with no plans to restart the production line and build new Raptors with more modern systems. Of the 187 jets that remain in service, only 125 of them are combat ready at any one time, with the bulk of the rest going through the upgrade or maintenance pipelines or sitting in flyable storage. It goes without saying that the decision to buy so few of the jets has long been controversial and repeatedly prompted calls to put the F-22 back into production. The Air Force has already conceded that it was shortsighted to end the production of the stealth fighters early. The service has also been compelled to acknowledge, at least tacitly , that it was optimistic to think that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter would be able to supplant the Raptor force and take over for most existing fourth generation fighter aircraft in the near future. USAF In June 2017, despite earlier suggesting it might be an possibility, the Air Force seemed to finally put an end to the discussion after delivering a report on the subject to Congress that explained it would cost approximately $50 billion to build another 194 Raptors. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway had this to say about the service’s verdict: In many ways this actually beats some cost estimates as far as restarting the production line. And at roughly $200 million per jet, the USAF could buy two F-35s for a single new F-22. But comparing the two is troublesome, as with both jets are in inventory and you don’t need anywhere near the numbers of Raptors as you do F-35s. Additionally, buying more F-22s could (and should) mean less F-35s would be required depending on how you look at the USAF’s overall force structure. Not just that, but involving other countries in the restart, notably Japan and possibly Australia, these costs to the USAF alone can come down. The big question as we highlighted before is what is a “new” F-22? Does it have an avionics system based on the F-35? Is it tailless and stretched to increase its stealthiness, range and weapons payload? Or is it a F-22 as we have today with basic upgrades to its computers and materials where necessary to accommodate modern production lines and techniques? The former is likely what the numbers above depict. But the F-22 remains the undisputed air supremacy fighter the world over, it has proven itself invaluable in Syria , and even the USAF has admitted the F-35 is no match for the jet’s extreme capabilities for certain key missions sets. But with a new bomber in the works, the need to upgrade or totally replace rapidly aging legacy fighters, as well as a whole other avalanche of priorities that are battling it out over the Pentagon’s unpredictably sized piggybank, realizing a Raptor production reprise remains just as doubtful as ever. Even the F-22 force the USAF already has is lacking key capabilities due to poor priorities and funding shortfalls. That last point is particularly important with regards to the CTF. Less well publicized is that the decision to buy less than 200 jets, combined with other budget cuts, had a significant impact on the testing of new, essential upgrades to the aircraft’s mission equipment to keep the Raptors just capable in the face of ever advancing potential threats . In the early 2000s, the CTF had seven F-22s of its own for test purposes. By September 2016, this number had dropped to just four aircraft . On at least one occasion, the Air Force pull combat coded jets and their pilots off their primary duty to bolster the experimental fleet. USAF A fifth full-time test jet will be a boon to ongoing upgrade work, most notably the Increment 3.2B software. The Air Force says this update will “ biggest capability upgrade since reaching Initial Operating Capability in December 2005.” In addition to the 3.2B software, the Air Force’s budget request says the CTF will support improvements to the F-22’s sensor suite, a set of National Security Agency-mandated updates to encryption capabilities of the aircraft’s communications gear and data links known as Update 6, and work on the Flutter Excitation System (FES) and Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS), according to the official budget documents. On top of that there will be flight tests of unspecified “advanced technology developments” that could include new, classified capabilities for the aircraft. This could include offensive or defensive directed energy weapons , which the Air Force says it is interested in integrating into its fifth generation fighter fleet and whatever comes next . It’s possible that expanding the test force might provide extra capacity in the near future for work on other important updates, such as improvements on the aircraft’s data sharing capabilities . The continued lack of a helmet-mounted display for Raptor pilots also limits the aircraft from realizing its full potential. The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway has written in depth on this glaring omission. Whatever the F-22 CTF does find itself doing in the coming year, it will have a fifth aircraft to help, and that can only be good for the fleet as a whole.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2019",USAF’s OA-X Light Attack Experiment is Looking More Like an International Arms Fair,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has begun to release more information about its ongoing light attack experiment , or OA-X, as well as the first official photos and video of the participants. From how the service is presently describing it, the assessment seems to be equal parts a lead up to a combat field test and marketing for potential future foreign military sales since two of the four aircraft involved don’t qualify for follow-on phases in their present form. On July 31, 2017, the Air Force kicked off the evaluation at Holloman Air Force in New Mexico. Since then, the four participating aircraft – Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano, Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine and Scorpion aircraft, and L-3 and Air Tractor’s OA-802 Longsword – have flown missions during the day and at night, with and without weapons, performing simulated surveillance and light attack missions, as well as more rudimentary flight tests. “That data is intended to inform strategic decisions,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who is at Holloman for a portion of the assessment, told reporters, according to Defense News . “It will also tell us whether we take this to the next step.” That next phase of the OA-X project could be an actual experimental deployment to a real combat zone. Though the Air Force has not yet specified any specific countries where it might hold these tests, the most obvious choice for this field evaluation would be either Iraq or Syria, where the planes could operate in relatively permissive environments surveilling and attacking ISIS terrorists. Given the complex and crowded nature of Syrian air space, missions over Iraq might be the better choice. Right now, it appears that the Air Force is only considering sending what it calls “tier one” participants – those that meet all of its threshold requirements, including a pressurized cockpit with an ejection seat – down range and only if the service is sufficiently impressed by their performance at Holloman. The A-29 and AT-6 are the only participants that meet the tier one requirements. The Scorpion light jet, which cannot operate from unimproved runways, and the OA-802, which lacks an ejection seat, are in a separate tier two category. “If the two ‘tier ones’ are successful in executing the first phase of the experiment and they want to continue to participate in the experiment, we plan to work with the combatant commanders to utilize both of those resources if they want to go forward,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the service’s top acquisition officer, explained. The A-29 Super Tucano flies a mission during the OA-X assessment., USAF Air Force Colonel Michael Pietrucha, the staff lead for light attack at the service’s Air Combat Command who helped draft the original OA-X requirements in 2008, told Defense News that there were already discussions within his command about how a field test might work. Once in the field, the experimental aircraft would undoubtedly take over some missions from ACC’s F-16 Viper and F-15E Strike Eagle multi-role fighter jets, and the A-10 Warthog attack aircraft to a lesser degree. Reducing the burden on higher performance aircraft to free them up for more demanding missions is one of the core arguments for buying a fleet of light attack planes in the first place. They could also perform some of the missions the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reapers are tasked with today. “Working with industry, and building on the Combat Dragon series of tests, we are determining whether a commercial off-the-shelf aircraft and sensor package can contribute to the coalition fight against violent extremism,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein explained . “I appreciate industry’s willingness to show us what they have to offer.” Combat Dragon was the nickname for a field test of the Cessna A-37A Dragonfly light attack jet, derived from the T-37 Tweet trainer, in South Vietnam in 1967. The Air Force revived the nickname for a more recent light attack project, known as Combat Dragon II. This plan at first envisioned a combat evaluation of the A-29 Super Tucano and then ultimately saw the deployment of a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Bronco aircraft on loan from NASA to Iraq for operational tests against ISIS. Those aircraft were wildly successful at their mission. Goldfein has since referred to the OA-X tests as Combat Dragon III, but the plan actually seems to have more in common with a Vietnam-era competitive field test of two other aircraft, the AU-23A Peacemaker and AU-24A Stallion . These aircraft flew combat missions against Communist insurgents in Thailand both as light attackers and miniature gunships during an evaluation called Pave Coin in 1971. The U.S. Air Force subsequently decided not to buy either type and offloaded the remaining planes onto Thailand and Cambodia. Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine on a test flight as part of the OA-X tests., USAF But if the ultimate goal is really a fly-off between the A-29 and AT-6 in actual combat, as it looks to be, it begs the question of why the Air Force has slowed the process down with the evaluation at Holloman at all. We at The War Zone have noted repeatedly that there is a clear and pressing need for this capability. The Air Force even pitted both aircraft against each other once before when it decided on an aircraft for the Light Air Support (LAS) program. The A-29 won that competition and since 2015 the Air Force has supported the training of Afghan and other allied pilots on the type at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. On top of that, the service trains its own fliers on the T-6A Texan II , an unarmed trainer that shares broad commonality with the AT-6 light attacker derivative. As such, both aircraft are already known quantities inside the service in terms of their capabilities and performance and it’s not clear what additional data the USAF might really gain from this assessment or another possible one overseas. USAF Of course, the Air Force did have specific equipment requirements for OA-X, including service-specific radios and the Link 16 data link, which were different from the A-29s it had helped supply to Afghanistan and Lebanon. However, the service had worked with contractors to train pilots to fly the participating aircraft ahead of the formal start of the OA-X evaluation, which would have uncovered any immediate issues with the basic functionality of the aircraft and their equipment or difficulties in conversion training. On top of that, the Air Force could have easily reached out to the U.S. Navy or the Air National Guard to help gather necessary information and existing test data, as both of them has extensively evaluated the Super Tucano with more advanced American equipment nearly a decade ago. The results of the Navy’s Imminent Fury experiment was the impetus for the Combat Dragon II program. Despite Secretary Wilson stressing that the evaluation highlighted “ new and faster ways ” of doing business, it seems safe to say that the Air Force could have put together a truncated state-side training plan and gotten the aircraft into an operational environment much sooner if that was the objective. It also seems increasingly clear that half the participants never had a realistic chance of advancing to any second phase of the test. “I believe the tier twos are going to learn from this,” General Bunch said. “They now have our criteria that were in the invitation to participate, so I think they’ll analyze that, they’ll go back and look at their systems, and then they can advance those.” Textron’s Scorpion light jet., USAF Instead, for both the tier one and two aircraft, the assessment at Holloman appears to be, at least in part, a marketing event aimed at potential international buyers. The flights give the various companies a prime opportunity to show off their wares for foreign military officials in a structured evaluation that those countries don’t have to pay to run. It’d easily be the first time many of them would get to see the Scorpion, a private venture by Textron, in any context at all. According to Defense News , representatives from Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and Paraguay, were among those out in New Mexico watching the evaluation. The Pentagon would most likely tap the Air Force to facilitate any foreign military sales deals for these types in the future, too. As already noted, the service has already helped deliver A-29s to Afghanistan and Lebanon, and could be involved in the training of Nigerian pilots as part of a forthcoming deal. There are also reports that The Philippines , another American ally, is finalizing its own plans to purchase six Super Tucanos. Armed crop dusters , such as the OA-802, are also becoming popular among American allies . In January 2017, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon’s top weapons broker, announced what has become a controversial sale of L-3 and Air Tractor’s aircraft to Kenya. The United Arab Emirates operates similar planes it purchased from the North Carolina-based firm IOMAX. Little Paraguay may seem like an outlier in this group, but it is a hub for American-supported counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities in South America’s so-called “ Southern Cone ” region. The country is reportedly home to one of the two small forward-deployed U.S. military special operations headquarters on the continent. Other American partners in Latin America, such as Colombia, already fly the Super Tucano for light attack missions. The OA-X tests could offer a chance for the competitors to pitch their aircraft to countries that might not have seriously considered this sort of capability, as well. As with the U.S. Air Force, Australia and Canada could be interested in a light attack aircraft as a low-cost alternative to sending their multi-role F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets on operations abroad . Both countries routinely engage in counterterrorism and peacekeeping missions overseas that could call for surveillance and light attack missions in permissive environments. With all this in mind, it remains as unclear as ever what the Air Force’s real goal with the OA-X experiment actually is. As it stands now, it looks like the most likely outcomes of the first phase of the evaluation, if there are any definitive outcome at all, could be a combat fly-off between the A-29 and AT-6 and an uptick in light attack aircraft sales to U.S. allies around the world. Regardless, it seems the road to an operational light attack aircraft fleet within the USAF’s inventory remains a meandering and uphill one.

The Royal Navy’s new supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and her escorts are about to finish a series of multi-national training exercises off the coast of Scotland. Notably, the flattop joined the U.S. Navy’s USS George H.W. Bush and members of her own Carrier Strike Group Two (CSG-2) to practice what may become a model for future combined operations between the two navies. On Aug. 1, 2017, 15 ships and more than 6,000 personnel from five countries – Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States – arrived in the North Atlantic Ocean to kick off the drills, called Saxon Warrior 2017 . While the NATO-led event was ostensibly intended as an opportunity for the different naval arms to practice working together, the main attraction was the two carriers operating alongside each other as they might in a future conflict. “We stand shoulder-to-shoulder here today to help them [the Royal Navy] refine and enhance their carrier strike group capabilities,” U.S. Army General Curtis Scaparrotti, head of U.S. European Command and NATO’s top officer, said ahead of the exercise. “Particularly important is the alignment of U.S. carrier strike groups and the U.K. carrier strike group,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Kenneth Whitesell, commander of CSG-2, added. So far, the two ships, along with their escorts and surface ships from the other participating nations have run through a number of individual training events against a number of mock air, surface, and sub-surface threats. Aircraft taking part in the exercise trained to fly strategic strike, air defense operations, combat air support missions, as well as help enforce a no-fly zone. USN In one case, ships defended themselves against a simulated swarm attack by small boats. American and British logistics vessels took turns refueling each others’ warships, demonstrating their ability to support each others’ operations, as well. But training for carrier operations is especially important for the Royal Navy, which hasn’t had a carrier with fixed wing aircraft since it retired HMS Ark Royal in 2011. HMS Ocean , a smaller helicopter carrier, is scheduled to leave service in 2018. Neither ship was anywhere near the size and complexity of Queen Elizabeth or her forthcoming sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales . “The U.S. Navy, out of huge generosity, has given us the whole of their carrier strike group so that we can practice the command and control of a carrier doing these operations in British waters,” Royal Navy Captain Ken Houlberg, Chief of Staff to the Commander of the U.K. Carrier Strike Group, said. “When HMS Queen Elizabeth comes into service later this year we will be well on the way to forming our own carrier strike capability.” Most significantly, Saxon Warrior gives the Royal Navy a chance to work with and observe the activities of a carrier with a full air wing. At present, the U.K. has no F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , expected to make up the core of Queen Elizabeth ’s aviation compliment, available to train with the new carrier. Instead, the Royal Air Force provided the actual British fighter jets for the exercise with its land-based Eurofighter Typhoons . A Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jet refuels during Saxon Warrior 2017., USAF The U.K. Ministry of Defense has insisted that Queen Elizabeth and her air wing will both be fully operational by 2026. However, what full operational capability means for the ship isn’t necessarily clear, as we at The War Zone noted in our profile of the British carrier when she set sail for her sea trials in June 2017: There is the very real potential the British may decide to trim their own purchases, too. Earlier in June 2017, The Times of London reported that the Royal Air Force was pushing for a reduction in the planned purchases of F-35Bs in order to free up funds for the conventional F-35A model. The proposal would potential cut the total number of B models to as few as 48. “Decisions on the precise details will be taken at the appropriate time to ensure the most appropriate capability and the best value for money,” was all the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense would say on the record to The Times . A fleet of 48 F-35Bs would prevent both Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales from operating with a full complement of strike aircraft, based on the official plan, especially since its unlikely the Royal Navy would have all of its Joint Strike Fighters embarked at any one time. The Royal Navy has already said what it would do with its first 42 F-35Bs, which were supposed to be in operation by 2023. Under the scheme 24 will be used for the deployment on carriers and 18 will be used for training. Relying on a ski jump and vertical landings instead of catapults and arresting gear to launch and recover aircraft, the ships require a short take-off and vertical landing optimized aircraft like the Joint Strike Fighter’s B version, too. So if something happens to the Royal Navy’s F-35B plans, there are no readily available alternatives. The service sold off its entire remaining fleet of perfectly capable Harrier jump jets after announcing it would retire Ark Royal in 2010. There’s no getting them back, either, since the U.S. Marine Corps promptly snatched up the aircraft to help sustain its own Harrier fleet. As such, the first aircraft to land on Queen Elizabeth was a Merlin helicopter, which will also be part of the final air wing. Without any actual Joint Strike Fighters, Royal Navy deck crews have been training on land with full scale models of the F-35 in preparation for taking up their actual roles onboard the carrier. “We are extremely fortunate,” Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander James Capps, who is the service’s Fixed Wing Operations Officer for Saxon Warrior 2017 and is situated aboard George H.W. Bush , said. “Being here on the George H.W. Bush has given us the opportunity to see where we are and what we need to achieve for our own U.K. carrier strike capability and to be here to see how the U.S. does it has been fantastic preparation.” These sorts of exchanges will likely become more common place as the Queen Elizabeth gets ready for her first patrol, presently scheduled for 2021. In December 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps and the Royal Navy cut a deal for Marine F-35Bs to join the U.K. carrier’s air wing for that initial deployment . American and British personnel will have to spend a significant amount of time training with each other in order for this arrangement to work. The US Navy supply ship USNS Supply refuels the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate HMS Iron Duke during Saxon Warrior 2017. , USN Saxon Warrior 2017 may actually be a first look at how Queen Elizabeth could operate more broadly, too. In July 2017, work began on the first of the Royal Navy’s future Type 26 City -class frigates , which are supposed to ultimately replace the aging Type 23 Duke -class . These frigates, along with its Type 45 Daring -class destroyers, will be at the core of the future U.K. Carrier Strike Group. Unfortunately, there are relatively few of them to support extended, independent carrier battle group operations. A typical American carrier strike group includes at least one guided missile cruiser, two or three guided missile destroyers, and at least one fast attack submarine, as well as being able to call upon a ready fleet of logistics vessels. Two Duke -class ships, HMS Iron Duke and HMS Westminster , joined Queen Elizabeth for Saxon Warrior 2017. This represented nearly one sixth of the Royal Navy’s Type 23s inventory. It is quite possible that the Royal Navy may seek another deal with its American counterparts to field combined carrier battle groups in order to ease the burden on its own surface fleet. Other allies might be willing and able to contribute to these shared operations, as well. For one photo-op during the exercise, Queen Elizabeth and her escorts sailed with U.S. Navy’s George H.W. Bush , Ticonderoga-class cruiser USS Philippine Sea , and the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Donald Cook , as well as the Norwegian Navy’s Fridtjof Nansen -class frigate HNoMS Helge Ingstad . Saxon Warrior ends on Aug. 10, 2017. Queen Elizabeth is set to enter her new homeport at Portsmouth for the first time sometime before the end of the month, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense. She is then scheduled for more sea trials before she formally enters service sometime in 2018. By then, it should be even more apparent how the Royal Navy expects to operate its new carrier strike group.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019",Trump’s “Fire and Fury” Threat Won’t Change North Korea’s Behavior,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to unleash the “fire and fury” of America’s nuclear arsenal on North Korea as the reclusive Communist country continues to issue its own fiery statements and conduct alarming missile launches . Without a dramatic change in policy to match, these comments alone are unlikely to dissuade the regime in Pyongyang from its provocative behavior and are more likely to feed into their existing propaganda narrative. The posturing, which seems at odds with other U.S. government statements, could send dangerous mixed signals to the North Koreans, their Chinese and Russian partners, and U.S. allies in the region alike. Trump made the pronouncement during a press conference at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump is supposedly on a working vacation from his property in New Jersey while workers finish planned renovations to the White House. “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Trump declared. “He has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire and fury and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.” Neither Trump nor members of his administration immediately clarified the content or intent of these remarks. A Pentagon spokesperson told Politico there had been no change in U.S. military policy or posture with regards to the Korean Peninsula. The next day, Trump took to Twitter to expand on his remarks. “My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal,” he wrote. “It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before. Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!” It’s important to note up front that Trump’s first executive order as president, which he signed on Jan. 20, 2017, related to the Affordable Care Act, not nuclear weapons. The order calling for a new nuclear posture review came seven days later. President Barack Obama had already put plans into motion to modernize the stockpile , which some estimate could cost up to $1 trillion and could take up to 30 years to complete. Trump has already voiced his opinions about America’s nuclear capabilities on numerous occasions, both during his election campaign and after. He infamously seemed unable to explain the nuclear triad underpinning America’s deterrent capabilities during one presidential debate in 2015, called for expanding the country’s stockpile for the first time in decades a year later, and once reportedly demanded to know what the point of building the weapons was if you couldn’t ever use them . In addition, Trump has previously appeared to suggest he would be willing to launch attacks , either nuclear or non-nuclear, if North Korea continued with its ballistic missile tests. We at The War Zone have written before about the myriad ways the United States can go about gathering intelligence about North Korea, its armed forces, and its intentions, as well as the available military options . Whatever Trump’s actual intent, the harsh remarks fit with what has already been weeks of conflicting statements about how the Trump administration intends to handle the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. On Aug. 1, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who famously seems to avoid directly engaging with the press, arrived at the State Department’s briefing room to take questions. “We continue to call upon them [China] to use that influence with North Korea to create the conditions where we can have a productive dialogue,” he said at one point . “We don’t think having a dialogue where the North Koreans come to the table assuming they’re going to maintain their nuclear weapons is productive.” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a meeting in The Philippines in August 2017., AP The next day Vice President Mike Pence categorically ruled out the possibility of talks with the North Koreans. On Aug. 6, 2017, Tillerson reiterated the possibility for negotiations if North Korea stopped its missile tests. After Trump’s comments from Bedminister, America’s top diplomat again tried to be more measured and conciliatory. “I think the President just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime  on the U.S. unquestionable ability to defend itself, will defend itself  and its allies,” he said to members of the press as they flew to Guam for a scheduled visit. “I think it was important that he deliver that  message to avoid any miscalculation on their part.” But deterrence is fundamentally based on a clarity of messaging to any potential opponent. To be sure, there is a precedent for governments disregarding signaling they can’t decipher. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy famously decided to ignore an apparent threat in favor of conciliatory messages from the Soviet Union, which helped deescalate the situation. It still seems especially risky to rely on this when it comes to discussions of nuclear conflict. The War Zone, thanks in part to documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, has already written a detailed look at how the U.S. military might go about launching a nuclear strike . An unclassified “risk” U.S. Strategic Command notes in its official operations plan is “adversaries misperceive messages.” How do you go about mitigating this? “Constantly assess culturally appropriate strategic communication strategy, tightly integrated through the interagency process.” STRATCOM via FOIA There were criticisms regarding Trump’s hyperbolic comment from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, worried about the potential for a dangerous new phase in the hostility between the United States and North Korea. Many of the comments seemed to focus heavily on the need for a clear and coherent message to the North Koreans rather than off-the-cuff statements. “Isolating the North Koreans has not halted their pursuit of nuclear weapons,” Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic Senator for California and the ranking member of her party on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement . “And President Trump is not helping the situation with his bombastic comments.” “I take exception to the President’s comments because you’ve got to be sure that you can do what you say you’re going to do,” Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told KTAR radio in Phoenix after hearing about Trump’s declaration. “I think this is very, very, very serious.” There were already concerns about how Trump’s negotiation style might mix with nuclear weapons. In January 2017, Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California, introduced a bicameral bill to try and prevent Trump’s from being able to launch a nuclear strike without Congressional approval. The comments from Bedminister reignited calls for these restrictions, which are not presently in place . A North Korean Hwasong-12 IRBM., North Korea State Media Surprising few experts and regular observers of the growing tensions in East Asia, the North Koreans quickly responded to Trump’s comments with more threats directed at the United States, as well as its allies in South Korea and Japan. Most notably, a statement attributed to an unnamed spokesman for the Korean People’s Army Strategic Force, taken to mean the country’s nuclear-capable ballistic missile units, said the country was working on an operational plan to attack the U.S. military’s strategic bases on the island of Guam. “The KPA Strategic Force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12,” the individual said. “The plan is to be soon reported to the Supreme Command soon after going through full examination and completion and will be put into practice in a multi-concurrent and consecutive way any moment once Kim Jong Un, supreme commander of the nuclear force of the DPRK, makes a decision.” There is no clear indication from the statement that this threat is imminent – it’s also a threat North Korea has made before – and it seems more likely that the plan described is akin to U.S. military own operations plans for potential crises. The North Koreans are definitely capable of launching this attack, having successfully test-fired the Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), which experts estimate does have the range to hit Guam and could potentially carry a nuclear warhead. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OU6EyQUNF5Y However, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis responded with his own stern statement , implying that the United States would neutralize the North Korean regime, at great cost to its population, if there was an actual attack on American soil. “The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people,” he said, referred to by an acronym for its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This seemed to double down on Trump’s initial threat, but the rest of the notice included caveats that suggested the U.S. military wouldn’t swing into action unless there was an imminent threat from the North Koreans. It also highlighted ongoing diplomatic efforts. “While our State Department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth,” Mattis wrote. “The DPRK regime’s actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates.” The War Zone has previously examined the conventional and nuclear capabilities the U.S. military could employ on the Korean Peninsula. In addition, American troops man defensive batteries of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile interceptors both on Guam and in South Korea, specifically to counter the threat of North Korean IRBMs, such as the BM-25 Musudan and the more advanced Hwasong-12. Whether this system would be able to take out multiple missiles at once or a larger intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) are issues we at The War Zone have previously discussed in depth . Similar questions persist about the capabilities of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system that presently protects the contiguous United States and Alaska. Still riding high on the a flurry of successful advanced ballistic missile tests, North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un already seem disinclined to back down in the face of repeated American and international condemnation. In July 2017 alone, North Korea fired two of its all-new Hwasong-14 ICBMs, which many believe has the ability to hit a significant portion of the continental United States. North Korean premier Kim Jong-un hugs a military officer after the first successful test of the Hwasong-14 ICBM in July 2017., KCNA On Aug. 8, 2017, The Washington Post also published a story stating that North Korea’s scientists and engineers were making progress toward a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could fit on many of its growing arsenal of land- and submarine-launched ballistic missiles , citing a leaked intelligence assessment. The United States believes the insular country has conducted five nuclear tests and many had been expecting a sixth to coincide with the launch of the Hwasong-14. This test would likely test the miniaturized nuclear warhead. North Korea had shown its defiance after the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a new resolution aimed at toughening sanctions against it over its ballistic missile tests on Aug. 5, 2017. United Nations members and their citizens are now prohibited from accepting any North Korean coal, iron, and iron ore exports, letting in any additional North Korean nationals for work, or starting new joint ventures or expanding existing cooperative arrangements. The resolution also added a number of individuals and entities to existing sanctions lists. “We will, under no circumstances, put the nukes and ballistic rockets on the negotiating table,” North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho had said in a statement on Aug. 7, 2017. “Neither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. … are fundamentally eliminated.” A view of the UN Security Council as it unanimously passes a new resolution against North Korea in August 2017., AP And even if the North Korean regime ultimately decides to dismiss Trump’s comments as an immediate threat, the remarks, as well as Mattis’ response to the specific threat against Guam, can only fuel North Korea’s long-standing narrative the United States uses “ nuclear blackmail ” to bully smaller countries and that American forces and their allies are actively preparing for an attack to destroy the country’s Communist regime and eliminate its key figures, including premier Kim Jong-un. North Korea describes its own nuclear arsenal as a way of assuring the country is treated fairly in international affairs. So, a carefully thought out “culturally appropriate strategic communication strategy” is perhaps especially important when it comes to North Korea.  Back in March 2017, Tyler Rogoway and I had explained the inherent danger to giving any undue weight to the North Korea’s claims, writing : So, it seems unlikely that the sterner American statements will goad North Korea into changing its own policies unless they’re actually coupled with a new, cohesive strategy. They will undoubtedly inflame the regime’s own pronouncements and paranoia about the United States. They could also serve to lighten the hair-trigger that separates a shaky peace from total war on the Korean Peninsula. Vice President Mike Pence looks out over the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea in April 2017., AP There’s also the distinct possibility that Trump’s blustery comments, along with the seemingly contradictory statements from his own administration, may set the United States up for a “ commitment trap ” where it will either have to back up this threat of “fire and fury” with some sort of actual action, which could easily end up looking trivial , or walk the rhetoric back in one or more potentially embarrassing clarifications. Either path could simply embolden North Korea. Neither set of options, short of an all-out confrontation, seems likely to curtail the country’s advanced weapons programs. On top of that, a full-scale war would be devastating for both North and South Korea, potentially putting the United States at odds with its own allies. These considerations had seemed to impact the response to North Korea’s second Hwasong-14 test , which landed relatively close to Japan’s Hokkaido island. Japanese authorities said they couldn’t continue to let the provocations go unchallenged and South Korea called an emergency meeting with U.S. military commanders on the Peninsula to discuss the available military options. But ultimately, the United States and its allies chose to conduct shows of force, as they have done many times in the past in response to North Korean provocations. On the ground, U.S. and South Korean troops fired their own ballistic missiles in a second combined demonstration. In the air, American B-1 bombers and fighter jets flew with fighters from South Korean Air Force and Japanese Air Self-Defense Force. Additional flights of the B-1s have continued sporadically over the last two weeks. Trump and his administration have also employed a similar mix of both flattering and threatening statements to try and elicit Chinese and Russian support in dealing with North Korea. Earlier in August, Trump himself took to Twitter to criticize the Chinese government for not doing more to reign in its small neighbor. “They do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk,” Trump wrote on his preferred social media outlet. “China could easily solve this problem!” After the Chinese voted in favor of the new U.N. sanctions, however, Trump thanked both them and the Russian for agreeing to the resolution . China and Russia are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which gives them the right to veto any motion. In response to Trump’s remarks, China’s state-run media outlet Xinhua called on both North Korea and the United States and its allies to halt any provocative actions , including both missile launches and military exercises, which is the Chinese government’s repeated position. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had called for the U.S. government to take “ prudent ” steps to deescalate tensions earlier on Aug. 8, 2017. It remains to be seen how or if the U.S. government will make any visible changes in its policies or activities in response to Trump’s remarks. In his comments on the way to Guam, Secretary of State Tillerson seemed to again outline the continuing contradictions in the Administration’s stance. “What the President is doing is sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong-un can understand, because he doesn’t seem to understand diplomatic language,” he said. But “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days.” he added. For the moment, at least, it seems that the actions, which will hopefully speak louder than the words, are business as usual for the United States and its allies in East Asia.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018",US Could Kick Off Air Strikes Against ISIS in The Philippines Next Week,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Philippine security forces continue to fight the Maute group rebels , aligned with ISIS, for control of the city of Marawi in the southern part of the country, the United States is reportedly considering launching its own air strikes against the militants. This would represent a significant escalation in U.S. involvement in the emerging conflict and a shift in the policy of the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has been an outspoken critic of American military intervention in the past. On Aug. 7, 2017, NBC News, citing two unnamed defense officials, said that the U.S. military was considering launching aerial attacks on the Maute fighters as early as the following week as part of what would be an official, named military operation. American forces have already been providing intelligence and other advisory support to their counterparts in and around Marawi at least since June 2017 . “We’re providing them some training and some guidance in terms of how to deal with an enemy that fights in ways that is not like most people have ever had to deal with,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was in the country for a scheduled visit, said the same day at a press conference . “I see no conflict, no conflict at all in our helping them with that situation.” Air strikes have already been a very visible component of the Philippines government operations in Marawi. However, as The War Zone has noted, the country’s Air Force has very limited capabilities when it comes to this kind of complex urban warfare, relying on a mix of aging OV-10M Bronco and SF.260 light attackers, newer FA-50PH light jet fighters, and light gunship helicopters. A Philippine Air Force OV-10M Bronco., PAF The Philippines has been looking into buying fixed-wing gunships based on turboprop conversions of the venerable C-47 transport, as well as new A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, but has yet to finalize any deals. The United States did recently help deliver a small number of Cessna C-208B Caravan aircraft with surveillance equipment , as well as unspecified small unmanned aircraft, according to Tillerson. In the end, most, if not all of these aerial attacks have involved “dumb” munitions, which can be dangerous to friend and foe alike. There was a report of at least one potential friendly fire incident on May 31, 2017. So, it’s not surprising that authorities in the Philippines may be interested in bringing in American air power. U.S. planes, either manned or unmanned, would expand the total number of aircraft available for air strikes, as well as add precision guided munitions to the equation for more accurate attacks. The NBC News story did not say what aircraft the U.S. military was considering deploying, but the immediate assumption was that American commanders would employ either U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper or U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones, all of which are able to carry a variety of guided bombs and missiles. The U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command has already proven it can establish drone surveillance operations virtually anywhere in a matter of weeks . A U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator., USAF Setting up a mission can take even less time if there is an improved air base or airport that American crews can make use of instead of needing to build its own facilities. For more than a decade, a U.S. special operations task force , known as Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P), made use of a number of Philippine bases , including Edwin Andrews Air Base situated less than 200 miles southwest of Marawi, for aerial surveillance and other operations. A briefing slide showing the assets US special operations forces in the Philippines had access to circa 2008., JSOTF-P Another option would be sending manned aircraft of some description, including high performance multi-role combat aircraft. As part of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement , which the United States and the Philippines signed in 2014, the U.S. military expanded routine training exercises in the country proving it could deploy and operate small numbers of jet aircraft in cooperation with the Philippine Air Force. In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force sent a contingent that included four A-10 Warthog ground attackers to the country to take part in a series of drills. Two months later, the U.S. Navy deployed four EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft for their own rotation . An A-10 sits at Clark Air Base in the Philippines in 2016., USAF There is the slim possibility the United States could choose to arm aircraft it already has flying in the country, too. The Navy’s P-3C Orion patrol planes, spotted conducting surveillance over Marawi in June 2017, can carry AGM-65F Maverick missiles for use against surface targets. During the U.S.-led intervention in Libya in 2011, a P-3 destroyed a patrol boat with one of these weapons. These missiles, with their very flat flight profile, would have limited utility against fighters hiding in Marawi’s more densely packed areas, but it could offer an immediate precision munitions capability. It would be an ideal choice for attacking insurgents riding around the city in vehicles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0F06frcm9oA But whatever aircraft and weapons the United States might employ, the decision would mark a significant escalation in American involvement in the fighting against ISIS branch in the Philippines. In 2015, the U.S. military formally ended operations focused on Al Qaeda-linked militants, which had started in 2002. The remaining American personnel from that mission were reassigned to a so-called “ augmentation cell ” within the Embassy tasked with continued, but limited advisory support for the Filipino armed forces. “The …  mission transitioned to rotational assignments of U.S. SOF [special operations forces] based on close consultation with our AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] partners to appropriately tailor our approach to their requests,” U.S. Army Major Kari McEwen, a spokesperson for Special Operations Command Pacific, told The War Zone in an Email on May 31, 2017. “The number of U.S. special operations forces in the Philippines fluctuates based on rotational Mutual Defense Board and Security Engagement Board (MDB-SEB) activities and requests from the Armed Forces of the Philippines.” NBC News reported that the United States would likely justify any strikes under the principle of “collective self defense,” which essentially means that American advisers working with partners near active combat can call in fire support to defend themselves if they too come under attack. The U.S. military has previously cited this same broad precedent when explaining fire support missions in other shadowy conflict zones , such as Somalia . The plans for a more active American presence in the Philippines would also be in line with the increased willingness of President Donald Trump and his administration to use military force in higher risk situations, as we had already noted with regards to Iraq , Syria , and Yemen . However the U.S. government explains the situation, it would also represent a significant policy shift for authorities in the Philippines’ and President Rodrigo Duterte in particular. Duterete threatened to reduce or outright end various military cooperation agreements with the United States both during his campaign and after his election victory in 2016. President of The Philippines Rodrigo Duterte shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in August 2017., AP These comments had mainly been in response to criticism from the U.S. government over reported gross human rights abuses during his war on the drug trade as Mayor of Davao City, including the use of roving death squads that he apparently personally oversaw . As time went on his rhetoric only became more charged and he personally insulted then President Barack Obama as a “ son of a whore .” He was also an outspoken critic of previous U.S. military involvement in the country, including the reported use of drones against Abu Sayyaf terrorists and Moro rebels, which he suggested had impeded efforts to cut peace deals with these groups. For their part, the United States and the government in the Philippines have both repeatedly denied reports that unmanned aircraft ever carried out strikes in the country. “I will not allow them to use our airport for them to launch their drones,” Duterte told a gathering of ethnic Moros on Aug. 12, 2013. “I do not want it. I do not want trouble and killings.” Relations between Duterte and Trump, who observers have compared to each other in various ways, have been much warmer and may help explain the change of heart. According to a leaked transcript of a phone call between the two leaders in April 2017, Trump pointedly told Duterte he was “doing a great job” in his controversial fight against drug traffickers. Still, Duterte’s rhetoric may make it difficult for him to admit he sought American help against the Maute group and their allies. In June 2017, he said he was unaware of any U.S. special operations forces in Marawi and had not asked for their support. On Aug. 8, 2017, the Philippines Department of National Defense (DND) said reports of impending U.S. air strikes were false. “The DND denies any discussions regarding the use of US drones to strike against Daesh-inspired terrorist groups in the Philippines,” public affairs office chief Arsenio Andolong declared in the statement. “The AFP also states that no such discussions have occurred at their level.” We’ll probably have to wait and see if American manned aircraft or drones suddenly appear over Marawi, just like the special operations forces quietly arrived on the scene with little fanfare.

The U.S. Air Force has clarified that its ongoing light attack experiment and a separate project it is working on together with U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) are focusing on separate aspects of the light aerial attack mission set. Though they are distinct programs, it seems very possible that they may ultimately turn out to be complementary rather than competitive efforts as we originally thought. On July 31, 2017, the Air Force had kicked off its much awaited light attack evaluation, commonly known as OA-X and more formally referred to as the Capability Assessment of Non-Developmental Light Attack Platforms, or Combat Dragon III. The four participating aircraft are Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano, Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine and jet-powered Scorpion, and Air Tractor and L-3’s OA-802 . Just days before the assessment began, the service had also announced it would be working on a program with SOCOM called Light Attack Support for Special Operations (LASSO). “USSOCOM is not seeking to develop its own light attack aircraft,” Brian Brackens, an Air Force spokesman at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, told The War Zone in an Email. “Light attack support for special ops represents a series of capability assessments that are complementary to the USAF light attack experiment.” Wright-Patterson is home of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, which is managing the LASSO project. The service is conducting the OA-X tests out at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. A pair of Afghan Air Force A-29 Super Tucanos., USAF “The light attack experiment focuses on the light attack platform,” Brackens continued. “Light attack support for special ops focuses on platform agnostic capabilities (i.e. sensors, munitions & mission systems) that may be compatible with any light attack platform.” We at The War Zone have already discussed in detail the kind of weapons and equipment special operators might want to integrate onto a future light attack aircraft. With this new information, it would appear that SOCOM has keen interest in the outcome of the OA-X evaluations, but has its own set of broad requirements that are distinct from the Air Force’s own parameters. This is perhaps not surprising given what we know about the Air Force’s own goals for its light attack experiment. Though the service has been tight-lipped about what it wants to get out of the assessment, it did confirm to FlightGlobal on Aug. 4, 2017 that it had effectively set aside its core requirements in order to include more participants. The original plan had seven key criteria for any aircraft participating in the OA-X assessment, including an ejection seat and the ability to employ laser-guided Paveway II-series bombs and Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II rockets . “USSOCOM envisions a Special Operations Force (SOF) peculiar capability supporting globally deployed ground forces,” Brackens explained. “This capability will be essential in areas where traditional Combat Air Force aircraft are in high demand and may be incapable of supporting a small ground SOF element.” Air Tractor and L-3’s OA-802 Longsword., L-3 This makes perfect sense since light attack aircraft are ideally suited to the kind of small, discreet missions American special operators often find themselves call upon to perform. These operations often target insurgents and terrorists with limited anti-aircraft capabilities, but in remote areas where friendly support might be limited. Unlike a high performance combat aircraft, a light attack plane could operate from airstrips with limited infrastructure closer to the front lines, making them more responsive and giving pilots more time to loiter over the target area. On top of that, the smaller planes would be cheaper to fly and easier to maintain under those conditions, all while freeing up multi-role fighter jets for higher risk missions. Whether or not LASSO is directly looking for a SOCOM-specific light attack plane or not, the U.S. special operations forces have a long-standing and clear requirement for this kind of aircraft. They have been the primary drivers of many recent similar projects, including the Combat Dragon II field test that sent two highly modified OV-10G+ Broncos , which the Navy had borrowed from NASA , to fight ISIS in Iraq in 2015. I had already suggested that the Air Force might be inclined to partner up with other services on such a project after Senate revealed its desire to add $1.2 billion for “a fleet of Light Attack/Observation aircraft” into the annual defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year without any formal acquisition program already in place. Specifically, I wrote: A joint Air Force-Navy-Marine Corps OA-X program might actually make the most sense in both the short and long terms. It would help share the burden of paying and manning the resulting units and give the Air Force space to develop plans to absorb its share of the aircraft. At the same time, the Marines could leverage the Air Force’s own experience working with these types of aircraft in cooperation with Afghanistan and Lebanon, which includes both pilot training and managing logistics chains. The same logic would apply to the partnership with SOCOM, perhaps even more so than with conventional forces in other services. By separating its technological requirements from any other light attack program, SOCOM can take whatever systems it plans to test and install them on any aircraft it wants or otherwise has access to first without needing to wait for the results of OA-X, too. Earlier in 2017, the Air Force’s 492nd Special Operations Wing , previously known as the Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center, announced it was interested in possibly leasing a single AC-208 Combat Caravan to train its personnel on the kind of light surveillance and precision strike aircraft they might encounter on advisory missions with allied air arms. This would be a good platform to test light attack technology, as well. In addition, increasingly popular modular aircraft and stores designs could only help American personnel move sensors and weapons quickly between different types of planes for both testing and operational purposes. All of this would speed up the introduction of a special operations-specific version of any such aircraft the Air Force ultimately decides to buy. The service could leverage those developments for any aircraft its fields to conventional units, as well. In the end, we may very well see a fleet of light attackers in the future flying with various conventional and special operations units that combine an airframe the Air Force selected with SOCOM-sponsored weapons and equipment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 25, 2019",US Army Seeks a New Battle Rifle for Piercing Advanced Body Armor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As it continues to work on an all-new standard infantry weapon , the U.S. Army is considering adopting a new “Interim Combat Service Rifle” in the 7.62x51mm caliber. The service is particularly concerned about soldiers’ ability to penetrate advanced body armors with their existing 5.56x45mm M4 carbines. On Aug. 4, 2017, the Army announced it would buy up to eight different sample rifles as part of the evaluation of the potential future infantry weapon, also known as ICSR. In April 2017, the service reportedly began a project to consider giving such a weapon to a designated marksman in each infantry squad, according to Military.com . This ultimately evolved into the new, broader requirement, sources previously told Soldier Systems . “The Army has identified a potential gap in the capability of ground forces and infantry to penetrate body armor using existing ammunition,” the notice on FedBizOpps, the federal government’s main contracting website, explained. “To address this operational need, the Army is looking for an Interim Combat Service Rifle (ICSR) that is capable of defeating emerging threats.” The service’s present plan is to evaluate the submissions against a three main factors, which are, in order of importance, the features of the “bid sample” itself, the production capability of the vendor or vendors, and the price. Each of these has a number of more specific subfactors. Snipers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team train with M110 rifles., US Army The announcement does not include detailed requirements for the rifle, but says they will be scored for how accurate they are, their basic dimensions, and noise and muzzle flash, with and without a sound suppressor . The weapon must also have semi-automatic and full-automatic fire modes to get into the competition in the first place. The Army ideally wants a gun that has folding back iron sights, ambidextrous controls, the ability to accept its existing standard optical sights and laser aiming devices, and a magazine that can hold 20 to 30 rounds in order to support a combat load of 210 rounds in total. The weapons will have to pass the various trials while using the standard M80A1 service ammunition, the contract notice said. Given the project’s focus on defeating armor, there is the possibility some tests could incorporate the XM1158 Advanced Armor Penetrating (ADVAP) cartridge that the Army is testing separately. Another option could be the U.S. Navy’s Mk 319 Mod 0 round, already available to special operations forces, which is specifically intended to have better terminal effects after breaking through cover, such as car windows. The production and price factors are primarily focused on the ability of the manufacturer to make up the rifles quickly and efficiently without sacrificing quality. Based on the known criteria, the Army appears to want to hire a vendor that already has the ability to make a production run of up to 50,000 rifles or can reasonably expand to do so with limited effort. This would seem to favor established companies already making such weapons in appreciable quantities. A U.S. Navy SEAL with a 7.62mm Mk 17 Mod 0 SCAR rifle., USN At present, the Army is already buying new rifles that meet many of the basic description of the ICSR as replacements for existing 7.62mm weapons it issues to sniper teams. Heckler and Koch’s M110A1 Combat Semi-Automatic Sniper System (CSASS), a derivative of the company’s HK417 rifle, will replace the older Knights Armament Company M110 rifles , which are based on the company’s SR-25 design. Both of these weapons share many of the same external characteristics and control features of the U.S. military’s standard M16 rifles and M4 carbines, which fire the smaller 5.56mm round, something that could simplify training requirements. Other options could include the 7.62mm version of the FN SCAR , already in service with American special operations forces, or further upgraded variants of the Cold War-era M14 rifle. Before adopting the M110, the Army rebuilt and issued older M14s, known as Enhanced Battle Rifles, for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. A US Army soldier poses with an M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle., US Army There is definitely a long-standing requirement for this sort of weapon. For years, critics have complained that insurgents and terrorists with Soviet-era weapons firing the 7.62x54mm cartridge, including SVD marksman rifles and similar types, had better range and terminal ballistics at those distances than their American counterparts armed mainly with 5.56mm weapons. Improvements in individual body armor have only added to these concerns. “The 5.56mm round, we recognize that there is a type of body armor out there, that it doesn’t penetrate,” U.S. Army General Mark Milley told members of Congress in May 2017. “We also have that body armor ourselves.” At the same time, however, there is also an ongoing debate over what type of cartridge and associated weapon would be the best solution, as well as the exact mix of those guns and other weapons in infantry and other units. Most importantly, bigger bullets might mean more range and a better ability to kill the enemy further away, but they also mean larger, heavier cartridges, which in turn either means soldiers have to carry more or have less ammunition. An Iraqi soldier trains with a Romanian PSL rifle, similar to a Soviet-era SVD., US Army Work on alternatives to heavy metal cartridges cases, such as polymer-cased, cased-telescoped, and caseless ammunition, could help reduce weight, but come along with their own developmental hurdles. We’ve already discussed many of these issues in our in depth look at the Army’s latest attempt to craft a so-called “ intermediate cartridge ” that would combine many of the best features of both 7.62mm and 5.56mm ammunition, as well as a gun to go with it. This separate, parallel program is likely the service’s real desired end state and would explain the “interim” in the ICSR project title. So, it’s not entirely surprising that hidden in the dense contracting language are two important caveats that suggest the Army may not ultimately decide to buy any ICSR. “Once the test and evaluation is concluded, the Government may award a single follow-on … contract for the production of up to 50,000 weapons,” the contracting notice noted. Deeper in the text, where it discusses this “follow-on production contract” in more detail, the announcement added that this deal will only come “provided that the ICSR prototype project is completed successfully.” A US Army prototype squad automatic weapon using cased-telescoped cartridges., US Army It is also possible that the Army could decide to procure these weapons, but only issue them to select units. During his May testimony, General Milley made this basic argument after suggesting there might be a need for a new 7.62mm rifle. “This idea that the entire Army needs the same thing all the time, it’s not necessarily true,” Milley added in his May testimony. “There are some infantry units that are much more highly likely to rapidly deploy than others and conduct close-quarters combat that we would probably want to field them with a better-grade weapon that can penetrate this body armor that we are talking about.” Though the contract says that the final number of rifles in any follow-on contract could be subject to change, the existing 50,000 total would fit with this idea of a limited purchase for particular units, such as the 82nd Airborne Division with its global response force mission , or storage in pre-positioned stocks for issue directly to troops heading to hot spots. At present , the U.S. Army has 10 divisions, each with approximately 15,000 personnel, depending on the exact composition of their brigade combat teams. On top of that, there are three separate maneuver “brigades,” counting its two deployable armored cavalry regiments, with another approximately 15,000 personnel. A soldier fires an 5.56mm M4 carbine., US Army The contract notice does mention what weapon or weapons the ICSR would replace or provide any other information on a proposed basis of issue. A buy of 50,000 rifles would not be enough cover everyone already carrying an M4 carbine, the existing standard service weapon, in all of the Army’s active component maneuver units. It also wouldn’t provide the necessary rifles for the Army to issue substantial numbers of them up front to Army Reserve and Army National Guard units that often deploy overseas. Another option would be to mix the new guns with the existing M4s and other weapons within the squad platoon structures, which would be closer to the original plan of having dedicated designated marksman carry the heavier rifles. The Army could still decide to only reorganize a limited number of units in this manner, keeping the rest of the ICSRs in reserve. Whatever happens, the results of the trials are likely to add more data to the ongoing discussions within the Army over optimal cartridge sizes and associated weapons. Whether the ICSR makes it into combat or not, is likely that many of the required features will be present in the service’s future rifles and carbines.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Blackwater Founder Wants to Provide a “Turn Key” Mercenary Air Force for Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though a debate remains over the exact reasons why , it’s increasingly widely accepted that the United States and its allies are not winning the fight against insurgents in Afghanistan at the moment. One suggestion for how to turn things around – unsurprisingly proffered up by the infamous Erik Prince and Stephen A. Feinberg, the owners of private military company DynCorp – was to dramatically increase the number of contractors supporting Afghan forces. Part of that proposal now reportedly includes setting up a mercenary air wing in the war torn country. Military Times broke the news that Erik Prince had gone straight to the government of Afghanistan to suggest he could supply a fully-staffed air arm able to provide close air support, intelligence and surveillance, and logistics support functions across the country. Lancaster6, a Dubai-based private military company, would be the actual contractor for this “turn-key composite air wing.” The new unit would include an unspecified number of A-4 Skyhawk attack jets , LASA T-Bird armed crop dusters, Gazelle and Super Puma helicopters, An-26 light transports, and a drone called Lioneye, which is reportedly a proprietary design belonging to Lancaster6 that can fly for up to 12 hours at a time. Military Times , which did not publish a copy of the proposal itself, did not say where the aircraft would come from, how much the entire package might cost, or how many individuals it would take for the air wing to function as advertised. There would reportedly be enough aircraft and personnel to provide close air support anywhere in the county within one hour. The attack planes would be linked to troops on the ground in part via an iPhone app called SafeStrike , commercial software that can help deconflict airspace over a given area and mark targets. The proposal insisted that while Lancaster6’s employees would fly all the missions, Afghan authorities would make key final decisions, including about whether to strike or not. A-4 Skyhawks belonging to private air services contractor Draken International., Draken International Some of the aircraft and helicopters would also be able to gather intelligence information. We don’t know how Lancaster6 planned to share this information with Afghanistan officials. Without knowing all the details, it’s hard for us to say how realistic, legally or logistically, this deal might be for any of the parties. It is true that Afghanistan’s Air Force at present, despite more than a decade of investment from foreign allies, lacks the ability to provide critical support for forces on the ground or do so on a regular basis. This can only have limited the ability of the country’s regular military to quickly respond to crises and has likely been a major reason for its dangerous over reliance on better trained and equipped special operations forces . A pair of Afghan Air Force L-39s in formation in 2007., USAF In theory, a private air arm could give Afghanistan’s military some space to catch up and get its own Air Force up and running to full capacity. Lancaster6’s obvious pitch is that instead of waiting for years to get critical capabilities into place, the government in Kabul could have them immediately. With its own fast moving jet attack planes, airborne intelligence collectors, and extra logistical support, Afghan forces would have more options when planning missions and when responding to time-sensitive situations. If troops know that there is reliable organic air support and improved medical evacuation capabilities on call it could help reduce casualties and improve morale , both of which are perpetual problems for Afghanistan’s security forces. However, there’s no explanation about how Lancaster6’s plan would be able to do this any better than the U.S.-led coalition’s efforts. Though the overall number had declined in recent years, there has been a dramatic spike in American air strikes in support of Afghan security forces in 2017. Most notably, in April 2017, the U.S. Air Force dropped one of its largest non-nuclear weapons , the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, more commonly known as the Mother of All Bombs, on terrorists belonging to ISIS’ franchise in the country. This was the first time the United States had dropped this bomb in combat anywhere. It seems difficult to imagine that Prince’s air wing could provide more sorties than American forces can, though it is possible his force could be more flexible and responsive under direct Afghan control. This in turn, however, raises concerns about the ability of Afghan forces to identify targets and the potential for increased civilian casualties, which could in turn inflame public sentiment against the government in Kabul and the foreign coalition, as it has in the past . Even having well-trained American and other coalition personnel on the ground directly coordinating with Afghan forces has not prevented serious accidents from occurring, such as the inadvertent and immensely controversial strike on the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz in October 2015. A pair of Afghan Air Force Mi-35 Hinds sit at a forward location ahead of a mission in 2011., USAF The U.S. military is clearly skeptical of the idea, too, according to Military Times . U.S. Army Gen. John Nicholson, in charge of all U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, has refused to meet with Prince to discuss the plan. If the United States declined to include Prince’s air arm under the legal umbrella of its own activities in Afghanistan, Lancaster6 would have to operate independently within the bounds of both international laws regarding mercenaries and the country’s own complex rules for foreign military contractors. In 2010, Afghanistan’s then-President Hamid Karazi oversaw the institution of major restrictions on private military companies in the country after accusing these organizations of undermining his government. One of the firms that had to shut down its operations was Erik Prince’s Xe, a rebranding of his infamous outfit Blackwater. The T-Bird can be loaded heavily with rudimentary or advanced weapons. , LASA Engineering In place of these companies, Afghan authorities established the Afghan Public Protection Force , a sort of dubious public-private partnership that nevertheless became a critical guard force for NATO-run facilities across the country. In 2014, Karzai disbanded this group, possibly because he felt it had become disloyal to him, in favor of a new Facilities Protection Force . Karzai’s successor Ashraf Ghani inherited this arrangement and seems equally wary of foreign private military firms. “President Ghani has told me he won’t accept it,” Ronald Neumann, who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan between 2005 and 2007 and is now President of the American Academy of Diplomacy, told Military Times . “Afghans will never accept this.” Members of the Afghan Public Protection Force., APPF From what we can tell, Lancaster6 itself might not be the best company to change the minds of anyone in Afghanistan’s government, either. Prince’s own relationship to the firm is unclear, but its CEO, according to LinkedIn , is Christiaan Durrant. Durrant used to be head of operations and aviation for Prince’s Chinese-funded Frontier Services Group. The Intercept and War Is Boring have reported that Prince, via FSG, has attempted to or succeeded in providing dubiously legal private military services in Libya , South Sudan , and Nigeria . Prince himself may be the subject of at least one U.S. government investigation. Prince and Durrant are also connected to a complex and dubiously legal plan to modify a number of Thursh crop dusters into armed aircraft as part of those deals, which ultimately moved from Austria to Bulgaria after running afoul of the former’s arms export control laws. Those aircraft became the T-Bird , one of the plane’s Prince included in his proposed air wing package. The LASA Engineering T-Bird., LASA Engineering Even if the politics and legal issues were to get smoothed over, there’s just the simple matter of how much the deal would cost and who would end up paying for it. As already noted, the U.S. military remains committed to plans to improve Afghanistan’s ability to operate its own Air Force. “It cannot be cheaper [than support from existing coalition forces],” Neumann told Military Times said. “This idea that it is somehow cheaper is ridiculous. Any force is going to have the same [support and logistical] requirements.” If Afghanistan and the United States were to proceed with the existing and equally fraught Afghan Aviation Transition Plan , as well as Erik Prince’s proposal, the government in Kabul and its partners could effectively find themselves ultimately getting one air arm for the price of two. It’s hard to imagine this would be attractive to the United States and its allies who have already spent hundreds of billions of dollars on a conflict seemingly without end and continue to largely underwrite Afghanistan’s military. American and Afghan personnel stand in front of an An-26 ahead of the type’s retirement from the Afghan Air Force in 2010., USAF There is always the possibility that Prince and his partners may be able to use their political influence with Donald Trump and members of his administration to advance his proposal. Trump has reportedly been furious with the state of the war in Afghanistan and the general lack of “winning” to the point that he might be considering firing General Nicholson. Trump also appears to have bought into the possibility that there might be a way to take advantage of the country’s vast and largely untapped mineral resources to help cover or even recoup some of the costs of the conflict. The U.S. government and its allies explored this possibility in detail, even having the U.S. military take part in extensive aerial surveys , between the late 2000s and early 2010s, funneling significant development aid into Afghanistan’s gemstone, marble , and limestone industries in particular. Security concerns, corruption, and limited existing infrastructure meant it was exceedingly difficult to convince foreign companies to take part in the projects in the past and the situation doesn’t look any more promising now. In its latest quarterly report , published in July 2017, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a top federal watchdog, highlighted a more than 20 percent increase in security incidents amid a broad decline in the country’s gross domestic product. What the war in Afghanistan really needs desperately is a coherent strategy that clearly explains what winning looks like and how the country gets there. From the available information, Prince’s private air force plan does not help answer either of those critical questions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 28, 2018",Boeing Made A Six Minute Long Cartoon About Re-Engining the B-52,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has launched a new push to promote a potential U.S. Air Force plan to re-engine its aging, but nevertheless very active fleet of B-52H Stratofortresses. New turbofans could significantly increase the bomber’s range and loiter capabilities, while reducing the overall cost per flight hours to operate the Cold War-era aircraft, but there have long been questions about where the money would come from and the overall complexities of such a conversion program. On August 2, 2017, Boeing posted a slickly produced animated video to its YouTube channel outlining the various benefits. The nearly six minute long pitch contains information from five other, shorter clips on the company’s main B-52 website. “Not only are new engines necessary, they will provide enormous economic benefits, creating billions of dollars of savings in sustainment and fuel over the remaining life of the aircraft,” the narrator explains. “Due to improvements in engine technology, a new engine installed today would not need to be overhauled ever for the projected life of the B-52.” Boeing does not specify any particular engine in its presentation, but says that installing a modern type – almost assuredly a high-bypass turbofan of some kind – would give the B-52 40 percent more flying time with the same fuel load and that missions that presently require three tankers would only need two after the upgrades. In addition, the new jets would be quieter and more environmentally friendly over the existing Pratt & Whitney TF33, which have powered the H-models since they first entered service in 1961. The TF33/JT3D design has been out of production for decades and the Air Force has had to develop its own specific shop at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma to keep them going. With no ready supply of new spare parts, the basic costs associated with both routine and more serious maintenance have grown exponentially over the years. According to Boeing, in 1996, it cost the Air Force $230,000 to overhaul just one of the engines. By 2016, it was approximately $2 million to rebuild the TF33s, which occurs at least once every 6,000 flight hours as a rule. All of this contributes to the cost for the Air Force to fly the B-52s, which is estimated to be more than $70,000 per flight hour, making it one the most expensive planes the service operates. A TF33 arrives at Tinker Air Force Base for an overhaul., USAF Though the Air Force has most recently been looking at a replacement scheme on and off since at least 2014 , the issue came back into the public eye after a B-52 lost an engine in mid-air in January 2017. As The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway wrote at the time, it was as if “the iconic bomber is literally begging for new engines,” adding: The last time the USAF researched what it would need out of an engine program was 2014, when it concluded that new powerplants would need to save between 10-25% in fuel consumption, and would have to go 15-25 years before the first deep overhauls of the engines are required. The question of which engine would best fit this requirement remains, as well as whether four large engines or eight smaller ones (even six, under some concepts) would be best. One area of concern is if new pylons would be needed to accommodate powerplants mounted in new locations under the BUFF’s wings. Such a requirement could result in a costly re-engineering of the B-52’s wings. With four larger engines, such as GE’s CF6 (called the F138 on the C-5M) or engines similar in size to the Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (the F117, in use aboard the C-17A) wing height and rudder authority for engine-out operations remain a question. As as result, costly flight control and avionics upgrades might be needed to accommodate their use, beyond the need for potential structural upgrades to the B-52’s wings. With this in mind, probably the easiest option is eight compact high-bypass turbofans fitted to the aircraft’s existing pylons in re-contoured dual-nacelle pods. The Rolls Royce BR725 powering the Gulfstream 650 is one contender, as is GE’s Passport 20 found on the Global Express 7000 and 8000. If the Air Force decides to push forward with an official RFP for an engine swap on the B-52, other entrants will surely emerge. The alternative to a new engine would be a more substantial rebuild program for the existing TF33s, which Pratt and Whitney has unsurprisingly been pushing for itself . However, Boeing specifically challenges the practicality of that plan in its video overview, suggesting that the cost savings would be minimal and likely wouldn’t address the fundamental obsolescence of the older powerplant’s existing design. A row of TF33s at Tinker., USAF Though it doesn’t make engines, the Chicago-based plane maker has a clear incentive to advocate for a more significant upgrade package. One benefit of an uprated TF33 would be that it might not require significant modifications to the B-52’s engine pods or the pylons. As such, any such project might not ultimately involve Boeing. An entirely new jet engine could easily come along with a new mounting arrangement, letting Boeing tag-team with the engine-maker and share in the windfall of adding the powerplants to the Air Force’s 76 remaining B-52Hs. If the new configuration still includes eight separate turbofans, it would amount to more than 600 engines at least. The Air Force would definitely want spares on hand, as well. Even if the upgraded bombers only had four engines, this would be at least more than 300 units, plus additional ones in reserve. Whatever the case, there would be big money involved in any such project. Of course, the Air Force has yet to make a decision on how it wants to proceed. It has long complained that budget cuts have limited its option for re-engining the B-52s. As a result, the service has suggested it could use a complicated public-private partnership, whereby whatever contractor or contractors they ultimately hire to do the work, whatever it entails, get “paid” out of funding freed up by the eventual cost savings. Such a mechanism could make the otherwise more expensive option of buying new engines more attractive since the up front would be relatively low. In its budget request for the 2018 fiscal year, the service did include $10 million for a risk-reduction study into the issue, which could finally get things moving forward. With the Air Force expecting the B-52s to serve for at least another three decades, as both a conventional force multiplier and an important component of the country’s nuclear deterrent, its long been clear that something needs to be done about it’s dirty, gas-guzzling engines. We’ll have to wait and see whether Boeing’s arguments have any impact on the service’s final decision. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 17, 2020",U.S. Navy Stealthy Special Operations Boats Are Zooming Around the Middle East,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we at The War Zone have noted before, the U.S. Navy’s Special Warfare community has a keen interest in the bleeding edge of what technology has to offer, as do other American special operations forces. Still, the U.S. military can be tight-lipped about many of these systems, often declining to actively publicize their use or even their existence in some cases. So it was interesting to see U.S. Central Command recently highlight the Combatant Craft Assault (CCA), one of Naval Special Warfare Command’s family of specialized stealthy boats, on social media. On July 27, 2017, CENTCOM posted a picture of one of the craft reportedly sailing off the coast of the United Arab Emirates . U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, who is in charge of the command, which oversees American military activities in the Middle East and Central Asia, had apparently taken a staff ride along with other senior leaders on the boat during a trip to the region. The Tweet tagged the U.S. 5th Fleet, which has its headquarters in nearby Bahrain, as well as the Navy’s main account. However, it is more likely that the CCA was from a task force assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command Central, the top special operations element in the region. SOCCENT is known to have at least one task force dedicated to training and advising their counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council regional bloc, which includes Saudi Arabia , Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar , Bahrain, and Oman. These boats and their crews could be detached to a number of different elements, as well. In May 2017, another CCA, this time speeding along in the Gulf of Aqaba off the coast of Jordan, appeared in an official video showing scenes from the annual Eager Lion training exercise. From what little we know about the 41-foot long craft, technically known as the CCA Mk. 1, it is low-observable design with a composite material hull and a pair of high performance engines that could operate with a low likelihood of detection even close to shore. It is reportedly small enough that U.S. Air Force C-17s can air drop it directly into a given body of water, likely using an arrangement similar to the Maritime Craft Aerial Delivery System (MCADS) for the Naval Special Warfare community’s 36-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIB), which you can see in the video below. The Navy specifically purchased the CCAs for medium range missions to insert or extract special operators or to discreetly conduct coastal surveillance, according to one unclassified briefing . Side-folding panels at the rear of the boat may offer additional protection, but there are no obvious provisions for mounted weapons. These fixtures are built inside the boat’s clean outer mold-line or are retractable/removable when not in use to maintain the CCA’s stealthy shape. The crew and passengers would undoubtedly carry individual weapons for self-protection as well. Armed CCAs lead the way during a large scale training event during international exercise Eager Lion in Jordan., DoD Each craft has a sensor mast with what may be a small surface search radar, as well as an electro-optical sensor turret with day- and night-vision capabilities. One unclassified 2014 technical report says that at least some of the boats had a satellite communications antenna flush in the top of the bow. A low-quality composite image showing the CCA’s bow antenna uncovered., Via The Applied Research Laboratory, PennState The Navy received the first of these craft from United States Marine, Inc. sometime between 2012 and 2013, though development had started as early as 2010. Production continued until 2014 and the CCA was only expected to reach full operational capability during the 2017 fiscal year. At present, the craft are split between Special Boat Teams 12 and 20, situated at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia respectively. Lockheed Martin has taken over responsibility for maintaining and otherwise supporting CCAs. But it’s clear some of them are zipping around the Middle East. Within the often cramped confines of many of the region’s waterways, this makes perfect sense. During any hypothetical conflict with a country bordering the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Aqaba – Iran is probably the most obvious example – American special operations forces would likely have the job of scouting and raiding ashore in support of amphibious landings or other larger conventional operations. The Iranians are already acutely aware of this possibility, using their network of small islands in the Persian Gulf as bases to patrol and otherwise monitor the water way in case of potential attacks. They may have even mistook a pair of Riverine Command Boats from the U.S. 5th Fleet’s Commander, Task Force 56 for just such a commando operation during a contentious international incident in 2016. After detaining the American sailors, members of the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps reportedly demanded to know where the Navy’s “mother ship” was, apparently believing that this was part of a larger infiltration operation. USN This incident showed exactly why a stealth boat like the CCA would be essential for SEALs moving in and out of defended shorelines with a reduced chance of detection. There might be a mother ship in those scenarios, as well. Given that it could launch and recover RHIBs, it is very possible that a Navy sea base, like USS Ponce could accommodate the CCA. According the annual review from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, the service’s huge new Expeditionary Mobile Bases can do so for sure . One of these, USNS Lewis B. “Chesty” Puller , left the United States to take over for Ponce in June 2017. Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewman (SWCCs), who crew these spec ops boats, are seen in a CCA boarding the amphibious transport dock USS Carter Hall through its well deck., USN The Navy could also deploy the larger, but still stealthy Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) and Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) types to the region to support such activities in the event of a crisis. Boutique ship builder Oregon Iron Works, now known as Vigor Works , began building both of these types in the early 2010s, finishing the first prototypes circa 2013. The CCM is larger, with a hull approximately 60 feet long and an enclosed crew space, but it appears to have a very similar sensor and communications configuration to the smaller CCA. One of the Navy’s CCM’s., USN Some available photographs do show the CCM with a twin .50 caliber machine gun mount at the rear and there are reports that it can accommodate a remote weapon station. This would make sense since the craft is a partial replacement for the older Mk. V Special Operations Craft, which had a number of fixed weapon mounts. A CCA, in the foreground, and a CCM sail together., USN Unlike the larger Mk. V, however, the CCM can fit inside a C-17. The Vigor Works craft is also a partial replacement for the RHIB, which had previously filled the CCM role. However, the RHIB has its own advantages, including being air drop capable from a C-130. A Mk. V Special Operations Craft launches a Scan Eagle drone., USN The CCH, also known as the SEAL Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization craft, or SEALION, is a significantly larger and more capable boat. The fully-enclosed, semi-submersible vessel has retractable sensor and communications masts and provision for jet skis, inflatable rubber raiding craft, and diving equipment. Special operators would exit through a large door in the rear. The Navy presently has two CCH types, the initial SEALION-I, essentially a prototype derived from an earlier design known as the Alligator , and the enhanced SEALION-II, which has the same overall shape. On June 2, 2017, U.S. Special Operations Command awarded Vigor a contract work more than $17 million for another craft, called SEALION-III . The SEALION-II CCH, readily identifiable by two windows on the side of the hull instead of one on the SEALION-I., USN During the contracting process, SOCOM did investigate five other potential designs, though it redacted the vendors’ names from official documents. One of these may have been M Ship Company’s M80 Stiletto , another uniquely shaped stealth boat. As of 2016, the Naval Special Warfare Combatant Craft Division out at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock, which previously handled development of the CCM and CCH, was still experimenting with an M80 in a variety of roles with help of Naval Special Warfare Group 10. SOCOM Ultimately, the command decided to sole-source the SEALION-III project to Vigor, citing its extensive knowledge of the existing craft and requirements. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the M80 or other designs might not have a future in the Naval Special Warfare community. After 2020, it is very likely that the Navy will want to begin updating its fleet of special operations stealth boats. There are already plans to begin production of a CCA Mk. 2, which could be an upgrade of the existing type or a new boat altogether, in 2020. The M80 would be too big for that requirement, but SEALs and Special Boat Team personnel might be interested in other emerging designs, such as the fully submersible HyperSub . We’ll be keeping our eyes open for more sightings of the existing the Navy’s existing stealthy combatant craft or new prototypes, either abroad or at home.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump already has something of a contentious relationship with plans to acquire a fleet of new presidential aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, as well as the primary contractor for the replacement planes, Boeing. He famously Tweeted out that the project’s “costs are out of control” and subsequently pledged to seek a better deal as only he supposedly could. But with the complex requirements largely non-negotiable, the U.S. Air Force has found perhaps the only realistic way to cut costs—by buying abandoned airliners on the cheap before converting them into the most advanced VIP transport in the world. Defense One’s Marcus Weinberger got the scoop that the Air Force was finishing up the paperwork to buy a pair of 747-8i aircraft sitting in storage out at the Southern California Logistics Airport , which contains an expansive commercial boneyard in the Mojave Desert. Neither the service nor Boeing would say how much the used planes cost, but it seems guaranteed that the final price will be less than that of a new one, which is more than $380 million. “We’re working through the final stages of coordination to purchase two commercial 747-8 aircraft and expect to award a contract soon,” Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokesperson, told Defense One. “We’re still working toward a deal to provide two 747-8s to the Air Force – this deal is focused on providing a great value for the Air Force and the best price for the taxpayer,” Caroline Hutcheson, a Boeing spokesperson added in a separate statement. One of the two existing VC-25A “Air Force One” aircraft., USAF In a somewhat amusing twist of fate, Russian airline Transaero signed a deal to buy four 747-8is in 2013. When that firm went bankrupt two years later – likely at least in part an indirect result of the international outcry over the Kremlin’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region – two of the planes were already complete. Aeroflot , Russia’s flag carrier, grabbed most of the abandoned fleet in a state-sponsored buyout, but declined to buy the especially expensive to operate 747s. Boeing has been trying to find a buyer ever since. Getting taxpayers the best deal should always be an important consideration, but it’s especially important in this case since Trump has made the cost of the Air Force One replacements such a public issue. When The Donald took to social media to decry the state of the program in December 2016, the final price tag was an estimated $3-4 billion dollars for a pair of jets to replace the existing pair of VC-25A “Air Force Ones,” plus various ancillary costs. The VC-25s, also based on the 747-200 airliner, have been in service since the 1990s, though they have received significant modifications over the years. The Air Force has been actively looking for new jets to fill this unique role since at least 2009. As The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway wrote after Trump’s Tweet, there were good reasons to replace these planes and for what the new aircraft would cost so much: Trump seems to balk at the cost of replacing the two VC-25As—aircraft that are approaching 30 years of service – which Trump says is around $4 billion.That figure seems to be a fairly accurate estimate , though his number is on the higher end of the estimate spectrum. A single 747-8i – which these new Presidential airlift aircraft will be based on—costs around $365 million from Boeing. But we’re not talking about the average crying baby hauler here. Pressed into Air Force service, these new aircraft will require a massive amount of systems integration work to be able to handle the job of Air Force One. This includes adapting them to host the most advanced flying communications suite there is, and making them hardened against the electromagnetic pulses given off by exploding nuclear weapons. It will also include building in and testing aerial refueling capabilities, lots of power generation, and integrating a self defense suite made up of the most complex constellation of missile countermeasures found on any aircraft in the world. Not just that, but the aircraft will also be subject to an avalanche of specific requirements, many from emanating from disparate agencies, which will all have to be folded into a single design that will only be replicated two or three times. Finally, the design has to take future expansion and upgradability into account at every turn – an expensive task upfront aimed at saving money down the road. In other words, this is tough and expensive work that has America’s national security relying on it. If Air Force One cannot act as a reliable flying command center, even during a nuclear exchange, the credibility of America’s nuclear deterrent erodes. Rogoway listed a number of ways Trump could have gotten away with canceling the program, including flying less overall, using less capable planes when possible, or even shifting some of the burden to the E-4B Nightwatch airborne command posts. Alternatively, Trump could have decided to go with a different, cheaper airframe altogether as the starting point. President Donald Trump onboard the current VC-25A “Air Force One.”, AP But choosing a different plane could have brought along all new problems and associated costs as designers would have to figure out how to get all the necessary systems into an entirely new package. There wouldn’t necessarily be any existing knowledge base for the extensive upgrades the aircraft itself would need, including hardening it against nuclear blasts and other attacks, both physical and otherwise . In the end, any overall savings from choosing a new plane as the starting point would likely have been relatively small by U.S. government standards. The cost of buying new 747-8is, as was the original plan, would have accounted for less than a $1 billion out of the project’s overall estimated price, somewhere between less than a third and less than a quarter of the final bill. However, as Rogoway ultimately noted, Trump had caged himself in with the “optics” of his statements: Trump could execute any of the options above; but even if it makes the best financial sense to move forward with the Air Force One replacement program as is, doing so would be a missed opportunity to show the world that Trump can do better. If we’ve learned anything it’s that Trump wants to send the message that he can squeeze a better deal out of anyone and everyone, including Boeing. So with just a little restructuring of the program here and there – and some dollars thrown Boeing’s way for other projects – Trump could potentially announce that he fixed the problem. In choosing the second-hand 747s, the Trump administration solves a number of issues at once. It keeps the program on track, largely unchanged, using an airframe similar to the existing VC-25As, which will help keep many costs down as the Air Force finalizes the design. More importantly, it gives Trump himself a “win” where he can say he made a promise to the American people and followed through on saving them money. So, while this will probably have a very small impact on what the future Air Force One looks like in the end, and may only trim a relatively minor part of the replacement program’s final cost, it seems likely that we will be hearing about this deal a lot in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",USAF’s Reboot Of Its Huge International Air Mobility Exercise Has Begun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. military’s greatest strengths is its ability to rapidly move personnel, equipment, and supplies anywhere they might need to go. Airlift is a critical part of that power projection capability and now the U.S. Air Force has kicked off the inaugural iteration of its new premier training exercise , Mobility Guardian, along with nearly two dozen allies. The event is a more operationally focused replacement for a long-standing tradition of air mobility competitions between American and foreign partners. On July 31, 2017, approximately 3,000 American personnel, along with more than 650 members of foreign military forces, began the drills at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) in Washington State. According to Air Mobility Command (AMC), which is leading the event, the nearly two weeks of drills will focus on its four “core competencies” of airlift, air refueling , aeromedical evacuation, and air mobility support. “We’re creating an exercise that will encompass everything AMC does,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, the director of Mobility Guardian, explained. “We basically took every skill set from AMC and said, ‘what would the ideal exercise for each of our different mission sets look like?’ Then we combined them all into one.” The Air Force’s airlift and aerial refueling units have been especially busy in recent years, supporting expeditionary operations against ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria . The service’s tankers have offloaded fuel into both American and other coalition warplanes, while personnel on the ground have ferried other forces, along with critical gear and supplies, around an ever expanding network of more established bases and remote forward sites . A Royal Air Force Voyager aircraft touches down at JBLM ahead of Mobility Guardian 2017., USAF In addition, similar missions continue to be important for continuing operations in Afghanistan , including a recent surge in airstrikes in support of Afghan forces and the U.S.-led coalition in the country. In Africa, a host of counter-terrorism missions and associated facilities likely could not function without Air Force support. On top of that, other units elsewhere in the world have been essential to an increasing schedule of training exercises and other events, including those aimed at deterring Russian aggression in Europe , responding to North Korean provocations , and promoting freedom of navigation in South China Sea and East Sea . The U.S. military has similar commitments in Latin America and Africa that require regular airlift support . A South Korean Air Force C-130H Hercules arrives for Mobility Guardian 2017., USAF In many of these instances, the Air Force works directly with foreign partners either in the air or on the ground. The service’s personnel are often situated at allied bases in host countries, requiring regular and smooth interactions to make sure missions occur on schedule. In some cases, the airlift and tanker support go straight to foreign forces or international missions, including those run by the United Nations and the Africa Union, where the United States may not otherwise be an active participant. “I have not deployed anywhere or gone anywhere in my duty as an airlift pilot where there was not an international presence,” Air Force Colonel Clinton Zumbrunnen, who is coordinating the international observers , said. So it’s imperative that AMC’s units not only be on top of their own skill sets, but that they also be able to work closely with allied elements that may speak different languages or have different standard operating procedures. At least 10 countries – Australia , Belgium, Brazil , Canada, Colombia , France , New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom – are full participants that the Air Force has worked directly into the exercise plans and many of them have brought their own aircraft. Other countries have sent observers who will team up with American personnel during the drills to learn how U.S. personnel perform their missions. USAF The Air Force appears to have designed Mobility Guardian specifically to focus on these information exchanges through a series of realistic and complex scenarios. There will be at least one formation flight with aircraft from the United States, Brazil, and Colombia. Other events will require operating at night with night vision goggles or flying at low levels. The actual training will touch on everything from combat operations to disaster relief. Perhaps most notably, members of the so-called “Five Eyes” – the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand – will conduct a mock “ forcible entry ,” which will involve air drops and air landings to deliver personnel and equipment into a “semi-contested” area with a simulated enemy presence. U.S. Army airborne units – possibly including the Alaska-based 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division and special operations forces situated on the West Coast – will support this and other phases of the exercise. U.S. Army troops load a Stryker armored vehicle onto an RAF Atlas transport during a pre-exercise event at JBLM in May 2017., USAF “We’re pushing the tactical edge,” Air Force Major Thomas Rich, who is serving as the director of operations for the Mobility Guardian exercise task force, told the service’s reporters. “We’re putting aircraft from different nations close together in a tight air space in a dynamic threat environment. There’s a little bit of inherent risk in that, but that’s what we want to do here so that everybody is ready when we do it for real.” Mobility Guardian is new, but is also a direct evolution of previous drills dating back to the 1950s. However, these were largely organized as competitions, first among Air Force units themselves, and then with foreign partners, as well. This ultimately evolved into the Air Mobility Rodeo in 2005, which was a biennial event. However, AMC had not organized one of the gatherings since 2011. U.S. Air Force personnel help unload cargo from a Belgian C-130H Hercules in preparation for Mobility Guardian 2017., USAF In 2013, due to budget cuts and operational demands , the Air Force scrapped the Rodeo for that year. Two years later, the same issues forced the service to cancel the exercise again . The service’s plan for Mobility Guardian plan was to integrate more realistic scenarios rather than simply have competitive events in order give participants an experience more focused on their actual training needs. This way the Air Force could continue the tradition, but not take personnel away from performing or actively preparing for their core missions. Like the previous Air Mobility Rodeo, the hope is that Mobility Guardian will be a biennial event. Whether or not the event will continue to grow is unclear. The new exercise is already larger in scale than the previous Rodeos and involves hundreds more personnel. “Mobility Airmen are often the first to arrive and the last to depart,” U.S. Air Force General Carlton Everhart II, head of AMC, said ahead of the start of the exercise. “Exercising our capabilities together is critical so when we are called upon, we can deliver quickly and precisely.” Mobility Guardian looks set to be an important part of making sure AMC and its partners can perform their missions seamlessly where ever and when ever necessary.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the third such successful strike on warships belonging to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen since the beginning of 2017, Houthi rebel recently attacked an unknown vessel of the United Arab Emirates’ Navy . Beyond this most basic detail, however, both sides have released wildly different and equally unconfirmed statements regarding the incident. On July 29, 2017, pro-Houthi forces, referring themselves as the “Yemeni Navy,” released a statement taking responsibility for the attack, which they said occurred in the Red Sea off the coast of the port city of Mocha, Yemen. According to an English-language report from the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency the next day, the insurgents killed 12 UAE personnel, wounded another 23, and damaged a nearby minesweeper at the same time. There was no information about the method of attack. “The targeted warship was heavily loaded with weapons and ammunitions and that the ship went into a series of explosions … after [which] aircrafts helped extinguished the flames,” an unnamed Houthi-aligned official told SABA. “The injured were airlifted to the Eritrean port city of Assab for treatment.” On July 30, 2017, Iran’s PressTV carried another report , citing an unnamed Yemeni military source, that said “dozens” of Emirati troops had died and two dozen had suffered injuries in what it described as a “missile attack” on an unspecified “frigate.” The other details from the Iranian outlet were the same as those in the Houthi statement. Chinese state media outlet Xinhua’s English story on the incident said “ rockets ” were responsible for the damage, though this could have been a simply translation error. A UAE Navy Baynunah -class corvette., Mztourist via Wikimedia The UAE’s Navy operates a number of corvette-type ships, a category that some refer to as frigates. The largest of these are Italian-made Abu Dhabi -class , which displace 1,650 tons and are armed with Exocet anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, a 76mm main gun, and other smaller weapons. The Emiratis also have six Baynunah -class and two Muray Jib -class types, both of which are smaller and displace less than 1,000 tons. All three types have space for a single light helicopter on their rear deck. This could help explain other reports that the ship was “ carrying helicopters ” during the attack. It would also support descriptions of helicopter activity after the incident, though it wouldn’t confirm the exact reasons they were airborne. If the reports about a accompanying mine hunter receiving damage are true, this may have been one of the UAE’s two ex-German Frankenthal -class ships . This vessel could have belonged to another coalition member, such as Saudi Arabia, as well. The presence of a mine-hunting ship points to the increasing importance of these weapons in the Houthi arsenal, an recently emerging threat that The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway has previously examined in detail . Whatever ships were involved in the attack, the Saudi-led coalition’s official description of the attack is almost completely at odds with the statements from Houthi-aligned sources. Al Jazeera, citing a Saudi Press Agency report, said that the rebels had actually employed a remote-control boat laden with explosives to strike a group of ships sitting pier side in Mocha’s port. According to Saudi officials there were no casualties or significant damage at all on the ships. A Frankenthal -class mine hunter in German service., Thomas Glapa vi Wikimedia This dissonance in the stories is striking, but not necessarily surprising. The Houthis and their allies, including both former members of the Yemeni military and Iran, have been engaged a brutal conflict with the Saudi-led coalition for more than two years now. There continues to be significant fighting in many parts of the country, including in the vicinity of Mocha. Just over the weekend Saudi-backed Yemeni forces reportedly retook control of the Khalid Ibn al-Walid military base, also situated near the country’s western coastline, while pro-Houthi forces launched an attack on the city of Taiz, approximately 50 miles east of Mocha. At the same time, both sides often accuse the other of human rights abuses and deny similar reports leveled at their own forces. Independent reporting has become increasingly difficult to come by as Saudi authorities have made it difficult for journalists to get into the country, even to the point of blocking United Nations aid flights carrying reporters . A similar conflict in reports surrounded a strike on another UAE warship exiting the Mocha port in June 2017. The Houthis said that attack, which the group said involved a land-based anti-ship missile, severely damaged the Emirati vessel. Afterwards, the Saudi-led coalition again confirmed the attack, but denied there was any significant damage, saying that only a single sailor had received unspecified injuries. Six months earlier, Houthi forces had attacked the Saudi frigate Al Madinah in the Red Sea near the port city of Hodeidah, some 100 miles north of Mocha. In that case, the rebels again claimed they had fired a missile at the warship. Saudi Arabia acknowledged a number of casualties, including two fatalities, in what it described as a swarm attack by three suicide boats. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Nug3OJhVAto The U.S. Navy later claimed this had been the result of a remote-controlled explosive-filled boat . Video later emerged showing a small craft slamming into the side of the frigate, but it was difficult to tell if there was anyone on board or not. American officials suggested that the equipment needed to turn the boat into a deadly drone, as well as the explosive payload, might have come from Iran, which the United States had already been connected to other illicit arms shipments bound for the Houthis. If this July 2017 attack involved another unmanned craft, its possible the necessary gear could have come from the same source. Regardless, these incidents followed a spate of confirmed anti-ship missile attacks on Saudi-coalition warships, as well as U.S. Navy ships in the area, in late 2016. One of these attacks notably destroyed the ex- Swift , a high-speed catamaran transport vessel the UAE had obtained after she left American service. Greek ferry operator SEAJETS later purchased the remnants of the ship and towed it to a shipyard in the city of Eleusis. Again, it was unclear whether the missiles involved in any of these attacks came from foreign sources, such as Iran, or from former Yemeni military stocks . https://youtube.com/watch?v=WTNeEYlO3Iw At the same time, civilian merchant ships in the area have also run the risk of getting caught up in the fighting. “We cannot rule out the possibility of Huthis [sic] attacking commercial shipping,” the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) noted in one infographic dated Oct. 10, 2016, a heavily redacted copy of which we obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. However, prior to the end of October 2016, “one of the largest war risk insurance associations in the world reported to its clients it had no information indicating merchant vessels were being targeted by Huthi [sic] rebels,” according to another heavily censored ONI report from December 2016 that we also received through FOIA. “It noted that collateral damage could occur, but considered this highly likely.” That same insurance associated, which the Navy did not name in the unredacted portions of its report, but could have been Lloyd’s of London , changed its threat level for commercial shipping in the region from moderate to high following a reported attack on the Galacia Spirit , a liquid natural gas tanker belonging to Norwegian firm Teekay Petrojarl. A subsequent report on that incident suggested that the premature detonation of explosives on the boat had ended the attack. The USS Mason, which was the target of multiple Houthi missile attacks in 2016, sails somewhere in the Middle East that year., USN “Starting in early October 2016, there have been a series of report attacks and advisories issue to the commercial maritime industry,” ONI’s December 2016 report continued. “With regard to the reported attacks, the intention is not to confirm or deny whether specific events occurred, but to report what information the industry received about the events, which likely drive its perception of threat,” the naval analysts added, underscoring the difficulty in obtaining clear details about incidents in the region. It is possible that rebels or other members of previous Yemeni regimes may be engaging in some form of piracy or other criminality, too. Earlier in July 2017, Bloomberg examined the case of the 2011 hijacking of the oil tanker Brillante Virtuoso , which pointed to former Yemeni security forces or mercenaries someone hired in the country being involved in what might have been more than one elaborate high seas insurance frauds. What is clear from all of these incidents is that the Houthis and their allies remain credible threats to military and commercial ships in and around Yemen’s coasts. In addition, they have a number of different weapons at their disposal, including anti-ship missiles, mines, and unmanned explosive boats, with which to launch these attacks. As the conflict in Yemen continue to be a brutal slog, it seems likely that the Houthi’s “navy,” will only continue to strike warships from the Saudi-led coalition, as well other vessels depending on their perceived affiliation, where and when it can.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2019",U.S. Special Operations Forces Want Their Own Light Attack Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is about to begin testing a number of light attack aircraft as part of an experimental assessment commonly known as OA-X .  At the same time, it appears that U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has been actively pushing the service for a project of its own , called Light Attack Support for Special Operations, or LASSO. On July 28, 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio announced the LASSO plan on the federal government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps. The notice said the center’s Fighter Bomber Directorate had teamed up with SOCOM to explore both light attack aircraft and associated technology specifically for special operations forces. The brief posting made clear that the first step would be simply to gather information on “emerging light attack platforms” and “platform-agnostic” systems, which is to say equipment that wouldn’t require any specific plane to accommodate it. SOCOM and its service components have long been interested in expanding their organic light attack capabilities, which presently including armed drones, fixed wing gunships, and specialized helicopters. As such, LASSO could potentially include readily reconfigurable designs with modular bays to accept different sensors or simply aircraft able to carry any of a number of multi-purpose pods able to carry day- and night vision cameras, radars, data links, and more. There are already a number of multi-functional stores available and in June 2017, the Air Force began flight testing its own design, known as AgilePod . Earlier in July 2017, it appeared that special operations forces had employed a contractor-flown modular surveillance aircraft during a training exercise , as well. A Colombian Air Force Super Tucano., USAF This broad requirement could apply to weapons configurations, too. In particular, the Air Force and SOCOM have been developing a number of small precision guided munitions , such as the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II laser-guided rocket , for both manned and unmanned aircraft. SOCOM has already fielded a common launch tube that can fire a number of missiles and stand-off glide munitions, including the popular AGM-176 Griffin and up-coming GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition (SGM), for various platforms. If successful, it seems likely that the LASSO project could one day be involved in more exotic weapons, such as lasers and other directed energy beams , as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PrsBPq6xj-k However, there were no formal requirements or a list of desired capabilities to go along with the statement, but there was a promise that this information would go out to interested parties in a “closed call process.” The Air Force was also quick to stress that this notice did not reflect any formal plan for it or SOCOM to ultimately buy any aircraft or gear. More importantly, “this effort is separate and distinct from the on-going Light Attack Experiment or any other Light Attack projects,” the notice explained. “This effort should not conflict with or be confused with any other Light Attack aircraft program or effort.” But while any special operations light attack fleet would undoubtedly be smaller than one within the U.S. Air Force proper, it seems hard to imagine that LASSO won’t be a competitor to the nebulous OA-X experiment at least to some degree. As of yet, the Air Force has yet to articulate any real goals or objectives for the test project, which has become formally known as the Capability Assessment of Non-Developmental Light Attack Platforms. Afghanistan Air Force A-29 Super Tucanos., USAF In addition, the service insists that there is no existing plan to turn results from the OA-X into a fully fledged “program of record” that would lead to purchases of actual aircraft. This is despite the service’s own repeated acknowledgements of the obvious benefits of a fleet of low-cost attackers for operations in permissive environments with very limited anti-aircraft threats, namely freeing up high performance tactical aircraft for more high-risk missions, well as a push in Congress to include money in the next defense budget that could cover the cost of dozens of planes. It seems almost guaranteed that OA-X and LASSO would end up evaluating many of the same technologies and exactly the same types of aircraft. At present, we know that the Air Force’s light attack experiment will evaluate three types , Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer’s A-29 Super Tucano, Air Tractor’s OA-802, along with Textron’s AT-6 Wolverine and Scorpion. Other similar planes on the market include IOMAX’s Archangel and L-3’s AT-802L, both of which are heavily modified agricultural designs like the OA-802, as well as the AC-208 Combat Caravan , an armed conversion of Cessna’s light utility aircraft. The U.S. military has already facilitated the delivery of the IOMAX and Cessna types, as well as Super Tucanos, to American allies abroad , including Afghanistan, Jordan, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates. And unlike the Air Force, SOCOM has been pushing hard for this capability for nearly a decade, beginning with a program known as Imminent Fury in the late 2000s. As part of that project, on behalf of SOCOM, the U.S. Navy leased an EMB-314 Super Tucano – the same plane SNC and Embraer now market as the A-29 – from a subsidiary of Blackwater Worldwide in 2008. The evaluation of this aircraft, possibly designated as the A-14A based on official U.S. military records, involved testing both its surveillance and light attack capabilities. The results of Imminent Fury informed a follow-on program known as Combat Dragon II, which resulting in the deployment of a pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Bronco aircraft to the Middle East in 2015. Again, the Navy, acting on behalf of SOCOM, cut a deal with NASA to borrow both aircraft for the field tests with the agreement that the service would return them to the civilian agency with significant upgrades after the evaluation period ended. While supporting special operations forces in Iraq, the pair of Bronco’s flew a total of 120 combat missions. Their primary weapon was the APKWS II rocket. Though the two aircraft reportedly had a very successful deployment , the Navy dutifully returned them to NASA afterwards. As of June 2017, the planes were still sitting in a hangar at the Langley Research Center in Virginia still wearing their gray tactical paint scheme and “black pony” art, an homage to the Navy’s storied Vietnam War OV-10 unit, Light Attack Squadron Four . It was unlikely that SOCOM would ever have considered actively adopting the aircraft, no matter how successful they proved to be, as the Bronco is long out of production. The decision to use the planes as the test platform seemed to be a matter of convenience more than anything else. In 2010, despite pleas from U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal, then in charge of the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan, Congress had blocked the initial plans to acquire more Super Tucanos for the Combat Dragon II program. Still, the project showed SOCOM’s continuing and active interest in the capability. As a result, if the Air Force itself continues to be lukewarm on OA-X, SOCOM could push for a significant piece of any funds Congress ultimately appropriates for light attack aircraft. The Air Force Special Operations Command would likely be the primary operator of any dedicated special operations fixed-wing light attack planes anyways. Whatever happens in the end, the U.S. military’s interest in light attack capabilities only appears to be growing and you can be sure we’ll continue following developments with OA-X, LASSO, and any other similar programs that emerge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 6, 2020",The B-52 Is About to Become a Much More Effective Psychological Operations Tool,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than half century of service, the U.S. Air Force’s B-52 bombers remain an iconic symbol of America’s military power, able to carry some of the most destructive weapons in existence. Now the service is looking to expand the plane’s arsenal even more in order to help it perform one of its less well known missions, psychological warfare. On July 25, 2017, the Air Force announced that a B-52H bomber from the 419th Flight Test Squadron had finished a series of test drops of the PDU-5/B. Though it might look like a cluster bomb at first glance, this dispenser actually holds tens of thousands of paper leaflets that, in an operational environment, might implore the enemy to abandon their cause or tell civilians to avoid certain areas. The PDU-5/B uses the same dispenser, called the SUU-76, as the CBU-100/B Rockeye II anti-tank cluster bomb. It functions the same way, too, with a fuze in the nose causing the canister’s shell to split open, releasing the payload inside. The easiest way to tell the two apart is by the PDU-5’s blue stripes, indicating an inert device. “We are primarily looking to see safe separation from the external Heavy Stores Adapter Beam,” Kevin Thorn, the B-52 air vehicle manager for the 419th, told the service’s reporters. “We are ensuring that the bombs do not contact the aircraft, and/or each other, creating an unsafe condition.” A B-52H from the 419th Flight Test Squadron drops a PDU-5/B during tests., USAF Each B-52 has a pair of “Heavy Stores Adapter Beams,” one under each wing, each of which can hold up to nine approved munitions, depending on their size and weight. During the tests, the Stratofortress only carried eight dispensers on the racks, leaving the center six-o’clock position empty. The actual test drops occurred over the Point Mugu Sea Test Range off the coast of California and on land at the Precision Impact Range Area at Edwards Air Force Base. The tests were reportedly successful, but there is no indication when B-52s might use the PDU-5s in an actual war zone. Earl Johnson, in charge of the program to integrate the bombs onto the BUFFs, said the next step would be making sure they functioned properly when the aircraft released them from i ts internal bomb bay. USAF It is possible the Air Force may want to get that testing done sooner rather than later so they can get loads of PDU-5s out to B-52s flying over Iraq and Syria . “Without the capability to carry PDU-5s on the B-52 aircraft, the impending shortfall on leaflet dispersal capability will jeopardize Air Force Central Command information operations,” Johnson explained. Despite being a very low-tech concept , leaflet drops are also relatively low cost and have been a regular component of coalition air operations against ISIS. Many of the leaflets warn civilians of impending strikes, telling them to flee to safety – something that unfortunately isn’t always an option , even if people are willing to abandon their homes in the first place. There’s always the problem of whether the target population will even be able to read them , too American aircraft notably dropped some of the paper notes ahead of a spectacular attack on trucks carrying ISIS oil near Abu Kamal, Iraq in November 2015. A-10 Warthogs and AC-130 gunships pummeled the site, destroying more than a hundred tankers. “We assessed that these trucks, while although they are being used for operations that support ISIL, the truck drivers, themselves, probably not members of ISIL,” U.S. Army Col. Steve Warren, then the top spokesman for the American task force leading the fight against ISIS, told reporters on Nov. 18, 2015, using another common acronym for the terrorist group. “They’re probably just civilians.” USAF via FOIA Not looking to deliberately kill innocent bystanders caught up in the conflict, American commanders chose to send them a literal message. The leaflets, copies of which I later obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, told them to get away quick. “Airstrikes are coming, oil trucks will be destroyed. Get away from your oil trucks immediately. Do not risk your life,” one side said. “Oil trucks are being destroyed because buying this oil is the lifeblood of Da’ish. Leave the trucks and flee,” the other side added, using another term for ISIS. Ahead of similar strikes against hundreds more tankers and other oil infrastructure in neighboring Syria, U.S. aircraft dropped more leaflets with similar messages. “The Coalition Forces will continue to attack all Da’ish controlled oil facilities until Da’ish is defeated,” one declared. USAF via FOIA Separately in 2015, American forces dropped much more graphic missives in Syria, according to a report by The Washington Post . One showed terrorists feeding young men into a meat grinder, an allegory ISIS’ leadership blindly throwing them to their death in a hopeless struggle against the United States and its allies. A very graphic leaflet depicting ISIS feeding new recruits into a meat grinder., CENTCOM via The Washington Post We don’t know what aircraft actually dropped the leaflets in these instances, or whether they used PDU-5s in each case. The U.S. military also has the capability to use helicopters and low-flying cargo aircraft to drop cardboard boxes full of messages in low-risk environments. According to an official U.S. Central Command regulation covering “Military Information Support Operations,” or MISO, another term for psychological warfare, the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar would process each request for a leaflet drop involving fixed wing aircraft and determine what method would be most appropriate. We obtained a copy of this document via FOIA. A sailor packs rolls of leaflets into a PDU-5/B on board the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz ., USN After that, the information would go out to either a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier operating in the region, each of which has the facilities to print and pack leaflets independently, or to the land-based Joint Information Support Task Force (Special Operations), which is part of Special Operations Command Central . The special operations forces personnel would then provide leaflets to Air Force units who would pack them for the final drop over the target area. Now, B-52 bombers have been flying sorties against the terrorist group from Al Udeid since April 2016. One official video clip, seen below, confirms that the aircraft have been adding to these psychological missions already, but using much older M129E1 or E2 leaflet bombs. Dating back to the 1960s, these dispensers can only hold 30,000 leaflets each. More importantly, the Cold War-era M129s are long out of production. Originally intended primarily for high performance multi-role fighter aircraft like the F-16, F-15E Strike Eagle, and F/A-18 Hornet, the PDU-5 will eventually become the only leaflet bomb in U.S. inventory. So it makes perfect sense to add the PDU-5 to the B-52’s arsenal in order to help ease the burden on those fast flying aircraft and free them up for more strike and close air support missions that require their ability to respond at high speed. Compared to tactical fixed wing aircraft, the BUFFs could carry the weapons to much more distant or remote target areas without the same need for extra fuel , too. The B-52s can simply lug significantly more payload, overall, as well. A full load of 16 PDU-5s on the wing racks alone would contain nearly a million leaflets, which could cover a wide array or multiple distinct zones in a single flight. With a leaflet bombs in its internal bay and GPS-guided Joint Direct Munitions out on the wings, the lumbering BUFFs might even be able to perform psychological missions and remain on station for actual kinetic attacks all in the same sortie. So if you see what looks like cluster bombs under the wings of B-52s in the Middle East any time soon, make sure to look for the blue bands first. What you might have is a bomber headed out on a psychological warfare mission with the newest “weapon” in its arsenal. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 9, 2019",It Looks Very Likely That North Korea’s New ICBM Can Reach The West Coast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has tested its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which appeared to land somewhere in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the East Sea. The launch is the latest for the reclusive regime since it demonstrated the Hwasong-14 for the first time on July 4th, 2017. It likely involved either that same missile type or a derivative thereof. If initial estimates are correct, the weapon can hit the continental United States, able to reach at least west coast and possibly beyond. The U.S. military confirmed the launch and that it involved an ICBM, but did not specify what type. The North Koreans fired the missile from the remote Mup’yong-ni in the country’s Janjang province. The missile flew for approximately 45 minutes before crashing into the sea some 600 miles from the launch site. “We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment,” U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement. “The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.” However, this latter portion of the statement likely referred only to this specific launch. The missile’s apogee was reportedly nearly 2,300 miles, more than 300 miles higher than in the July 4 test. With that information, subsequent independent estimates put the weapon’s range at more than 6,000 miles with a payload weight sufficient to accommodate a nuclear weapon. With that range, it isn’t just Alaska, Hawaii, or even California that could be under threat. It could mean the North Koreans could launch an attack right into the middle of the continental United States. Although they would need a warhead and miniaturized nuclear device capable of surviving reentry to do so. After the first Hwasong-14 test, experts had already speculated that the North Koreans had yet to demonstrate the missile’s full capabilities. So it is unclear whether or not this is just a more strenuous test of that design or a significant modification based on it. Regardless, it is a significant achievement that is likely to both anger and spook the United States and its East Asian allies. After the launch, both the Japanese and South Korean governments did say they would convene emergency meetings of their national security staffs. “I have received information that North Korea once again conducted a missile firing,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters . “We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people.” North Korean premier Kim Jong-un celebrates after the success of an earlier missile test., KCNA As the missile came down inside Japan’s EEZ, it initially looked as if the test might have a been a protest to very recent Japanese sanctions against North Korean individuals and entities. Earlier on July 28, 2017, the country’s cabinet reportedly agreed to implement new restrictions on nine people and five companies, including two Chinese firms, the Bank of Dandong and Dalian Global Unity Shipping. The United States had already sanctioned both of these organizations, among others, in response to North Korean missile activity in June 2017 . Initial reports even incorrectly suggest that the missile had landed inside Japanese territorial waters, within 12 miles of the shore. Though the country claims exclusive rights to natural resources within its EEZ, which extends out 200 miles from the coast, the area still qualifies as international waters. Still, “North Korea’s repeated provocative acts absolutely cannot be accepted,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declared. However, this would not be the first time North Korean missiles have fallen into this zone. In May 2017, North Korea fired a barrage of much shorter range Scud-type ballistic missiles, three of which came down in Japan’s EEZ near the Oki Islands. This and other missile tests in the East Sea had already prompted Japanese authorities to look more closely at acquiring additional missile defenses, including the U.S. military’s Aegis Ashore system , to defend against potential attacks. Instead, it now seems obvious that North Korea was more intent on demonstrating their increasing credible deterrent capabilities. In their report, the Associated Press speculated that this was why North Korean officials decided to conduct a nighttime launch, which wouldn’t be an ideal scenario for flashy propaganda pictures and video. Firing an ICBM in the dead of night could have been meant as a demonstration of the country’s ability to respond at any time. The test did seem to conflict with recent assessments that it was unlikely the North Koreans were close to launching another ballistic missile. “Currently, there’s no sign of an imminent North Korean missile launch,” South Korean Army Colonel Roh Jae-cheon, a spokesman for the country’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said at a press conference on July 27, 2017. A canisterized ICBM-type design that North Korea has yet to demonstrate in an actual test., AP The U.S. military and others had already been expecting another missile launch to closely coincide with the anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27. This arrangement had stopped much of the overt fighting on the Peninsula, but did not include a formal peace deal, leaving North and South Korea technically at war to this day. On July 20, 2017, CNN reported that the U.S. military had already spotted signs that another missile launch might be coming sometime in the next two weeks. It was unclear whether the test would come from a site on land or the sea, as there had been “unusual deployment activity” among North Korea’s submarine fleet. And in spite of the reality , North Korea has declared the armistice date as Victory in the Fatherland Liberation War Day, celebrating the “defeat” of the United States and “puppet” allies. These events are often marked with military parades or demonstrations, including missile launches. In the end, the date came and went without a launch, possibly due to bad weather . We don’t know why North Korean forces ultimately decided to wait, but it didn’t prevent them from reaching a significant milestone in their missile program. We’ll keep an eye out for additional information, but it seems increasingly clear that North Korea will present a threat to the continental United States itself far sooner than most ever imagined.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2019",Iran Officially Opens Expanded Space Center With Simorgh Rocket Launch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran claims it has successfully launched a Simorgh rocket into space for the first time, possibly carrying an experimental intelligence satellite. A major achievement for the country’s space program, it is sure to provoke criticism from the United States and many of its allies, who see the project as a cover for research and development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The Simorgh, meaning “phoenix,” lifted off from the Imam Khomeini Space Center, also known as the Semnan Space Center, in northern Iran, according to local media reports. The launch was reportedly successful, though there was no information immediately available about the payload or the rocket’s apogee. The Tasnim News Agency said the rocket could carry payloads as heavy as 550 pounds to altitudes up to 310 miles, or Low Earth Orbit. The launch marked the official inauguration of the space center in Senman, according to the semi-official outlet. Iran has been working on the Simorgh launch vehicle since at least 2010, when then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed the plan publicly during a celebration marking the first anniversary of the country’s first successful satellite launch. That launch, which put a telecommunications satellite known as Omid , or “hope,” into orbit, involved a smaller rocket called Safir , or “ambassador.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZPTN_e73RM In parallel, Iranian authorities have been expanding the facilities at Senman to accommodate the Simorgh. Though officials claimed the larger rocket would be ready to go in 2010, it took more than five years for the first experimental launch to occur. The program missed another scheduled first launch in 2012. In the interim, Iran fired a number of other Safir types carrying earth imaging and navigation system satellites. The United States and Russia both confirmed that there had been a ballistic missile launch on April 19, 2016, which experts believe was at least a partially failed test of the Simorgh. Iranian officials and local news outlets did not report on the event reinforcing the suggestion that it had not been entirely successful. Even if the rocket or its payload didn’t work as intended, it would have provided valuable data for continued development. IRNA In December 2016, Iran did say it was planning on conducting another satellite launch before the end of the Iranian calendar year, or March 20, 2017, as well as two more before the end of March 2018. At the time, the country’s Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Dr. Mahmoud Vaezi, said that engineers had already built all three payloads. One, Toloo, “sunrise,” was reportedly a remote sensing and signals intelligence platform. The other two designs would be for communications and scientific research purposes, respectively. Having a multi-functional intelligence satellite would be one thing, able to grant Iranian military commanders and analysts an important boost in situation awareness, including over otherwise denied areas. At present, Iran forces or their proxies are actively engaged in conflicts in Syria and Yemen . Even a limited space-based capability would be an important learning experience that could aid future developments, too. IRNA But more importantly, a successful Simorgh launch could put Iran one step closer to a viable intercontinental ballistic missile design. Though Iran has repeatedly denied these claims, the United States, Israel, and others view the entire project as a cover for a long-range missile that might be able to one day carry a nuclear warhead. A period review of global missile developments that the U.S. Air Force’s National Air and Space publicly released earlier in 2017, reiterated this position, saying Simorgh “could serve as a test bed for developing ICBM technologies,” The Simorgh launch also comes less than a month after North Korea tested its own ICBM design , the Hwasong-14. Though there is no indication that the two countries’ designs are related, there is significant evidence that they have cooperated on missile developments in the past. There was already a concern that the North Korean test could inform similar Iranian developments . https://youtube.com/watch?v=PK2YS02-jc0 Regardless, Iran’s ballistic missile development efforts are significant on their own. However, this research and development were notably absent from the multi-national negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran Deal, which instead focused solely on limiting the country’s controversial nuclear program. Still, American officials feel that repeated test launches are counter to the spirit of the final agreement. So, already in 2017, the U.S. government has put two new sets of sanctions into place against individuals and entities connected to Iran’s ballistic missile programs. The Simorgh test could provoke a third round of diplomatic action over the issue. In response, Iran has said it will not bow to sanctions or other threats and has vowed to continue with its missile work. In June 2017, its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fired six Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles at targets in Deir Ez-Zor, Syria, underscoring the country’s capabilities. Ostensibly a strike on ISIS terrorists in response to a pair of unprecedented attacks in Tehran, the decision to use the missiles appeared to serve other purposes, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HOOy6npQlp8 At the time, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway wrote : Iran’s use of ballistic missiles accomplished two clear objectives. First it offered at least some sign that Iran was exacting vengeance for the rare terror attack on their parliament. This is a much needed event for Iran’s ruling elite, and it will play well for domestic consumption. So the attack is largely a hollow political gesture more than a tactical one. Second, it showed the world Iran’s missiles are not just an experiment or a propaganda tool, but that they are very real capability to be reckoned with, and Tehran is now apparently willing to use them. Iran’s developments have long sent a message to other countries in the region , such as Israel , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates , all of whom are already hard at work expanding their ballistic missile defenses. As more information emerges about the Simorgh launch, it might add even more urgency to those projects. As for the launch itself, its undoubtedly a milestone for both Iran’s space and missile programs and an indicator that the country is getting closer to an ICBM-like capability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 21, 2019","On Twitter, Trump Talks New U.S. Military Ban on Transgender Service","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump has appeared to suggest he will ban transgender individuals from openly serving in the U.S. military. The announcement comes amid a Pentagon review and ongoing Congressional and public debates surrounding the issue. On July 26, 2017, Trump took to Twitter to say he would not “accept or allow” transgender persons “in any capacity” in the American armed forces. He specifically cited high medical costs and unspecified “disruption” as the key factors in his decision, which he said came after discussing the issue with unnamed “Generals and military experts.” Here is the full text of the three Tweets combined into a single statement: “After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.” During his election campaign, Trump insisted he would be an ally for the LGBTQ community, notably winning the support of prominent, if controversial transgender celebrity Caitlyn Jenner , at least initially . Though his administration ultimately moved to remove Obama-era protections , he come out in favor of letting transgender person use the bathroom of their choice , another hot button political issue, during his campaign. In regards to the new military restrictions, He did not link to a more detailed description of any actual military policy or an explanation of how it might be implemented and impact transgender individuals serving already. Estimates vary considerably – from approximately 1,300 to 15,000 – on how many trans personnel the U.S. military has at present among its uniformed service members and civilian employees, but this figure appears to be likely in the thousands. At least one of these individuals serves in the Naval Special Warfare community, according to separate recent reports regarding women joining U.S. special operations units. At the time of writing, neither the White House, nor the Pentagon websites had any statements on the issue or notices about policy changes. Trump could put forward the new policy in a presidential policy directive or executive order or push for new legislation in Congress. Senator John McCain, who serves as the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among a number of members of congress , both Republicans and Democrats, to immediately criticize the potential decision, as well as the choice to announce it via social media. “The President’s tweet this morning regarding transgender Americans in  the military is yet another example of why major policy announcements  should not be made via Twitter,” the Arizona Republican wrote in a statement . “There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight,  train, and deploy to leave the military – regardless of their gender identity. We should all be guided by the principle that any American who  wants to serve our country and is able to meet the standards should  have the opportunity to do so – and should be treated as the patriots they are.” The issue had already become a heated debate, however. In 2016, President Barack Obama’s administration announced plans to ultimately begin recruiting openly transgender individuals into the U.S. armed forces, a policy that his Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had initially outlined. Those plans are already on hold until Jan. 1, 2018. Secretary of Defense James Mattis made that decision on June 30, 2017, ahead of the original deadline to begin accessing openly trans persons for military service on July 1. “Since becoming the Secretary of Defense, I have emphasized that the Department of Defense must measure each policy decision against one critical standard: will the decision affect the readiness and lethality of our armed forces?” Mattis wrote in a memo for all the service secretaries and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Put another way, how will the decision affect the ability of America’s military forces to defend the nation?” However, Mattis made clear that his decision would not “presuppose” or otherwise prejudice the outcome of his additional review. We don’t know if any findings from this ongoing process impacted Trump’s apparent policy decision. Mattis’ memo also stressed the delay on new recruits wouldn’t have any impact on the existing policies regarding transgender individuals already serving in the U.S. military. On June 19, 2017, U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly concurred with this position, stating that he had no objection to trans persons presently on duty continuing to serve. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, right, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford confer during a hearing in June 2017., DOD Trump’s announcement, which alluded to potentially exorbitant costs associated with providing medical care to individuals seeking or in the process of transitioning genders, did come after the House of Representatives decided not to block federal funding for reassignment surgeries or hormone therapy earlier in July. The lawmakers voted to strip the provision from a draft of the defense spending bill for the 2018 fiscal year. Secretary Mattis personally called the provision’s author, Vicky Hartzler, to ask her to withdraw it, according to CNN . In June 2017, the Missouri Republican had attempted to insert more hard line language into the bill, which would have outright ended the Obama-era plans to begin recruiting transgender persons into the U.S. military. She decided to retract that original legislation and wait for the results of the official Pentagon review. The particular issue of tax dollars going to transgender transitions had become something of a lightning rod after reports that Chelsea Manning , a former member of the U.S. Army the service had convicted of leaking secret information to Wikileaks, would receive such benefits . At present, there is no conclusive evidence to support or contradict the claims that transgender individuals would overly burden the U.S. military’s healthcare system, negatively impact “ unit cohesion ,” or otherwise limit forces’ ability to fight and win. Critics have made many of these same arguments in the past against women and homosexuals openly serving in uniform. USAF A independent, non-partisan RAND Corporation study on the issue, which the Obama administration commissioned as part of its push to end restrictions on transgender individuals in the armed forces, found the potential impacts were likely negligible. Military healthcare costs would increase from anywhere from approximately $2 to $8 million annually, a relatively minor amount in overall defense budgets that include hundreds of billions in spending. In terms of readiness, it would, at worst add another 0.1 percent to the total number individuals not eligible for deployments each year. RAND compared this to the fact that 14 percent of the U.S. Army had already been unable to perform their duties in 2015 due to “legal, medical, or administrative” reasons. When it came to unit cohesion, RAND looked at both the United States military and four of the 18 total countries that already allowed open transgender service, Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom. “Evidence from foreign militaries and the U.S. military has indicated no significant impact on unit cohesion or operational readiness as a result of allowing transgender and gay and lesbian personnel to serve openly or allowing women to serve in ground combat positions,” RAND concluded. RAND RAND’s study didn’t say the process would necessarily be simple, but that there were various policies that could ease various logistical difficulties. In particular, they described other countries’ method of addressing physical fitness issues. A common complaint about women and transgender individuals serving in various roles it that their presence will force the U.S. military to water down its training requirements. The report’s findings might not satisfy those critics: [In other countries’ armed services,] “physical fitness standards typically do not fully shift until medical transition is complete. In many cases, personnel are exempt from physical fitness tests during transition. Because the gender transition process is unique for each individual – and not all transgender personnel will seek gender transition-related treatment – issues related to physical standards and medical readiness are typically addressed on a case-by-case basis. This flexibility has been important in addressing the needs of transgender personnel. The Pentagon’s ongoing review would have, and may still, add additional perspectives to this existing data. It’s unclear whether Trump’s policy plans will end this process or discard the results of RAND’s study. Pres. Trump visits the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day 2017., AP In the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway, then at Foxtrot Alpha, astutely wrote this on the issue after one of many Republican primary debates in which former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee raised the issue of transgender service and its associated costs: In the end, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and what went on before it, will be looked at as a result of a dark age in America’s history and I doubt transgender discrimination within the services will be regarded any different. Additionally, one’s personal or religious views on homosexuality or transgender people are protected, but the Pentagon is not a religious institution. As such, repealing sexual orientation restrictions is an exercise in the separation between church and state at its most basic level more than anything else. Ultimately, we still know very little about Trump’s plans or the reasoning behind them, or even if they will ever go into force in the original form.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Navy, or IRGCN, has made yet another unsafe approach toward a group American warships , during which the U.S. Navy says one of its patrol craft fired warning shots. The incident is the second of its type in as many months, but reflects Tehran’s ever present desire for greater influence in the region. On July 25, 2017, one of the IRGCN’s three Naser -class boats, which the U.S. Navy describes variously as an auxiliary patrol vessel or a light personnel transport, had an “unsafe and unprofessional interaction” with American ships while they were conducting drills in the Persian Gulf, USNI News reported , citing an official statement. The participants in the U.S.-only exercise included the Ticonderoga -class guided missile cruiser USS Vella Gulf , the Cyclone -class patrol craft USS Thunderbolt , two unspecified U.S. Coast Guard cutters, and an unnamed U.S. Army logistics vessel. The Army has a number of General Frank S. Besson -class logistics support vessels, the service’s largest and most capable ships, as well as smaller support craft, forward deployed in the region. Here is the full statement the U.S. Navy provided to USNI: An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps naval vessel conducted an unsafe and unprofessional interaction with a U.S. Navy ship during a coalition exercise in the international waters of the Arabian Gulf, July 25. The Iranian vessel made a close approach to coastal patrol ship USS Thunderbolt (PC 12), getting within 150 yards. The Iranian vessel did not respond to repeated attempts to establish radio communications as it approached. Thunderbolt then fired warning flares and sounded the internationally recognized danger signal of five short blasts on the ship’s whistle, but the Iranian vessel continued inbound. As the Iranian vessel proceeded toward the U.S. ship, Thunderbolt again sounded five short blasts prior to firing warning shots in front of the Iranian vessel. After the warning shots were fired, the Iranian vessel halted its unsafe approach. The Iranian vessel’s actions were not in accordance with the internationally recognized COLREGs “rules of the road” nor internationally recognized maritime customs, creating a risk for collision. “ COLREGs ” refer to a set of formal “International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,” which, as the Navy noted, outline who has right of way in international waters and other precautions to avoid accidents. You can see how dangerous the situation with the Naser -class boat – also written Nasser or Nassar – could have become in video USNI obtained seen above. The Naser appeared to be lightly armed, but that did not necessarily mean it might not have been threatening. The core of the IRGCN’s fleet is a number of modified civilian craft with fixed machine guns and rocket launchers or able to carry teams armed with their own weapons, including automatic rifles and rocket propelled grenades. There is always the possibility they could act as mine layers or even suicide bombs in an actual conflict. ONI’s guide to Iranian Navy and IRGCN ships, which doesn’t show the Naser -class., ONI “The IRGCN believes it can overcome enemy defenses … by using different types of small and mobile weapons systems together, or by using its capabilities in unexpected ways to achieve tactical surprise,” the Office of Naval Intelligence wrote in an unclassified review of Iranian naval forces, which it released to the public earlier in 2017. “Driven by an asymmetric doctrine –based on speed, numbers, stealth, survivability, and lethality – the IRGCN focuses its naval acquisitions along four primary capabilities: fast attack craft, small boats, anti-ship cruise missiles , and mines .” Negative on Houdong.

The Arvandan Shipbuilding Company, which generally specializes in light passenger ferries and other civilian craft, built the Nasers . In June 2017, Iranian Rear Admiral Abbas Zamini, Deputy Commander of the separate Iranian Navy, suggested his branch was also interested in using converted commercial ships as launching platforms for anti-ship missiles. This is also hardly the first time IRGCN ships and other craft have harassed American warships in the Persian Gulf. Separate from the regular Iranian military and in charge of a host of industrial and other concerns , observers generally see the IRGC’s activities as a whole as reflecting the often hardline domestic and foreign policy objectives of the country’s Supreme Leader and other unelected clerics rather than its elected government. This includes a categorical opposition to American influence and military presence in the Middle East. However, given the Corps’ unique position in Iran, it is not always clear who actually controls their actions . In June 2017, one of the IRGCN’s Thondor -class missile boats had come within 2,400 feet of the U.S. Navy’s amphibious assault ship USS Bataan , the escorting Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Cole , and the supply ship USNS Washington Chambers . The Chinese-made Iranian vessel shined its searchlight and a laser light on the formation, as well as helicopters transferring goods from the Washington Chambers , in another unprofessional and potentially dangerous display. One of the IRGCN’s patrol boats fires an unguided rocket during a drill in 2011., AP In March 2017, an unspecified Revolutionary Guard Corps’ boat maneuvered in front of the spy ship USNS Invincible before coming to a complete stop in the larger ship’s path, which could have led to an accident. Two months before that, Arleigh Burke -class destroyer, the USS Mahan , fired three warning shots to chase away a flotilla of four IRGCN fast attack craft that appeared to be rushing toward the American ship as it transited the narrow Strait of Hormuz. There were more incidents in 2016, including at least one other involving a Naser -class boat. In each of these instances, the U.S. Navy made a public complain about the Iranian actions. But while there is a certain routine nature to these incidents, and Iran has never followed through on threats to close off the Strait of Hormuz to foreign military ships in the past, the U.S. Navy has had reason to take these interactions especially seriously in the past year. In January 2016, IRGCN forces captured 10 American sailors and two Riverine Command Boats that had drifted into Iranian territorial waters near Farsi Island, touching off a tense international incident. One of the craft had suffered an engine breakdown and lost track of its position. Sec @JohnKerry says US sailors were ""well taken care of"" & #Iran releases these photos – unbelievable pic.twitter.com/nR0gCNFQtt — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) January 13, 2016 Though American officials quickly secured the release of the sailors and defused the situation, IRGC-linked media had already broadcast humiliating imagery of the American personnel and apparent formal apologizes for violating Iranian sovereignty. A subsequent U.S. Navy investigation found that the sailors and their superiors had been responsible for a series of failures that put them in the situation to begin with, but that Iran had violated a host of international norms by detaining rather than assisting the broken down ship. It’s not just the United States that Iran has been sparring with in international waters, either. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia claimed it had captured a team of IRGCN commandos near the offshore Marjan oilfield in the Persian Gulf. Iran strenuously denied the Saudis had captures any of its forces or that they had been near the Saudi oil rigs to begin with while countering that the Royal Saudi Navy had actually fired on a pair Iranian fishing boats, killing an innocent civilian. The next month, Iran’s semi-official Fars News Agency reported the IRGC had captured a Saudi-flagged fishing boat trespassing in Iranian waters , with Saudi officials taking their turn to deny the incident had even occurred. But critics of President Barack Obama and his administration pointed to a multi-lateral deal with Iran over that country’s controversial nuclear program as having enabled the IRGCN. Opponents of that arrangement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), claim it has otherwise empowered Iranian authorities to continue pursuing destabilizing policies across the Middle East. Iran’s military is reportedly considering opening bases in Syria and Yemen to expand its physical footprint abroad. Pro-regime militiamen in Syria., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik  via AP This includes supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen who are fighting a Saudi Arabian-led coalition, propping up the brutal dictatorship of Bashar Al Assad in Syria directly and through proxies including the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah and other militias – some of which have attacked American-supported forces in the country – and increasing military and economic cooperation with the government of Iraq. Iranian-backed groups have also been fighting ISIS alongside Iraqi government troops and on July 23, 2017, the two countries quietly signed a new agreement on military and counter-terrorism cooperation that has the potential to reduce American influence on Iraq’s security forces. This has in turn pushed U.S. military officials to seek a role in the country even after the terrorist threat has subsided in order to counter Iran’s influence. President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017 had a decidedly anti-Iranian tone to it, as well. The American leader has repeatedly called the JPCOA a “ bad deal ” and there are rumors he might try to renegotiate its terms, despite Iranian officials contending that this proposal would be a non-starter . In June 2017, he threatened Iran, along with Russia and Syria, over possible future chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In July 2017, the Trump administration reluctantly admitted that the Iranian government was abiding by the terms of the Iran deal. However, criticizing the country’s separate and continued work on ballistic missiles and support for international terrorist organizations, this announcement came along with a raft of new sanctions against Iranian individuals and entities. Iranian security forces take cover during the June 2017 terror attacks in Tehran., DPA via AP Of course, Iran’s continued push to assert itself throughout the Middle East hasn’t been without its own problems. The country’s support for the Assad regime has made it a target for ISIS, who launched a pair of unprecedented terrorist attacks in Tehran in June 2017. The attackers killed more than a dozen people and the entire affair threatened to drag Iran deeper into a still simmering regional crisis. For its part, the IRGC pointedly blamed Saudi Arabia, which is accuses of supporting Sunni extremists like ISIS, as being ultimately responsible for the incident. It also put its ballistic missile capabilities on display afterwards in a major and heretofore unseen ballistic missile attack ostensibly against ISIS in Syria. However, it seemed clear that the strike also served as a show of force against Iran’s regional competitors, including the Saudis. In light of this, the increasingly complex and confusing situation in Syria, Iran’s reported support for the Houthis, its long-standing rivalry with the Saudis, and continuing exchanges of tough talk with the U.S. government, it seems likely that the IRGCN will continue to harass American ships in the Persian Gulf for the foreseeable future as an easy way of showing its continued defiance against its international opponents. Unfortunately, these interactions will also continue to run the risk of a dangerous miscalculation that could turn them into a violent skirmish or even a larger conflict.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 5, 2020",India Wants New Subs While Ones They Already Have Sail With Broken Periscopes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly a decade, India says it will finally move ahead with plans to team up with a foreign contractor to build advanced diesel electric submarines . The announcement comes amid reports that despite ambitious plans to upgrade their equipment, each of the country’s eight front line Sindhughosh -class submarines have only one working periscope instead of two. On July 24, 2017, the Indian government reportedly declared it would begin considering offers from six different countries to pair up with an Indian shipyard to build a total of six advanced diesel-electric “stealth” submarines, according to The Times of India , which described the tender as the “mother of all underwater defense deals.” The plans, part of a larger conventional submarine program known as Project-75, have been in the works since November 2007. “The stress will be on transfer of technology,” an unnamed Indian Defense Ministry official told The Times . “The submarines, to be built with indigenous steel, should also be less maintenance-intensive to ensure a better operational cycle with minimal downtime.” In addition, the subs will be able to carry indigenous weapons, including land-attack cruise missiles – possibly including types able to carry nuclear warheads – sensors, and other equipment. Perhaps most importantly, the final design must have a air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which could be derived from one India’s Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) already designed for its up-coming Kalvari -class subs. These boats are a joint Franco-Indian effort based on the Scorpène -class, which itself was originally Franco-Spanish design project. INS Kalvari during torpedo-firing trials in May 2017., Indian Navy An AIP arrangement is essential for modern, quiet-running conventional submarine designs. Combined with improved batteries , these systems can provide nuclear sub-like power and noise reduction in a significantly cheaper and more compact package. Advanced derivatives may actually be quieter than their nuclear counterparts while still able to stay submerged for weeks at a time, both critical elements to avoiding detection. Additional advanced conventional submarines are essential for the Indian Navy as it continues to expand its operations further and further beyond its territorial waters. At present, the country reportedly only has 13 diesel electric submarines, only seven or eight of which are combat ready at any one time on average. The bulk of these are Soviet-era Kilos , which the Indian Navy received between 1986 and 2000 and operates as the Sindhughosh -class . India ultimately hopes to have an undersea fleet of 18 front line conventional attack submarines, another six nuclear-powered attack submarines, and four nuclear ballistic missile submarines. This would be a significant threat to long-standing enemy Pakistan and its five submarines. However the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy, with dozens of subs of various types , would still dwarf the Indian contingent. As such, submarine and anti-submarine warfare was undoubtedly a key component of the latest iteration of the annual U.S.-India-Japan naval exercise known as Malabar , which wrapped up earlier in July 2017. In the 2015 Malabar drills, the INS Sindhudhvaj , one of the older Sindhughosh -class boats, reportedly scored a “kill” on the USS City of Corpus Christi, a Los Angeles -class nuclear attack submarine. New Indian subs would still be another key part of any plans to counter potential Chinese naval threats above and below the waves . Beyond active offensive or defense operations, stealthy conventional submarines would provide a important intelligence gathering capability for the Indian Navy to keep tabs on potentially hostile maritime developments and activities close to shore. An artist’s conception of the then-DCSA Shortfin Barracuda proposal for the Australian Navy., DCNS For the new Project-75 tender, France is likely to be a leading contender, given that they have one of the most advanced AIP submarines designs available for export and are already working with Indian shipbuilders on the Kalvaris . In April 2016, the Australian government chose this sub , French firm Naval Group’s commercial Shortfin Barracuda , as the winner of its submarine competition, meaning the type is in active production, too. Naval Group, formerly known as DCNS, would have to reconfigure the design, which presently displaces approximately 5,300 tons submerged, to some degree, depending on the amount of indigenous hardware the Indians would want to install. A cutaway of Thyssen Krupp’s Type 216., Thyssen Krupp As in the case of Australia’s search for its future Collins -class boats , France will likely face stiff competition from the other competitors, especially Germany and Japan. Germany’s Thyssen Krupp would likely put forward a version of its Type 216 , an approximately 4,000 ton displacement boat derived from the company’s smaller Type 214 , which it put forward for the Australian competition. Though the Type 216 isn’t in active production, Thyssen Krupp has a number of active deals for shared production of the Type 214s with foreign customers, including South Korea . Works launch the Soryu -class submarine Unryū in 2008., Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Japanese firm Mitsubishi-Kawasaki similarly developed a 4,200 ton displacement version of their advanced Soryu -class that is already in service with the Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force. There is one Soryu still in production, plus plans for up to four more, meaning there is an active production line and knowledge base for this design, as well. The latest Soryu class boats depend on lithium ion batteries alone for air independent propulsion. The remaining entrants as of yet are Russia, Spain, and Sweden. Unfortunately, all of these countries face more significant hurdles in their bids. HMS Gotland arrives in San Diego, California in 2005 for tests with the U.S. Navy., USN Swedish company Kockums Naval Solutions, now part of Saab Group, was responsible for building the then state-of-the-art Gotland -class in the 1990. These boats remain extremely capable and the U.S. Navy even used one for tests in the mid-2000s. However, the company has not built any news submarines in more than two decades. Spanish shipbuilder Navantia is making new S-80 class submarines for Spain’s Navy, but the four boats have suffered repeated delays due to combination of budgetary and technical troubles. Though the country approved funds for the project in 2003, none of the subs have entered service. The design is similar in overall size to the German Type 214, too, and might not fit the Indian requirements for a front-line submarine. As a result, Navantia could have to come up with an all-new type for its bid. The sole Lada -class submarine, Sankt Peterburg , in 2010., Морозов Л.Н. via Wikimedia Russia is actively producing diesel-electric designs, but again they may be smaller than what the Indian Navy wants with the latest Lada -class boats displacing 2,700 tons submerged. These subs may not inspire much confidence either. The first Lada sub, Sankt Peterburg , effectively became a prototype after it became apparent that there were serious flaws in the design. The next two boats in the class have been in the works since 2005 and 2006 respectively, but the Russian Navy only expects to get them into service in 2019 after years of substantial redesigns. The Ladas are highly improved derivatives of the older Soviet-era Kilo -class, which may not help their chances with the Indians given their experiences with the Sindhughosh -class , either. In August 2013, INS Sindhurakshak exploded and sank while dockside in Mumbia. Less than a year later, smoke from an apparent fire INS Sindhuratna killed two sailors and knocked another five unconscious. Government watchdogs have cited poor safety procedures within the Indian Navy as a factor in these accidents, but Russian submarines have a history of deadly accidents, too. The Sindhughosh -class submarine Sindhuvijay. , via Wikimedia Regardless, there simply remains a major question of when or even if these new Project-75 submarines might actually enter service. The same anonymous Indian Defense Ministry official told The Times of India it could be another two years before the government could even pare down the list of competitors and their chosen Indian shipbuilding partners. “Moreover, the first new submarine will roll out only seven to eight years after the final contract is inked,” the official added.  “But the aim is to fast-track the entire process.” Whether or not this is possible is up for debate, especially given the existing experience with the Kalvari -class. That program began in 2005 with the expectation that the Franco-Indian joint effort would deliver all six boats between 2012 and 2016. The entire class would cost a total of $3 billion. It ultimately took four years before construction even began and INS Kalvari only started sea trials in May 2016. By that point, Indian officials had already pushed back her commissioning date from September 2016 to June 2017. Earlier in July 2017, The Times of India reported that she was scheduled to finally arrive at the Indian Navy the next month – more than a decade after the development program began. On the same day the Indian government announced the new submarine project, other reports surfaced that a top government watchdog had slammed the country’s navy over separate bureaucratic wrangling that had already held up important modifications to the Sindhughosh -class for some six years . The Comptroller and Auditor General found that as a result, all of the boats were operating with just one periscope instead of two and that the remaining unit was not capable of low light level or night vision function, greatly limiting the aging subs capabilities. Troubles started when another firm purchased Kollmorgen, the original vendor of the upgraded periscopes. Indian authorities didn’t formalize a deal with the new company until 2014. By the time the last of the periscopes arrived in 2016, all but one of the remaining Sindhughosh -class subs had finished their planned refits. This meant they returned to service without the new equipment and without any immediate plans for installing them in the near future. The last of the Indian Kilos was still out for overhaul at the time, but it was unclear if it received the new gear before it returned to the fleet in January 2017. Regardless, “the contention of the defense ministry that there was no adverse impact on the operational capability of the submarines is not tenable,” the state auditor said, according to the Indian Defense Update blog . INS Kalvari , Indian Navy And then there’s just the matter of cost. The final overall contract for the six Project-75 subs will be worth an estimated nearly $11 billion. This is a not insubstantial amount given India’s other requirements for various new combat aircraft , tanks and anti-tank weapons , and surface warships , among other projects. If it takes two years before Indian officials even begin make decisions about the offers, the country’s strategic priorities and budget realities may have already changed significantly. At present, there is a more immediate concern, which the Comptroller and Auditor General first raised in 2015 , that India’s military may not even have enough ammunition to keep troops in the fight for more than 10 days in a major war, such as one with China. Indian and Chinese forces are already engaged in a serious standoff over a disputed border in India’s northeastern Sikkim province. The crisis over the region has been simmering since June 2017 and neither side seems so far inclined to back down . It seems likely that submarines will continue to be an important part of the country’s defense spending priorities, though. This is especially true given China’s increasingly active and aggressive maritime moves, which include establishing its first overseas naval base and continuing to exert more and more control over the heavily contested South China Sea . In light of these factors, the Indian Navy is probably looking to make sure it doesn’t take another decade to get its new class of advanced attack subs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 29, 2019",Another THAAD Anti-Ballistic Missile System Test Could Be Imminent,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Coast Guard has revealed upcoming plans for an unspecified missile test in Alaska. The launch site is the same one that has hosted U.S. military experiments involving the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system and the announcement comes amid increased concern and warnings about North Korea and other potential enemies expanding their ballistic missile capabilities. On July 19, 2017, the Coast Guard distributed a safety notice to mariners advising them to keep away from a large section of the Pacific Ocean stretching from Kodiak Island in Alaska to Hawaii, according to an initial report by the Kodiak Daily Mirror . The message said the test launch would occur at the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska (PCSA) overnight on July 29-30, 2017, but could end up rescheduled for the next two nights. The alert did not describe the missile system or parties who would be involved in the launch. Private contractor Alaska Aerospace Corporation manages PCSA, situated on Kodiak Island, and hosts U.S. and foreign military programs, as well as scientific research and commercial projects. The Coast Guard routinely takes parts in these events in order to secure the test range both to keep individuals away from any hazards and provide security for the often sensitive experiments. Though we don’t know what this specific test will entail, one possibility is the U.S. military’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is preparing to conduct its second THAAD test of the year. On July 11, 2017, the agency reported that one of the system’s interceptors had successfully destroyed a surrogate intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) for the first time ever . MDA also released official video of the event, seen below. This launch, known as Flight Test THAAD 18, or FTT-18, was just one of two MDA planned for the U.S. government’s 2017 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, 2017. There was also no public announcement of exactly when that test would occur beforehand. Still, in January 2017, in announcing the decision to use PCSA for these and future tests , MDA spokeswoman Leah Garton confirmed to Inside Defense that both THAAD launches would occur sometime in “late fiscal year 2017.” In a hearing in June 2017, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral J.D. Syring, head of MDA, said the second experiment, FTT-15, would involve collecting data on the system’s endo-atmospheric capabilities against a mock medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) “with associated objects.” These additional items might stand in for decoys trying to throw off THAAD’s interceptor or the long-range AN/TPY-2 radar , which is essential for detecting and targeting incoming missiles. FTT-18, “in addition to previous flight testing and FTT-15 … , will demonstrate several key capabilities against longer range threats that the MDA should further explore using end-to-end modeling and simulation,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation wrote in a 2016 review of the THAAD program’s progress. The office added that MDA and its Ballistic Missile Defense System Operational Test Agency “should plan to conduct high-fidelity modeling and simulation runs against longer range threats following the FTT-18 and FTT-15 flight test campaign, to include endgame and lethality analyses for these tests.” A South Korean CH-47 Chinook flies past the first THAAD missile site in the country in April 2017., AP The THAAD test and evaluation plan has already taken on a new urgency in light of North Korea’s extensive ballistic missile launches earlier in 2017. These have included the launch of the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4, 2017, as well as successful demonstrations of increasingly advanced MRBM and IRBM types. This in turn had prompted complaints that the U.S. military’s missile defense test schedule was moving too slow to respond to these emerging threats . “We are not going fast. We are so risk-averse that we only test every 18 months,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, told Stars and Stripes in an interview earlier July 2017. “The best way to build rockets, the best way to move fast, is to build it, test it, instrument it, learn from your failures.” So, even if the upcoming test is FTT-15, there may be concerns that THAAD both needs more testing and needs it yesterday. And while it is not clear whether THAAD would be able to handle an incoming ICBM, and the U.S. military has other missile defense systems for that purpose, it would be an important line of defense against the shorter range MRBM and IRBM types the North Korean military has showed off this year, including a stretched version of the BM-25 Musudan, also known as the Hwasong-12. The Hwasong-12 on its transporter-erector., AP Those weapons have estimated ranges that would allow them to hit American forces and their allies in South Korea and Japan . In March 2017, the U.S. military began deploying THAAD batteries to South Korea, though the country’s president Moon Jae-in has put plans to expand those defenses on hold pending a new environmental review. Pyongyang’s missile forces could also target the American territory of Guam in the South Pacific, which is home to significant U.S. military facilities. The U.S. Army has had a THAAD battery in place on the island since 2013. “Kim Jong Un’s regime is tied to [its] nuclear program, and what I can tell the American people today is North Korea is capable of launching a limited missile attack,” U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the Aspen Security Forum on July 22, 2017. Still, “the United States military can defend against a limited North Korea attack on Seoul, Japan, and the United States,” he was quick to add. “Limited” is a key caveat as THAAD may not be able to adequately respond to a barrage of ballistic missiles and decoys in its present form. Especially critical in that scenario would be the AN/TPY-2’s ability to spot and categorize a large number of incoming threats, which it might not be able to do. As The War Zone has reported on multiple occasions , based on unclassified information, though this radar has a very long range, it may have a very narrow focus that would have difficulty tracking multiple targets coming from different directions at once. Beyond East Asia, other American allies and partners may be similarly anxious to see the results of additional and more complex THAAD tests. The United Arab Emirates is in the process of establishing its own missile defense scheme, focused primarily on Iran’s growing ballistic missile capabilities, while Saudi Arabia has expressed interest in purchasing as many as seven THAAD batteries for the same reason. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1eWPAnjEgO8 In May 2017, a semi-official Iranian media outlet announced the construction of a third underground ballistic missile factory. “We will continue to further develop our missile capabilities forcefully,” Amirali Hajizadeh, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ airspace division, said, according to the Fars News Agency . The IRGC showed off its capabilities the next month when it fired six ballistic missiles at targets in Syria, ostensibly in retaliation for earlier ISIS terrorist attacks in the country’s capital Tehran. In addition to Iran, Saudi Arabia has found itself increasingly under threat from Yemeni militant groups with access to an arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles . These forces, linked to the regime of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and allied with Houthi rebels, have also claimed they have the capacity to produce new and improved weapons based on existing designs, such as the Soviet-era Scud series. Given the increasing number of ballistic missile threats in the Middle East, it is also possible that the up-coming PCSA test could support Israel’s development of its own Arrow 3 ballistic missile defense system. However, in the June 2017 hearing, Admiral Syring said the next test of this interceptor, which MDA would support at the Kodiak launch site, was scheduled to occur sometime in 2018 . https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8IElq3zeFY As ballistic and other long-range missile technology has become more widespread , missile defense has experiencing a renaissance of sorts in general. In June 2017, Russia conducted a test of its A-135 ballistic missile defense system, which has been in place to defend Moscow from incoming ICBMs since 1995. These interceptors have a 10 kiloton nuclear warhead. In 2010, China conducted its own anti-ballistic missile test. The exact configuration of this system or its interceptor , which may be called the DN-1, remains unclear. On July 24, 2017, there were unconfirmed reports of a second Chinese ballistic missile defense experiment involving an unknown system. Last night in northwest China, suspected anti ballistic missile test. https://t.co/iYF2dU8XNX pic.twitter.com/DskzJHlW3q — dafeng cao (@dafengcao) July 24, 2017 Of course, there is always the possibility that this next launch in Alaska will have nothing to do with THAAD or any military mission at all. But even after FTT-15, there are more THAAD tests already on the schedule, with another one expected to occur in the next fiscal year. That event, Flight Test Operational-03 Event 2, or FTO-03 E2, will target another mock IRBM and will involve other missile defense and surface to air missile systems, including the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and the Patriot missile. Regardless of when they ultimately happen, with threats increasing around the globe, MDA may well decide to expand its test schedule for THAAD and other systems, too, or follow the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s recommendations and add in additional modeling and simulations. It seems safe to say that THAAD, and just how well it actually works, will only be an increasingly important topic of discussion.

On July 19, 2017, the Navy sent out a draft request for proposals to four defense contractors – Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman – ahead of the service’s planned release of a formal notice sometime in the fall, according to USNI News . Notably, this document outlines just two so-called “key performance parameters,” or KPPs, for any proposed design. “The system needs to be able to operate off of the aircraft carrier and integrate with all of the subsystems of the carrier,” U.S. Navy Captain Beau Duarte, the MQ-25 program manager, told USNI. “Sea-based tanker is the second KPP. It needs to be able to deliver a robust fuel offload at range to support an extension of the air wing and add flexibility of what’s available from a mission tanking perspective.” It’s a testament to Pentagon bureaucracy that the Navy has to specify the first of these requirements at all. That the unmanned aircraft, previously known as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), would need to use existing carrier subsystems, such as catapults and arresting equipment , is a long-established given. The experimental X-47B carrier drone., USN The second KPP, however, is a small, but significant change from how the service explained the drone’s planned missions when it applied for the MQ-25 designation in 2016. In that request, which the author previously obtained through a Freedom of Information Act Request, the primary focus was on recovery rather than mission tanking. Recovery tanking is a much more limited task involving an aerial refueling aircraft flying fixed orbits in close proximity to the carrier. The concept allows carrier fighters or strike aircraft to fly missions that take up much of their fuel, knowing that when they return they can take on additional gas and land safely. US Navy via FOIA US Navy via FOIA Since the Navy’s carrier air wings do not presently have a dedicated tanker, Super Hornets have to fill this role using a detachable “ buddy pod ” store. This takes the aircraft away from their primary duties as a strike fighter. So, having the Stingray do this work would lead to “a substantial increase in mission capacity and can also extend the reach of existing [carrier strike group] capabilities,” according the MQ-25 designator request packet. Only one MQ-25 in each complete “unmanned aerial system” – which would include multiple drones, an MD-5 ground control station , and other associated equipment – would be available for so-called mission tanking. Unlike recovery tanking, this mission profile has aerial refueling planes operating in orbits nearer to the target area. To perform this job, the tanker would have to have a greater maximum range of its own and could expect to find itself closer to enemy defenses without the protective umbrella of the carrier and its escorts. At present, large U.S. Air Force KC-135 and KC-10 tankers perform the bulk of the U.S. military’s mission tanking across all the services. Lockheed Martin’s MQ-25 concept art., Lockheed Martin The shift in focus from primarily recovery to mainly mission tanking could potentially lead manufacturers to develop significantly larger designs than they might’ve originally planned to submit. In line with the original focus on recovery tanking, both Boeing and Lockheed Martin have already released concept artwork showing nothing but what looked like the Navy’s existing buddy pods without any significant amount of the aircraft itself visible. Duarte confirmed to USNI that this piece of kit is part of the requirement, but that the rest is up to the manufacturer. “We are saying that you do have to use the existing aerial refueling store that F/A-18s [and] S-3s have used – and that’s externally carried – and that’s to reduce development, cost and timeline and risk,” Duarte explained. “But how you configure the air vehicle to deliver that fuel is up to industry.” Also, Duarte made no specific mention of the Navy’s earlier desire for the aircraft to still have limited intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. This was a holdover requirement from the original strike and reconnaissance focused Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program. In asking for the MQ-25 designation, the Navy specifically said that drones would be available for intelligence gathering missions when not providing tanking services. The requirements described an unmanned aircraft able to gather imagery, including full motion video, during the day or at night, as well as signals intelligence data. It would also have the necessary data links to transmit that information back to the carrier, to other ships or even submarines, other manned or unmanned aircraft, and troops on the ground. We don’t know whether or not the Navy has decided to scrap the intelligence gathering mission entirely. “There are a number of key system attributes or other requirements lower than that that are subsequent to and are of lower importance and that will allow us to focus on those two key areas on tanking and carrier suitability and let those be the primary design drivers,” Duarte noted. An Omega Air Refueling KC-707 tanker links up with an X-47B drone during tests., USN All of this seems to suggest the Navy may have decided to focus on tanking above all else, at least initially. This singular mission focus could help the service keep costs low and get the aircraft into service quickly. In April 2017, Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman each received more than $18 million to continue work on their MQ-25 designs, even though the final requirements were still in flux and it was unclear when any production aircraft might actually be combat ready. There is no estimated final price tag for the project as of yet. But billing the aircraft as nothing more than a pilotless gas station could limit the ability for the Navy to employ them for other tasks in the future. The original UCLASS designs – Boeing’s Phantom Ray , General Atomics’ Sea Avenger , Lockheed Martin’s Sea Ghost , and Northrop Grumman’s X-47C – were low-observable drones clearly intended for deep strike and intelligence gathering in so-called anti-access/area denial environments, or A2/AD, full of networked air defenses and hostile aircraft. The shift in requirements to a tanker with secondary intelligence gathering capability already suggested manufacturers might rework their proposals around less costly non-stealthy designs. “From our viewpoint, the requirements, as they are currently unfolding, are going to require a new design from all of the competitors,” Rob Weiss, head of Lockheed’s Skunk Works advanced projects office, told USNI in March 2017 . If the Navy did decide it needed a deep strike unmanned combat air vehicle in the future, an aircraft that may ultimately become essential for operations in heavily defended areas, these new pilotless aircraft could be wholly unsuitable for the task. Whether they could perform  the kind of secondary reconnaissance mission the Navy had originally envisioned is debatable with this new primary focus on longer range aerial refueling. A modular design that could accept additional mission equipment would necessarily be a substitute for a purpose-built low observable design. Of course, there is always the possibility one or more of the four contractors could put forward a stealthy tanker design. There is growing evidence that aerial refuelers, manned or unmanned, are increasingly vulnerable in high threat environments in general. In May 2017, a Russian fighter jet intercepted and then did a barrel roll atop an Air Force KC-10 flying over Syria, underscoring this potential danger. But unless all of the competitors decide to go this route, anyone who does might be stuck making an offer that is significantly more expensive and less attractive as a result. A now very dated artist’s concept of what was once a joint U.S. Air Force-Navy unmanned combat air vehicle program., DARPA Still, in his interview with USNI, Duarte sought to downplay these concerns and the idea that there would be a need for all new aircraft concepts. “The program has been structured so there isn’t any new development. There’s no new science here,” he insisted. That’s not really true, of course. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B demonstrator and its associated technological advancements had made clear the impressive potential of a carrier-based combat-capable drone as outlined in the original UCLASS program. Since then, the Navy, as well as the U.S. Air Force, has repeatedly declined to push ahead with UCAV concept for reasons that remain largely unclear . In the case of the MQ-25 specifically, it could be that naval aviators saw the Stingray as a threat and have argued behind the scenes for reduced requirements.  Maybe multiple branches feared the drone would eat into budgets for more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters or updated F/A-18 Super Hornets. We don’t know for sure, but it seems clear that the decision against a deep-penetrating, stealthy attacker in favor of a tanker was not done without careful consideration of one or more factors. Whatever the case, it will be interesting to see how Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman ultimately interpret the Navy’s latest requirements.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 31, 2019",ROTC Cadet Could Become First Female US Navy SEAL,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has confirmed a number of women are seeking to join its special operations units , including at least one who could become the first female SEAL . However, given the grueling training and in light of what are sure to be accusations of a politicized process, the service was quick to stress that there was no guarantee any of the candidates would fulfill the necessary requirements. As of June 2017, there were two women in the pipeline for the Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewman program, according to a report by Military.com . Another woman, presently a college student in a Navy Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program, is set to join the SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection (SOAS) course in the coming months, ahead of an evaluation by the SEAL Officer Selection Panel in September 2017. “We assess right now that, with the small cohorts of females, we don’t really know what’s going to happen as far as expected attrition,” U.S. Navy Captain Christian Dunbar, the deputy commander of the Naval Special Warfare Center, told the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services in June 2017. “All the barriers have been removed. Our planning has been completed and is on track.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=qhzYWqBTKdQ On Dec. 3, 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that the U.S. military as a whole would no longer limit what jobs women could serve in, opening the path for female service members to apply for previously off-limits positions in special operations units in all branches. At the time, all the services had 30 days to both remove the official restrictions and develop plans on how to fully implement the changes. U.S. and Israeli naval special operations forces train together in March 2017., US Army In spite of criticisms and accusations of “political correctness,” spokesmen for Naval Special Warfare Command assured both Military.com and NPR , among other outlets, that there had been no changes to the core training requirements to accommodate the female candidates. U.S. Navy Captain Jason Salata told Military.com that the only modifications to the programs had to do with lodging and the wear of uniforms. As of July 2017, only one of the two women remained in training to become a Special Warfare Combatant Crewman (SWCC), according to Salata. Another Naval Special Warfare Command spokesman, Lieutenant Command Mark Walton, told NPR that SWCC community had one transgender individual, as well. The report did not state the sailor’s identified gender or the one they were assigned at birth. The command declined to provide many details for these stories, citing operational security and privacy concerns. On June 30, 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis did delay plans to begin accessing openly transgender applicants for U.S. military service until Jan. 1, 2018. In this time, the branches “will review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces,” according to an official Pentagon statement . This has no impact on women applying for or progressing through the SEAL, SWCC, or any other training programs. The SWCC process includes an eight-week Basic Crewman Training program followed by a 12 week Crewman Qualification Training and additional training. This can include military parachuting courses and practicing dropping rigid hull inflatable boats from aircraft and helicopters, as well as Survival, Escape, Resistance, and Evasion (SERE) training. In 1994, the Navy created the SWCC enlisted warfare specialty so that boat crewmen could stay within the Naval Special Warfare community beyond single tours of duty. In 2006, service created the special warfare boat operator rating, which allowed individuals to remain in NSW for their entire career. As of 2017, there were three such operational teams, Special Boat Teams 12, 20, 22. SWCC in these units were responsible for manning various specialized craft , including rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB), Special Operations Craft-Riverine (SOC-R), the Mk V Special Operations Craft , and the stealthy Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH), also known as the SEAL (Sea Air Land Commandos) Insertion, Observation and Neutralization, or SEALION . https://youtube.com/watch?v=mEtAxNvD5Pc Candidates to become SEAL commandos go through the near-legendary Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Team course, or BUD/S , which presently starts with a three week “indoctrination” process, followed by three separate phases, each seven weeks long. This course also includes the especially arduous “Hell Week,” specifically intended to weed out individuals who are unlikely to succeed in meeting the requirements. Throughout BUD/S, “there is attrition of candidates who voluntarily withdraw from the course due to arduous physical training, sleep deprivation, prolonged cold water exposure, and leadership and team work challenges,” according to one official U.S. Navy special warfare manual from 2013 . Some of those individuals apply and are accepted into the SWCC program as transfer students. After BUD/S, SEAL candidates go through another 26 weeks of qualification training, as well as other courses, including military parachuting and SERE. The entire process for both SEALs and SWCCs can take months, followed by more time spent in pre-deployment training before individuals actually arrive at SEAL or Special Boat Teams. US Navy SEALs ride in Humvees during a training exercise in Germany., US Army For years already, both the SEALs and Special Boat Units have proven to be highly selective. Both tracks require candidates to meet the same initial physical and Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) score requirements. On average, between 73 and 75 percent of SEAL applicants drop out. Within that, officer candidates, which are a much smaller pool, apparently have a much better success rate, with approximately 65 percent making the grade. Though they go through a slightly less strenuous process than the SEALs, an average of 63 percent of SWCC recruits still fail to pass the required courses. “It would be premature to speculate as to when we will see the first woman SEAL or SWCC graduate,” Salata made clear to Military.com. “Managing expectations is an important part of the deliberate assessment and selection process; it may take months and potentially years.” “Managing expectations” is putting things mildly. The issue of women serving in many combat-related functions within the U.S. military is both a highly charge and highly politicized debate. When Carter announced his decision to remove all remaining restrictions in 2015, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford pointedly skipped the press conference. This was an apparent protest since the Marines had been the only service to oppose the plan, citing an internal review that showed all-male infantry units performed better than those with a mix of men and women. Carter assured the Corps, members of Congress, and the general public that those concerns would be taken into account as the U.S. military considered how to implement his new directive. U.S. Marine Corps Private First Class Christina Fuentes Montenegro, one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps Infantry Training Battalion in 2013., USMC Any internet search on the subject will quick bring up news articles, op-eds, blog posts, and forum comments from current and retired military members and others who are worried about relaxed training standards or concerned about a loss of “ unit cohesion ” by having men and women serve together in tense combat situations. There is no conclusive evidence one way or another that mixed gender units are less effective than all-male units in combat or more prone to disciplinary issues. Critics in and out of the U.S. military community claimed the Marines in particular were biased against women in their study, which the serviced had labeled as “pre-decisional.” Then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, the top civilian in charge of both the Navy and the Marine Corps, famously dismissed the report’s findings in September 2015, accusing it of being over determined . “When you start out with that mindset, you’re almost presupposing the outcome,” he said. The first three female infantry Marines joined 1st Battalion, 8th Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in January 2017. The battalion already had female personnel in support roles, such as logistics, motor transport, and communications. Women had previously graduated from the Marine Corps Infantry Training Battalion, but were still precluded from taking combat infantry jobs. US Army Major Lisa Jaster, who became the third woman to ever graduate from the service’s Ranger training course., US Army There have been many of the same debates outside of the Navy and the Marine Corps. In August 2015, two women passed the U.S. Army’s Ranger training course for the first time ever . Again, there were claims that instructors had reduced the requirements or otherwise given special consideration to the two soldiers not afford to their male counterparts. Though the Army strenuously denied this, it quickly developed into a political firestorm. Representative Steve Russel, an Oklahoma Republican and Army veteran who had passed the Ranger course, demanded to see the training records to judge for himself . The service provided the records it could legally send along absent a formal oversight request and that particularly issue largely subsided. The Ranger training course is separate from the process to join the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, part of the U.S. Army’s Special Operations Command. In 2016, three women did apply to join the regiment. In January 2017, the serviced confirmed to Task and Purpose that one of them had passed through the second phase of the storied unit’s assessment and selection process and was set to become the first female member of a U.S. special operations forces unit. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Brian Losey., USN Neither this nor the progress of women through Navy special operations training courses is likely to change the tenor of the debate, unfortunately. More recently, in regards to the plans to allow transgender individuals to openly serve, some have suggested that failing recruits might decide to “ swap genders ” in order to gain access to an easier physical training regimen or the women’s showers. However, it seems unlikely that someone who didn’t actually identify as transgender would choose to go this complicated and lengthy route, which presently requires both a formal medical diagnosis and command approval in the Navy for instance, rather than simply working to build up the necessary strength and endurance. But there seems to be a certain inevitability to women serving in combat units including special operations forces, regardless of where one stands on the debate. “Acceptance is expected to increase over time,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Brian Losey, then head of Naval Special Warfare Command, wrote in a memo in September 2015 where he also cited political pressure to reduce training requirements for women. It’s worth noting that Losey subsequently became the subject of public accusations of toxic leadership and retaliating against whistleblowers, which his defenders said were politically motivated . The issue effectively forced the officer into early retirement , but in defiance of critics in Congress, the Navy subsequently gave him a retroactive promotion that came along with added back pay and larger pension. Beyond gender issues, earlier in 2017, there were separate, controversial reports that the SEALs were struggling with high illicit drug use and general disciplinary problems . “With the recent female graduates from the Ranger course, there may be an expectation that there will soon be female graduates from BUD/S,” Losey had added in his 2015 letter. “We will welcome any candidate who meets standards.” Soon, the Navy may put those statements, as well as the training standards, to the test.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2019",Late Addition to the USAF’s Light Attack Experiment Sparks Drama Online,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We at The War Zone have already written a lot about what the U.S. Air Force may or may not hope to gain from its light attack aircraft experiment, or OA-X, and whether it is truly invested in the idea. Now it appears the service may be courting a separate controversy by inviting a team from L-3 and Air Tractor, a decision their competitor IOMAX has criticized, provoking some peculiar drama in the press and on social media. On Aug. 1, 2017, the Twitter account associated with L-3 and Air Tractor’s Longsword light attack plane said that a complaint from IOMAX “sounds like something a recently vanquished politician would say.” This was in direct response to an interview IOMAX’s President and CEO Ron Howard had given in to Aviation Week. This came in the middle of two other Tweets with similar sentiments. The spat had started on July 31, 2017, the same day the OA-X assessment began at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, when L-3 and Air Tractor announced they would be sending their Longsword plane to take part in the experiment. Before then, Sierra Nevada Corporation and Embraer, with their A-29 Super Tucano light attacker, and Textron, with both the AT-6 Wolverine and Scorpion aircraft, were the only participants to confirm the USAF a cleared them to take part in the tests. “We are proud of the Longsword and the opportunity to participate in OA-X,” Jim Hirsch, president of Air Tractor, said in a press release . “We are looking forward to flying at Holloman AFB and showcasing our capabilities to the Air Force and to our partner nations.” Air Tractor L-3 and Air Tractor unveiled the aircraft earlier in 2017. Marketed variously as the AT-802L, OA-8, and OA-802, the aircraft is a heavily modified Air Tractor AT-802 crop duster intended for light attack and aerial surveillance duties. The plane is a derivative of Air Tractor’s AT-802U light attack demonstrator, which debuted in 2008, and L-3’s own electro-optical sensor package for the aircraft. In 2014, the U.S. Air Force hired L-3 to install this system, centered on a turreted electro-optical and infrared video camera system, onto four AT-802s initially bound for Yemen . When that country’s government collapsed in February 2015, the United States diverted those planes to Jordan. #L3 and #AirTractor marketing AT-802L (formerly 802U) as OA-8 #Longsword at #Avalon Airshow. Story to come. pic.twitter.com/U8x6HvfcU0 — Gareth Jennings (@GarethJennings3) February 28, 2017 In addition to the sensor turret, the Longsword configuration has a battle management system and provisions for up to 11 hard points, four under each wing and as many as three under the fuselage, allowing it to carry a mix of precision guided bombs and missiles, rockets, dumb bombs, and gun pods. According to L-3 and Air Tractor, the aircraft has enough fuel for up to 10 hours of flight time, which equals to a combat radius of 400 miles plus up to six hours loitering over the target area. Based on what little we know of the OA-X’s structure and goals, this plane sounds like an obvious entrant. For more than two decades , the idea of converting agricultural planes into counterinsurgency tools has steadily gained traction and countries like the United Arab Emirates and Jordan have already put similar aircraft into action. Air Tractor’s AT-802U demonstrator at the Paris Air Show in 2009. , PvK via Wikimedia But L-3 and Air Tractor’s chief rival in this market, a small North Carolina-based company called IOMAX, who is not taking part in the trials at Holloman, publicly suggested the Air Force had made a special exception to let the OA-802 into the experiments. “This is a perfect example of the Air Force changing its requirements,” IOMAX’s head Howard told Aviation Week . One of the key issues is the Air Force’s apparent desire for the light attack aircraft to have an ejection seat. IOMAX says its original aircraft, also based on the AT-802, was barred from the service’s earlier Light Air Support (LAS) program because it lacked this feature. SNC and Embraer ultimately won that competition and the U.S. military has since facilitated the sale of its A-29 to Afghanistan and Lebanon. According to IOMAX, the Air Force revived the ejection seat requirement for OA-X. This disqualified the company’s new Archangel, which uses the Thursh 710 crop duster as its base airframe. The IOMAX Archangel., IOMAX “We’ve got an escape capability inside the cockpit – a more efficient egress solution,” Howard explained to FlightGlobal . “It’s not an ejection seat.” His complaint is that the OA-802 doesn’t have an ejection seat, either. The implication is that the Air Force removed this stipulation at the last moment after IOMAX had given up trying to get into the competition. Even before responding to these criticisms, the L-3 and Air Tractor team’s Twitter account had been keeping an eye out for stories related to OA-X, and actively promoting its participation. The other response to IOMAX specifically were as pointed as the “vanquished politician” remark “USAF set a high bar for Military Flight Release in OA-X,” another declared. “One has to compete to win…Iomax [sic] isn’t.” “Competing is hard work,” a third read. “Throwing mud…not so much.” This harsh language may seem like it came out of nowhere. However, this isn’t the first time IOMAX has publicly criticized the Air Force’s decision to work with L-3 and Air Tractor. In January 2017, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon’s top weapons broker, announced plans to help Kenya purchase a fleet of AT-802L aircraft and associated equipment, spare parts, and support services. The total deal was worth approximately $418 million. IOMAX, as well as it supporters in Congress, subsequently argued that the Air Force, and in particular the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, a special projects office better known as Big Safari , had deliberately steered the contract to L-3 and Air Tractor. Big Safari has worked extensively with L-3 in the past on a number of projects, including the aforementioned delivery of modified AT-802s to Jordan. “They were given a raw deal,” Representative Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican, told Fox News in March 2017. “We want to know why IOMAX was not considered.” These comments sparked questions in Kenya about whether the country’s government had been duped into overpaying for the aircraft. L-3 and Air Tractor denied there had been any collusion or misrepresentation of their product in that contract. Separately, the Air Force and Big Safari have weathered similar criticism for their decision to let L-3 decide what airframe to use as the base for its replacement for the aging EC-130H Compass Call jamming aircraft. That provoked formal protests from Bombardier and Boeing, both of whom argue that L-3 will be inclined to unfairly choose Gulfstream to supply the planes. It’s still too soon to say whether or not this dispute will have any impact on the OA-X experiment or its outcome. However, depending on the results, it could easily add another layer of complexity to any final decision the service makes about whether or not to buy a fleet of light attack aircraft.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Everything You Need To Know About The Royal Navy’s New Type 26 Frigates,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After years of delays and debate, construction of the Royal Navy’s future Type 26 frigates has officially begun at a shipyard in Scotland. The full class of eight ships will provide a number of critically needed capabilities, including acting as additional escorts for the United Kingdom’s up-coming pair of supercarriers. The first of those flattops, HMS Queen Elizabeth , is in the middle of her first sea trials in the North Sea. On July 20, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Defense Secretary Sir Michael Fallon led a ceremony to cut the first steel for the lead ship at BAE Systems’ Govan shipyard in Glasgow. At the same time, he revealed that the ship would share its name with the city and that the next seven ships would also take on similar names. As such, HMS Glasgow and the rest of the Type 26s would become known as the City -class. “HMS Glasgow and the other seven frigates in this new class will protect our powerful new aircraft carriers and nuclear deterrent, helping keep Britain safe across the world,” Fallon said at the event . “The Type 26 is a cutting-edge warship that will maintain our naval power with a truly global reach. Designed for a service life of at least 25 years, the Type 26 frigates will form a backbone of the future Royal Navy surface fleet well into the future.” Originally known as the Global Combat Ship (GCS), BAE’s frigate will displace approximately 6,900 tons and have a crew of just more than 150. A pair of electric motors, four high speed diesel generators, and a gas turbine will provide onboard electrical power and propel the ship to a maximum speed of over 30 miles per hour over a range of some 7,000 miles. An artists conception of a Type 26 frigate with a Merlin helicopter on its rear helipad., Crown Copyright Intended primarily for anti-submarine warfare, the ships will have both a sonar system in the bow and a built-in towed sonar array, both linked to a central BAE Systems battle management system. An enlarged helipad and attached hangar can accommodate a Wildcat or Merlin helicopter or vertical takeoff capable drones, any of which could carry torpedoes or additional sensors. In addition, the vessel will have significant air defense and surface warfare capabilities, consisting of 12 vertical launch system (VLS) cells for the Sea Ceptor surface to air missile and another 24 multi-purpose Mk 41 VLS cells. European defense consortium MBDA’s Sea Ceptor missile is a navalized variant of the company’s active radar homing Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM). Like the U.S. Navy’s RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), each VLS cell can hold four Sea Ceptors, giving each ship a total of 48 missiles in a relatively compact space. Already in active service, the missile also fit quad-packed into the existing launchers for the older Sea Wolf and the Royal Navy began arming its existing Type 23 frigates with the new weapons in 2016. Raytheon’s Mk 41 VLS can accept a variety of weapons, including the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) and various models of the surface-to-air Standard Missile . The U.S. Navy has also become interested in the possibility of an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile that will fit in the cell, most notably Lockheed’s stealthy and highly capable Long-Range Anti Ship Missile (LRASM). An official infographic says the inclusion of launchers will give the ships “the widest possible choice of weapons to counter threats as they emerge.” BAE Systems On top of these missiles, each Type 26 frigate will have five-inch gun in a turret on the foredeck with a range of at least 20 miles. Rocket-assisted or guided ammunition, various types of which are already in development, could expand the capabilities of this weapon. In addition, there will be a variety of smaller cannons and machine guns, including the ubiquitous Phalanx CIWS, for close-in self protection against incoming missiles, swarms of small boats, and similar threats. A BAE Systems Artisan 3D radar will be the City -class’ main sensor to spot enemies on the surface and the air. This is the same type fitted to Queen Elizabeth , which will give the new frigates additional interoperability when working with the larger carriers. Though there is limited information on what other equipment could end up on Glasgow and the other Type 26s, it seems like that additional sensors and electronic warfare measures will be on the final ships. All of these features would allow the City -class ships to support other, larger surface combatants as part of a carrier battle group or other task force. The ships should be able to operate independently in elevated threat environments, as well. And the Royal Navy is badly in need of additional capable surface combatants. https://youtube.com/watch?v=nK0GGTyoWPc As The War Zone noted in its deep dive into the Queen Elizabeth carrier , the Royal Navy would need to commit significant numbers of ship to escort the flattop during actual operations. With only six Type 45 Daring -class destroyers and seven Astute – and Trafalgar -class attack submarines, as well as another 13 Type 23 frigates, in total as of 2017, the service could be hard pressed to sortie out a carrier battle group while still conducting other missions, yet alone two battle groups. Typically the U.S. Navy sends its supercarriers out with a guided missile cruiser, three destroyers, and at least one Los Angeles -class attack submarine, in addition to vital logistics ships. The City -class could help potentially reduce the burden on the Darings or other ships, too. Intended to be modular, somewhat like the U.S. Navy’s controversial Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), each City -class ship will also have reconfigurable “mission bay” to allow it to perform additional tasks. One of these could launch and recover rigid hull inflatable boats for boarding or other specialized missions. Another will reportedly have unspecified drones that can carry disaster relief ashore, according to an official infographic. The #RoyalNavy & #RoyalFleetAuxiliary in 2017 (complete fleet graph) https://t.co/4ksctW41Ww pic.twitter.com/8Ua8cMfn7I — Naval Analyses (@D__Mitch) May 1, 2017 Depending on the particular mission, the Glasgow and its sisters could accommodate more than 200 personnel in total, which could conceivably include Royal Marines or special operations forces. While the hangar is too small to store such a helicopter, the ship’s helipad is big enough to accommodate a heavy lift type such as a CH-47 Chinook, which could also support missions on shore. Also, similar to the American LCS debacle , the planning for what ultimately became the Type 26 began in the late 1990s, but was delayed and slow-rolled due to funding issues and debates over required capabilities and the ship’s exact purpose. The program slogged along until 2015, when the Ministry of Defense finally signed a formal development deal. But Defense Secretary Fallon made clear the following year that there would be no actual production until the design offered actual “ value for money .” An artists conception of rigid hull inflatable boats in the Type 26’s mission bay., Crown Copyright The overall cost of the project could continue to be a significant factor in both how fast . The U.K. Ministry of Defense’s contract only covers the first three City-class ships and carries a price tag of 3.7 billion Pounds. According to Secretary of Defense Fallon, the country’s government will have to negotiate another deal for the last five ships and said that might not happen for another six to 10 years . The United Kingdom’s defense priorities and the overall state of the world could be very different in a decade. Right now, the United Kingdom’s Conservative-led government is still pushing budget austerity and associated cuts amid concerns about what the country’s planned exit from the European Union, more commonly known as Brexit , might do to its overall economy. This might help explain why the Royal Navy will name all Type 26 ships after cities, a decision also akin to the original plans for LCS, which has since given way to variety of different monikers. The general concept is that naming a ship after a city gives it an immediate connection to a larger community, which in turn gains an interest in keeping the ship in active service. In explaining why he abandoned the traditional “denizens of the deep” naming convention for the Los Angeles -class attack submarines, U.S. Navy Admiral Hyman G. Rickover famously said “ fish don’t vote .” The U.K. government’s comments have echoed many of the same sentiments about a project Fallon said would “support and sustain” approximately 3,400 jobs. The Type 26 Glasgow will be the eighth Royal Navy ship to bear that name, the last of which was a Type 42 destroyer that sustained bomb damage during the Falklands War in 1982 and retired from service in 2005.

On July 17, 2017, HMS Richmond , a Type 23 frigate, found itself escorting a flotilla of Chinese warships as they passed through the English Channel on their way to link up with the Russian Navy for drills in the Baltic Sea. Two months earlier, HMS Somerset , another Type 23, did the same for one of Russia’s Kilo class submarines, the Krasnodar . And in January 2017, the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force both shadowed the Russian carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and her own escort as they passed by on the way home from operations off Syria. HMS St. Albans sails alongside the Admiral Kuznetsov and her escort while RAF Typhoon fighter jets fly overhead., Crown Copyright The Baltic Sea in particular has seen increasing air and naval activity since NATO began stepping up exercises in response to the crisis in Ukraine in 2014. Russia responded and the tit-for-tat drills have only increased since then. At present there is already an especially large number of ships in the area ahead of a Russian naval parade in St. Petersburg scheduled for July 30, 2017. The Royal Navy has also sent a Type 45 destroyer, HMS Duncan , to the Black Sea to join the U.S.-led Sea Breeze 2017 exercise off Ukraine. This is in addition to the service’s various other training and operational commitments in the North and South Atlantic – including patrolling near the disputed Falkland Islands – the Pacific, and throughout the Middle East. When the first Type 26s enter service they will become an important part of the Royal Navy’s continuing global naval presence. It’s not clear when the last of the eight City -class ships might be ready for combat. The Ministry of Defense expects HMS Glasgow and two of her sisters to enter service by the mid-2020s, the same time frame it expects HMS Queen Elizabeth to be operational. In the meantime, the Type 45s and Type 23s will continue to be at the core of the Royal Navy’s surface power in an increasingly busy neighborhood.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 4, 2019",US Special Operators Are Moving Closer to the Fighting in Raqqa,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S.-backed Syrian forces have been fighting for weeks to liberate the strategic city of Raqqa from ISIS terrorists, who claimed it as their de facto capital. Now, new images suggest that American or other coalition special operations forces may be taking a more active role in the offensive that could put them nearer to the actual fighting and at increased risk of taking casualties. On July 17, 2017, pictures began to appear on social media of flat bed trucks carrying M1245A5 M-ATV mine protected vehicles. On July 20, 2017, additional images emerged of another convoy with more M1245s, as well as a number of up-armored Caterpillar D9 bulldozers. The M1245 is the U.S. military designation for the special operations forces-specific model of the Oshkosh M-ATV. These vehicles are easily distinguished from other American types by the enclosed, protected cargo compartment at the rear of the vehicle. The A5 denotes the version equipped with the M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) II, which allows troops inside to fire the top-mounted weapon – most commonly a .50 caliber M2 machine gun – without exposing themselves to enemy fire. It also gives them thermal imaging surveillance capabilities. Oshkosh derived its Light All Terrain Vehicle, or L-ATV, from the M-ATV. In 2015, this vehicle won the competition to become the U.S. military’s new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which is set to replace a significant number of iconic Humvees across all branches of service. Though they look similar, the L-ATV is significantly lighter than the M-ATV and is better suited to more general use in various settings. There have been no confirmed reports of the U.S. military or its coalition partners supplying M-ATVs of any type or any vehicles with the M153 CROWS II to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group that includes both the Syrian Arab Coalition and the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, better known by the acronym YPG. Unnamed U.S. officials told Defense News that these vehicles were not part of any U.S. aid to the rebel coalition, which has previously included light armored vehicles and other heavy weaponry . New pictures from #US deliveries of armoured vehicles to #PKK -affiliated #YPG that is stuck in #Raqqa fighting #ISIS . #Syria pic.twitter.com/Ys0B3QELFB — Dennis Kurt | Defense Observer (@byz_observer) July 19, 2017 Of course, the presence of coalition special operations forces in and around Raqqa is hardly surprising. American special operators have been actively conducting raids against ISIS and other operations in support of the SDF in Syria since 2014. In March 2016, members of the U.S. Army’s elite 75th Ranger Regiment began making very public shows of force in an apparent attempt to keep the peace between SDF and Turkey, who views the Kurdish elements as dangerous terrorists . A more common U.S. military M-ATV variant with the open rear section., USAF However, the M-ATVs and bulldozers did begin to appear as reports emerged claiming that U.S.-supported rebels were making especially slow progress against the ISIS defenders. U.S. military officials were quick to push back against these assertions. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the top spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, which is leading the coalition fight against ISIS, took to twitter to make clear that the SDF had not halted its operations. He added that the rebel forces had already captured more than 13 square miles of territory from the terrorists that week. Operations to #DefeatDaesh in #Raqqa continue. #SDF claimed more than 35km2 from #ISIS this week. #SDF have NOT suspended ops; not true. — OIR Spokesperson (@OIRSpox) July 18, 2017 “We knew going in that Raqqa was going to be very hard,” Pentagon spokesman U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis then told reporters on July 18, 2017. “There is not a consistent degree of progress in any military campaign, it’s a stop and go effort by its very nature.” But expected or not, the truck loads of vehicles seem to confirm reports that resistance has been stiff. On top of that, as Iraqi forces found in Mosul, ISIS fighters continue to make extensive use of deadly booby traps and improvised explosive devices, including massive vehicle-based suicide bombs . There have been reports of motion-activated IEDs , as well. Common portable or vehicle-mounted jamming equipment may not defeat some of these designs, which began to appear in Iraq as far back as 2011, if they do not use radio remote controls as triggers. All of this would make for slow going on the part of the attackers. Iraqi bulldozers, along with an M1 Abrams tank, push down a street in Mosul in March 2017., AP It would explain the inclusion of bulldozers in the convoy. In the battle for Mosul, and elsewhere in Iraq, the armored construction equipment became an essential part of operations, able clear traps and other obstacles relatively quickly to allow friendly forces to advance. They were also sturdy enough to shield troops from IED blasts and block car bombs from getting to their target. “There can be no liberation without the bulldozer,” 19-year old Iraqi Private Mohammed Ali al-Shwele told The Washington Post , which wrote a detailed profile on the vehicles and their use in Mosul, in May 2017. The 19-year old bulldozer driver had become a viral sensation after sharing a cellphone video of himself getting rammed by an explosive-laden car. The M-ATVs would be similarly essential for special operators working closely with SDF forces in the city and an indication of the increased risks they face. Early on in the Mosul offensive in 2016, other M1245A5s had quickly appeared – some humorously bearing the names of Disney “princesses,” including Elsa from Frozen and Mulan from the film of the same name – along with American advisers. As time went on, the elite troops repainted many of the sand-colored armored trucks black to help blend in with their counterparts from the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service. It makes perfect sense that special operations forces would want to be as close as possible to the local units they are supporting. The proximity would speed up the process of calling in air or artillery strikes, as well as helping make sure shells and bombs fall on the right targets. If nothing else, being on the ground would simply give advisers a better sense of the battlefield and the immediate needs of SDF units. US Marines conduct a fire mission in Syria with an M777 howitzer in March 2017., USMC This would only be the latest similarity between American involvement in the liberation of Mosul and the offensive into Raqqa. In March 2017, U.S. Marines set up a secretive artillery base in Syria. Before operations in Mosul kicked off, Marines deployed to a very similar site south of the Iraqi city, before the U.S. Army took over the mission. Since then, there have been reports since that the number of these emplacements may have grown or that American artillery crews have moved closer to Raqqa ahead of the liberation campaign. The U.S. military has even released official photos and video, including a slickly-produced trailer of sorts, of these troops in action with their 155mm M777 howitzers. Some of this imagery showed the Marines were employing the low-cost XM1156 fuze kit , which turns regular high-explosive shells into GPS-guided projectiles. Other forces may be employing the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and its GPS-directed 227mm rockets, which has already been a popular weapon in the fight against ISIS. GPS-guided artillery in general has been an important part of American operations in both Iraq and Syria, as it is both accurate and able to find its mark in through dust, smoke, and storms. In addition, unlike air strikes, which can be hampered by low clouds or poor weather, artillery on the ground can generally provide fire support in spite of these adverse conditions. Pictures and video from local sources have also shown Marine supply convoys moving back and forth in northern Syria under heavy escort in apparent support of these positions. These logistical elements almost certainly have been ferry cargo to dispersed units from a growing number of American outposts in the country. Many of these sites are large enough to accommodate fixed wing cargo aircraft, including the U.S. Air Force’s C-17s and C-130s , as well as helicopters . Officially, none of the U.S. troops are technically involved in directly fighting ISIS in either Iraq or Syria. But there is substantial evidence that the definition of “direct combat” has gotten stretched in Iraq and Syria. Photographs and video have shown special operations forces snipers and U.S. Army mortar teams , among other elements, working very closely with Iraqi forces in Mosul. “Fortunately, they’re not engaged in direct ground combat themselves,” Lieutenant General Stephen J. Townsend, head of CJTF-OIR, still insisted to reporters on July 11, 2017, speaking about coalition forces in both Iraq and Syria. “They’re advising. They’re firing artillery and rockets, and they’re advising their partners.” Whatever the definition, it appears that special operators may now be moving at least physically closer to the actual fighting in Syria, running an increased risk of finding themselves further entangled in the country’s fluid political situation where a variety of armed groups with differing agendas are battling each other.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 14, 2018",USAF and USN Try New Fixes But Still Struggle With Aircraft Oxygen Woes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy are still trying to figure out what’s choking pilots in a number of different aircraft following months of reported incidences of “ hypoxia-like ” symptoms. The Air Force is looking to change the software on some of its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters to help address the issue on the aircraft, while the Navy appears to be narrowing its investigation into similar problems with the T-45 Goshawks to focus on potential contamination of the airflow. On July 18, 2017, the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) told Defense News that F-35A jets from the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona would get an update for the aircraft’s computer-controlled onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS). The change would modify the algorithm the system uses to determine the appropriate oxygen concentration for the pilot depending on the situation. However, “there is no indication the delivered oxygen concentration was a contributor to any of the recent events,” Brandi Schiff, an F-35 JPO spokesperson, added to Defense News. Since the Air Force is still unsure of the exact cause or causes of hypoxia-related incidents at Luke, the software update may or may not ultimately help. On June 9, 2017, the 56th Fighter Wing stopped flying its Joint Strike Fighters after the unit had five separate hypoxia-like incidents beginning the previous month. It later emerged that there had been 10 additional instances among Air Force F-35 pilots dating back to 2011. On June 21, 2017, the 56th’s commander, Air Force Brigadier General Brook Leonard, ordered his fliers back to work after implementing a number of new safety protocols, including limiting how high pilots could fly and requiring the use of multiple backup oxygen systems. USAF Despite that the recent hypoxia events have only occurred in jets flying from Luke, at least that we know of, the Air Force has decided to ultimately install the software patch on all of its Joint Strike Fighters. Defense contractor Honeywell, which makes the F-35’s OBOGS, is in charge of crafting the new code and devising a plan to get it out to the rest of the fleet. The JPO explained to Defense News that it had no idea how much the change would ultimately cost, or who would pay for it. Depending on the wording of existing contracts, Honeywell could have to perform the fix at no cost. On top of that, it could take up to two years before all of the Air Force’s F-35As got the update. “Cost estimates are still being developed,” Schiff told Defense News. “The current time estimate is 24 months, but the F-35 joint program office … is pushing Lockheed Martin to accelerate the fielding of this new firmware.” The extended time frame could point to possible separate problems with using the F-35’s Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) as the single manager for future software changes, as well as other potential dangers with that arrangement . The ALIS computer acts as a loader for much of the stealthy jet’s software and its associated networks provide a centralized point of contact between the aircraft, their operators and the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin. If the updated OBOGS firmware does indeed go out using the system, it could expose a potential vulnerability to cyber attackers , who might be able to hamper flight operations by disabling or disrupting the OBOGS after finding a way to break into the network in the future. If anything else, it is a reminder that cyber attacks on the F-35’s ALIS could target industrial controls that run tertiary components of the jet that are not involved with its combat systems but are just as critical to mission success. Regardless, since the oxygen concentration has not been conclusively linked to the issue, this patch won’t stop the Air Force from continuing to exploring the problem with regards to the F-35As at Luke. On July 19, 2017, a team of officials from the JPO, the Air Force’s own F-35 integration office, and the 711th Human Performance Wing , arrived at the base to begin a “heat exhaust study,” spokesperson Air Force Major Rebecca Heyse told Defense News. Situated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, the 711th maintains the service’s OBOGS laboratory to help study and address hypoxia episodes. Though there were no details about what this would necessarily entail, it seems likely this will involve gathering data on how the F-35’s OBOGS brings in and processes the air. As on many other aircraft, the Joint Strike Fighter’s system bleeds off air from the engine before filtering it and passing it to the pilot’s breath mask. A problem with the design or with how the system is repaired might allow in particles that could limit or contaminate the oxygen flow, giving fliers hypoxia or similar symptoms. T-45 Goshawk trainers., USN At the same time, the Navy is reportedly conducting a similar investigation into the flow of air through the OBOGS on the T-45. The service effectively grounded the fleet of jet trainers in April 2017 after it became public that instructor pilots were refusing to fly due to reports of hypoxia. Instructors are still allowed to fly below 5,000, but the issue has largely halted sorties critical to training new Navy and Marine Corps pilots. Again, it’s not clear why the T-45 is apparently choking crews or why there has been a dramatic spike in reported physiologic episodes among Goshawk pilots since 2015. In 2014, there were only 12 such events. The next year there were 27, with this number rising to 38 in 2016. Before the Navy instituted its flight restrictions in April, there had already been 21 hypoxia-like cases for the year. Now, the Navy is focusing on the potential contamination of the air coming from the aircraft’s Rolls-Royce F405 engine. This came after a review concluded that the arrangement was “not equipped to continuously provide clean, dry air” to the OBOGS, according to Aviation Week , which added that the service would begin testing air samples for toxic material by the end of July 2017. In addition, Aviation Week offered a detailed explanation of how the T-45’s particular OBOGS works and how contaminants might work their way in: The problem is that there are countless opportunities during the OBOGS cycle for contaminants to enter the airflow. In the T-45, the bleed air from the compressor section of the engine flows through a cooling heat exchanger and enters the OBOGS, where it first passes through a heater, particulate filter and pressure reducer. The air is then directed to a sieve bed material loaded into two identical canisters. Each canister’s sieve bed material absorbs nitrogen, passing the concentrated oxygen to a mixing plenum—or box—and then to the pilot’s regulator and mask. The nitrogen absorbed in the sieve bed is purged from the system. The ability of the OBOGS to produce usable oxygen depends on clean, dry air, delivered to the air crew in the right pressure and volume, flowing into the system. Moisture is a particular problem; due to the sieve bed’s high affinity for water, any contaminants trapped there could be exchanged for moisture and then released from the OBOGS into aircrew breathing air. USN At the same time, the Navy hopes to get the jets back to full operation using its own “mitigation measures” akin to those the Air Force instituted at Luke for the F-35s. “These mitigations monitor the breathing gas and alert and protect our aircrew, as well as incorporate new maintenance procedures to ensure the systems are clean and working properly prior to flight,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, commander of Naval Air Forces, said, according to Aviation Week. Rolls-Royce said it was working closely with the Navy on the issue, but that possible contamination of the airflow from the T-45’s engine was only one of “many potential root causes.” There is no indication yet as to why the air from the engine would have suddenly become a problem in the last two years or why hypoxia has not been an issue among the many other operators of BAE’s Hawk family. Beyond the F-35A and T-45 fleets, there has also been a notable and similarly unexplained increase in reported hypoxia among the Navy’s F/A-18 Hornets and EA-18G Growlers in recent years, too. In a guest commentary for The War Zone in April 2017, Commander Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka, who had spent time as the Weapon System Officer in the F/A-18 Hornet and as the Radar Intercept Officer in the F-14 Tomcat, said pilots were “getting a good old fashioned run around as no current solution for repairing [the Hornet’s] OBOGS currently exists.” Since 2010, Ruzicka said the Navy had blamed the bulk of recorded hypoxia episodes in Hornets and Growlers on breathing contaminated air or a loss of cockpit pressure , but had yet to find a “smoking gun.” There has been no appreciable movement on the issue with regards to the F/A-18s and EA-18Gs since then, even though the service has now linked at least four deaths to oxygen deprivation. Pilots’ luck in escaping these situations unharmed may have already run out. An EA-18G Growler., USN In June 2017, Military.com reported that the service’s latest “solution” for Hornet and Growler pilots would be to issue each aviator a Garmin Fenix 3, a $450 wristwatch that can measure air pressure and altitude. Based on a preset configuration, the watches would alert pilots if things inside the cockpit got to a dangerous point, providing another early warning tool before any actual physiologic event. This, of course, does nothing to actually address the problem and some engineers at the Naval Air Systems Command reportedly warned that the Garmins might only provide “false sense of security.” But this all gets at the core issue with determining the cause of and fixes for reported hypoxia cases. Aircraft and individuals perform differently under different conditions and what impacts one pilot may not affect another, or may do so in a different way. Recreating the events in a safe, controlled environment on the ground is difficult. “It’s like chasing a ghost,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Mike “Nasty” Manazir, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Systems and a career Navy pilot, told members of Congress during a hearing in February 2017. “You can’t figure it out, because the monitoring devices that do this are not on the airplane.” If the problem continues to expand and impact more aircraft types, the Air Force, Navy, and other services will have little choice but to keep looking for solutions no matter how hard they might be to find. Ignoring the problem simply isn’t an option . Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Navies Sea U.S. Navy"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 24, 2019","Russia Says It Has Plans For Not One, but Two More All-New Combat Aircraft","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has announced it is looking to start work on two all new combat jet designs, a fifth-generation successor to the supersonic MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor called the PAK DP and an as yet unnamed short or vertical takeoff and landing carrier fighter jet to go along with the country’s equally ambitious naval modernization plans . Though these would be significant additions to the country’s arsenal, other such aircraft programs have repeatedly proven to be complex and costly and it could be years before the Russian military actually gets these planes into service, if it ever does. On July 14, 2017, Russian officials and representatives from MiG said there was a basic concept in the works for a MiG-31 replacement and that a formal research and development program would start some time in 2019. Then, at the MAKS 2017 air show in Zhukovsky on July 18, 2017, Deputy Defense Minister Yury Borisov revealed that the Kremlin was in talks with the country’s aviation industry about a new fighter design , ostensibly to go along with stalled plans for a new supercarrier . “We are currently developing the concept of a long-range interceptor aircraft to bring a proposal to our main customer [the Russian Defense Ministry],” Ilya Tarasenko, MiG’s director general told journalists on July 14, 2017, according to Russian state-run outlet Sputnik. “I hope that in the near future we will start research and development work [pertaining to the new plane].” Russian Aerospace Forces chief Colonel-General Viktor Bondarev confirmed the broad plans for the new PAK DP. The Russian air arm desperately needs this plane as it expects the existing MiG-31s will start hitting the end of their life cycles before 2030. Derived from the MiG-25 Foxbat , the Foxhound first flew in 1975 and the last aircraft rolled off the production line in 1994. The aircraft have a service ceiling of more than 67,000 feet and can reach Mach 2.8 at that altitude. Vitaly Kuzmin Like the Foxbats, the Foxhounds were primarily interceptors, intended to shoot down incoming American bombers in the event of a major war between the Soviet Union, its allies, and NATO. But while the MiG-25’s design was geared toward high-altitude missions against then state-of-the-art supersonic bombers, such as the B-58 Hustler and the planned follow-on XB-70 Valkyrie , the MiG-31’s main target was low-flying “penetrating” B-1 Bones and B-52 Stratorfortresses. As such, engineers at MiG made sure the Foxhounds had significantly improved low-level performance, as well as phased array radars and long-range weapons with look-down-shoot-down capabilities. So, in addition to being able to engage low- and fast-flying aircraft like the B-1, this also meant the MiG-31s had the ability to detect and shoot down cruise missiles. The interceptors still had good high altitude performance, too. The front cockpit of a MiG-31 in 2011, full of analog dials and gauges., Vitaly Kuzmin After the Cold War, though the overall size of the fleet shrunk, Russia continued flying and updating the remaining MiG-31. In 2015, the Russian military introduced the latest upgraded versions, known as the MiG-31BM . The updated aircraft included a host of new or improved avionics, fire control, communication, and navigation equipment. Most notably, however, the BM models have two encrypted digital datalinks, one for talking to command centers on the ground and another for sharing information other aircraft, including additional MiG-31BMs, as well as the latest iterations of the MiG-29 Fulcrum and advanced members of the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker family. This level of networking gives pilots in the MiG-31 additional situational awareness, as well as providing additional capabilities to other fighter jets that may lack its powerful sensors. And despite their age, the MiG-31s seem important as ever to Russia’s integrated air defense scheme . By design, the jet’s high speed and long range make it ideally suited to rapidly responding to potential threats even in the country’s most remote regions, especially territory close to or above the Arctic Circle . In 2015, four of the jets demonstrated off their capabilities by reportedly shooting down an air-launched Kh-55 cruise missile with the help of an A-50 early warning radar aircraft. Earlier in July 2017, the Russian Navy released video claiming one of its Foxhounds had knocked down a supersonic cruise missile in the stratosphere during an exercise. As part of the Kremlin’s expanding interest in space-based warfare , there are also reports that the Russian Aerospace Forces are considering developing an anti-satellite weapon for the MiG-31BMs. But the MiG-31 is showing its age with a decidedly unstealthy shape full of hard angles lifted largely from its 1960s-era Foxbat predecessors that would make it increasingly vulnerable to advanced air defenses and stealthy enemy fighters. With the youngest jets being more than 20 years old, the basic condition of the airframes can only become more and more of serious issue, as well. A view of the rear cockpit of a MiG-31 in 2011, show a very old style radar display., Vitaly Kuzmin Though the aircraft undoubtedly still have more life in them, the process of developing and testing the low-observable fifth-generation PAK DP, as well as the systems to go inside it , is likely to be long and expensive. The experience of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter shows that the complexity of next generation fighter jets can make for exhaustively costly programs that span decades rather than years. The Russians don’t even have to look abroad to know this, having encountered many of these issues already with their T-50/PAK FA fighter jet and PAK DA bomber projects. Despite initial plans to have built 150 of Sukhoi’s T-50 stealth fighter by 2020, the Kremlin has now scaled that back to a buy of just a dozen aircraft . This year, after more than seven years of flight testing, the Russian military hopes to finally take delivery of the 10th and 11th pre-production prototypes.  The program has been beset by delays, accidents , and rumors of massive design changes, along with very public criticism from India , which has become an increasingly frustrated partner in the endeavor. In particular, the T-50’s engines have been a major problem. If MiG expects the Foxhound replacement to closely match the older aircraft’s top speeds and “super cruise,” all while lugging around large long-range missiles, it would likely need bigger and likely more complex turbines. There are real questions about whether existing Russian aircraft engines would be up to the task and developing an all new powerplant could drag out the development timeline. The Kremlin has similarly slow-rolled Tupolev’s PAK DA bomber , which has reportedly been in the works since at least 2008. Despite nearly a decade of development and the expectation that the first prototype will take to the sky in 2019, there hasn’t even been any official concept art of the design.  Now, the Russian government wants to restart production of the older Tu-160 Blackjack, which would seem to be a tacit admission that its new stealth bomber is still a long way off. The Yak-141 prototype hovers at the Farnborough Airshow in 1992., Ken Videan via Wikimedia And all of this applies doubly to any plans for a new short or vertical take-off and landing capable jet fighter, an uncommon type of aircraft that no Russian manufacturer has built even as a prototype since the cancellation of the Yakovlev Yak-41/141 in the early 1990s. The Russian aircraft maker famously sold much of the technical design package for that aircraft to Lockheed Martin, which used it as a jumping off point in developing the F-35. At present, the F-35B is the only vertical take-off and landing fighter in active production anywhere in the world. In the 1990s, Yakovlev reportedly proposed a follow-on design to the -41, known as the Yak-43 , but there is no evidence this ever proceeded beyond the conceptual stage. Deputy Defense Minister Borisov said that any future design would be derived from the old Yaks, but it’s not clear how useful those designs might be to an all-new development, even one that only offered similar capabilities to late fourth generation fighters. It’s not immediately clear why the Russian Navy would need this type of fighter, or any new carrier fighter at all. The service’s only carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , does not have any such aircraft in its air wing at present, relying instead on navalized Fulcrums and Flankers instead. After returning from a debacle of a deployment to the Middle East earlier in 2017, with its aircraft suffering a number of accidents while taking off and landing , Kuznetsov is now set for a major overhaul. This effectively leaves Russia without any carriers, or the need for specific carrier aircraft, whatsoever for the foreseeable future. Even when and if it ultimately returns to service, the last of the new MiG-29KRs only entered service in 2016 making it odd that there would already be a need for another new carrier fighter. In addition, the Indian Navy has reported significant issues with its own MiG-29K aircraft, including persistent engine and airframe problems, all leading to low availability rates. So, money for a new carrier fighter might be better used to make sure the latest existing models work properly. A model of the proposed Lavina-class. , Artem Tkachenko via Wikimedia Russia is supposedly looking to build a line of Lavina- class amphibious assault ships , a replacement for a planned fleet of Franco-Russian made Mistral class ships . The French had canceled this deal in response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014. This new amphibious assault ship is reportedly configured for helicopter operations only, but could potentially field a fighter matching Deputy Defense Minister Borisov’s basic description and operate in a similar way as the American “ Gator Navy ” flattops with their AV-8B Harriers and F-35B Joint Strike Fighters. But it remains questionable if Russia could even build a ship as big and complex as the proposed Lavina- class, so developing a niche STOVL fighter for it seems frivolous to say the least. Beyond the actual development of the aircraft, Russia’s economic difficulties and international political realities could easily make it even more difficult to build and field both the PAK DP interceptor and the new carrier fighter. Starting in 2014, the global price of oil, one of the Russian government’s primary sources of revenue, began to drop. That same year, the Kremlin seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea region and began actively supporting separatists fighting that country’s government, triggering widespread international condemnation and sanctions. Foreign pressure has only increased as Moscow continues to support Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad in his brutal effort to suppress a long running rebellion against his regime. The Kremlin’s international relationships and allegiances could potentially impact export sales of the PAK DP, something that might help spread out the cost of its development. This is especially true given the otherwise growing fifth generation fighter market . Sukhoi’s long in development T-50 stealth fighter., Dmitry Zherdin via Wikimedia Of course, MiG designed the original Foxhounds with Russia’s needs in mind specifically and there have been no export sales of the type to date. This would likely continue to be the case with the PAK DP. Regardless, the Russians don’t appear to be having much trouble making new inroads into various world arms markets, including the Middle East and Africa , and there are reports that the country is looking to team up with the United Arab Emirates on a new fighter aircraft . Though defense spending to modernize the country’s armed forces remains a clear Kremlin priority, there is an ever present question about how Moscow intends to pay for all of these programs on top of existing plans. Just in March 2017, the Russian Federal Treasury publicly released budget figures that showed significant cuts to the military in the upcoming fiscal cycle of somewhere between 10 and 25 percent. In addition to the aforementioned gutting of the expected T-50 purchases, this has already apparently stymied plans for the aircraft carriers the new carrier fighters would reportedly fly off of, as well as threatening work on new amphibious assault ships that could potentially benefit from the aircraft as well. Even Russia’s much touted advanced battlecruiser design has been put on indefinite hold, along with new nuclear-powered destroyers , due to fiscal limitations, according to some sources. There are also new submarines and ice breakers to squeeze into any future budget. And PAK DP and the new carrier fighter would be in immediate competition with the PAK DA bomber and the Tu-160 restart project over this increasingly limited pool of money as well. At present, Russia expects to begin buying production T-50 stealth fighters in 2018. If that timeframe hold true, and there’s no guarantee it will, this suggests the Kremlin won’t be purchasing the final PAK DP aircraft until 2030 at the earliest. When the Russian Navy might see a new carrier fighter, or a new ship to carry it, is anyone’s guess. Update : Shortly after posting this story, Russia announced that it is also going to field a 5th generation light fighter that will “be developed by 2025.” Once again, any information on how the country was planning on paying for yet another high-end weapons system development program has not been released.
