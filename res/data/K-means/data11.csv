By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has denied conducting an air strike against unknown gunmen along the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border and Afghan officials have now said their Tajik neighbors were responsible for the aerial attack. The border skirmish comes as the Kremlin continues to advance an unfounded conspiracy theory that the United States, or its allies, is using secret helicopters flights to support terrorist groups, including ISIS’ regional franchise , in Northern Afghanistan. The air strike reportedly occurred on Aug. 26, 2018, in part of the â€œno-manâ€™s landâ€ separating Afghanistanâ€™s Takhar Province from Tajikistan to the north. In addition, Tajikistan’s border guards exchanged fire with the armed individuals on the ground, killing as many as eight militants and wounding six more, but losing two of their own in the process. Mohammad Jawid Hejri, a spokesperson for Takharâ€™s provincial authorities, initially said that foreign â€œfighter jetsâ€ had carried out the strikes. Unnamed Afghan officials later told the countryâ€™s Tolo News that it was only one aircraft and that it belonged to Tajikistan. Russia has thousands of troops forwarded deployed at a base in Tajikistanâ€™s capital Dushanbe as part of bilateral agreement, but its not clear if it has any fixed wing aircraft assigned to units in the country. The Russian military has, however, deployed combat jets to the country for training exercises in the past. A row of Russian helicopters at Kulyab Airfield in Tajikistan during a drill in 2017., Alexey Kudenko/Sputnik  via AP Tajikistanâ€™s own air force is extremely small and has limited capabilities, with its only fixed wing combat jets being four Czech-made L-39 Albatros dual-purpose jet trainer and light attack aircraft, not all of which may be airworthy. There were no additional details from Hejri or other sources, at least according to the available English-language reporting, that specified what kind of planes were involved specifically. It is possible that an armed helicopter, such as an Mi-24 Hind gunship or Mi-17 armed transport , which Russia and Tajikistan both operate in the country, actually flew the strike, as well. Adding to the confusion, both Russian and Tajikistan authorities have both denied conducting an air strike of any kind. The NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan also said it was not involved in any way in the incident. â€œAfghanistan has no control over its airspace due to a lack of facilities,â€ retired Afghan air force general, Atiqullah Amarkhel, told Al Jazeera on Aug. 27, 2018. â€œU.S. forces should follow up the case.â€ A Russian L-39 jet trainer. Tajikistan reportedly has four of these aircraft that can also conduct light attack missions., Dmitry Terekhov via Wikimedia There is also a debate about who exactly the militants were to begin with. Khalil Asir, a spokesman for the provincial police force in Takhar, said they were members of the Taliban , though the governorâ€™s spokesperson Hejri identified them simply as drug smugglers . The Taliban are involved in the narcotics trade , but the group itself denied any involvement , claiming that it had not authorized its fighters to engage security forces from neighboring countries. This assertion is dubious given the organizationâ€™s long history of terrorist operations in Pakistan, though it may reflect the group’s main focus on ejecting the NATO-led coalition from Afghanistan. It is hardly unusual to hear confusing and conflicting reports about the fighting in Afghanistan from various parties, including from the countryâ€™s central government in Kabul and NATO officials. It is that difficulty in establishing many of the basic facts of any given situation in Afghanistan that has allowed Russian authorities to keep effectively spreading rumors that the United States has been working hand-in-hand with militant groups, such as ISIS, in Northern Afghanistan since at least 2017 .Â The Kremlin couches its claims by saying it is only asking for answers about already unfounded reports about sightings of mystery helicopters dropping off terrorists and supplies for them at sites in Afghanistan near the Tajikistan and Chinese borders. A grainy, night-vision shot of a US CH-47 Chinook supporting Afghan commandos during an operation., Resolute Support Mission â€œWe draw attention again to the flights of unidentified helicopters in the north of Afghanistan, delivering weapons and ammunition to local Daesh [another term for ISIS] militants and Taliban fighters, who are cooperating with the Daesh terrorist group,â€ Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Aug. 23, 2018 , in one of the more recent comments on this â€œissue.â€ â€œAccording to the statements by the Afghan media and local residents, such flights have recently been recorded in the province of Sar-e Pol.â€ â€œUnidentifiedâ€ helicopters in N.Afghanistan deliver arms and ammunition to local ISIS militants.

As we at The War Zone have examined in depth in the past, the claims about mysterious terrorist-supporting helicopters in that province and neighboring regions are completely unfounded. The allegations trace back to comments that Zahir Wahdat, governor of Sar-e Pol, made in May 2017, which did not implicate any particular country as being behind responsible for the flights. Afghan officials routinely deny the claims entirely, though there may be some truth to the sightings of helicopters in the region.Â In the dark, almost any helicopter is likely to appear “black” and “unmarked.” American forces, especially special operations forces, along with their allies and Afghan partners, routinely conduct operations after the sun goes in order to maximize the element of surprise and their technological superiority to try to catch terrorists and insurgents off guard. In addition, there simple presence of U.S. military personnel operating discreetly in areas with significant ISIS or Taliban presence does not mean they are somehow supporting those groups. A map of Afghanistan showing both Sar-e Pol and Takhar Provinces in the northern part of the country., Golbez via Wikimedia It remains equally unclear if Russia is actively supporting the Taliban, despite U.S. government claims that there are indications that this is the case. The group does appear to be getting Russian-made equipment, including night-vision goggles , but these items could come via the thriving black market in the region. Regardless, Russiaâ€™s claims about ISIS in Afghanistan serve â€œto legitimize the actions of the Taliban and provide some degree of support to the Taliban,â€ U.S. Army General John Nicholson, the outgoing commander of American and other NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, told the BBC in April 2018. â€œWe’ve had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and [they] said, this was given by the Russians to the Taliban.â€ But despite all of these murky details, it is still notable that the border skirmish occurred so soon after the Russians re-iterated their claims about the mystery helicopters. A core component of the Kremlinâ€™s well-established misinformation and disinformation campaigns has been to assert it is actually its military or political opponents who are responsible for the nefarious actions â€“ or worse â€“ that they themselves stand accused of committing. An Afghan policeman in Badakhshan Province, which also borders Tajikistan, walks past a pile of burning drugs in 2016., Mohammad Sharif Shayeq/NurPhoto/Sipa via AP The Russian government, and its intelligence services in particular , uses overt and covert methods to amplify these claims, especially on social media . The accusations can then rapidly take on an organic quality that is difficult to differentiate from the initial state-sponsored propaganda. It then creates a feedback loop, by which the Kremlin often cites ostensibly independent actors to support its claims. One of the most common uses for this tactic has been in relation to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assadâ€™s employment of chemical weapons against rebels and innocent civilians as part of his brutal, Russian-backed campaign to reassert control over his country. Russia state and quasi-state media often release statements, without any conclusive supporting evidence, claiming that rebels and terrorists are preparing to stage false flag attacks to make it look like the regime in Damascus is responsible. As in Afghanistan, the Kremlin often accuses the United States or other Western countries of actively aiding terrorists in Syria conduct these operations. On Aug. 26, 2018, RT put out an unprecedented virtual play-by-play on Twitter detailing yet another one these supposed false flag preparations in Syriaâ€™s Idlib Governorate. Not surprisingly, this came in advance of an imminent Russian-backed offensive to clear rebels out of the region. Similar offensives in the past year and half have routinely involved reported chemical weapon attacks .

In April 2018, the United States, along with the United Kingdom and France, launched a massive cruise missile barrage against various pieces of the Syrian governmentâ€™s chemical weapons infrastructure. In Afghanistan, the latest incident along the Tajikistan border may be nothing more than a rare skirmish between Tajik authorities and one of many potential armed actors. The Taliban have been resurgent across the country and have been stepping up their attacks in Takhar Province , among other places , in recent months. The timing is still curious and also comes as the Russians trying to arrange a peace summit between the Afghan authorities and the Taliban â€“ a group the Kremlin regularly reiterates is â€œ banned â€ in Russia, as ISIS â€“ along with other regional stakeholders. The Russians seem intent on trying to supplant the United States as a key power broker in the conflict, which continues to be, at best, a grueling stalemate .

Earlier in August 2018, the Afghan Ambassador to Russia, Abdul Qayyum Kochai, claimed, also without providing any clear evidence, that the Kremlin had struck a deal with the Taliban to provide them with support of some kind in exchange for their cooperation in fighting ISIS in Afghanistan, something the Russians deny. â€œI canâ€™t even hypothetically imagine how Russia could use the Taliban for fighting the IS,â€ Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Aug. 21, 2018. However, he added that â€œwe fight the IS with all means available, we support Syria in that struggle, we help equip the Iraqi army for the same goal, and we naturally would like to see the people of Afghanistan getting rid of the IS.â€ It remains to be seen whether the Russian peace summit will occur at all, if any more clarity will emerge about the Kremlinâ€™s connection to the Taliban, or if the actual facts behind the supposed sightings of mystery helicopters will become apparent. Until any of those things occur, weâ€™ll be keeping our eyes and ears open for any new into what might be truly occurring along the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 19, 2018",Russia Proved How Stupid Western Media Is At Defense Reporting With This Ridiculous Contraption,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov—which carries the name of Mikhail Kalashnikov, who gave birth to the legendary AK-47 rifle—pulled off what would be laughable PR stunt, or it would have been if the results weren’t so frustrating. The sad part is that western media bought right in , taking what is no more than a cheap vaporware weapon mockup that wouldn’t pass muster as a prop in a made for TV movie and turning it into a viral news story. Enter the ever more wanna-be diversified Kalashnikov Concern’s “Igorek” mecha . It’s 13 feet tall and supposedly weights 4.5 tons. Yeah, it’s also going to be heavily armored and the operator will be able to fire giant weapons from its claws, and it will be in testing soon and so on and so forth. Rostec Facebook So, let’s be clear, this is not real. They stuck a bad approximation of a science fiction mecha/walker outside of their concourse at the Army 2018 weapons expo to grab attention. There are nearly no actual military applications for such a vehicle and the development that would be needed to make it work on even a near useless level on the battlefield is laughably out of reach for Russia, and that’s a blessing in this case, not a curse. Rostec I don’t have to explain its tactical vulnerabilities and mobility issues either. We have all seen enough Hollywood blockbusters to figure that out. And while the United States did develop a mecha of sorts during the Cold War, it was heavily shielded and intended to service a nuclear-powered bomber, not clearing the streets in Western Syria and building fortresses. A small number of other experiments were even less successful. Rostec So, this is a publicity stunt, and a bad one at that, but one that has deep pop culture cross-overs that the press, and especially the defense-related press (see Space Force a s an example ), loves to finagle into headlines. But no, this isn’t your Star Wars, Avatar, or anime dreams becoming a reality. There won’t be any glorious battle against these things on any forest moons anytime soon. It is just… Crap. Star Wars was one of a long line of science fiction works that made bipedal manned robotic vehicles part of popular culture, regardless of how insanely impractical they actually are. , Starwars.com I get it, trust me, we all have our stinkers. No journalist or commentator bats 1000, but outright playing into something as ridiculous and underdeveloped as this on anywhere near a serious level is straight-up malpractice. And I am the first to remind people to not underestimate America’s peer state competitors, including Russia . That stance has proven me right more than any other over the years and in this case I am sticking to it, because Russia wouldn’t be stupid enough to actually plow heaps of rubles into this fantasy. They have other far clearer priorities that have already sucked funds away from much more relevant and higher profile weapons programs . What’s scary is that I received so many messages asking me to write something about this thing. Eventually I decided to do just that to underscore how far many writers will grease a low-hanging fruit like this to get some traffic and make their day a little easier, not to build up bullshit hype about a near-future in which huge two-legged science fiction robots become a battlefield reality. Mechas continue to be science fiction fan favorites till this very day. , Avatar screencap While this wouldn’t be that big of an issue under most circumstances, the fact that Moscow has actively played the western press and has multiple information warfare campaigns running at any given time on a scale not seen since the Cold War, makes this type of thing just a bit annoying. But don’t hate the player, hate the game. It’s been a constant stream of these unfeasible weapons ideas that are put out for consumption to the masses who don’t know any better by a press that needs the traffic and loves to ride the hyperbole train, especially on a topic as opaque and often misunderstood as defense issues. From ATV riding androids to mini robotic tanks and everything in between—all of which are actually just radio controlled contraptions—the western press largely buys into Moscow’s narrative that they are developing a robot army and that a ‘Skynet’ scenario could be right around the corner, but with the Kremlin at its controls. Advanced artificial intelligence is not a remote controlled robotic dummy on a scooter, and when it comes to robotics alone, Russia is far behind the United States. Additionally, robots are only one example of this steady stream weapons fantasy. For instance, there’s this mechanical battle suit —that also offers a cloaking system now incidentally—but is actually just a costume. Then there is Russia’s claims that they are developing everything all the time, from strategic bombers to nuclear supercarriers to a bunch of new fighters . Yet at the same time they can’t even afford the far less ambitious equipment they have already developed . Although we have to report of some of these developments because there is truth buried within each pile of disinformation, getting to that truth has become increasingly challenging. So to those who wonder why we are always so skeptical of Russia’s weapons development claims, it’s for good reason. Sometimes they even weight successful and promising weapons programs down with outlandish capability claims, always seeming to be in competition with the United States. It’s counterproductive in so many ways, to say the least. So there you have it. Russia’s semi-state run weapons industry jumped the shark with this one and it’s time the press does their job and calls them out for how stupid this looks not exclaiming how it will be exciting when the next war looks just like the one on Pandora. And what’s most alarming is that this mentality is also spilling into western defense topics, where just a fiberglass mockup of a fighter jet and some buzzword filled powerpoint presentations makes reporters act as if the thing actually exists, when the real question should be is it even feasible in the first place. I get that these things are exciting for these things, I get excited too, but get a grip people. And keep in mind, this is all coming from a guy that has the name of a famous, two legged, gun and missile slinging robot on his license plates. I shouldn’t be the adult in the room on this one. That alone should give you an idea of just how insulting all this is to our collective intelligence.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",Air Force Offers First Details Of Future Plans For An Upgraded B-52J Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Air Force moves closer to starting a major re-engining program for its B-52H Stratofortresses, it is reportedly considering adding in additional upgrades to ensure the bombers will remain combat capable through at least 2050. These updates could include improvements to the iconic plane’s avionics, defensive suite, sensors, ejection systems, and flight data recorder, with the resulting aircraft receiving the new designation B-52J. Aviation Week’s Aerospace Daily & Defense Report was the first to report on the developments, citing anonymous sources who attended a recent industry day event at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. Tinker is where the Air Force conducts heavy depot maintenance on both the B-52 and B-1 bombers and is home to the shop in charge of maintaining the Stratofortress’ existing TF33 engines . There is also no indication that the proposed “B-52J” nomenclature is in any way related to previous concepts that used that moniker, such as the B-52 Stand-Off Jammer (SOJ) electronic warfare platform or unofficial B-52J arsenal plane concepts . At present, the B-52J configuration is only a “potential future effort,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Lance Reynolds, the program manager for B-1 and B-52 systems within the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, told the gathering of industry representatives, according to Aviation Week’s sources. However, there had already been indications that the service was considering combining other upgrades with the re-engine effort. A previous industry day briefing at Tinker in December 2017 said the Air Force wanted the new jet turbines for the B-52 to provide at least 400 kilovolt-amps (kVA), and potentially up to 500 kVA, to power a digital engine management system and unspecified future upgrades. More modern engines will just vastly improve the bomber’s fuel efficiency and range capabilities, which you can read about in more detail here . A slide from a December 2017 US Air Force briefing outlining requirements for the B-52 re-engine program, including increased power generation to enable future upgrades., USAF Since the bombers would have to be out of service for an extended period of time to receive the new engines, taking that opportunity to install other new equipment would make good sense. The upgrades would also be logical additions given other recent upgrades that have already expanded the B-52’s capabilities as a conventional arsenal plane , including a new internal “smart” rotary bomb rack that allows the aircraft to carry various precision guided munitions inside its bomb bay. Though the B-52Hs have already received a number of cockpit and avionics updates over the years, just adding in a full glass cockpit would be a major boon for the bomber’s crew. Replacing the rows of old “steam gauge” analog dials with large multi-function displays could ease the workload on the pilots and provide for better integration and information sharing between the aircraft’s various flight management, navigation, and targeting systems and crew stations. It would also help support the digital engine management arrangement, which could be part of a larger system to monitor the “health” of various systems and provide more detailed information to help warn ground crews and potential issues or help them isolate problems. The Air Force is already integrating similar systems into the glass cockpit on its Block 45 KC-135R aerial refueling tankers, many of which are of the same Cold War vintage of the B-52s. The present B-52H cockpit does have two small digital multi-function displays, but is still predominantly full of analog “steam gauges.”, USAF Improved defensive systems will also be essential, especially against potential high-end opponents, if the Air Force intends to keep flying the bombers until 2050. These additions might include upgraded electronic warfare equipment , jamming resistant systems , and electronic support measures (ESM) to both jam hostile radars and just spot and geo-locate those threats, giving the bomber’s crew enhanced situation awareness and help them avoid hazards to begin with. The Air Force and the Navy are both increasingly interested in the possibility of adding hard-kill active protection systems with either physical interceptors or directed energy weapons to actually shoot down incoming missiles to a wide variety of aircraft, including tankers, transports, and other special mission platforms. Another possibility could be the addition of directional infrared countermeasures . A layered suite of new defenses could help the B-52 maintain an ability to operate in at least marginally contested environments or better defend itself against enemy fighter jets or other threats while acting as a arsenal plane from the very edge of a hostile integrated air defense network full of long-range surface-to-air missiles and powerful radars and other sensors . The B-52J upgrades could also include relocating the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod from its present position under the right wing to another spot on the aircraft. Moving this targeting system under the fuselage or into the would give it a better field of view. This could be a good opportunity to add in an improved version of the Sniper or additional sensors, such as day- and night-vision capable electro-optical or infrared video cameras with higher fidelity, as well. This B-52 carries a Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod in the current standard position under its right wing., USAF It is not entirely clear what upgrades the Air Force might be considering for the B-52’s ejection system. Aviation Week reported that this would involve “an ejection seat,” but the aircraft already has those for each one of all of its crew members. There is a provision for a non-ejecting jump-seat in the main cockpit, so there is a possibility that the proposal could be to add an ejection capability in this position. This is unlikely since it would require extensive modifications to the forward fuselage, though. The existing system is already complicated and two of the crew members would get ejected downward in the process, making it dangerous to do so at low altitudes, including during takeoffs and landings . The Air Force could also be considering some sort of modification to the latter portion of the egress arrangement to better ensure everyone can get out in an emergency. The plan may just be to upgrade the ejection seats in the four top-firing positions. A member of a B-52H crew sits in a non-ejecting seat during a training mission., USAF It’s similarly unclear what the driving factors might be for the proposed improvements to the flight data recorder, but B-52s have suffered notable accidents in the past decade, including a fiery crash at Andersen Air Force base on Guam in 2016 and an engine falling off another one of the bombers during a training flight in 2017. The U.S. military as a whole has seen a significant spike in aviation mishaps , as well, which could have prompted the Air Force to push for improved ways to gather information and assess the causes of incidents in general. It’s not clear whether the Air Force has even a prospective timeline for when it could start and then finish a B-52J update program across the existing Stratofortresses. If the service did link the upgrade effort to the re-engine project, it could have a full fleet of rebuilt bombers by the mid-2030s . USAF However, the Air Force based that timeline for the re-engining program on the idea that it would award the first contracts for the work starting in the 2018 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, 2018. While we don’t know exactly where in the contracting process the service is, it seems highly unlikely that it will be able to announce the deals and pick a winner within a little over a month. What is clear is that the Air Force remains determined to fly the B-52s in combat for decades to come and the planes will need continuing upgrades to remain a viable tool in higher-risk contingency operations. It will be interesting to see how the bombers’ capabilities, and any future B-52J configuration, grow and evolve to meet those demands.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 5, 2018",Russian Flotilla Appears Off Syria as Accusations Fly Ahead of Assad’s Next Big Offensive,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a dozen Russian warships are either in the eastern Mediterranean Sea or will be there soon, forming an armada of unprecedented size off the coast of Syria. The buildup comes as Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad moves closer to kicking off for a major offensive into Idlib Governorate , an important rebel stronghold, and as the Kremlin accuses the United States and its allies, without offering any evidence , of preparing to strike the regime in Damascus over any future use of chemical weapons . As of Aug. 28, 2018, the Russian Navy task force near Syria consisted of a large surface action group , with the Soviet-era Slava -class guided missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov in the lead , along with a trio of more modern Admiral Grigorovich -class frigates , the Udaloy -class destroyer Severomorsk , and other vessels, many of which are armed with Kalibr land attack cruise missiles. There was also a pair of Kilo -class attack submarines attached to the force, which can also fire Kalibrs. Russia’s Northern and Black Sea fleets had both contributed ships to the operation. In terms of total ships, this is the largest Russian naval buildup in the region since Russia first intervened on behalf of Assad in 2015. In 2016, the Kremlin dispatched another flotilla with eight vessels, but this included the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy , two of the largest ships in Russia’s Navy. That naval force arrived off the Syrian coast ahead of another offensive, the one to route rebel forces from their long-time stronghold in Aleppo. “The Russian Navy has dispatched substantial naval forces to the Mediterranean, including several ships equipped with modern cruise missiles,” NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu told Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Aug. 28, 2018. “We will not speculate on the intention of the Russian fleet, but it is important that all actors in the region exercise restraint and refrain from worsening an already disastrous humanitarian situation in Syria.” The Russian Navy’s first-in-class frigate Admiral Grigorovich. , Vasiliy Batanov/Sputnik via AP It seems most likely that Russia is positioning itself to support Assad’s reportedly imminent push into Idlib. Russian ships in the Mediterranean Sea , as well as the Caspian Sea , together with combat aircraft and ground-based missiles and conventional artillery , have supported the Syrian government’s offensives on and off since 2015. In December 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared total victory over terrorists and rebels in Syria, but made it clear that his country would continue supporting Assad for as long as necessary. His pronouncement turned out to be premature and, in May 2018 , Putin said that the Russian Navy would continue to maintain a permanent, rotational presence in the Eastern Mediterranean “given the persistent threat of terrorist incursions.” Situated in Syria’s northwest, Idlib has remained a bastion for rebel forces opposed to Assad and has stubbornly resisted previous offensives in spite of Russia’s very active support. In February 2018, militants managed to shoot down a Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft in the region. It is also reportedly the source of a steady stream of attacks using improvised unmanned aerial vehicles against Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in neighboring Latakia Governorate, as well as its Tartus naval outpost further to the south. In January 2018, rebels launched an unprecedented mass drone attack on Khmeimim and the Kremlin says militants have stepped up their unmanned operations in recent weeks. The Russians insist that none of those attacks have been successful and it has been difficult to verify the claims one way or another. There has been a steady stream of reported incidents since the beginning of 2017. The video below shows improvised unmanned aerial vehicles that Russian forces say Syrian rebels attempted to use to attack Khmeimim earlier in August 2018. At the same time, there have been reports that Assad’s forces may be planning to use chemical weapons to flush out the rebels from Idlib and sow panic among the region’s civilian population, as they have done in other major Syrian government offensives. In addition, on Aug. 21, 2018, the United States, along with the United Kingdom and France, threatened military action against Assad’s regime if the regime’s forces employed these tactics again. In April 2018 , these three countries launched a series of cruise missile strikes against a number of Syrian government chemical weapon-related sites. “Our position on the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons is unchanged,” the joint statement read . “As we have demonstrated, we will respond appropriately to any further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, which has had such devastating humanitarian consequences for the Syrian population.” This has, in turn, prompted Russia to accuse the United States and its allies of aiding rebels in preparing a false flag attack that would provide the justification for striking Assad again. The Kremlin has provided no evidence to substantiate its claims, which include the assertion that U.K. private military company Olive Group , under the direction of the U.K. government, is directly supporting these activities in Syria. This is not the first time the Russians have made these types of allegations against the United Kingdom and the accusations fit a now-typical pattern of deflection and disinformation that has become a hallmark of Russia’s information operations in general. At the core of the Kremlin’s playbook is to accuse its opponents of actually being responsible for whatever it or its allies stand accused of, if not more heinous actions altogether. Even if these reverse claims aren’t believable , they serve to muddy the waters and add confusing and conflicting information into what is already a complicated situation. Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov, who is often a fount for outlandish claims regarding the United States and its allies in Syria., Vadim Savitskii/Sputnik via AP That the Kremlin is making these statements at all is a strong indicator that Assad is considering the use of chemical weapons or that the Russians believe he will. They also may truly believe that the United States, the United Kingdom, and France would be inclined to act again militarily in response to such actions. Russia might hope that its flotilla of ships in the eastern Mediterranean will serve as a deterrent, making the U.S. military and its allies wary of striking targets in and around Syria for fear of inadvertently hitting Russian forces. Just having such a large number of vessels there could simply serve as a potential hazard to navigation for any American-led naval force looking to get into position to fire cruise missiles at Syrian targets or offer advance warning of those strikes. It could also complicate the planning and risk analysis for such an operation, since U.S. and allied commanders would have to take into account, at least to some degree, a host of new potential threats to friendly ships and aircraft operating in the eastern Mediterranean. In the April 2018 strikes, British and French aircraft, as well as French ships, fired their cruise missiles into Syria from this general area and the U.S.-led strike force set up combat air patrols and aerial refueling tanker orbits in the area to both protect and support the operation. There would also be the dangerous possibility that firing cruise missiles over Russian ships might lead them to believe they were the ones actually under attack and to respond in kind, resulting in a far more serious international incident. It is still unlikely that American and Russian forces will actually come to blows , though. If the U.S.-led strikes in April 2018 , as well as a slew of Israeli air and missile strikes in the past few years , are any indication, the Kremlin’s forces in Syria are either not authorized to respond in any way, in order to prevent the situation from escalating into a larger conflict, or are simply incapable of doing so even if they wanted to. In addition, in the previous American-led strikes, U.S. forces largely avoided the Mediterranean, firing a significant portion of their cruise missiles from ships in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and from aircraft flying into Syria via Jordan to the South. That’s not to say that there aren’t significant tensions between Russia and the United States, the rest of NATO , and other American allies and partners that could potentially take even more worrisome turns. In September 2018, more than 300,000 troops from Russia, China, and Mongolia will take part in the largest Russian military exercises since the end of the Cold War. Russian officials have publicly said that the drills, known as Vostok-2018, or East-2018, are a message to its international opponents. “The country’s [Russia’s] ability to defend itself in the current international situation, which is often aggressive and unfriendly towards our country, means [the exercise] is justified,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a conference call on Aug. 28, 2018. A training carries Chinese Type 99 tanks in Russia ahead of the Vostok-2018 drills., Evgeny Yepanchintsev/Sputnik via AP It’s not clear whether Vostok-2018 will have any more of a deterrent impact than the appearance of the Russian naval force off the coast of Syria. It is a clear indication that Russia intends to continue responding to foreign policy challenges with assertive behavior . As for how the situation in Syria will play out, that also remains to be seen. There are reports that Russia is attempting to broker a deal, possibly with Turkey , to get rebels and supportive civilians out of Idlib. The Syrian government has cut similar deals with militants and terrorists in the past, which have sent them into areas of Eastern Syria where U.S.-backed forces are in control or out of the country entirely. This has allowed the Syrian regime to fill the void with pro-government civilians . An earlier arrangement actually sent rebels from the suburbs of Damascus into Idlib , which effectively concentrated them in that region. After his forces take control of Idlib, which seems to increasingly inevitable, Assad will have reasserted his authority in virtually all of western Syria , save for a portion in the north where Turkish forces have established a buffer zone in order to fight Kurdish groups . Rebels prepare to leave the greater Damascus area for Idlib in May 2017 as part of a deal with Assad’s regime., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP There are also reports that the U.S. government is engaged in talks over the situation with the Russian government and may be trying to set the stage for some sort of resolution to the conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump has long advocated for pulling U.S. troops out of the country and turning responsibility over to a mix of local forces and foreign partners. To bolster its own position and shield Assad, Russia appears to have put into motion a multi-part hybrid plan that involves both an information warfare campaigned backed up by a pre-planned and otherwise candid military response. Whatever happens, it appears the Kremlin intends to throw its full weight behind Assad’s next offensive and there are strong indicators that what will already almost certainly be a brutal campaign in Idlib is very likely to include a new spate of chemical weapon attacks.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There appears to be a contact-style naval mine floating in the waters near Bainbridge Island, Washington. This island is located directly across from Seattle and vessels have to navigate around either side of it to reach the sprawling Kitsap Naval Base. The base is home to one of the Navy’s most important shipyards as it i s capable of servicing even the largest supercarriers and is a major decommissioning site for retired nuclear powered vessels. KGW.com reports that the mine was spotted near Brownsville Marina, which sits across the channel from the western side of the island. The Coast Guard has simply called the object ‘potentially unexploded ordnance’ and is patrolling a 1,500 meter perimeter around it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 15, 2023",Israel Unveils Updated Armored Command Vehicle And Will Give Merkava Tank Crews X-Ray Vision,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged of what appears to be updated command vehicle variant of the Israeli Army’s Ofek armored vehicle, which is a derivative of the Merkava tank . The new development comes as Israel pushes ahead with a major upgrade program for the Merkava itself, which will include an augmented reality system that will allow the crew to “see” in any direction outside without having to leave the vehicle and expose themselves to hostile fire and an artificial intelligence-enabled mission computer. On Aug. 28, 2018, multiple users on Twitter posted images of the latest version of Ofek, which means “horizon” in Hebrew. Jeremy Binnie, the Middle East & Africa Editor for Jane’s Defense Weekly wrote that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had said the vehicle was specifically for command and control purposes. Ofek features a large, fixed superstructure on top of a modified Merkava hull and chassis. The available images show the latest examples bristling with radio aerials and vehicle in Binnie’s picture also had what looks to be a large, round satellite communications antenna on top. A side-by-side shot of one of them next to an older command vehicle based on the M113 armored personnel carrier , shows that the Ofek is significantly larger. It is likely able to carry more radios and other communications gear, as well as cooling systems for both the equipment and the crew inside cool. Binnie’s picture notably shows an air conditioning hose going into the vehicle through a hatch on the roof. This is likely only necessary for display, where the engine or any auxiliary power units won’t be running to power the onboard systems, but gives a sense of how hot the inside would otherwise get. The Israeli Army reportedly began testing the first Ofek prototypes all the way back in 2015, but at that time the vehicle’s main mission was as a heavy armored personnel carrier for support units, such as combat engineers. There were also plans to use the added space to turn them into armored ambulances and cargo carriers. The concept offered Israel a means of recycling old Merkava Mk IIs , which were starting to leave service at that time. The Israelis planned to have these tanks retired entirely by the end of 2016 . A standard Merkava Mk II tank., via Wikimedia Israel has a long history of creatively using obsolete tanks as the basis for “new” support vehicles and to fill other unique roles. Israel converted a number of older M60-based tanks into the covert Pereh missile launchers , which are disguised as normal tanks with fake gun barrels, but are actually armed with Spike-NLOS man-in-the-loop missiles. Ofek isn’t the first turret-less Merkava variant, either. In 2008, the Israeli Army had actually received the first Namer , a heavy armored personnel carrier based on the more modern Merkava Mk IV , which the service intended for more typical front-line infantry-carrying duties. US Army soldiers experiment with an Israeli Namer, another Merkava-based heavy armored personnel carrier, in 2012., US Army The standard Mk IV tank, which entered service in 2004, featured a host of significant improvements over earlier Merkava variants, including a more powerful engine attached to a new transmission, more rugged tracks, and upgraded passive armor, much of which carried over to the Namer. There is no indication that the Mk II hulls that got turned into Ofeks have received any similar updates to the vehicle’s powertrain or other components. The original Ofeks did feature a slat armor “cage” around the superstructure to help defeat rocket-propelled grenades and other infantry anti-tank weapons. The latest images show that the Israelis have replaced this with what appears to be an improved passive armor “bra.” These vehicles do not appear to have any sort of active protection system, such as Israel’s own Trophy system , which has become an increasingly standard feature on the Merkava . There are reports that they may be able to carry electronic warfare suites to jam remotely activated mines and improvised explosive devices. A Merkava Mk IVm Meil Ruach, or “windbreaker,” equipped with the Trophy active protection system., IDF But this latest version of Ofek is still likely to be an important addition to Israeli armored formations. Between the satellite antenna and the radio equipment, the vehicle and its crew look to be able to create an active network for any other tanks or other armored vehicles in its vicinity. The U.S. Army, among other military forces , is working along similar lines to implement an on-the-go high-bandwidth satellite connectivity capability. With these links to larger, overarching communications and data-sharing networks, Ofek could offer a secure and physically protected satellite uplink and local network relay, which would give Israeli units a significant advantage over opponents in both limited and larger scale conventional conflicts. Line-of-sight communications, in particular, quickly begin to suffer in dense urban areas and across complex terrain, such as hills and mountains, which are exactly the kinds of environments the IDF routinely fights in . The new iteration of Ofek also looks set to be a significant complement to the Israeli Army’s planned upgrades to their existing Merkava Mk IVs. By 2021, the Israeli Army hopes to receive its first production Mk IV Barak tanks . A standard Merkava Mk IV., MathKnight and Zachi Evenor via Wikimedia The main new feature of this variant, which the IDF unveiled in July 2018 , is the integration of Elbit’s Iron Vision helmet-mounted augmented reality system. This will be linked to a series of high-resolution cameras arrayed around the tank. The existing Mk IV has a number of more traditional optics, as well as the ability to receive full-motion video and other data from unmanned aircraft and other sources, but still offers limited visibility for the crew when they’re “buttoned up” inside with all the hatches closed, a long-standing issue for tanks and other armored vehicles in general. Iron Vision will give the crew immensely better situational awareness in any direction without the need for that offboard assistance. Similar to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System , the system will “stitch together” those feeds together and project them onto the helmet’s visor, giving crew members the ability to rapidly “see” in any direction from within the safety of the tank. This will also be especially valuable for urban operations, which inherently offer hostile forces multiple avenues to quickly attack a tank’s blind spots and then duck back behind cover. The Mk IV Barak is getting an improved version of Trophy to help guard against those threats, as well. The Mk IV Barak will also have improved network connectivity, allowing the vehicle to share a much broad array of information and do so rapidly. There will also be a new artificial intelligence-assisted mission computer to reduce the workloads for individual crew members, help them sift through sensor data and other information faster, and otherwise speed up the decision making and targeting processes. “The mission computer will be like a fifth crew member, which will improve processes in the cabin,” an IDF officer, identified only as Lieutenant Colonel Schachar for security reasons, told Jane’s in July 2018. “It’s designed to understand the situation and activate multiple touchscreens accordingly. This will form an inseparable part of the ability to conduct combat operations in closed, urban spaces.” Given the heavily networked nature of the Mk IV Baraks, Ofek could serve as a vital communications conduit and relay for other data between the tanks other forces, including those on the ground , in the air , or at sea . Adding AI-enabled mission systems and improved data links to the command and control vehicle could improve the flow of vital information, as well. If nothing else, the latest iteration of Ofek, along with the Merkava Mk IV Barak, show that the entire family of armored vehicles still has a lot of growth potential left. It will be interesting to see how the designs continue to evolve and what new missions they might take on in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2018",Virgin Orbit’s Rocket Launching Jumbo Jet Reminds Us A 747 Can Lug A 5th Engine Under Its Wings,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You arrive at your gate just ahead of boarding time. A gleaming 747 Jumbo Jet fills the terminal window. You saunter over to take in your marvelous aerial chariot before stepping onboard. You quickly do a double take—there is a 5th engine strapped under one of its wings! Yes, this really happened, multiple times. The 747 was designed with a so-called ‘5th pod’ capability in which it can lug a spare engine aloft, even on a revenue flight. The aircraft’s performance is impacted a bit in this configuration—with fuel economy being the biggest factor—but the aircraft’s handling characteristics remain largely the same. Virgin Orbit aims to use its 747-400 named ‘ Cosmic Girl’ as a first stage launch platform that will ferry its ‘LauncherOne’ rocket up into the flight levels before sending it and its pricey payload on its way into space. The pylon the company built for the aircraft to accommodate this exciting mission is just entering combined flight testing out of Victorville, California . Virgin Orbit’s use of a 747 was quite ingenious as they were not only able to leverage the jet’s outstanding performance, large support network, and weight-lifting abilities, but also its latent provision for attaching a large pylon under its wing as part of the 5th Pod engine ferrying system. In doing so they didn’t have to totally re-engineer the aircraft to accommodate a heavy-duty hardpoint. The 5th Pod system came out of a requirement to move large and expensive jet engines around on short notice and sometimes to remote locales to support fast-moving airline operations. When the 747 was designed there weren’t really options for rapidly shipping one of its high-bypass turbofan engines if need be. Instead, it would have to go by sea and land, which could take weeks, sidelining an expensive revenue producing aircraft in the process. But the best aircraft to ship one of the Jumbo Jet’s powerplants was another Jumbo Jet. This is where the 5th pod option came into play. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Qantas (@qantas) Qantas is most famous for using it, including during some revenue flights, which has clearly prompt a lot of questions from passengers. Qantas even made a little video about its use of the 5th Pod: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Oghpffvy19A It’s also worth noting that the 747 can fly with three engines , as well. So, while there is the 5th Pod option, there is also a three engine option when it comes to receiving a fresh motor and getting back into service. Over the 747’s nearly 50-year long career other airlines also leveraged the 5th Pod capability and did so repeatedly . But the fact of the matter is that this feature isn’t really unique to the 747. Other airliners also had or have the ability to externally transport a spare engine externally, including the L-1011 , DC-10 , 707 , DC-8 , and VC-10 . Even the big three-holers had extra engine transport capabilities. , San Diego Air And Space Museum Today there are far more robust and efficient logistical networks that crisscross the planet than there were decades ago. There are also multiple types of heavy-lift cargo aircraft available to move engines around if need be. The support infrastructure for airliners is far more mature, as well, and jet engines are even more reliable. So it all comes down to cost. What was a necessity decades ago is less so today and that’s why, like other aviation innovations , transporting extra engines under airliners’ wings is almost entirely a thing of the past. Regardless, with these obscure bits of aviation history in mind, it’s a bit puzzling how a space-launch concept that uses the 747 as a first stage hasn’t come into existence sooner. And beyond that, why haven’t these engine-hauling pylons on airliners been leveraged for other work? The defense/military applications, in particular, seem highly enticing, from hanging modular sensor pods on a big jet to carrying large weapons over long distances. The U.S. has the mighty B-52 to do much of its outsized weapons carrying work , but adapting commercially available 747s or other airliners with similar capabilities seems like a logical and downright economic step. This is especially true during the Cold War era where there were far more elaborate 747-based weapons concepts that gained some traction . With second generation 747s heading into the twilight of the airliner careers, an increasing number of airframes will be available for conversion to take on more exotic missions. We have already seen the type put to work as an engine testbed and now we are seeing it being used as a space launch system. But one can only think that there is a lot of untapped potential in those 5th Pod hardpoints. GE’s 747-400 test platform packing a giant GE9X turbofan., GE I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot more of them in the not so distant future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 13, 2018",Israeli Company Allegedly Flew A Suicide Drone On A Real Combat Mission In Azerbaijan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli government says it plans to charge executives and other employees of a defense contractor in the country with fraud and violating the country’s export controls for military equipment. The allegations reportedly stem from an incident in Azerbaijan in which executives from Aeronautics, Limited “demonstrated” the capabilities of their Orbiter 1K suicide drone by flying a very real strike on Armenian-backed forces in a disputed border region. Israel’s Ministry of Justice announced that it would bring the charges against Aeronautics, which came after a year-long investigation into the firm, in an official statement on Aug. 29, 2018. Though the press release offered few details, Israeli media separately obtained a leaked copy of a complaint within the Ministry of Defense that mentioned the Azerbaijan-Armenia connection and had reportedly touched off the proceedings, to begin with. Aeronautics “has never carried out a demonstration against live targets, including in this case,” the company said in a statement after Israeli newspaper Maariv first reported the Defense Ministry complaint. “We are convinced that after we first present our position at the hearing, the State Prosecutor’s Office will reach an informed decision that there is no reason to put the company or any of its officers in court and will order the case closed,” the firm added in a response to the public announcement from the Justice Ministry. Per Israeli media reports, the alleged incident occurred in October 2017. Officials in Azerbaijan requested the company’s personnel show off what the Orbiter 1K could do against ethnic Armenian personnel in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Israeli government has permitted private defense companies to demonstrate their wares in actual combat, but this is rare and is unlikely to have occurred in this case, since Israel does not view Armenia as an enemy, according to The Times of Israel . The video below shows Azerbaijani forces demonstrating their Orbiter 1K loitering munitions. The often violent dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh , also known as simply Karabakh, dates to before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of the two countries. Though part of Azerbaijan, the region has a significant ethnic Armenian population and a rebel movement that seeks to break away and join Armenia, which has, in turn, actively supported their aspirations. Aeronautics employees reportedly refused to carry out the 2017 mission and company executives subsequently stepped in to fly the drone themselves. Though it’s not clear if this was deliberate or not, the drone reportedly missed the target, only injuring two ethnic Armenian fighters. It could very well be that the executives made this decision consciously since Orbiter 1K has a so-called man-in-the-loop guidance system whereby the operator is either actively flying or otherwise monitoring the video feeds from the drone and they can see what it sees throughout the mission. This is specifically supposed to help improve accuracy since the operator can correct the course of the drone constantly and account for any movement on the part of the target. It also provides an option to abort the strike right at the last moment to avoid hitting innocent civilians or if the target is no longer reachable. Ethnic Armenian fighters of the Nagorno-Karabah Defense Army in 2016., RIA Novosti/Sputnik via AP This is a key feature of loitering munitions in general, which are a sort of a cross between a missile and a drone that can fly over a certain area using its onboard electro-optical and infrared video cameras to surveil the situation and search for targets. It also has an explosive warhead to directly attack any targets it finds. Israel has been at the forefront of the development of both loitering munitions and man-in-the-loop guidance packages . Azerbaijani authorities, which have developed very close ties with their Israeli counterparts, in no small part over their shared concerns about Iran, have also been very interested in the capabilities these suicide drones provide. The Orbiter 1K isn’t the only loitering munition the Azerbaijani military reportedly has in service. They have also acquired a number of the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harops and had successfully used them in combat prior to Aeronautics reportedly fraudulent “demonstration.” Azerbaijan used at least one in April 2016 to destroy a bus carrying ethnic Armenian fighters. In April 2018, video footage slipped out of Azerbaijani forces using Harop in a slickly produced music video honoring the country’s State Border Service. Earlier in August 2018, the suicide drones reappeared at drills along the Caspian Sea, on the opposite side of the country from Nagorno-Karabakh. You can see footage of Azerbaijani forces firing a Harop from a truck-mounted launcher at approximately 1:54 in the runtime of the video below. Though Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan , Russia , and Turkmenistan , all agreed in principle to a deal to finally divide up this body of water on Aug. 12, 2018 , it had long been a hotly contested region. The exact position of the maritime boundaries could block certain countries from exploiting the oil and natural gas resources under the land-locked sea. In 2001, an Iranian military vessel reportedly threatened a British Petroleum research vessel in a portion of the Caspian Azerbaijan had claimed as it national territory. Then, in 2009, Iran actually positioned its own oil rig in the same general area, prompting Azerbaijan to turn to the United States for help in handling the situation. Those tensions, combined with the Israeli Justice Ministry’s assertion that Aeronautics had fraudulently obtained some sort of authorization relating to demonstrating the Orbiter 1K in Azerbaijan, raise the possibility, albeit remote, that the company might have claimed they were planning to use the drone in some way against Israel’s arch-nemesis Iran . One of Azerbaijan’s Israeli-made Sa’ar 62-class patrol boats fires an Israeli-made MLS-NLOS missile during a drill in the Caspian Sea., State Border Service capture Israeli authorities had reportedly already begun investigating Aeronautics in September 2017, a month before the alleged strike in Nagorno-Karabakh, according to The Times of Israel . The Justice Ministry specifically accuses the company of “fraudulently obtaining something under aggravated circumstances,” Maariv ’s report explained. If the Israeli government had give the company a rare permit to launch an actual strike on Iranian forces, they might have already begun to have doubts about the legitimacy of those claims giving warming ties between Azerbaijan and Iran. In October 2017 , two Azerbaijani patrol boats visited the Iranian port of Enzeli in the Caspian Sea on a goodwill mission. It could also simply be that Aeronautics had obtained normal approvals for demonstration and export of the Orbiter 1K under false pretenses, even though they planned all along to conduct the live strike for Azerbaijani authorities. However, it is not clear how this would necessarily have been apparent to the Israeli government a month before the strike in Nagorno-Karabakh occurred. Whatever the case, and despite Aeronautics confidence that the Israeli government won’t decide to pursue the charges in court, the Justice Ministry has already suspended its export license pending the outcome of the situation. It will be interesting to see what new details come out about this case as the legal proceedings begin.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 6, 2018",Mystery Naval Mine In Puget Sound Was From Navy Exercise That Occurred Over A Decade Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a swift investigation into the matter, the U.S. Navy has concluded that a naval contact mine that surfaced in the Puget Sound near Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State was a relic from a technology demonstration exercise that the Naval Undersea Warfare Center held in 2005. The service confirmed that the mine, which looked like something out of a World War II movie, was inert, but it still posed a hazard to navigation and it will now conduct a thorough survey of the area to locate any other remaining mines from the event. The mine first appeared off the coast of Bainbridge Island in the Puget Sound on Aug. 28, 2018 . The Coast Guard cordoned off the area until the Navy sent in explosive ordnance disposal personnel to carefully assess the object and tow it to Port Orchard Bay, where they blew it up on Aug. 29, 2018 . “This exercise [in 2005] was an opportunity for academia to demonstrate various Unmanned Underwater Vehicles and their capability to detect underwater objects and avoid submerged obstacles,” the Navy said in a release, according to the Kistap Sun . The service had placed a number of inert mines underwater for the event and had apparently assumed they would stay submerged. The Navy did not say what exercise in 2005 the mine was from specifically, but a very likely candidate would be Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) Fest 2005, which the National Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Test and Evaluation Center (NUTEC) hosted in June of that year. At that time, NUTEC was a part of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which is itself located at Naval Base Kitsap. A map of the event’s test areas shows one that is almost perfectly aligned with where the mine appeared. The participants, which included teams from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , fit with the Navy’s description of the event offering academic institutions an opportunity to show off their underwater robotics developments. A map of the AUV Fest 2005 Operating Areas (OPAREAs). Shallow Water (SW) OPAREA 4 is almost exactly where the inert mine surfaced in August 2018., USN Since 2005, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, as well as the Navy as a whole, has significantly expanded its unmanned undersea vehicle efforts , including the development of new systems and tactics, techniques, and procedures for using underwater drones, especially to hunt for mines . Earlier in 2018, the Navy’s also stood up its first ever formal underwater drone squadron , Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One (UUVRON 1), at Naval Base Kitsap. This unit is assigned to the secretive Submarine Development Squadron Five (DEVRON 5), which oversees a number of specialized undersea elements, including the USS Jimmy Carter spy submarine.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 30, 2018",Boeing Is The Winner Of The Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray Tanker Drone Competition (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has announced that Boeing has won the contract to build four MQ-25 Stingray carrier-launched unmanned aerial refueling tankers. This is the culmination of a contracting process that began in earnest in 2017, but also reflects the latest developments in a saga that dates back nearly two decades. Boeing had submitted its striking design to the MQ-25 competition last December, facing off against General Atomics and Lockheed Martin. In October 2017, Northrop Grumman announced it would not compete for the contract with a modified version of its X-47B unmanned aircraft, which the Navy had tested extensively as a carrier-borne platform between 2011 and 2015 . Boeing was the only entrant with any sort of a fully realized prototype capable of flight. The contract announcement reads: The Boeing Co., St. Louis, Missouri, is awarded a ceiling price $805,318,853 fixed-price-incentive-firm-target contract to provide the design, development, fabrication, test, verification, certification, delivery, and support of four MQ-25A unmanned air vehicles, including integration into the carrier air wing to provide an initial operational capability to the Navy.  The work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri (45.5 percent); Indianapolis, Indiana (6.9 percent); Cedar Rapids, Iowa (3.1 percent); Quebec, Canada (3.1 percent); Palm Bay, Florida (2.3 percent); San Diego, California (1.5 percent); and various locations inside and outside the continental U.S. (37.6 percent), and is expected to be completed in August 2024.  Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds in the amount of $79,050,820 will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.  This contract was competitively procured via an electronic request for proposals; three offers were received.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity (N00019-18-C-1012). Boeing A huge congratulations for Boeing and the St. Louis team! You can read all out past MQ-25 coverage here and we will update this post as more information becomes available. Update: 3:57pm PDT— Boeing has released the following comment on today’s announcement: Boeing was awarded the engineering and manufacturing development contract to provide four aircraft. Boeing plans to perform the MQ-25 work in St. Louis. “As a company, we made an investment in both our team and in an unmanned aircraft system that meets the U.S. Navy’s refueling requirements,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Boeing Defense, Space & Security. “The fact that we’re already preparing for first flight is thanks to an outstanding team who understands the Navy and their need to have this important asset on carrier decks around the world.” MQ-25 is designed to provide the U.S. Navy with a much-needed refueling capability. According to the U.S. Navy, the MQ-25 Stingray will allow for better use of combat strike fighters by extending the range of deployed Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, Boeing EA-18G Growler, and Lockheed Martin F-35C aircraft. MQ-25 will also seamlessly integrate with a carrier’s catapult and launch and recovery systems. Boeing has been providing carrier aircraft to the U.S. Navy for more than 90 years. Boeing Update: 4:30pm PDT— Here is the Navy’s release concerning the announcement: WASHINGTON, D.C. (NNS) — The Navy awarded a contract to The Boeing Co. Aug. 30 for the MQ-25A Stingray, the first operational carrier-based unmanned refueling aircraft. This fixed-price-incentive-firm-target contract with a ceiling price of $805.3 million provides for the design, development, fabrication, test, delivery, and support of four MQ-25A unmanned air vehicles, including integration into the carrier air wing for an initial operational capability by 2024. “MQ-25A is a hallmark acquisition program,” said Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition James F. Geurts. “This program is a great example of how the acquisition and requirements communities work hand in hand to rapidly deliver capabilities to our Sailors and Marines in the fleet.” When operational, MQ-25 will improve the performance, efficiency, and safety of the carrier air wing and provide longer range and greater persistence tanking capability to execute missions that otherwise could not be performed. “This is an historic day,” said Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson. “We will look back on this day and recognize that this event represents a dramatic shift in the way we define warfighting requirements, work with industry, integrate unmanned and manned aircraft, and improve the lethality of the airwing — all at relevant speed.  Everyone who helped achieve this milestone should be proud we’re here.  But we have a lot more to do. It’s not the time to take our foot off the gas.  Let’s keep charging.” The award is the culmination of a competitive source selection process supported by personnel from Naval Air Systems Command and the Unmanned Carrier Aviation program office (PMA-268) at Patuxent River. MQ-25 is an accelerated acquisition program that expedites decisions that will enable rapid actions with less overhead. The intent is to significantly reduce development timelines from contract award to initial operational capability by five to six years.  By reducing the number of key performance parameters to mission tanking and carrier suitability, industry has increased flexibility to rapidly design a system that meets those requirements.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018",Lockheed Pitching U.S. Air Force On F-22-F-35 Hybrid Fighter Intended For Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin is reportedly pitching the idea of a new fighter jet that would combine features from its F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to the U.S. Air Force. It is also continuing to offer a similar proposal to the Japanese government and is now reportedly willing to let companies in Japan handle a significant portion of the research and development and production of the aircraft. Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber got the scoop that the Maryland-headquartered defense giant was looking to sell the U.S. Air Force on the idea of hybrid design that blends elements of its two previous stealth fighter offerings. Earlier in August 2018, the Nikkei Asian Review had also revealed new details of Lockheed Martin’s ongoing discussions with Japan about a very similar-sounding aircraft , which Japanese officials hope could be ready for service by 2030. “There’s a lot of potential in this idea [of a hybrid F-22-F-35],” David Deptula, a retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General, present Dean of the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, and long-time F-35 cheerleader , told Defense One . “I’m not suggesting that we jump right into it and embrace it, but from the Japanese perspective when they are looking at and willing to invest in this kind of an alternative as opposed to trying to build an indigenous aircraft that’s not going to get close to what an F-22 can already deliver. It’s a smart move on their behalf.” Lockheed Martin’s concept would reportedly marry the F-35’s core features, such as its advanced mission computer and extensive, inter-linked sensor suite , with an airframe design derived from that of the F-22 . The company would also be able to incorporate lessons learned in stealth coatings and other complex manufacturing processes required for stealthy and other advanced aircraft that it has learned from the F-35 into the design and production of the new aircraft. An F-35A in Japanese Air Self Defense Force markings at an official rollout ceremony in 2016., Lockheed Martin Not only could this positively impact production cost and overall capability, but it could also significantly lower the cost per flight hour when compared to the F-22. The Raptor’s radar-absorbent skin is notoriously demanding on maintainers and negatively impacts the availability and cost of operating the jet. The F-35 introduced a new, lower maintenance concept that supposedly solves many of these issues. The firm’s Skunk Works specialized design bureau has been doing pioneering work in both rapid prototyping and manufacturing science that could apply to the project. Between the F-22, F-35, and other advanced projects , the company has gained an extensive knowledge base to draw from to potentially help keep costs down and speed up the development process of a hybrid fighter jet. Totally new stealth fighter programs have become notoriously lengthy and expensive endeavors. The War Zone has long supported Japan’s desire to procure F-22s and has proposed this exact aircraft and arrangement in the past. As we described before, if the U.S. Air Force acts even as a minor stakeholder in a project that its Japanese counterparts were leading, it could help significantly in spreading out the development cost burden. Now it seems very likely that Lockheed Martin itself is presenting this exact reality to both parties. The company has reportedly been proposing an arrangement under which it or its subcontractors would initially build the main fuselage, engines, and mission systems in the United States, but using a steadily increasing percentage of Japanese parts, according to Nikkei . Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan would build the wings to start with, which will reportedly be larger and stronger than those on the existing F-22 to hold bigger fuel tanks in order to give the new fighter an unrefueled combat radius of nearly 700 miles without the need for drop tanks that would negate its stealthy characteristics. An F-22 with a pair of drop tanks., USAF But the basic design would specifically allow for the eventual substitution of both Mitsubishi Electric-supplied mission system components and IHI’s XF9-1 engine . If Lockheed Martin and Japan could agree on how to implement those options, Japanese companies might find themselves responsible for more than 60 percent of the production work, Nikkei explained . Even without this more extensive involvement in the aircraft’s development and construction, the fighter jet project could offer the government in Tokyo an important opportunity for technology transfers and to get contracts for domestic firms to supply a number of smaller components. Perhaps most importantly, the resulting aircraft would likely be both Japanese enough and distinct enough from the F-22 to avoid a number of export complications. Japan famously attempted on multiple occasions to buy Raptors, but got rebuffed by the U.S. government on each occasion. The fact that it would also feature many elements already found on the F-35 also helps with export concerns since the country is now part of that program . USAF A shared U.S.-Japanese stealth fighter program would offer both countries the benefits of lower unit costs. Nikkei reported that Lockheed Martin had estimated that each F-22-F-35 hybrid would cost around $216 million if the total order was for 70 aircraft. This would drop to less than $190 million if the order were to double. This is more than twice the unit cost of a new F-35A variant at present, but is less than the estimated per-aircraft price if the U.S. Air Force decided to restart the F-22 production line on its own and agreed to buy 194 aircraft, by the service’s own calculations . Under an ideal cooperative deal, the U.S. may be able to pay for very little of the aircraft’s development and other non-recurring costs, basically buying the airframes for the unit cost alone. To put the F-22 back into production, the USAF figured these costs would amount to roughly $10B. While that notional effort would incorporate some modernized elements into the aircraft, it would not be nearly as elaborate as an upgrade as what Lockheed is supposedly pitching now and what Japan seems to be interested in. A row of US Air Force F-22s., USAF Such an arrangement also presents a way for the U.S. Air Force to finally bolster the size of its F-22 fleet without having to invest heavily in a major new development program that could face opposition from senior officials or members of Congress for fear of taking money away from the F-35. It has become more and more widely accepted that the U.S. government’s decision to buy less than 200 F-22s has proven to be a poor decision in the long term and has limited the ability of those jets to fulfill the missions the Air Force intended for them. A recent Government Accountability Office review reinforced the view that the service should find ways to maximize the existing force’s potential if it cannot simply buy new Raptors . At the same time, the Air Force is already considering acquiring vastly improved F-15Xs from Boeing to fill various roles, which you can read about in more detail here . This plan offers a low-risk way of acquiring additional aircraft with unique capabilities that would be complementary to the F-35 while also not highly disruptive to the F-35’s share of the budget. Still, cost will almost certainly continue to be a major factor for any such project, whether the U.S. and Japan decide to work together on it or not. The Japanese government has allocated more than $50 billion in total for both development and production of the planes, which is already $10 billion more than it had suggested a domestic fifth-generation fighter jet program might cost in 2016. Japan is also likely eager to avoid a repeat of the F-2 fighter jet, which it developed with significant help from Lockheed Martin. Though derived from the F-16, the jets were much more expensive than their American counterparts, in no small part due to the small number produced but also due to the aircraft’s then cutting-edge AESA radar. Additionally, the project failed to lead to many of the expected industrial offsets. Lockheed Martin worked together with Japan on its last “domestic” fighter jet project, which produced the F-2, seen here., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Of course, U.S. President Donald Trump has also formed a very close relationship with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and has advocated for increased promotion of U.S. weapons abroad. Japan has already announced plans to buy a wide array of new and advanced American military equipment . It is possible that the Trump Administration, or the president himself, might intervene to try and finagle a better deal for Japan in order to get it “the very best” fighters and funnel another major contract to Lockheed Martin – another Trump favorite . Nikkei ’s report also noted that Lockheed Martin’s plan to let Japanese companies do most of the production domestically could then require the export of significant amounts advanced equipment and other components to support that work, which could have a positive impact on America’s trade deficit, something that has been a hot-button issue for Trump personally , despite his policies that have exacerbated the issue . The potential benefits of a shared U.S.-Japanese program to develop an F-22-F-35 hybrid have already been clear, as were the advantages of Japan leading the effort and putting up a significant amount of the funding. Now, as predicted , the Air Force appears to be at least entertaining the idea of turning this idea into a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 3, 2018",All You Need To Know About Bombing Of Top Separatist Leader In Ukraine And Why It Matters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Unknown bombers have killed Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and self-proclaimed head of the largely unrecognized “Donetsk People’s Republic,” which could further fuel tensions between the government in Kiev and rebels, as well as their benefactors in the Kremlin. The assassination comes amid a months-long surge in fighting over the disputed area , fears of a military buildup across the border in Russia, and a growing crisis in the Sea of Azov. This could all combine to send the conflict heading into a new phase . Zakharchenko was in a café he owned in Donetsk city, the capital of the region, when the bombing occurred on August 31st, 2018. The blast killed him and injured the Donetsk People’s Republic’s (DPR) “finance minister” Alexander Timofeyev. Rebel forces subsequently confirmed the incident to various media outlets and said that they had apprehended an unknown number of reportedly Ukrainian suspects. Both DPR and Russian authorities have launched investigations into the incident. “Assassination of Zakharchenko is [an] act of state terrorism by Ukraine,” a senior DPR official reportedly said in an interview with Russian state-owned television. “We’ll definitely get revenge on them.” This may have been Denis Pushilin , who is now the DPR’s acting “prime minister” and has echoed the calls for retaliation against Ukraine over Zakharchenko death. He has instituted a state of emergency in areas under rebel control in Donetsk, as well. Deputy “defense minister” for the DPR Eduard Basurin also accused Ukrainian authorities, but alleged that the United States was involved , as well, without providing any evidence to substantiate that claim. Not surprisingly, Russian and Ukrainian authorities have each pointed the finger at each other as being responsible for the incident. But while Ukraine indicated that Zakharchenko’s rivals or criminal elements might also have been responsible, the Kremlin has more directly insinuated that Kiev orchestrated the assassination. “There is every reason to believe that the Kiev regime, which has used similar means to eliminate unwanted people who have dissenting views more than once, is behind his assassination,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said after the bombing . “Instead of complying with the Minsk agreements and searching for ways of resolving the internal conflict, the warmongers in Kiev are implementing the terrorist scenario exacerbating the complex situation in the region.” The Minsk Agreement, or Minsk Protocol , was a ceasefire deal that came into effect in September 2014 and collapsed four months later. This was the first attempt to reign in the conflict between Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, collectively known as the Donbas , which erupted in April 2018. This closely coincided with Russia’s own illegal invasion and subsequent annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula . The remnants of the Separ cafe in Donetsk city after the bombing that killed Alexander Zakharchenko on Aug. 31, 2018., Sputnik via AP In February 2015, the parties to the conflict in eastern Ukraine agreed to another arrangement, known as Minsk II , which technically remains in effect, with the International Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) overseeing its implementation. Ukrainian officials and the Russian-backed rebels, as well as their respective international allies and partners, have each traded accusation of violations of the letter and the spirit of that second deal. Sporadic fighting between Kiev’s forces and the separatists continued afterward, but there has been a recent spike in the violence in the region since earlier in August 2018, along with reports of the continued presence of actual Russian troops bolstering separatist forces. “We have heard time and time again Russia deny its role in manufacturing the conflict over four years, yet additional evidence of its involvement continues to come to light,” Harry Kamian, the Chargé d’Affaires, a.i. of the U.S. Mission to the OSCE, said at a meeting of the organization on Aug. 30, 2018. “The United States once again calls on Russia to take the initial steps to order a credible cease-fire and disengage its forces in the Donbas.” Soviet-era T-64 tanks belonging to Russian-backed separatists participate in a parade to mark the end of World War II in 2017. Note that these vehicles are wearing the exact same parade paint scheme as Russian armored vehicles do during similar celebrations., Sergey Averin/Sputnik  via AP The concern, of course, is that Zakharchenko death could lead to an even greater surge in the fighting, which has hit civilians living in eastern Ukraine the hardest and could potentially give Russia a pretext for even greater involvement in the conflict. The demands for vengeance from the DPR’s acting Prime Minister Pushilin only reinforce these fears. Still, it remains to be seen how the various parties to the conflict might seek to exploit the situation to advance their own agendas. Despite the already free-flowing accusations, it is not at all clear who was actually behind the bombing of Zakharchenko or what their motives might have been. It is certainly possible that Ukrainian authorities could have killed Zakharchenko. Separatists have accused Ukraine, or groups linked to the government in Kiev, of assassinating at least four other prominent rebel commanders in Donestk and Luhansk – Mikhail “Givi” Tolstykh , Arsen “Motorola” Pavlov , Aleksey Mozgovoy , and Alexander “Batman” Bednov – since 2015 and, unlike the Russian government , authorities in Kiev are hardly mourning the DPR leader’s death. But there is also evidence that Givi and Bednov died due to political infighting in Donetsk and Luhansk respectively. Other information has implicated Russian security services in the deaths of Motorola and Mozgovoy , as well as yet another rebel commander, Valery Bolotov . It is equally possible that the Russians had a hand in Zakharchenko’s death. In May 2016, Vladislav Surkov, who has been Russian President Vladimir Putin’s personal advisor on matters relating to Ukraine since 2013, reportedly traveled to Donetsk to admonish the DPR leader, according to the Ukrainian intelligence services. The Kremlin was allegedly angry over the way he had been allocating financial and other aid from Russia and that his forces had not made sufficient progress in ejecting Ukrainian forces from the region. Zakharchenko has also been a high-profile member of the separatists in Donetsk from the beginning of the conflict and may have been involved in or otherwise aware of movements of Russian military equipment and personnel back and forth in the early stages of the fighting. This could have given him insider knowledge about the true circumstances of the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. In the face of overwhelming evidence implicating Russian forces in that tragedy, the Kremlin continues to deny it was responsible and there is now one less individual who might be able to directly link Russia to that incident. Alexander Zakharchenko, at center, speaks a university student, in a black coat, after a press conference in 2015., James Sprankle/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images Still, if Russia did kill Zakharchenko, it’s hard to tell what the desired outcome in doing so might have been. The most obvious objective would have been to cast further aspersions on Ukraine’s government to deflect attention and distract from its out malign activities in the country, which is a core element in the Kremlin’s information operations playbook . The bombing could also help undermine the Minsk II agreement, potentially leading to its collapse, after which officials in Moscow could push for a new deal that is more in their favor or actively push to annex Donetsk and Luhansk for good, a possibility that Pushilin himself had raised in the past . With this in mind, there have been reports of unusual Russian military movements along the country’s western border with Ukraine that do not appear to be linked to routine military exercises. These sightings have included train-loads of older T-62 tanks that are typically associated with rear-echelon reserve forces that could be heading to Ukraine. We have seen similar reports ahead of separatist offensives in the past . Far more worryingly, Zakharchenko’s death also comes as Russian forces have moved to assert greater control over the Sea of Azov , which lies to the east of Crimea and is linked to the Black Sea to the south via the Kerch Strait . Russia and Ukraine both have interests in the sea, which serves as a major commercial shipping route for both countries. “Russia has delayed hundreds of commercial vessels since April and in recent weeks has stopped at least 16 commercial ships attempting to reach Ukrainian ports,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement on Aug. 30, 2018. “Russia’s actions to impede maritime transit are further examples of its ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine, as well as its disregard for international norms.” Harassing ships heading to and from Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov has the immediate effect of hurting Ukraine economically. It also demonstrates Russia’s willingness and capacity to hamper Ukrainian naval operations in the area if a broader conflict were to break out, if not deny Kiev the ability to send ships through the Kerch Strait at all. This, in turn, could allow the Kremlin to block off an important route for Ukrainian forces in the eastern portion of the country during a crisis. These military moves might be an attempt on Russia’s part to deter the United States and NATO from becoming any more involved in the region. The Kremlin has already become more assertive toward American ships and aircraft operating in the Black Sea, especially in the vicinity of occupied Crimea . A Ukranian sailor mans a machine gun on the stern of a patrol boat in the Sea of Azov., RFE/RL The Kremlin’s goal could also simply be to try to put Ukraine in a weaker negotiating position in any peace talks to end the conflict, with hopes of compelling them to accept the present status of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk. Russia might feel that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko position is already fragile enough that he might be more inclined to make a deal to secure a political victory and avoid the negative press associated with heightened tensions with the Kremlin or a further surge in fighting with Russian-backed rebels. Poroshenko is facing the prospect of a number of serious challengers in presidential elections set to occur in March 2019 and has been beset by a number of corruption scandals himself. In addition, though he has managed to build a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, and secured the delivery of new and advanced weapons in the process, including Javelin anti-tank guided missiles . There continues to be speculation that his American counterpart might be inclined to cede Crimea to Russia in exchange for concessions that he could spin as his own political victory . It seems likely that Russia will make new demands of Ukrainian authorities, as well as its international partners, such as the United States, regardless of the true motives behind Zakharchenko’s assassination and who might have carried it out. At the same time, whether or not the goal was to provoke a serious escalation in the conflict in Ukraine, the statements from DPR officials and their Russian benefactors make it hard to see how they will be able to get away without pursuing some sort of retaliatory action, whether it involves direct military action or not. All told, after nearly five years of fighting and political upheaval, the bombing looks set to create all-new and serious challenges for Ukraine.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 22, 2018",Air Force Puts Out Contract Opportunity Announcement For Literally Anything Hypersonic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF has posted a sources sought contracting announcement on the federal government’s business opportunities website FedBizOps.gov that amounts to an entirely open-ended request for hypersonic weapons programs. Let me make that clear, this isn’t a request for information or a contract announcement for a type of hypersonic weapon, but one that says the Air Force is willing and wanting to look at any hypersonic weapon concept or development capacity. The posting is definitely a sign of the times as the Pentagon has identified hypersonic weapons as a preeminent area of emerging weapons competition among its potential peer-state opponents. Within roughly the last 24 months, hypersonic weapons have gone from an area of development interest and an ongoing exploratory initiative that seemed at least partially relegated to black budgets to a burgeoning international arms race. China and Russia have poured funds into the hypersonic weapons space in recent years and it became clear that the United States was losing ground if not outright falling behind in what is tantamount to a super-weapon technology . Hypersonic vehicles are able to penetrate deep into the most hostile and well-defended airspace on earth and take out targets with very short notice. Fast forward to today and the USAF has four hypersonic weapons programs that use the B-52 as a launch platform alone . Others exist in the form of submarine-launched and ground-launched types , as well as reusable hypersonic aircraft . And these are just the ones we know about. The U.S.-Australian HIFiRE hypersonic test initiative is one of a growing number of active hypersonic programs in the DoD’s portfolio. Here it is seen during launch before making a successful run over the Woomera test range. , DoD But these existing programs clearly are not enough for the USAF, and the service is now soliciting any firms with the wherewithal to participate in the hypersonic arena. Such a blanket request isn’t totally unheard of but it is rare for a high-end weapons capability like this that is already saturating the Pentagon’s weapons portfolio. The announcement reads in part: The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Armament Directorate, is currently conducting market research on hypersonic weapon rapid development, production, and sustainment.  AFLCMC/EB is considering the viability of a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract vehicle. Qualified vendors must be skilled in design, qualification, and component/subsystem/system weapons testing.  Qualified vendors must also be capable in all the following fields:  hypersonic aerodynamics; aero-thermal protection systems; solid rocket motors; advanced hypersonic guidance, navigation, and control; component integration into an all-up round; mission planning; and platform integration. … CAPABILITIES STATEMENT:  All interested vendors shall submit a capabilities statement that explicitly demonstrates their capability.  The capabilities statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet all aspects of hypersonic weapon development and production. Clearly, this open call of sorts is meant to help further jumpstart hypersonic weapons development across multiple contractors. Well established players in the space, namely Lockheed Martin, is already expanding literally as fast as they can to accommodate the demand placed on them by the USAF’s existing hypersonic initiatives. So this announcement swings the door wide open for less established or dominant players to get a piece of the growing hypersonic pie. It will be interesting to see who comes forward to offer up their services to the USAF. The usual players, including Boeing and Raytheon, will surely be eager to extend their involvement in the hypersonic sector, but smaller outfits could also step up with new high-speed weapons concepts that they claim are within their grasp. Regardless of who responds, it abundantly clear that the Pentagon now has an insatiable appetite for very high-speed weaponry, one that likely won’t be quenched anytime soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2018",Ukraine Requests To Buy Patriot Missiles As It Delivers A Mobile Radar To The U.S. Army,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ukraine is looking to purchase a small number of surface-to-air missile systems from the United States, possibly Patriots , amid a recent spike in tensions with separatists in the country’s eastern Donbas region, as well as their chief backer, Russia. The move also comes as the U.S. government is expanding arms deals with the government in Kiev, including the sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles , and has even recently bought a Ukrainian air defense radar for its own analysis and training use. On Aug. 28, 2018, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Valeriy Chaly explained his country’s desire to buy unspecified American-made air defense weapons in an interview with the country’s Radio NV . Chaly said that Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko had raised the matter directly with U.S. President Donald Trump during a brief meeting the two had in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit in July 2018. He also said that authorities in Kiev had discussed the possible purchase separately with U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton . “Ukraine has requested to official Washington for a possible sale of air defense systems worth $750 million for one unit,” Chaly told Radio NV, according to a translation from Defence Blog . “If necessary, [Ukraine could purchase] at least three appropriate military complexes for the Ukrainian army.” Though Chaly did not say what American-made air defense system Ukraine was interested in acquiring, the figures he outlined would be well in line with Raytheon’s Patriot surface-to-air missile system. Earlier in 2018, the U.S. government approved the sale of four Patriot Advanced Capability-3+ (PAC-3+) systems to Sweden in a deal worth a total of approximately $3.2 billion. This would mean each system cost $800 million, but it is worth noting that the complete package included training and other support services and ancillary equipment that would not be part of the base system’s unit cost. US Army truck-mounted radars, part of the complete Patriot surface-to-air missile system, in their deployed configurations during a training exercise in Israel in 2018., US Army In addition, that Ukraine is only interested in buying three complete systems at most points to a longer-range and more strategically-focused system, such as Patriot. This would be an impractical number of short- or medium-range systems , which require much greater density to be useful across a broad front. Officials in Kiev could also be looking at the Medium Extended Air Defense System ( MEADS ), which American defense contractor Lockheed Martin makes in cooperation with the European missile consortium MBDA. MEADS can already fire the latest Patriot PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor and Lockheed and MBDA are pitching it as a modular system that could accommodate other missile types in the future. MEADS, seen here in a truck-mounted configuration, could be another option for Ukraine., Lockheed Martin Regardless, adding a modern long-range surface-to-air missile system such as Patriot to Ukraine’s arsenal would significantly bolster the country’s air defenses and help counter increasing threats from Russia. Patriot’s ballistic missile defense capabilities, in particular, could be an important challenge to Russian Iskander ballistic missiles situated on the Crimean Peninsula , which the Kremlin illegally seized from Ukraine in 2014. Earlier in 2018, Russia also deployed aircraft capable of carrying the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, an Iskander derivative, to its Southern Military District , another move that seemed to be, in part, a signal aimed at the government in Kiev. Patriot has gotten a good chance to demonstrate its capabilities, especially in the ballistic missile defense role, recently in Saudi Arabia . The Saudis have had to employ these surface-to-air missile systems on many occasions to defend their cities against ballistic missile attacks from Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen . The threat posed by Russia’s Iskander in general, as well as ballistic missile developments elsewhere, especially in North Korea, have led to a certain renaissance for Patriot around the world, especially in combination with the improved capabilities that Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3 MSE interceptor offers, which you can read about in more detail here . There is also work in progress on finding ways to reduce the cost of each missile. Romania and Poland, in addition to Sweden, are in the process of acquiring Patriots now and, if Ukraine is any indication, there could be more sales to come in the near future. At present, the Ukrainian military relies on older Soviet-era iterations of the S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile system for high-altitude, long-range air defense. Earlier in 2018, it also reactivated a small number of S-300V systems , which are more geared toward defending against tactical ballistic missiles. Ukrainian S-300V surface-to-air missile systems on parade earlier in 2018., Ukraine MoD Since at least the beginning of August 2018, there have been increasing fears that Russian-backed separatists, again supported by actual Russian troops, might be positioning themselves for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. This, in turn, may have driven Ukrainian officials to look for additional ways to bolster its defenses against a more overt Kremlin intervention into the conflict. The assassination of Alexander Zakharchenko, a major rebel leader, by unknown parties on Aug. 31, 2018, has only further inflamed tensions, as we at The War Zone recently explored in detail. If the U.S. government was to approve the sale of a system such as Patriot to Ukraine, it could similarly reflect an even more significant shift in Washington’s military cooperation country. The surface-to-air missile systems would be, by far, the most advanced weapons the United States had ever sold to Ukraine. President Trump’s administration’s decision to green-light the sale Javelin anti-tank guided missiles to Ukraine was already a major departure from President Barack Obama’s policies. The Obama administration had limited arms deals with Kiev to “defensive” and non-combat related military items, such as trucks and medical supplies. A sale of Patriots would also be immensely more expensive than buying Javelins, which could be a factor for cash-strapped Ukraine . The purchase of more than 200 of the anti-tank missiles, along with nearly 40 launchers and other equipment and services, was valued at less than $50 million in total , a fraction of what a single surface-to-air missile system would set the country back, according to its own ambassador to the United States. A member of the U.S. Army fires a Javelin anti-tank missile during a training exercise., DOD Still, there’s little to suggest that Trump personally or his administration would be hesitant in principle to sell Patriots, or similar surface-to-air missiles systems, to Ukraine. Trump has been a strong advocate for promoting the sale of American-made weapons abroad and has formed a close relationship with Ukraine’s President Poroshenko. There is also the possibility that both countries could find ways to make such a sale more mutually attractive. Earlier in September 2018, the U.S. Army took delivery of a Ukrainian-made 36D6M1-1 air defense radar . This is a modernized version of a Soviet-era radar, also known as Tin Shield, variants of which remain in use in Russia and other countries, including Iran , as a component of S-300 surface-to-air missile systems . The manufacturer, the Iskra Scientific and Production Complex, claims that the trailer-mounted S-band radar can spot and track targets at both high and low altitudes and can function in a missile defense role. It’s unclear how long this deal between Iskra and the U.S. Army has been in the works. In 2017, Ukroboronprom, Ukraine’s government-run arms broker, declared that a Russian company, KIT, LLC, had attempted to block the Ukrainian firm from fulfilling any contracts due to a legal dispute over unpaid patent licensing fees. Ukrainian authorities rejected those claims and countered by accusing KIT of being a fraudulent company that Iskra employees had established in order to embezzle funds. A Ukrainian trailer-mounted 36D6M1-1 radar in its deployed configuration., Ukroboronprom It seems almost certain that the 36D6M1-1 is bound for the U.S. Army’s National Ground Intelligence Center , which maintains an extensive reference collection of foreign-made defense hardware. Intelligence analysts there would examine it in detail, a process known as Foreign Materiel Exploitation , or FME, in order to determine its exact capabilities and weaknesses in order to help the U.S. military better understand the potential threat. The U.S. Army could also roll it out for training exercises, giving American aviators a real-world hazard to practice with. At the same time, it would allow them to get a better sense for the capabilities of their countermeasures and the efficacy of their tactics, techniques, and procedures for suppressing and destroying enemy air defenses. The radar could similarly help the U.S. military in the development of new defensive systems , aircraft designs , and relevant doctrine. It is possible that Ukraine could offer more sales of advanced versions of Soviet-era systems to the United States as an offset against buying more modern American-made weapons. With the U.S. military increasingly focused on potential high-end conflicts against possible opponents, such as Russia and China , there is likely an even greater demand for access to examples of any and all foreign military technology that could help ensure that American troops maintain a qualitative edge . It may be that Washington’s and Kiev’s interests are now sufficiently aligned that we could soon see Patriot missile batteries appear in Ukraine and more deliveries of Ukrainian-made weapon systems arrive in the United States.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 29, 2018","Russian Forces Flood Into The Med Ahead Of Syrian Offensive, Here’s Everything You Need To Know","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad looks set to launch a new, all-out offensive into the country’s largely rebel-held Idlib governorate with the help of Russia and Iran. The campaign could officially begin any day now and comes amid, American threats to respond to any Syrian regime use of chemical weapons , a major Russian military build-up , the possibility of a Turkish intervention into the region, and Israeli air strikes against Iranian-supports forces fighting on behalf of the government in Damascus. Given that the situation is so complicated, we’ve taken the time to lay out all the latest news and military movements to give you a snapshot of what is happening and what is likely to come. A flurry of activity occurred just on Sept. 4, 2018, after Russia launched air strikes against targets in Idlib city, the capital of the governorate of the same name, and other areas Syrian rebels control in the region, according to the independent U.K.-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Kremlin had suspended these operations for more than three weeks and these new sorties are a likely prelude to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s all-out offensive into the region. Syrian government forces and pro-Assad militias had and continue to conduct their own aerial and artillery bombardments against rebel positions. U.S. policy confusion “The United States is closely monitoring the situation in Idlib province, Syria, where millions of innocent civilians are under threat of an imminent Assad regime attack, backed by Russia and Iran,” the White House said in a statement on Sept. 4, 2018. “Let us be clear, it remains our firm stance that if President Bashar Al Assad chooses to again use chemical weapons, the United States and its Allies will respond swiftly and appropriately.” The Trump Administration has conducted two separate sets of cruise missile strikes against targets in Syria, one in April 2017 and another one in April 2018 , both of which were in response to the particularly egregious Syrian government chemical weapon attacks . The United Kingdom and France also took part in the 2018 operation. A Russian pilot climbs into an Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft at the Kremlin’s Khmeimim air base in Syria., Vadim Grishankin/Russian Federation via AP The White House statement appeared to be a walk-back of a seemingly broader threat from Trump on Twitter the day before that indicated the United States could act in response to any sort of “reckless attack” that produces a larger humanitarian disaster in Idlib. This is an outcome that seems almost assured considering the Syria regime’s pre-existing propensity to indiscriminately attack populated centers and destroy civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals , that could at all be useful to rebels. Many experts and observers believe Assad’s up-coming Russian- and Iranian-backed campaign in the region will be especially brutal looks to fully reassert his control over the western portion of his country. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley reiterated that chemical weapons were the “red line” for U.S. action in her own press conference on Sept. 4, 2018, but seemed to make clear that the United States would not act in response to other atrocities. U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made similar comments that day, issuing a broad warning about the potential impacts on civilians and calling on Assad to do more to mitigate collateral damage – comments that in many ways seemed to suggest the United States might be moving closer to fully accepting that the Syrian dictator will remain in power for the foreseeable future. “If major military operations take place we can expect humanitarian catastrophe and I think we would all want to see that be avoided,” Dunford told reporters while in Greece on an official visit. “I’m suggesting that counter-terrorism operations should take place in a manner that mitigates the risk of the loss of innocent life.” However, a readout of a phone call between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu later in the day suggested the United States was opposed to any Syrian government push into Idlib. Pompeo and Çavuşoğlu “agreed that any Assad regime military offensive into Idlib would be an unacceptable, reckless escalation of the conflict in Syria,” the State Department’s top spokesperson Heather Nauret said in a statement. It remains unclear exactly where U.S. policy lies on what increasingly appears to be an inevitable Syrian government offensive into the region. Russian build-up What is clear is that the Kremlin appears determined to be doing everything in its capacity to both support Assad and ward off any potential U.S.-led intervention into the situation in Idlib. Russia has major strategic interests in Syria, including its Khmeimim air base in western Syria and its Tartus naval outpost on the Mediterranean Sea. Rebels based in Idlib have attacked both sites repeatedly , giving Russia additional reason to help the Syrian government retake the area. We at The War Zone have already detailed the wild, conspiratorial accusations the Russians have made against the United States and the United Kingdom both, accusing them, without evidence, of seeking to stage chemical weapon attacks as a pretext to strike at Assad. These unfounded allegations have continued and reflect a now typical Russian information operation that seeks to deflect and distract from its own activities in Syria, as well as those of Assad and simply muddy the waters as to the true state of the situation in contested areas, such as Idlib. We saw a similar escalation in rhetoric and accusations in the lead up to the U.S.-led cruise missile barrage in April 2018 . What is different this time around is that the Russians have deployed a massive amount of military aircraft and warships into and around the eastern Mediterranean . Though the Kremlin’s official reasoning for this is that it is simply carrying out a training exercise, the entire maneuver looks well suited to provide support to the Syrian regime and an obstacle to any U.S.-led strikes against Assad. The Russian Udaloy -class destroyer Severomorsk sails in front of the Slava -class guided missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov . Both of these ships are presently operated off the coast of Syria., Alexander Galperin/Sputnik via AP The “drills,” which started on Sept. 1 and are set to run through Sept. 8, 2018, will ultimately involve at least 25 ships and 30 combat aircraft. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense , these assets include, but are not limited to: The Slava -class guided missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov , which can carry up to 16 P-1000 Vulkan supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles and 64 long-range surface-to-air missiles across eight individual S-300F systems. Udaloy -class destroyer Severomorsk , with the Metel missile system , which can carry up to eight anti-submarine or anti-ship missiles, as well as 64 short-to-medium range 3K95 surface-to-air missiles. At least three Admiral Grigorovich -class frigates, each of which can carry up to eight Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles . At least two Kilo -class submarines, which can also fire Kalibrs. Tu-160 White Swan supersonic strategic bombers, also known as Blackjacks, which can carry Kh-101 air-launched land attack cruise missiles. Tu-142MK Bear and Il-38 May maritime patrol aircraft, which can carry various anti-submarine weapons. Russian Naval Aviation Su-30SM and Su-33 fighter jets , which could provide combat air patrols to defend the task force against any notional aerial attack or carry anti-ship cruise missiles to carry out their own maritime strikes. Note that this list does not include any of Russia’s forces presently deployed in Syria proper, which include additional combat aircraft and helicopters , air defense systems , artillery , and other assets . It is not clear if any of those units will participate in the exercises in the Mediterranean. A Russian Tu-160 bomber., Aleksey Nikolskyi/Sputnik  via AP Little change in America’s force posture It seems unlikely to be simply a coincidence that the Russian force is now operating in the same basic area of the Mediterranean where British and French aircraft, as well as French ships, launched their cruise missiles into Syria in April 2018. Fighter jets also orbited in this general portion of the Mediterranean to support that operation. In particular, a force of USAF F-16s and F-15s flying out of Aviano Air Base in Italy ran continuous combat air patrols over the Eastern Mediterranean during and after the 2018 strikes in a move to lock down the area and ward-off potential Russian reprisals. U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , a Ticonderoga -class cruiser , and a Virginia -class submarine fired their Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles from the Mediterranean, as well as the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The presence of the Russian ships and aircraft could serve as a physical impediment to American and other allied forces looking to get into position for new strikes and allow the Kremlin to potentially give Assad advance notice of such an impending operation. Even firing cruise missiles over Russia’s exercise area would involve serious risks, including the danger that Russian ships or aircraft might believe that they were the ones under attack and respond in kind. The United States, or its allies, has not made any clear moves that it is sending additional ships to the Mediterranean outside of normal transit and routine deployments as of yet. On Aug. 27, 2018, the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Carney left the Black Sea for the Mediterranean. On Sept. 3, 2018, the Los Angeles -class attack submarine USS Newport News made a visit to Gibraltar . Both of those ships can carry Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, but the U.S. Navy said both movements were pre-planned . In June 2018, the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman , along with the rest of its Carrier Strike Group, moved out of the Mediterranean into the Northern Atlantic and it was still there as of September 2018. At present, there is no flattop in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Air Force B-1 bombers that flew into Syria by way of Jordan to launch cruise missiles in April 2018 remain in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Depending on the exact risk analysis, the service could also employ other long-range strike assets, including B-2 Spirit stealth bombers , in any future operations against Assad. That being said, the U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community have reportedly been working to create a list of potential targets for a possible military response to the offensive in Idlib, according to CNN . There was also an apparent sighting on online flight tracking sites of an E-6B Mercury aircraft, which can relay communications to submerged submarines, flying near Syria, though some have suggested this was a case of mistaken identity . In the meantime, the Russian task force may present a challenge to American intelligence and patrol aircraft monitoring Syria from international waters. On Aug. 31, 2018, a day before the Kremlin’s exercises officially began, a U.S. Air Force RC-135V Rivet Joint spy plane and a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft both made routine appearances in the eastern Mediterranean. It’s not clear if those missions will be able to continue as normal while the Russians are in the area. The Kremlin already routinely harasses American aircraft in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea and has made similarly dangerous maneuvers near U.S. fighter jets and aerial refueling tankers in eastern Syria. This could make it harder for American commanders to determine the state of Syrian air defenses and add additional risk into the planning for any strikes, as well. Turkey may intervene, too But as with anything in Syria, the situation is multi-faceted and Assad and his Russian and Iranian benefactors may have to take the interests of other countries into account in the offensive into Idlib. As already noted, Turkey has engaged with the United States to oppose any Syrian government moves into the governorate. In January 2018, Turkish forces intervened in northwestern Syria, primarily to crush Kurdish forces that the government in Ankara views as terrorists and a direct threat to their national security. However, Turkey has also long opposed Assad’s regime and continues to support various Syrian ethnic Arab and Turkmen rebel groups, collectively known as the Turkish Free Syrian Army , or TFSA, which have a presence in Idlib. The Turkish military has already responded to the Russian air strikes by deploying additional forces into northwestern Syria, including additional artillery units. Based on Turkey’s Foreign Minister Çavuşoğlu’s comments to U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo, there appears to be the distinct possibility that TFSA forces, with Turkish support, might resist Russian-backed, pro-Assad elements. This could create even more complications as Turkey has grown steadily closer to Russia over their shared interests in the region and disagreement with American policies . The two countries have been working together for weeks at least to try and find an alternative arrangement in Idlib that would likely keep Assad from recapturing the entire governorate. Russian, Iranian, and Turkish officials are due to meet on Sept. 7, 2018, to talk in part about Syria. If Russia and Turkey can’t agree on a deal, it could fracture that relationship and put their forces, or the groups they support, at odds. Turkey and Russia have already come to blows in the past over the conflict in Syria. Turkish M60T tanks in Syria earlier in 2018., Lefteris Pitarakis/AP Will Israel act? There is also a question of how Israel might factor into the campaign, even if only tangentially. As Assad has prepared to move into Idlib, Israel continues to rain missiles and bombs down on targets in Syria linked to Iran’s interests. Just on Sept. 4, 2018, Israel reportedly struck Iranian-linked targets in Syria’s Hama and Tartous governorates. That same day, the Israel Defense Forces publicly acknowledged for the first time that they had carried out more than 200 strikes in Syria and fired more than 800 missiles and other artillery rounds into the country since 2017, according to The Jerusalem Post . The Israeli government had been adamant that it cannot and will not allow Iran to further bolster its presence in Syria. In August 2018, private satellite imagery and geospatial intelligence company ImageSat International (iSi) released new evidence of Iranian-built ballistic missile infrastructure in Syria. iSi had first reported Iran was building these missile factories in Syria in August 2017. It’s unclear how Israel’s continued strikes against Iran’s interests in Syria might impact Assad’s offensive into Idlib, which will surely rely at least in part on Iranian-backed militias. So far, Russian forces have declined to use its own integrated air defenses in Syria to try to protect the Syrian government’s or Iran’s interests from Israel’s strikes, though the Kremlin has actively helped Syria improve its own capabilities. It’s also worth noting that Israel has launched strikes against Syrian regime targets , as well. These have notably included missions to destroy chemical weapons-related sites after attacks on civilians and it is possible Israeli forces could repeat those operations if the United States and its allies choose not to act in response to any chemical weapon use in Idlib. Pro-Assad forces with truck-mounted improvised rocket launchers outside of Damascus in May 2018., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP Regardless, Russia seems to view Assad’s reconquest of Idlib as inevitable and “it goes without saying that this problem [rebels in Idlib] must be straightened out,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Sept. 4, 2018. “Certainly, this leads to general destabilization of the situation [in Syria] and upsets the efforts to putting the situation on the track of political and diplomatic settlement.” Unfortunately, the likelihood that the up-coming Syrian government push into Idlib will be a humanitarian disaster, together with U.S., Turkish, and Israeli opposition to Assad, his policies, and his various partners to differing degrees, it seems hard to see how the offensive will do anything to help stabilize the situation. Given everything we know now, the campaign could have a real chance of sparking off an even more volatile exchange. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 5, 2018",Russia Says It Used Precision Guided Munitions In Strikes On Syrian Rebel Drone Makers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says that its latest air strikes in Syria’s Idlib governorate destroyed rebel stockpiles of improvised armed drones and shoulder-fired, man-portable surface-to-air missiles. In addition, the Kremlin claims that its aircraft used precision-guided munitions against the targets and released strike footage online, which appeared to be an attempt to mimic similar U.S. military videos and offer a response to criticism of its largely indiscriminate bombing campaigns in support of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Four aircraft in total, two Su-34 Fullback and two Su-35S Flanker-E combat jets, carried out the strikes into Idlib on Sept. 4, 2018, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said the day after . The Kremlin also said that rebels had launched two more small unmanned aircraft carry small bomblets at its Khmeimim air base in neighboring Latakia governorate, where the planes flew out of to conduct their missions, but that Russian personnel at the facility shot them down on the night of Sept. 4-5, 2018. “This [the situation in Idlib] poses a considerable threat – the Russian president [Vladimir Putin] has mentioned that – to our temporary bases,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said on Sept. 4, 2018 , in offering tacit support of Assad’s up-coming offensive against rebels in the region. “It is from there (Idlib) that drones are launched to threaten our temporary bases.” The Kremlin says that there has been a significant increase in rebel drone strikes against its forces in Syria recently, but it remains difficult to verify the extent of these claims. As of August 2018, the Russian Defense Ministry said its forces at Khmeimim have destroyed 45 unmanned aircraft, but it is unclear whether that is since the Kremlin’s intervention began in 2015, since the beginning of 2018, or across some other time frame. Below are a series of videos the Russian Ministry of Defense released on Sept. 5, 2018, showing the strikes it conducted in Idlib the day before. https://youtube.com/watch?v=G1G61Thx4oc But there is no doubt that insurgents have been steadily launching more unmanned aircraft to try and attack the Kremlin’s outpost at Khmeimim, as well as its naval base in Tatrus on the Mediterranean Sea since at least the start of 2017 . In January 2018, rebels launched a particularly notable mass drone attack on Khmeimim, which damaged a number of aircraft, as well as Tartus. The Russian Defense Ministry did not say what munitions specifically the Su-34 and Su-35S aircraft had employed to destroy the drone workshop in Idlib, but both aircraft can carry various laser-, television-, infrared-, and satellite-navigation guided missiles and bombs . The strike footage, which appears to be seen through electro-optical targeting systems on the striking aircraft or via the full motion video camera on a drone observing the mission, shows reticules on the target before the weapons impact, suggesting they could be laser-guided bombs or missiles. If that is the case, it’s also not clear whether the aircraft designated the targets themselves, or one or two of the jets “buddy lased” the targets for the others. Russian troops on the ground could have been the ones designating the target, as well. Russian Su-34 Fullback combat jets at Khmeimim Air Base in Syria., Friedemann Kohler/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP To put it charitably, Russia has only employed these weapons sparingly in Syria. Since the beginning on 2018, however, the Kremlin has increasingly claimed to have used precision bombs and missiles in more focused, high profile strikes in retaliation for rebel attacks on Khmeimim and Tartus and other Russian assets in the country. After the mass drone attack in January 2018, Russian forces reportedly killed the militants involved in that operation, who were based in Idlib, by using laser-guided 152mm artillery shells . When rebels shot down a Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft during a mission over Idlib in February 2018 with a man-portable anti-aircraft missile, the Kremlin again responded with a “ massive precision strike .” A Russian KAB-500L laser-guided 500-pound class bomb, one of the precision-guided munitions that the Su-34 and Su-35S can carry., Vitaly Kuzmin So, there is a definite trend as to when and why Russia launches precision-guided munitions strikes in Syria. At the same time, the Russians appear to be trying to leverage the latest mission into Idlib, at least in part, to counter critics of its previous and far less precise aerial bombing campaigns , which appear to have deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals , in rebel-held areas. Russian aircraft have conducted the vast majority of strikes in the past using unguided bombs and cluster munitions and have often droped them from high altitudes. This inherently put civilians on the ground at greater risk, especially during air strikes in dense urban areas. That the Kremlin proudly highlights the rare instances when it does employ precision weapons in Syria highlights just how unusual it is. “If major military operations [in Idlib] take place we can expect humanitarian catastrophe and I think we would all want to see that be avoided,” U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Sept. 4, 2018 in response to questions about Assad’s planned push into the region. “I’m suggesting that counter-terrorism operations should take place in a manner that mitigates the risk of the loss of innocent life.” Though they occurred before Dunford made his remarks, Russia’s air strikes that day seem to be a direct response to these types of criticisms. The Russian Defense Ministry’s statement afterward reinforces this apparent secondary objective. “The strikes were dealt away from populated areas,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Konashenkov said . The mission focused on “terrorists’ hangars where the drones were kept and also against confirmed areas where attack drones were launched for terrorist attacks against the Russian airbase Khmeimim and communities in Aleppo and Hama provinces.” The video below shows improvised unmanned aerial vehicles that Russian forces presented to the press in August 2018 as evidence of Syrian rebels’ attempted attacks on Khmeimim. This can be seen as part of a larger, well-integrated information operation that the Kremlin has been conducting ahead of Assad’s expected offensive into Idlib. U.S. government officials, including President Donald Trump, have issued a number of warnings and threats of military action over the planned operation, especially with regards to any Syrian regime chemical weapons use . Russia has countered by accusing the United States, and its ally the United Kingdom, of supporting terrorists in Syria , including ISIS and Al Qaeda-linked groups, and supplying them with chemical weapons to stage fake attacks in order to provide a pretext for striking Assad. The Kremlin has offered no evidence to substantial these conspiratorial claims, which mirror equally ungrounded accusations it has leveled against the United States and its partners in Afghanistan and elsewhere , as well. The claim that it had destroyed shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles in its September 2018 strikes in Idlib is likely a reference to yet another series of baseless claims. After the February 2018 shootdown of the Su-25, Russian state-run media suggested, without any evidence, that the U.S. military might have supplied the anti-aircraft weapons to the rebels. “The Russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign [in Syria],” U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, then the top spokesperson for the American-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, had said back in November 2017 after the Kremlin had advanced yet another unsubstantiated conspiracy theory. “I think that is a reason for them to start, you know, coming out with their latest barrage of lies.” With escalating rhetoric now flying back and forth over what increasingly appears to be an inevitable Syrian government offensive into Idlib, the Russians are only likely to employ more of their standard information operations tactics to deflect blame for instability and humanitarian suffering in the region onto the United States and its allies in order to distract from what Assad is planning himself. Russia also appears to be setting the stage to try to be able to brush off criticism of its own support for the Syrian government’s operations. But, if Russia’s past aerial bombing campaigns in support of Assad are any indication, it’s unlikely that the Kremlin will actually employ precision-guided munitions on any sort of regular basis when the actual fighting in Idlib starts.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2019","The Pentagon Spent Decades Developing Hypersonic Anti-Tank Missiles, Then They Vanished","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To maintain its edge over potential peer-state opponents during a high-end conflict, the U.S. military is scrambling to find new ways to out-gun its increasingly capable competitors on tomorrow’s battlefield. One of the largest components of this initiative has been the rapid rise of a hypersonic weapons arms race of sorts, but one that is focused on large, long-range systems meant to hit time-sensitive and heavily guarded strategic targets. But the lower-end fight, specifically duking it out on the ground with armor, is also a major concern. As the threat of advanced anti-tank guided missiles and other infantry anti-tank weapons continues to grow, numerous countries, including the United States, are adding active protection systems to their armored vehicles. While being able to defend against some kinds of incoming rounds is very important, it’s even more important to kill the threat before it ever has a chance to fire in the first place, or at least be able to attack it in such a way that it too can’t defend itself with high-end countermeasures. This is precisely where hypersonic weapons should come into play. The idea isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds. The reality is that the U.S. Army was heavily invested after spending decades developing hypersonic kinetic-kill anti-tank missiles up until a little less than a decade ago. Peculiarly, even today, in a time of supposed great power competition, the concept seems to have largely vanished, at least publicly. When the Pentagon killed the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) program in 2009, it also effectively ended its last known high-speed anti-tank missile project in the process. The service had expected Lockheed Martin’s Compact Kinetic Energy Missile (CKEM) to arm certain variants of the FCS family of vehicles, as well as existing platforms, such as the tracked Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the wheeled Stryker armored vehicle . CKEM rendering., Lockheed Martin “There is nothing as incredibly powerful as CKEM when it comes to Line-of-Sight engagements,” Rick Edwards, then Lockheed Martin’s Vice President for Tactical Missiles within the company’s Missiles and Fire Control division, said in 2007 after one successful test against a static T-72 tank . “CKEM’s proven hit-to-kill technology is the only successful system which will fill FCS lethality gaps for close and extended engagements.” Even just at supersonic speeds, kinetic penetrators are especially good at negating various types of add-on armor and other countermeasures. Explosive reactive armor (ERA) and slat or bar armor work to neutralize the warheads in incoming tank shells, missiles, or other anti-tank rounds, which kinetic hit-to-kill projectiles do not have at all. Though it’s unclear how many of them Russia will ultimately put into service, the T-14 Armata tank reflects many trends in modern armored vehicle design and has a mix of explosive reactor armor, slat armor, and active protection systems., Vitaly Kuzmin Hard-kill active protection systems (APS) with either explosive charges or physical interceptors work on much the same principle. The sheer speed of existing non-missile kinetic penetrators, which can hit speeds of around Mach 4.75, is too fast for the sensors on even the most modern APS arrangements to track and engage in the first place, making them best suited to defeating slower anti-tank guided missiles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other infantry anti-tank weapons. So, a hypersonic anti-tank missile, which would, by definition fly at speeds over Mach 5, combined with a kinetic penetrator, could be a game-changing anti-tank capability. The test target T-72 tank that Lockheed Martin destroyed in 2007 with a CKEM had an explosive-reactive armor package that gave it no apparent added protection against the weapon. The video below explains how modern kinetic energy tank rounds work. These shells actually fire a smaller, dart-like high-velocity penetrator made out of a dense metal that is held in place in the barrel by a so-called discarding sabot, which falls away as it leaves the gun. As already noted, the Army has a significant amount of pre-existing development work that it could leverage for a new high-velocity, kinetic anti-tank missile project. When the CKEM program came to an end in 2009, it had been in development for nearly a decade. At that point, Lockheed Martin’s missile design was reportedly around five feet long and weighed less than 100 pounds. By comparison, the most recent variants of Raytheon’s BGM-71 TOW missile, which remains the main ground-based heavy anti-tank missile in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, are just shy of four feet in length and weigh around 50 pounds. CKEM used a solid-fuel, dual-pulse rocket motor to boost its kinetic penetrator to speeds over Mach 6. It was to have a range of around five miles, more than twice that of TOW, but it’s unclear if Lockheed Martin ever demonstrated it against targets at that distance. Details about CKEM’s features as of 2006., Lockheed Martin The T-72 in Lockheed Martin’s 2007 test was just over 2 miles away from the CKEM launcher. Limitations in the firing platform’s ability to steer the missile to the target may have been the reason for not testing it out to its maximum range at that time. The goal was for FCS vehicles to use various sensors to send targeting information and course corrections to the weapon in flight via a two-way data link. It’s not clear whether the missile had the ability to independently lock onto the target, such as with an onboard imaging infrared sensor but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The physical shape required for very high-velocity rockets and missiles and their penetrator payloads can make it difficult to place sensors and control surfaces in the nose . The CKEM used a unitary kinetic kill vehicle design in which the entire missile would eventually slam into the target. There were other proposals, including for a multi-stage arrangement with a rocket booster that would fall away after getting the main anti-armor penetrator up to hypersonic speed. Various CKEM configuration concepts as of 2001., US Army But CKEM wasn’t the only concept for a hypersonic, kinetic-kill anti-tank missile that Lockheed Martin developed for the U.S. military. It was only the latest in a string of U.S. military- and privately-funded programs that the firm, along with other American defense contractors, had been working on tracing back to at least 1981. In that year, the U.S. Air Force hired LTV to begin work on the Hypervelocity Missile (HVM), which the service initially envisioned as an air-to-ground kinetic hit-to-kill anti-tank weapon for the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. This design used a solid fuel rocket motor to get the weapon close to hypersonic speeds and separate thrusters would allow for course changes in flight. Highlighting the potential difficulties in guiding such a weapon over extended distances from a ground-based launcher, the HVM lacked any onboard sensors to guide it to the target itself. Instead, the launching aircraft would use a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) system to spot an enemy armored vehicle and guide the missile in its general direction. The pilot would have had to keep the FLIR locked on to the target throughout the HVM’s flight. A two-way data link would send position updates and course correction information to the missile. An A-10 Warthog fires an AGM-65 Maverick missile. This was the aircraft’s primary anti-tank missile at the time the HVM was in development., USAF In 1984, the Army and Marines joined the HVM program with the goal of creating a surface-based variant. In 1988, LTV, together with Texas Instruments, pitched an upgraded version of the weapon to the Army for ground-launched applications. The Air Force ultimately abandoned the air-launched portion of the project. The ground-based effort evolved into what became known first as the Line-of-Sight Anti-Tank (LOSAT) program. In 1997, Lockheed Martin took charge of this program, having acquired the weapon’s design from the Loral Corporation, which had itself previously purchased LTV’s missile division. The Army terminated that project in 2004, by which time it had become known as the Kinetic Energy Missile (KEM), in favor of CKEM. By that point, the LOSAT/KEM project had produced a functional missile design, the MGM-166A, which was nearly 10 feet long, weighed more than 175 pounds, and had a top speed of nearly Mach 5. The primary carrier vehicle for LOSAT/KEM was a modified Humvee with four missiles ready to fire. The vehicle could tow a trailer with additional rounds and the crew would have to exit the vehicle to reload the system. There were also proposals for better-protected options, including mounting a similar four-round launcher on the Bradley chassis. Another concept was to use the M8 Armored Gun System chassis to carry a turret packed with a dozen missiles in two armored pods. A prototype Humvee LOSAT missile carrier, towing extra rounds on a trailer, circa 2004. , US Army Raytheon, perhaps fearing a challenge to its hugely successful TOW missile family, began its own private venture to develop what it simply called the Hypervelocity Anti-Tank Missile (HATM) sometime during LOSAT’s development. The goal was to develop a hypersonic kinetic energy anti-tank missile that would fit inside existing TOW launchers, a feature that would almost certainly have made it very attractive to the Army and Marines. In 2002, the Massachusetts-headquartered defense contractor test-fired a number of experimental unguided “ballistic test vehicles” as part of that project. Available pictures show a modified Humvee serving as the launch platform, but it is unclear whether this test configuration used a standard or modified TOW launcher. A test launch of an unguided ballistic vehicle as part of Raytheon’s HATM program., Raytheon via Designation-Systems.net It is hard to imagine how an updated take on any of these systems wouldn’t be very attractive to the Pentagon today, in a time expanded defense spending spurred on by the rising threat posed by peer state competitors. Even more so, the drive for hypersonic weapons is hitting a fevered pitch . The USAF even recently released a contract opportunity announcement for literally anything hypersonic . So, the environment seems especially ripe for a hypersonic, kinetic hit-to-kill anti-tank weapon to finally succeed. And money is certainly flowing into the anti-armor space, this includes upgrading and developing new direct fire and indirect fire weapons , along with air-launched anti-tank missiles . A major issue that persists is the need for a ‘longer stick’ on virtually all ground combat platforms to allow them to be able to engage enemy forces at long distances—namely before the enemy is within firing range itself. The idea that a hypersonic anti-tank missile can provide discarding sabot penetrator like capabilities at double the range, without the need of a long barrel/tank configuration, and that it can even be mounted on lightly armored vehicles, seems like a massive game-changer that solves a lot of problems. The fact that it poses a major challenge for active defensive countermeasures makes it even more enticing. An artist’s conception of an M8-based LOSAT missile carrier., US Army It remains unclear exactly what technological hurdles may have remained when the most recent iteration of the concept was canceled nearly a decade ago, but at Mach 5 speeds thermal and guidance issues can come into play. But a lot has changed technologically in regards to material science, flight controls, sensors, and data-links in the last decade and considering the Pentagon’s new motivation for exactly this type of weapon, one would think that they could be overcome. The fact that there is literally three and half decades of collective research on such a capability should only help the cause. The concept could also be improved upon. For instance, with the use of a small drone for targeting, ground combat teams could potentially use such a weapon for non-line-of-sight engagements as well. This capability wouldn’t only be relevant for land vehicles, it could also be useful at sea when it comes to defending against medium and small-sized threats in the littorals, and especially so if it was scaled up a bit to add more range. At hypersonic speed, traditional close-in defenses would be very challenged to overcome an attack. Providing it in an air-launched form for helicopters and aircraft such as the A-10 could offer these aircraft a new fast-reaction anti-armor weapon that cannot easily be defeated, including by modern ground-mobile point defense systems. Youtube GIF With all this in mind, it is downright perplexing that we are not hearing about this concept today. There is a chance that it could be back in development in a classified form, but that seems less than likely considering it never really was a highly classified program in any of its prior iterations. Assuming technical hurdles remain, if they can be solved, this could be something of a superweapon that America’s ground forces need to distribute highly lethal and indefensible anti-armor capability on everything from light tactical vehicles to main battle tanks. Doing so would put the enemy at risk far outside of its own ability to employ armor-piercing discarding sabot rounds that have similar effects—a capability that is also limited to its forces main battle tanks alone. If the enemy turns toward anti-tank missiles for longer-range engagements, those systems are increasingly vulnerable to countermeasures as they travel at less that one quarter the speed of their hypersonic counterparts. In other words, we are talking about a total game-changing weapon here. Will we see hypersonic anti-tank missiles rise like a phoenix from the ash heap of weapons development history? We’ll just have to wait and see. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick AGM-114 Hellfire Air Air Force Munitions Air-To-Ground"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 25, 2019",Watchdog Warns The Coast Guard To Get Real About Its Plans To Field Critical New Icebreakers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Congress continues deliberating on whether or not fund the U.S. Coast Guard’s desperately needed heavy icebreaker program at all, a congressional watchdog has raised questions about whether the service has done enough to mitigate possible delays and additional costs. Any slip in the planned delivery schedule could leave the United States without any of these specialized ships for an extended period of time and hamper the U.S. government’s ability to operate in the increasingly contested and immensely strategic Arctic region . The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its latest review of what is formally known as the Heavy Polar Icebreaker (HPIB) program on Sept. 4, 2018. The report includes six separate recommendations for the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security, including establishing technology readiness baselines for specific components of the planned ships, updating cost estimates, creating a firm program schedule, formally identifying and analyzing the possible impact of any risk factors, setting up an acquisition plan for the first ship, and clarify how the U.S. Navy might help provide funds in the future to offset any cost growth. “The Coast Guard – a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – did not have a sound business case in March 2018, when it established the cost, schedule, and performance baselines for its heavy polar icebreaker acquisition program,” GAO’s report explained in its executive summary. “GAO’s analysis of selected lead ships for other shipbuilding programs found the icebreaker program’s estimated construction time of 3 years is optimistic. As a result, the Coast Guard is at risk of not delivering the icebreakers when promised and the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities could widen.” At present, the Coast Guard and the Navy plan to collectively contribute nearly $1 billion over the coming years to the HPIB program with a goal of having the first of three heavy icebreakers in service by 2023. The second and third ships would arrive in 2025 and 2026. After that, the Coast Guard has plans to acquire three more medium icebreakers. The US Coast Guard’s USCGC Polar Star , the service’s only active heavy icebreaker., USCG The Coast Guard’s existing icebreaker fleet technically consists of three ships, the USCGC Polar Star , USCGC Polar Sea , and USCGC Healy , the latter of which is a medium icebreaker with a more limited capability to move through ice-filled waters than the two heavy Polar -class ships. The Polar Sea is also in a permanently inactive state, serving as a source of spare parts for its sister ship. Despite undergoing an extensive refit between 2010 and 2012, the 1970s-era Polar Star remains prone to breakdowns and other problems . GAO’s argument against the HPIB program’s existing cost estimates and delivery schedule is that the Coast Guard laid out its baseline requirements before knowing what shipbuilders would be able to offer, which could lead to “an unstable design, thereby increasing the program’s cost and schedule risks.” In February 2017, the service did hand out five contracts, worth a combined $20 million, for design review studies to Bollinger Shipyards, Fincantieri Marine Group, General Dynamics/National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), Huntington Ingalls, and VT Halter Marine, but it has yet to pick a winner. Members of the Polar Star ‘s crew work on a broken turbine during the ship’s 2017-2018 cruise., USCG In addition, the watchdog says that while the Coast Guard says it plans to use “proven technologies” for the new icebreakers, it did not complete a formal assessment of whether those systems were truly mature and ready to go into the proposed ship. Again, the concern is that any company that ends up building the HPIBs could then uncover unforeseen issues during construction, delaying the work and increasing the ship’s price tag. The GAO review did say that the Coast Guard’s cost estimate seemed reasonable and well-founded, but noted that it did not include any appraisal of how expensive it might be to operate and sustain the ships. As such, the investigators warned that the service might be undervaluing how much funding the HPIB program will actually need in the long term. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, GAO warned that the complete schedule for acquiring the ships was based on the need to avoid a gap in heavy icebreaker capability rather than any understanding of how much time would be necessary to build the ships. The watchdog noted that almost all major surface ships the Coast Guard and Navy has acquired in recent years took longer to build and also typically came in months behind schedule. A chart showing the comparative time it took in years for the Coast Guard and Navy to acquire various other ships., GAO These are definitely all reasonable concerns. GAO has reviewed a number of Navy shipbuilding projects in depth in recent years and came to many of the same conclusions, only to be proven right in the end as costs grew and schedules slipped. The most notable example of this has been the watchdog’s reporting on the seemingly perpetually troubled Ford -class aircraft carrier program. But the HPIB won’t be anywhere near as complicated as an aircraft carrier or many of the other warships GAO used for comparison. Of course, shipbuilding is, in general, a complicated process and the Coast Guard is no stranger to difficulties. It last major ship program, the National Security Cutter, experienced significant delays due, in part, to the discovery of serious design flaws. Just on Sept. 5, 2018, Vigor Marine completed important structural enhancements on one of these vessels, USCG Waesche , which had first entered service in 2010. Still, the final HPIB design could very well be a derivative of an existing civilian design or incorporate many lower-risk commercial grade components. This would make it much more akin to the U.S. Navy’s Montford Point -class Expeditionary Transfer Dock (T-ESD) logistics ships, which General Dynamics/NASSCO derived from the existing civilian Alaska -class oil tanker design, which also helped reduce risks and keep costs down. Of the shipbuilding program’s GAO examined, the investigators noted that the Navy not only received the first T-ESD on a truncated schedule, it got the ship a year and a half ahead of schedule. A graph showing schedule slips across various Coast Guard and Navy shipbuilding programs, including the “negative delay” for USNS Montford Point ., GAO While the Coast Guard has discussed adding anti-ship cruise missiles or other more combat-oriented military-type hardware onto the HPIBs, the plan seems to be to include trade-space in the design to allow the service to add in those systems in the future rather than make them a core part of the ship when it first enters service. This could add to the GAO’s concerns that the Coast Guard may not have a good sense of how much the icebreakers will cost over the course of their service life. In addition, Italy’s Fincantieri Marine Group might stand out as a leading contender for the HPIB contract for similar reasons, since it is already building new heavy icebreakers for Canada . Since November 2016, the Coast Guard has been in discussions with the National Research Council of Canada, which will operate the Canadian ships, to help develop the requirements for its own HPIBs. Fincantieri representatives told The War Zone at the Navy League’s 2018 Sea-Air-Space Exposition in April 2018 that the company would likely pitch the Coast Guard on a version or derivative of the Canadian design. This would allow the Navy to leverage an existing, in production design, and the cost benefits that come with it. The Canadian program has suffered its own delays, but due to shifting government funding priorities rather than major slips in the construction schedule. A model of Canada’s future CCGS John G. Diefenbaker , which a subsidiary of Fincantieri Marine Group designed., Joseph Trevithick None of this is to say that it Coast Guard shouldn’t follow GAO’s recommendations, all of which the Department of Homeland Security agreed were reasonable, and double check its figures and planned schedules just to be sure. The service can ill afford delays in getting new icebreakers for any reason. Even if the HPIB program goes entirely as planned, the existing, truncated schedule may not be enough the Coast Guard from ending up, at least for a time, with no heavy icebreakers what so ever. Polar Star is due to undergo a service life extension program to keep the ship operational into 2025. Without this overhaul, the icebreaker would likely be headed into retirement by the end of 2020. Even if this work goes ahead, though, the ship will be out of commission for at least some period of time and there is no backup. If the HPIB program’s schedule slips significantly and the lead ship hasn’t arrived by 2025, the only alternatives would be put Polar Star through another refit or go without a heavy icebreaker until the new ships arrive. A timeline showing when the first HPIB’s are due to arrive under the Coast Guard’s present plan and how long Polar Star will be able to remain in service in the meantime., GAO On top of all this, the HPIB’s schedule may slip in the end regardless of GAO’s recommendations and whatever the Coast Guard might discover about its proposed plan as it evaluates and assess various elements of the program. In July 2018, the House Appropriations Committee eliminated all funding for the icebreakers from their latest draft of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year and moved that money into the budget for President Donald Trump’s signature border wall project . That bill has yet to come to a vote and legislators would need to reconcile it with a version in the Senate that does include the full $750 million that Coast Guard requested for the HPIB program. The proposed House spending package would maintain $15 million for the Polar Star ’s service life extension. It’s hard to overstate just how short-sighted the House’s proposed shift in funding priorities would be. The Coast Guard has been working in earnest to get new icebreakers since 2014, at which time a capability gap seemed unavoidable, which led to the decision to try to accelerate the HPIB program’s schedule. At the same time, as polar ice continues to recede and the period where seasonal ice presents a risk to ships gets shorter, various countries have become increasingly interested in exploring the Arctic’s natural resource wealth, as well as using it as a passage for commercial shipping. In August 2018, the Denmark-headquartered Maersk Line announced plans to become the first shipping company to ever send a container ship through Russia’s Northern Sea Route . The firm’s goal is to collect information about just how practical the passage has become and whether it is now safe enough for routine transit. This, in turn, has increased the need for the United States to be able to effectively patrol and monitor its own claims and ensure other parties are respecting those boundaries. There is similarly an increased potential for armed conflict in the region, which has led the U.S. military to focus more heavily on preparing various sea, air, and ground units to fight in the frigid north. Russia and China have only expanded both military and civilian activities in the Arctic. The Kremlin, in particular, continues to establish new bases the region and develop other specialized cold-weather military capabilities . Without icebreakers, ice could severely limit the ability of the Navy’s combat vessels to operate in the area during any crisis. The Russians, by contrast, as well prepared for this contingency with a fleet of dozens of icebreakers of varying sizes and capabilities, including nuclear-powered icebreakers and smaller anti-ship cruise-missile armed types . Russia’s nuclear-powered icebreaker Taymyr ., Tuomas Romu via Wikimedia “We really need to be in that part of the world all the time,” Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz said at a gathering U.S. Naval Institute at the Center for Strategic and International Studies hosted on Aug. 1, 2018 .  “We need six icebreakers. Three of them need to be heavy icebreakers, and we really need one of them today.” Schultz isn’t wrong and the Coast Guard really owes it to itself to ensure that it is running the HPIB program as well as it can in order to get these vital ships into action as fast as is humanly possible. But it will also be up to Congress to make the right call and not push off fully funding the icebreakers any longer.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The functional USS Oak Ridge , a forward-deployable floating dry dock that participated in World War II, is being auctioned off by the U.S. government. The offering was set to close at 12pm PDT today, but a flurry of late bids has extended the bidding. The odd thing about the sale is that Oak Ridge’s utility may be greater now to the U.S. Navy than it had been in decades. So selling it off for pennies on the dollar seems like a questionable move.

There are also a number of interesting files attached to the auction post which you can check out here , here , and here . The 536-foot long, 81-foot wide, unpowered vessel can handle vessels the size of nuclear fast attack submarines and smaller. It is a closed bow, open stern design that allows it to be moved across the oceans to different locales. The addition of rudders and onboard generators means the vessel operates similarly to a standard ship during transits, but it has to rely on some form of tow vessel for propulsion. It was built with all the amenities of a normal Navy ship and to support a crew of nearly 200. Oak Ridge was originally commissioned as auxiliary repair dock USS ARD-19 during World War II. It supported the Palau offensive and took damage during an attack on San Pedro Bay, where ARD-19 was servicing the destroyer USS Ross at the time . A Japanese Tojo fighter careened into it and a large fire broke out in the dry dock area after the aircraft ripped through the vessel’s outer wall. The fire was in the process of being extinguished when another Japanese fighter made a strafing run on the ship, but before it could do much damage, ARD-19’s gunners shot down the assaulting aircraft. Not bad for a lowly dry dock! In a relatively short period of time, the ship was back operational again and not long after the incident, ARD-19 was towed to Subic Bay where it spent the rest of the war tending to very needy U.S. Navy ships. The dry dock spent time in the reserve fleet and executed miscellaneous roles after the war. She was then recommissioned as USS Oak Ridge (ARDM-1) in 1963 after extensive modifications and upgrades. Her new role was to support America’s burgeoning Polaris ballistic missile submarine force. She was the only ship that could put these submarines into dry dock and transport them over long distances if need be. Oak Ridge with a submarine in its dry dock area. , Oak Ridge Facebook Page The newly minted Oak Ridge stood up service at Naval Base Rota in Spain in late 1964. Over the decades she continued to support the Navy’s submarine force, and later in life, this included exclusively servicing nuclear fast-attack submarines due to the increased size of the Navy’s ballistic missile carrying subs. This was her role up until her retirement in 2001, with Oak Ridge’s last station being Naval Submarine Base New London in Connecticut. Oak Ridge was transferred to the Coast Guard after being struck from the Navy register and has served as a dry dock facility at the Coast Guard’s shipyard in Curtis Bay, Maryland ever since. In fact, Oak Ridge received a basic service life extension in 2013. This included structural and systems rehabilitation, as well as the installation of new communications systems and other technological enhancements. Oak Ridge at the Coast Guard’s shipyard in Maryland. , USG Originally the Coast Guard saw the ship as only being usable for five years, but it has remained in an operational state despite being nearly 75 years old and receiving relatively minimal investment. And although 75 years may seem ancient, that is comparatively young compared to a number of the Navy’s fixed dry dock installations. USS Oak Ridge pictured with USCGC Eagle in its dry dock in late December 2017., Kenau22 /Wikicommons And that’s why getting rid of Oak Ridge seems a bit puzzling. The Navy has a major dry dock capacity deficit , and many of the ones it does have are decaying rapidly, an issue that the Navy, now flush with cash, is trying to remedy but it will be a long and arduous process doing so. Considering Oak Ridge can accommodate nuclear fast attack submarines, and anything smaller, not to mention it is portable and can be moved if need be, it seems like a good candidate for reenlistment to meet the Navy’s growing needs, especially in terms of submarine maintenance and service. The Navy is experiencing a damning backlog of dry dock time for these essential and hugely expensive national security assets. This has resulted in some subs being sidelined for years just as the Navy says it is sorely lacking in submarine capacity to meet tasking demands. Oak Ridge Facebook Page The Coast Guard’s reasoning for getting rid of the unique ship is stated in this official 2015 Coast Guard document on its dry dock facilities, in which it notes the vessel’s age, disrepair, and lack of investment, and states: The annual maintenance and depreciation cost for OAKRIDGE is $957,000 per year. At present, the operating and maintenance costs of OAKRIDGE are 11 times greater than the ship lift system (per linear foot of useable dock space). Floating dry-docks are required to be dry-docked themselves once every 10 years, to perform hull inspections and maintenance, consistent with both Navy and Coast Guard requirements. The Yard performed dive inspections on OAKRIDGE instead of dry docking; OAKRIDGE has not been docked since the mid-1990s. At present, there are no active shipyards in a safe transit distance from the Yard that have the capacity to dry dock OAKRIDGE to perform this maintenance, and even if dry-dock facilities were available, the costs would be prohibitive, so this work has been permanently deferred until OAKRIDGE is removed from service. This all sounds logical for the Coast Guard, but maybe not so much for the Pentagon’s increasingly needy naval portfolio. Additionally, the dry dock is going to have to be transported by its new owner, so clearly it can be moved. Putting it through a much-needed dry dock period itself and giving it a deep overhaul may be a far quicker way to gain additional Navy dry dock capacity than building an entirely new dry dock facility. USS Baltimore SSN-704 aboard Oak Ridge in 1997., USN Even porting Oak Ridge over to a contractor to operate it and make it available for the federal government’s needs may make more sense than selling it to a customer that potentially has other uses in mind, which could include ripping it apart for scrap. One can hope this won’t be the case. In the past, vessels with similarly unique capabilities have been saved from the scrapper’s torch, such as the Hughes Mining Barge and Sea Slice , and put back to work after an overhaul. But there is no language in the auction contract that will require this to occur. And even if it is put back into service, it may do so servicing yachts and commercial vessels, not the Navy’s inventory. Currently, the bidding is in its final stages and is up to $1,322,099. Hopefully, with the buyer making that level of investment, the historic Oak Ridge will still have a bright future ahead of it.

For the first time ever, U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs Joint Strike Fighters are on an operational deployment in the Gulf of Aden, bringing them the closest they’ve ever been to conflict zones in Iraq and Syria , Yemen , and Somalia . The stealthy jets and their pilots set to join thousands of other U.S. Navy sailors and Marines for a two-week training exercise while they’re in the region, but there’s still no indication they are headed for actual combat, at least not yet. The Essex Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), which includes the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Essex , the San Antonio -class amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage (LPD 23), and the Whidbey Island -class amphibious dock landing ship USS Rushmore , has been in the area since earlier in September 2018. The ships are carrying elements of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which includes the detachment of six F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Two One One ( VMFA-211 ). The entire ARG will participate in so-called Theater Amphibious Combat Rehearsal (TACR) off the coast of the East African country of Djibouti starting on Sept. 8, 2018. The drills will last two weeks and approximately 4,500 Navy and Marine Corps personnel will take part in total. The Navy’s Task Force 51, which oversees amphibious operations under U.S. Fifth Fleet command, will lead the exercise and the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) will manage Marine forces during the drill. The U.S. Fifth Fleet manages maritime operations on the Indian Ocean side of the Middle East, as well as around the Horn of Africa. Two F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Two One One, attached to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, fly over the Indian Ocean on Aug. 31, 2018., USMC “TACR provides our U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team the opportunity to execute complex missions at sea, from the sea and ashore,” U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General Matthew Trollinger, who serves as the commander for both Task Force 51 and the 5th MEB, said in a statement earlier in September 2018. “TACR allows us to demonstrate the enhanced capabilities and tactical lethality that embarked F-35Bs on an ARG bring to the region,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Chandler Nelms, who is in charge of the 13th MEU for this deployment, added. The exercise will include, but may not be limited to individual drills involving defending the ARG against simulated air attacks and naval mine threats, as well as performing various quick reaction force type missions, such as boarding potentially hostile ships and rescuing downed airmen and recovering their aircraft. There are always Navy ARGs, together with Marine MEUs, conducting routine patrols around the world to provide a persistent capability to quickly respond to a wide variety of contingencies, ranging from active combat operations to non-combat humanitarian missions. Neither the Navy nor the Marines have announced any intention to send the F-35Bs into combat anywhere in the Middle East or East Africa while the Essex and her ARG are in the region, but there is always a possibility the U.S. military could decide to do so. Since 2014, elements of various MEUs have detached air and ground elements to support the campaign against ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria.

USS Essex , her ARG, and the 13th MEU are right now moving into position in the Gulf of Aden, seen at the bottom righthand corner., USMC The F-35Bs, along with the rest of Essex ‘s ARG could face other threats and hazards while operating near Djibouti, though, including the ever-present danger of anti-ship cruise missiles, naval mines , and other attacks from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on the other side of the Gulf of Aden. There have also been reports that Chinese forces at their own base in Djibouti have used lasers to try and blind pilots and otherwise harass American military aircraft operating in the region. If nothing else, the deployment shows that the Marine Corps is continuing to integrate its F-35Bs into routine activities around the world, increasing the likelihood that the aircraft will eventually be in the right place at the right time for the USMC to push them into their first actual combat action.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 11, 2018",Russia Threatens To Attack Key U.S. Outpost In Southern Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has reportedly told the U.S. government at least twice in recent days that it is ready to support a Syrian government offensive into an area near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders where American-backed opposition forces are presently in control . The threats come as the United States, among others, has warned the Kremlin and Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad against kicking off a major offensive into the rebel-held Idlib region further to the northwest. CNN was first to report on the growing tensions over the border garrison, situated near the city of At Tanf . It was not immediately clear if the Russian statements were an indication of an imminent operation or simply a blanket threat against the base. “We have absolutely advised them to stay out of At Tanf,” an unnamed U.S. official told CNN . “We are postured to respond.” The individual also stated that American forces retain their right to self-defense if Russian-backed Syrian-government aligned forces were to threaten their positions. The U.S.-led force reportedly patrols a 34-mile wide “exclusion zone” around the base, according to CNN . A map showing various locations of interest in Syria, including At Tanf in the south., DOD A combination of American and Jordanian special operations forces and supporting personnel, including conventional U.S. Army truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) launchers, presently occupy the site along with members of Maghawir al-Thawra , a Syrian rebel group that is also known as the Revolutionary Commando Army. “The United States does not seek to fight the government of Syria or any groups that may be providing it support,” another American official explained to CNN . “However, if attacked, the United States will not hesitate to use necessary and proportionate force to defend US, coalition or partner forces.” We don’t know how the Russians informed their American counterparts of their apparent preparedness to enter the At Tanf area. It is possible that they employed a de-confliction hotline that the two countries have operated for years now to help keep their forces separated and avoid potentially dangerous interactions. U.S. officials have unsuccessfully attempted to use this system in the past to try to bring multiple attacks on American-supported forces at At Tanf , as well as in northeastern Syria , to an end, long calling its efficacy into question . A Russian attack at At Tanf would also not be unprecedented. Russia’s combat aircraft struck the site in 2016 , killing a number of rebel fighters belonging to what was then known as the New Syrian Army. This, in turn, prompted the United States to deploy additional forces into the area. In 2017, the American-supported Syrian forces brushed off a number of attacks by Iranian-backed Syrian-government aligned forces with their own tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery. American airstrikes were instrumental in protecting the base and U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets also shot down two advanced Iranian drones during separate skirmishes. The outpost at At Tanf continues to be a thorn in the side of the Syrian government, preventing Assad from completely reasserting his authority in the southern portion of his country, as well as the dictator’s Russian and Iranian allies. For Iran, it presented a major obstacle in obtaining a single overland route from its own territory all the way to areas in Lebanon where the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah operates. US special operations forces in various light vehicles, at right, along with a Jordanian UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, near At Tanf in 2017., US Army But Russia’s latest threats are most likely linked to American threats to potentially intervene in response to an imminent Syrian government offensive in the country’s Idlib governorate to the northwest. There seems to be a clear suggestion from the Kremlin that it could retaliate against any such American involvement by taking action in At Tanf. We at The War Zone had previously posited that the Russians could pursue this course of action in response to U.S., U.K., and French cruise missile strikes against Assad in April 2018. In that case, the Kremlin ultimately chose not to conduct any overt military action against American-supported groups, either in At Tanf or in eastern Syria. Now, with the United States again implying it could launch new strikes against the Syrian government over the impending operations in Idlib, especially if Assad’s forces use chemical weapons, Russia has taken a decidedly more aggressive approach overall. It has moved a significant number of aircraft and ships into the region, ostensibly for exercises, but it is clear the maneuvers are also meant to serve a deterrent to the U.S. military, as well as potentially provide support for Assad’s upcoming campaign. On top of that, the Kremlin has reinvigorated its information warfare effort against the U.S. government and its allies, making baseless accusations that they are supporting terrorists in Syria and elsewhere . Among these unfounded allegations are renewed claims that the United States and Jordan are actively enabling militants to operate out of the Rukban refugee camp situated in a no-mans land along the Syrian-Jordanian border. An aerial view of the Rukban refugee camp., US State Department “Several hundred [ISIS] militants, as well as [Al Qaeda-linked] al-Nusra militants, possessing heavy weaponry, are hiding among civilians who are being held hostage, and are being used as human shields,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Aug. 23, 2018 . “Unfortunately, all this happens, and we have information confirming this, with the knowledge of the U.S. military who control the 55-kilometer [34-mile] zone around their illegal base in Al-Tanf on the Syrian territory.” Neither Zakharova, nor anyone else in the Russian government, has publicly provided any information to support these claims. Though there is evidence that militants have significant influence at Rukban, the United States and Jordan also appear to make efforts to stay away for fear of being attacked by those same groups. In August 2018, the Syrian regime proposed evacuating the camp , with Russian support, and returning its inhabitants to the areas they had fled. Of course, these individuals had fled the country’s brutal civil war in the first place and there is no guarantee that Assad’s government will treat them fairly upon their return. For example, there have long been reports that Syrian authorities have been arresting men for “deserting” their obligation to serve as conscripts in the national military, sending many of them to notorious prisons where torture and summary execution are rampant. It remains to be seen whether the Russians or the Syrians will follow through on their latest threats to try yet again to eject the Americans and their partners from At Tanf or to secure the nearby Rukban refugee camp. It seems clear that, at least for the moment, the U.S. military and the Revolutionary Commando Army rebels also have no intention of leaving.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday we broke the story that a USAF RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drone crashed in the waters off Spain late last June. This morning, U.S. European Command officials responded to our queries and we received the photo above from our sources that originally notified us of the previously undisclosed mishap. Here is European Command’s response to our questions: Tyler, Thank you for your patience on this. The below responses to your questions can be attributed to me as the U.S. European Command Spokesperson. For additional questions regarding the aircraft or the mission, please refer to [redacted] at ACC Public Affairs. Thanks! Q: Like where approximately it went down? A: An RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft crashed off of the coast of Rota, Spain, at approximately 11a.m. EDT, Tuesday, June 26, 2018. No personnel were involved in the incident. Q: Was there a salvage operation? A: The Supply-class fast combat support ship USNS Arctic (T-AOE-8), assisted in the recovery of the downed RQ-4 Global Hawk in the vicinity of the Gulf of Cadiz. Prior to providing assistance, Arctic was conducting routine operations in the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations. In addition to the USNS Arctic, a 100th Air Refueling Wing KC-135 operating out of Zaragoza Air Base, Spain, launched on June 26 to aid in the recovery efforts. Q: Current state of the vehicle? A: For information about the investigation, I’ll have to refer you to Air Combat Command Public Affairs… Q: Any details surrounding the events leading up to the crash? A: For information about the mission or the flight path, I’ll have to refer you to Air Combat Command Public Affairs… So we didn’t get a whole lot of new information here, but the exact time and general location of the crash are noteworthy, as is the use of USNS Arctic for the recovery operation. It’s not clear how this vessel, which usually acts as a high-speed fleet support and replenishment ship, executed the salvage operation. It’s very possible that another ship extracted the Global Hawk carcas from the seafloor and Arctic hauled those pieces back to Rota. The Gulf of Cadiz is generally not a shallow body of water, with areas dropping to depths as deep as 13,000 feet. USNS Arctic. , USN The KC-135R was likely sent out to the area to provide first eyes on the scene and to help coordinate search and recovery efforts.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 7, 2018",Exclusive: U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk Drone Crashed Off Spain Last June,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A high-flying RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned spy plane crashed into the waters off Spain on June 26th, 2018. The incident has not been previously disclosed to the public prior to our inquiries. It marks the second loss of an RQ-4 in just over a year, with the other aircraft crashing into highly remote California wilderness near Mount Whitney on June 21st, 2017. After reaching out to a number of units associated with Global Hawk operations, as well as to those associated with its Navy cousin the MQ-4 Triton, we received the following correspondence from the Air Force Safety Center: Tyler, There is an ongoing Safety Investigation Board investigating the crash of an RQ-4 that impacted the water off the coast of Spain on 26 Jun 2018. The Safety Investigation Board is still ongoing. It is Department of Defense & Air Force policy not to discuss the analysis, findings, or recommendations from safety investigations to protect the investigation process. That is all that is releasable at the moment. If you have additional follow up questions, please let me know. VR, Josh A. Aycock Chief, Public Affairs Division Headquarters, Air Force Safety Center This is the first official acknowledgment of the incident to the press. The only other indication that a Global Hawk was lost at all that we could find came from the Air Combat Command’s Combat Edge magazine that had this little graph without any further explanation: ACC The details as we understand them, but without further confirmation, is that the Global Hawk crashed into waters west of Spain and a salvage operation has since raised the stricken drone from the seabed and packaged what’s left of the aircraft for transport back to the United States for inspection via Naval Station Rota. Beyond these sparse and unconfirmed details, we really don’t know what circumstances surrounded the mishap. It remains unclear why the USAF has kept the incident under wraps. It may have been due to the sensitive nature of fielding a quick recovery operation at sea as even a waterlogged and damaged RQ-4 could represent a massive technological boon for a competing power. Also, the USAF, in particular , has clamped down on the frequency and magnitude of information it provides the press as part of a Pentagon-wide public relations chill that itself has been highly publicized. USAF We also don’t know for certain exactly what type of Global Hawk was involved in the mishap. Beyond the Global Hawk’s primary surveillance mission , three earlier build RQ-4s have been reconfigured into EQ-4 Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) data fusion and relay aircraft. Considering the drone could have been transiting back to the United States or on a mission in the area, either type is possible, although the RQ-4 variant is far more likely. Defense Secretary Panetta stands in front of an RQ-4 Global Hawk at NAS Sigonella, Italy on October 11th, 2011. , DoD Global Hawks have been highly active in the European Theater, most notably flying regular high-altitude reconnaissance missions over Eastern Ukraine and the northern Black Sea region. They have also been active over the Eastern Mediterranean, near the Syrian coast, but less so in recent months. The semi-autonomous drone has even executed missions over Libya and other locales in the EUCOM and AFRICOM areas of responsibility, including the Baltics. All of these sorties have been flown out of NAS Sigonella, Italy. We will report back with more information as soon as we get it regarding the shadowy crash.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 30, 2018","For Boeing, Its MQ-25 Win Is Sweet Vindication After Years Of Disappointment","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s selection of Boeing to move their MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based tanker drone initiative forward was surprising to some, but to the company’s St. Louis team, and especially their Phantom Works ‘bleeding edge’ design unit, it had to have been an incredibly validating moment. For more than a decade and a half, Boeing has tried to push semi-autonomous advanced unmanned combat air vehicle technology forward into an operational realm without success. Now they have a chance to change all that in a very substantial way. Boeing pioneered the unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) concept magnificently back in the early 2000s via the X-45A Joint Unmanned Combat Aircraft System demonstration program. What looked to be the dawn of a new era in air combat the likes of which we haven’t been seen since the introduction of the jet engine, astonishingly ended up withering on the vine. Boeing X-45A during testing near Edwards Air Force base in 2002., NASA The company even used its own funds to develop a very stealthy advanced UCAV follow-on to the X-45A, the X-45C Phantom Ray, but the USAF had no interest in procuring a version of the promising aircraft and the Navy chose Boeing’s competitor, Northrop Grumman, to develop their carrier-based UCAV demonstrators. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin seemed to make major inroads with similar technologies in the classified realm and Northrop Grumman is widely thought to have done the same , especially with strategic unmanned assets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mDdi00nfBVU You can read all about Boeing’s pioneering role in the Pentagon’s bizarre UCAV saga and how UCAVs seemed to vanish from view just as they were about to revolutionize air combat forever in this past special feature of mine. But suffice it to say, Boeing seems to have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to advanced unmanned air vehicle systems, but all their work may finally pay off with the MQ-25. There is some misunderstanding about the MQ-25 program in general. Although the aircraft gets all the attention, maybe the most exciting and critical part of the program—and possibly the most important going forward for Boeing—is in the command, control, and networking ecosystem that will be developed for it. This is not intended to be a discreet system that will just work with the MQ-25 Stingray. It will be a new enterprise based around semi-autonomous drone operations that will grow and evolve with technology and capability demands. Even though the Navy will ‘own’ this capability, Boeing will be right there developing it alongside the seagoing force. So even though it won’t be proprietary to Boeing, the company will have a big leg up on the competition by evolving it to work with their MQ-25 drone and in ironing out all the operational interface kinks at sea and under real-world conditions. So even though possible future tenders, like one for a UCAV that will leverage the same support infrastructure, can be competed openly—even the MQ-25 could be recompeted after the first four prototypes are built by Boeing—Boeing will undoubtedly have an advantage for these future opportunities due to their intimate knowledge of what will probably become one of the Navy’s most important integrated systems and software suites, ranking right up there with the Aegis Combat System. Below is a document from 2014 that we received via FOIA regarding the command and control suite that was being developed for the earlier and more complex iteration of the Navy’s carrier-based combat drone program that morphed into MQ-25. It borrowed from software developed for Northrop Grumman’s MQ-8 Fire Scout and MQ-4 Triton. It isn’t perfectly clear if this work will be ported over directly for the MQ-25’s development and integration with Boeing’s aircraft, but by what we can tell it will. Regardless, the support architecture and concept of operations will be very similar if not identical. FOIA FOIA FOIA FOIA FOIA FOIA Navy flight test pilot demonstrates functionality of new software for the future Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike system at the program’s Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md. lab. (2014 photo), USN According to nearly every one of our sources, MQ-25 is not a popular initiative below the top rungs of the Navy’s command structure, and especially within elements of NAVAIR. Right now the Pentagon is flush with cash, but that will likely change in the years to come. Will the MQ-25 really live to see full rate production? That’s debatable, and pilot culture will be a major hurdle when it comes to its ability to survive. But if anything else, the universal backend aspect of the program will give it a better chance of avoiding the budgetary axe than anything else, including the attributes of one particular airframe. This is all very exciting for Boeing, but one can only wonder if Northrop Grumman made a severe error by not competing for the MQ-25 contract. Just as Boeing blazed the trail for the UCAV concept, Northrop Grumman took it to sea and accomplished marvelous things with their X-47B demonstrators . Those aircraft were far more akin to a stealth, penetrating UCAV than a tanker. In other words, they were needlessly complex for the tanking mission set alone. But Boeing took their previously undisclosed UCAV demonstrator—an aircraft devised for the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) requirement that the Navy ended up ditching for the far more dumbed down Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System initiative that turned into the MQ-25 program—and modified it for the MQ-25 tender. And they won . One of Northrop Grumman’s highly promising X-47Bs refueling autonomously during one of its last tests in 2015., USN We don’t know much about how the Navy came it its final decision as to who would be awarded the MQ-25 contract, but we do know that it chose the only contestant that had a prototype, and that prototype isn’t likely to be exactly representative of Boeing’s final MQ-25 configuration. And Boeing’s prototype has never flown. Northrop Grumman’s X-47Bs, on the other hand, have not only flown, they have operated from aircraft carriers at sea multiple times and in various conditions and even aerial refueled autonomously. Many predicted that the simplest solution that offered the most gas at a reasonable price would have won the MQ-25 competition. But the Navy went with Boeing’s UCAV derived offering that clearly has room for some tactical growth. The main element we still don’t know about is cost. Some have claimed Boeing offered the Navy a deal it couldn’t refuse. Maybe that’s true, maybe it isn’t, but with the results of the contest now decided, it sure seems Northrop Grumman would have been able to make a very compelling case to the Navy by leveraging their X-47B demonstrators. You will find no bigger supporter of pouring funds into the almost non-existent high-end unmanned air combat space than me. Although the Navy should have been far more aggressive, pushing for a UCAV with tanker capability similar to UCLASS, the MQ-25 as it sits today is still a very exciting step in the right direction. It literally will lay the groundwork for more advanced carrier-based semi-autonomous drones in the future. And above all else, Boeing has worked incredibly hard and has walked a trail full of disappointment and frustration, seemingly undeservingly so, for many years to get to this unmanned aircraft opportunity. Boeing repeatedly claims that they are ready to make MQ-25 a success in their first corporate video following the contract award. If their history in the unmanned space tells us anything, they really do mean it. Now it’s time to finally prove that they can be a leader in this space, one that will redefine the meaning of air combat, whether you like it or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 5, 2018",Russian Commandos Are Getting “Silent” Mortars That Are As Quiet As A Suppressed Rifle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Personnel at a forward operating base are patrolling the perimeter after dark when they hear a muffled popping sound in the distance. Soon after, small shells begin raining down on them and there’s no clear indication where the attackers are shooting from. They’ve just been on the receiving end of a 2B25 “silent” 82mm mortar. This might sound like some sort of unlockable upgrade in a video game, but it’s an actual weapon system that Russian special operations forces, commonly referred to as spetsnaz , began receiving in 2018. Jane’s was first to learn that the Kremlin had begun fielding the specialized mortars from an unnamed individual at Russia’s Army 2018 defense exposition in August 2018. “The [Russian] Ministry of Defence is acquiring new towed and man-portable mortars for the land troops,” Jane’s source explained . “In particular, the special forces are slated for receiving several dozen 2B25 silenced mortars.” The Burevestnik Institute , a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned defense contractor UralVagonZavod (UVZ), has been working on the 2B25, also known as the Gull, since at least 2011. In 2015, the company announced plans to further improve the design and it’s not clear whether Russian spetsnaz have already been using earlier iterations. The 82mm 2B25 Gull mortar and its ammunition on display., Rostec From the outside, the 30-pound mortar doesn’t look out of the ordinary and it functions in the same way as many other modern types. An individual inserts the mortar bomb into the tube and then pulls a handle-shaped trigger to fire it. The shooter aims the weapon by using an optical sight and adjusting the angle of the barrel. Where the 2B25 is special is in its 3VO35 82mm ammunition. A traditional mortar bomb has a propelling charge in its tail and troops can generally attach supplemental charges to increase its range. The detonation of these explosives forces the projectile out of the barrel and sends it down range. The Gull’s mortar bombs keep that detonation entirely contained in the very long tail assembly. The sudden, extreme force pushes a physical piston against the base of the tube, which launches the projectile. The video below shows how the piston-powered ammunition system works at around 1:24 in the runtime. This means firing the 2B25 produces no flash or smoke and helps contain any residual auditory signature of firing behind the mortar bomb’s own body and the tube of the mortar itself. It’s not actually silent, but Burevestnik claims that shooting the weapon isn’t any louder than firing an AKM assault rifle with a PBS-1 sound suppressor attached, which is substantially quieter than a standard infantry mortar. The 3VO35 mortar bomb features a high explosive projectile encased in a fragmentation layer made up of dozens of small steel balls, making it well suited to attacking troops, light vehicles, and ammunition and fuel caches out in the open. Regardless of the target set, being able to catch those targets unawares and giving them little warning to try and seek cover would only improve the 2B25’s effectiveness. The video below shows an individual firing an AK-type rifle with a U.S.-made copy of the PBS-1. The basic concept of using a self-contained cartridge with a piston to create “silent” isn’t new. Both the Soviets and the United States developed various small arms rounds using this principle for rifles, pistols, and even shotguns during the Cold War. The Soviet Union, and now Russia, however, remained far more interested in the idea, especially with regards to pistols, after the United States had largely abandoned the concept. When it comes to small arms, the advantage of a piston cartridge is that it offers the benefits of a sound suppressor without having to actually use one, reducing the length and bulk of a “silent” weapon. The Soviet Union’s PSS , S4M , and MSP pistols are all extremely compact and ideal for concealed carry by special operators or intelligence agents. The drawback to piston ammunition is that by keeping the propelling gasses contained inside the cartridge, they exert less outward force to actually move the projectile. This, in turn, typically limits the maximum effective range of the weapon system. For compact pistols that troops and covert operatives might use to quietly eliminate sentries or guard dogs or assassinate someone, all of which typically occur at extremely close ranges, this isn’t much of a problem. https://youtube.com/watch?v=M-QNc2YmUNE For an indirect fire weapon such as a mortar, this could be more problematic. Burevestnik claims the 2B25 has a maximum range of just less than three-quarters of a mile, less than half that of many modern 60mm lightweight infantry mortars . It does offer similar range to other ultra-compact “commando” mortars that various companies offer specifically for special operations use, such as the Czech ANTOS 60mm mortar . But those systems can be half the weight or less of the 2B25. The Gull’s clear advantage over either type is its capability to operate with very little visual or auditory signature. It might also reduce the infrared signature of the mortar, making it even hard for opponents to spot it from the ground or the air. This could allow spetsnaz units to easily get it within range of their target, especially at night, and then engage it quickly in a hit-and-run style attack before withdrawing to safety. The mortar and its ammunition are light enough for troops to carry on dismounted patrols, as well as during airborne and airmobile operations. Russian special operators from the 45th Guards Independent Spetsnaz Brigade take up positions during a training exercise., Vitaly Kuzmin The typical rate of fire for the 2B25 is 15 rounds per minute, but troops can lob up to 30 mortar bombs every sixty seconds for a short period of time if necessary. That’s a lot of firepower to send an enemy’s way while they’re likely to be still scrambling to find out where the rounds are coming from, let alone trying to mount a counterattack. Even if the rounds did little damage and caused few injuries to the enemy force, the attack could sap their morale and create a pervasive sense of fear that incoming mortar bombs could come at virtually any time with little warning. This might prompt an opponent to adopt a more defensive posture that requires troops to be in or near cover as often as possible, which could hamper their normal day-to-day activities. So, while the 2B25 does have real limitations and the Russian defense industry is well known for presenting fanciful weapon concepts that have little likelihood of becoming a reality, the idea of a sound-suppressed mortar is a very real concept. It won’t replace standard infantry mortars, but it may give Russia’s elite forces a way to launch devastating, or at least demoralizing, surprise attacks on their opponents before slinking away into the night.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2018",Behold The First Official Photo Of The Navy’s New NC-37B Missile Tracking Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has publicly announced that it took delivery of its first NC-37B missile range support aircraft earlier in 2018. It is now headed to Raytheon, which will integrate a host of specialized mission equipment into the plane so it can keep missile ranges clear of hazards during tests, gather important telemetry data from those launches, and serve as a communications relay platform. The Naval Air Systems Command officially received the NC-37B, a modified Gulfstream G550 business jet, on July 30, 2018 . Scramble Magazine had been the first to catch a glimpse of the plane, which is already wearing the colors of the “Bloodhounds” of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Three Zero (VX-30), which is headquartered at Naval Base Ventura County in Point Mugu, California, the month before. “Just getting to this point has been a process,” U.S. Navy Captain Steven Nassau, the program manager for the NC-37B project, said at an official acceptance ceremony . “Delivering the aircraft under cost and on schedule is a major milestone for such a complicated project.” In June 2018, Scramble had reported that the aircraft had received the Bureau Number (BuNo) 166379/100 serial number, but an undated picture the Navy released in September 2018 showed the aircraft was still wearing the U.S. civil registration code N544GD. It is entirely possible that the photograph predates when it received its BuNo. Whatever the case, the new jet will eventually replace one of VX-30’s aging NP-3D “Billboard” range support aircraft when it comes back from Raytheon with its full suite of systems. At its core, the NC-37B uses Gulfstream’s G550 Airborne Early Warning (AEW) airframe configuration, also known as the Conformal Airborne Early Warning (CAEW) variant, which features an enlarged nose, new fairings on the fuselage sides, and a modified tail, among other features. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) originally helped develop this version for, as its name implies, aerial early warning missions with the modified airframe housing large conformal radar arrays, additional communications gear, and various other systems. The CAEW configuration also has extra power generation and cooling capabilities to support all the added electronics. Italy and Singapore now also operate AEW Gulfstreams based on this modified fuselage design. The U.S. Air Force looks set to follow suit with what could turn out to be an “EC-37B” and IAI might pitch the CAEW configuration to the United Kingdom as an option to replace the Royal Air Force’s E-3D Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) A basic overview of the G550 CAEW configuration., Gulfstream The Navy’s NC-37B’s role will, in part, also involve air and maritime surveillance around U.S. government missile test ranges facing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, such as the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii, Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Navy’s range support aircraft keep an eye out for planes and boats deliberately or accidentally entering into the test area, which could prove dangerous for them and U.S. military personnel. Those intruders also present a potential operational security risk , as the missile and missile defense-related tests VX-30 supports are often highly sensitive, if not outright classified. These research and development events may also involve other top-secret systems, as well. For example, on May 26, 2014, a pair of NP-3Ds from VX-30 provided range support during a secretive Navy “flight test event” called Polar Bear. The objective of this test, which involved firing a sounding rocket, was to help evaluate the Cobra King missile-tracking radar system on the USNS Howard O. Lorenzen spy ship, Naval Sea Systems Command told The War Zone in 2017. The USNS Howard O. Lorenzen “missile range instrumentation ship” spy vessel. The Cobra King radar arrays are visible at the stern., USN To support this surveillance mission, as of 2014, Gulfstream was working under the assumption that the Navy’s NC-37B would carry a version of Telephonics’ AN/APS-143 X-band “Ocean Eye” radar in its nose. Versions of this radar are also found on the U.S. Air Force’s E-9A Widget range support aircraft and the Indian Air Force’s P-8I Poseidon maritime patrol plane. The latest iterations of the APS-143 are multi-mode systems that can function in search and synthetic aperture modes, the latter of which gives it imaging and mapping capabilities. Its search capabilities are powerful and precise enough to spot a life raft size object at ranges up to 25 miles away depending on altitude. However, in 2015, Gulfstream only said it was configuring the nose to accommodate a “notional search radar.” With the APS-143 still in production, it remains a very likely option. A 2014 Gulfstream briefing slide showing the planned NC-37B nose configuration with the AN/APS-143C(V)3 radar., Gulfstream The side fairings appear to be set aside for the telemetry arrays that will be able to monitor missiles in flight and help gauge their performance during tests. VX-30’s existing NP-3Ds have various S- and L-band radars to perform this function and are able to track multiple, geographically separated targets at once. It is likely that NC-37B will also have still and video cameras to collect imagery of the launches. The NP-3Ds have Cast Glance still picture camera system and Cluster Ranger electro-optical full motion video camera systems. The pod on top of the plane’s tail will house a satellite communications antenna and the fuselage will be covered in various other aerials associated with high-frequency and very-high-frequency radios, data links, ultrahigh-frequency navigational equipment, GPS, air traffic control and collision avoidance systems, and more. The communications and data-transfer systems will enable the aircraft to send surveillance and telemetry data back to personnel on the ground, as well as serve as a relay between those individuals and other air and sea assets present during a launch. We don’t know what, if anything, might go in the fairing at the rear of the jet. A Gulfstream briefing slide showing the NC-37B’s antenna layout as of 2015., Gulfstream The Navy also says that the CAEW configuration will provide room add in new and improved systems in the future, which will help the service readily upgrade and expand the NC-37B’s capabilities as necessary, which could help save money in the long run. Just replacing the old NP-3Ds with a G550-based aircraft will help trim costs given the improved fuel efficiency and lower overall operating costs of the newer aircraft. At the same time, since the NC-37B does not appear to share many, if any, missions systems with the standard G550 CAEW configuration, so Raytheon will still face a major integration task getting the various radars and other equipment that are unique to the aircraft into the airframe within the space available. The Navy has not disclosed how long it expects this work to take, but has said that it expects the plane to reach initial operational capability by 2021. We will hopefully get to see more of this interesting and important aircraft as it moves closer to entering operational service.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Six sailors assigned to the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth got a little too celebratory during the ship’s inaugural visit to the United States. The big vessel—displacing 65,000 tons—and her Type 23 frigate escort docked at Naval Station Mayport in Florida on Thursday . It’s visiting the United States to host F-35B strike-fighters for the very first time. According to Jacksonville CBS affiliate Channel 47, the six sailors were charged with drunk and disorderly conduct and three were charged with resisting arrest. Channel 47 reports: “One of the three pushed and pulled an officer; the second refused to put his hands behind his back and was stunned by a Taser; and the third was actively fighting and refused to stop, officers said. These arrests reportedly took place late Wednesday into early Thursday. … A sergeant with the police department said the sailors were getting into drunken fights mostly with one another. Officials said there have been no further issues since speaking with the ship’s leaders.” Not the best first impression, but it’s not like these things don’t happen. U.S. Navy sailors have gotten into their share of trouble around the globe over the years too. The 11-week flight operations test period will see the ship head north, off the Maryland coast, where a pair of F-35Bs will make their first landings and takeoffs from its spacious deck. It will mark the first time a fixed wing aircraft has set down on a Royal Navy carrier since 2010, when Harrier GR9s took off from the HMS Ark Royal for the last time. The UK Ministry of Defense described the upcoming critical developmental evolution as such: Around 200 supporting staff, including pilots, engineers, maintainers and data analysts will be joined by two ‘orange wired’ test aircraft, belonging to the ITF, which are expected to conduct 500 takeoffs and landings during their 11-week period at sea. The aim of these initial, or ‘developmental’ trials are to ascertain, through the specially equipped aircraft and sensors around the ship, the operating parameters of the aircraft and ship, in a range of conditions. Similar successful trials were conducted by HMS Queen Elizabeth at sea earlier this year for Rotary Wing aircraft. Four F-35B Lightning developmental test pilots, who are members of the ITF, will embark to fly the aircraft; three British, one American. The British personnel comprise a Royal Navy Commander, a Squadron Leader from the Royal Air Force and one civilian test pilot. They will be joined by a Major from the US Marine Corps. The trials follow the recent arrival into the UK of the first joint Royal Navy, Royal Air Force F-35B jets, based at RAF Marham. ‘Operational testing’, utilizing British F-35B aircraft are scheduled to take place on board HMS Queen Elizabeth next year. The deployment, known as ‘WESTLANT 18’, will be the first-time HMS Queen Elizabeth will have sailed across the Atlantic. As well as the vital deck trials, it will also involve exercises to prove the ability to operate with other nations’ maritime and aviation assets, as well as the landing of Royal Marines and their equipment ashore in the United States, to conduct training with their US counterparts. USMC F-35Bs will operate alongside their UK counterparts aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth once she is declared operational in the coming decade. AP It’s also worth noting that Mayport lost its resident supercarrier when USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) was retired in 2007. The community, and Florida in general, have been trying to get another carrier based in Mayport ever since. Currently, the naval base lacks the support infrastructure for nuclear-powered vessels, so the biggest ship based there is the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7). The Navy has said upgrading the facility for nuclear operations would be cost prohibitive, while proponents of the idea say it’s strategically absurd to have all east coast-based supercarriers stationed in one place, that being Norfolk, Virginia. With interest growing in the U.S. Navy procuring smaller, conventionally-powered carriers sometime in the future as nuclear powered supercarriers have drastically increased in price and just getting rid of them once they are retired could cost billions . Above these issues, there are unique operational advantages to fielding smaller, conventionally powered carriers—ones very similar to HMS Queen Elizabeth but configured for catapult and arresting gear operations. Mayport would likely be the first place a vessel like this would be stationed. With all that in mind, the visit of HMS Queen Elizabeth will certainly be an example that Mayport will use when trying to make their case to bring a carrier back to their community. Also, as the Navy and USMC learn more about Queen Elizabeth , the proponents for fielding smaller carriers that use conventional fuel could also increase. We’ll report back as this highly important deployment of HMS Queen Elizabeth proceeds and hopefully, there won’t be any more arrests to report.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 14, 2018","North Korea Parade Strikes Lighter Tone, But Still No Evidence Kim Intends To Give Up Nukes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea recently held yet another major parade, full of military hardware, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the country’s founding, but its nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles were notably absent. There is still absolutely no indication that North Korean premier Kim Jong Un intends to ever give up these weapons, but he could be looking to give U.S. President Donald Trump a political victory in hopes of jumpstarting negotiations between the two countries and securing new concessions . The parade itself occurred in the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Sept. 9, 2018, and had already been the subject of weeks of intense scrutiny on the part of North Korea experts and the media . Almost half of the procession consisted of floats and other elements that reflected Kim’s publicly stated focus on developing the country’s economy and civilian infrastructure. The regime also held a spectacular mass sporting event, full of highly choreographed gymnastics and dances, the first time one like it has occurred in five years. “It’s incredible how North Korea stays ‘on brand’ – last year’s parade was all about nukes and this year it’s all about the economy,” CNN international correspondent Will Ripley Tweeted out from Pyongyang during the ceremonies. “But one thing that hasn’t changed – praise & adulation for Kim Jong Un and his predecessors Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung was still front and center.” While the parade had a heavy economic focus and left out the most controversial parts of the country’s arsenal, it was still primarily a military event. Pictures and video show throngs of goose-stepping soldiers, tanks, ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles , artillery, anti-aircraft systems , and other weapons as military aircraft, including some of North Korea’s dated, but surprisingly relevant An-2 biplanes , flew overhead. The North Koreans also showed off what appeared to be a new, more modern-looking self-propelled howitzer with a design reminiscent of the South Korean K-9 Thunder . There was also a heretofore unseen 6×6 armored anti-tank guided missile carrier that appeared to be derived from the Soviet-era BTR-80 armored personnel carrier. Though the exact specifications of these vehicles are unclear, they are an indication that Kim’s regime continues to improve its conventional military capabilities in defiance of international criticism and economic sanctions. What appears to be a new North Korean self-propelled howitzer at a parade honoring the 70th anniversary of the country’s founding on Sept. 9, 2018., Kyodo via AP Images Still, the decision to leave the ICBM’s at their bases was enough to draw laudatory statements from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has generally spoken positively of North Korea’s brutal dictator Kim since the two men met for a historic summit in Singapore in June 2018. “This is a big and very positive statement from North Korea,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sept. 9, 2018. “Thank you To Chairman Kim. We will both prove everyone wrong!” he continued “There is nothing like good dialogue from two people that like each other! Much better than before I took office.” “[Kim] made it clear that his trust in President Trump remains – and will remain – unchanged, even though there have recently been some difficulties in negotiations between the North and the United States,” South Korean Envoy to North Korea Chung Eui Yong said on Sept. 6, 2018, following a vist to Pyongyang. “He said he wished he could eliminate 70 years of hostile history with the United States, improve North Korea-U.S. relations, and realize denuclearization within the first term of President Trump.” But despite Kim’s claims that he wished he could give up North Korea’s nuclear weapons, his decision not to show off intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) such as the Hwasong-15 should not necessarily be seen as an indication that the country is willing to negotiate away those capabilities. If anything, it’s an indication that the country’s government feels it has established itself as a legitimate nuclear power, as its officials and state media outlets routinely explain , and sees no need to publicly flaunt these capabilities any more than the United States does. “I spoke with two North Koreans who participated in the parade. Both said they felt their country didn’t need to display ICBMs because they’ve ‘already completed’ their nuclear program,” CNN’s reporter Ripley wrote in another Tweet. “When I asked one man if he thinks North Korea should denuclearize, he quickly replied ‘never!’” Both of these statements are almost surely reflective of North Korea’s state policy. It is highly unlikely that North Koreans attending such a public and heavily monitored event would have dared to offer up a contradictory opinion to a foreign journalist. North Korean An-2 biplanes fly in a formation depicting a “70” during the country’s 70th-anniversary parade on Sept. 9, 2018., Kyodo via AP Images As we at The War Zone have noted repeatedly in the past, the North Korean definition of “denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula” is widely at odds with the U.S. government definition of that proposition. For authorities in Pyongyang, it is a description of a complex process that centers on eliminating the threat of nuclear war against North Korea. This is implicitly linked to a formal peace deal between the United Staes and North Korea, rather than an armistice, the removal of American troops from South Korea, and an end to the U.S. government’s policy of including South Korea under the protection of its so-called “nuclear umbrella.” Only then, would the North Koreans consider giving up their nuclear arsenal and delivery systems, which they see as a guarantor of the regime’s survival . Though, as Trump regularly boasts , the North Koreans have not tested a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon in months, every other publicly available indication is that the country continues to expand its ability to develop and produce both types of weapon systems. Officials in Pyongyang reportedly rebuffed repeated attempts by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo since the Singapore summit to get the country to agree to dismantle even a token part of its nuclear arsenal. In fact, they haven’t even gotten to the point where North Korea is willing to declare how many nuclear weapons and delivery systems it actually has, and the nature of each weapon in its inventory, a key step needed robust denuclearization negotiations to even begin. On Sept. 10, 2018, National Security Advisor John Bolton, in a talk at the conversation Federalist Society, again complained that the North Koreans were not upholding their end of the bargain on denuclearization. Bolton, among others in the U.S. government, understands denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula to mean a deal by which North Korea pledges to dismantle its existing nuclear capabilities and take concrete steps to prevent it from ever acquiring nuclear weapons again in the future. “We’re still waiting for them,” he said , despite the two countries not even agreeing on the basic definition of denuclearization. “[Trump] can’t make the North Koreans walk through the door he’s holding open.” North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un, in black, stands next to a Hwasong-15 ICBM on its transporter-erector ahead a of test in November 2017., KCNA On Sept. 10, 2018, NBC News reported that North Korea looks set to produce between five and eight more nuclear warheads this year, the same as it was before the U.S. president’s historic summit with Kim, according to unnamed U.S. officials. Earlier in 2018, experts and observers also identified what appear to be new and expanded production facilities for missiles and fissile material . Still, the composition of the 70th-anniversary parade is notable and could indicate North Korea’s continued interested in negotiating with the United States and Trump in particular. In August 2018, the U.S. president indicated his desire to meet with Kim again . For its part, North Korea also appears to be in favor of this, which makes perfect sense. By any reasonable assessment , North Korea came away from the Singapore summit with concessions, an improved international standing, and the long-sought image of its totalitarian leader on an even ground with a sitting U.S. President while giving up very little to the United States in return. Most importantly, Trump called off major U.S.-South Korean military exercises without receiving any guarantee that the North Koreans would make even a goodwill gesture in response. There are no plans to call off any future American drills in South Korea, but officials in Pyongyang might see an opportunity to try to negotiate on that point again. North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un waves during his country’s 70th-anniversary parade on Sept. 9, 2018., Kyodo via AP Images Kim and his advisors could hope to try and exploit Trump’s freewheeling style to elicit other beneficial deals, as well. North Korea is especially eager to secure a formal end to the Korean War, replacing the existing Armistice Agreement with an actual peace deal, which could help give it greater access to the international community and normalize its position in international politics. Separately and without representatives from the United States present, North and South Korean officials have been meeting to discuss a lasting peace agreement, among other things, as part of a process that began with another summit in 2018 between South Korea’s President Moon Jae In and Kim Jong Un. North Korea’s goal here also appears to be to drive a wedge in policy between authorities in Seoul and their American counterparts, potentially putting the two long-standing allies at odds over the future of the Peninsula. As such, the nature of the recent parade itself seems to be geared, at least in part, toward giving Trump a tangible political victory to bolster the case for renewed negotiations. In August 2018, North Korean state media praised Trump and his willingness to meet with Kim, blaming his detractors for holding up normalization in relations between the two countries and progress toward a lasting peace. This is a particularly noteworthy change in tone for these outlets when talking about any U.S. president. At the same time, keeping the IBCMs out of the spotlight doesn’t draw unnecessary attention from the United States or other world powers, including China. It also does nothing to challenge the U.S. government’s narrative that Chinese authorities are the ones not doing enough to help encourage North Korea to denuclearize, further fueling an increasingly bitter trade war between the two countries. All of this distracts from what the North Koreans are doing themselves, chiefly building more missiles and nuclear weapons, and violating international sanctions to do it. So far, we don’t know for sure how the United States or North Korea will proceed diplomatically from here. There are no firm plans yet for another Trump-Kim summit and U.S. officials continue to struggle in negotiating more minor deals, including the repatriation of additional remains of fallen American service members from the Korean War. Earlier in September 2018, the U.S. and North Korean officials met in the South Korean border enclave of Panmunjom to try to kickstart those talks. Both Trump and Kim obviously want to meet again, but appear to have wildly different expectations of what a second summit might offer. There is nothing to suggest the North Korean regime would be at all willing to negotiate away its nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, except in exchange for significant concessions that the United States seems equally unlikely to offer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 7, 2018",USAF Plans To Drastically Boost Flexibility of U-2s and RQ-4s By Adding Modular ‘Agile Pods’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is planning to hire a contractor in the coming months to demonstrate a new sensor suite that blends together various powerful multi-mode cameras with a laser-imaging system into a single, relatively compact package. The service wants it to be small enough to fit inside its AgilePod modular sensor pod, which could then go onto either a manned U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane or unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk drone. The Air Force Research Laboratory (ARFL) first announced plans for the project back in July 2018 , at which time it expected to hand the contract, worth approximately $92 million, directly to UTC Aerospace Systems , also known as UTAS. On Aug. 15, 2018, the Air Force decided to hold a full competition for the work, stating its plans to issue a formal solicitation early in the 2019 Fiscal Year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2018. AFRL had originally argued that hiring UTAS made the most sense since the company makes the MS-177 multi-spectral sensor system, which will be at the core of the suite of sensors it is looking to acquire. The complete setup will also include a UTAS-supplied short-wave infrared camera and a UTAS-designed telescope to increase the range of the MS-177, which the firm developed for the Air Force as part of a project known as Standoff High Resolution Imaging Next Era, or SHRINE. The Multi-Mode LADAR , or M2L, a laser-imaging system, is “government-designed,” according to the original contracting announcement, as is the AgilePod. The Air Force owns the design rights and trademark to AgilePod, which it developed in cooperation with the KeyW Corporation starting 2016. The US Air Force’s AgilePod modular sensor pod with a pair of sensor turrets from an earlier test in 2017., USAF AgilePod is a “lego-like” system that can consist of between three and five individual sections, each of which is able to house a different sensor system. You can read more about how it works and the inherent benefits in our past profile of this modular system here . The new sensor suite will include a “novel hyperspectral imager ,” as well, but it’s unclear who might be the source of this system. Not to miss the opportunity for another convoluted acronym, the service has dubbed the entire, combined project CHASM, standing for Contract for Hyperspectral, AgilePod, SHRINE and M2L. It’s not clear how the Air Force expects all of these sensors to fit inside the same space and weight limits as the standard MS-177 or not require any additional power. It is very possible that the service could eventually abandon that plan and as whichever contractor it hires to integrate various portions of the complete package into multiple payload bays in a single AgilePod. A graphic showing AgilePod’s modular nature., KeyW Corporation By itself, the MS-177 is already a powerful sensor system, which takes imagery of targets at long distances across seven different spectral bands and then fuses them into a single, one-meter resolution image. A single camera able to capture still or video imagery in any one band might not be able to pick up certain details, but together they can produce a highly detailed image. UTAS has also developed the improved MS-177A, which expands this “spectral performance” to 10 bands, allowing for even more detailed imagery. In addition to the imaging component, this sensor system also has geo-location capabilities, a ground moving target indicator mode, a wide-area persistent surveillance functionality that allows for the rapid collection of imagery across a broad zone of interest. A sample image from an MS-177 during a test of the system on board an RQ-4 drone., Northrop Grumman The Air Force’s goal is for the entire suite to not exceed “the size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of the MS-177,” according to the ARFL contracting notice. Needless to say, this would offer significantly enhanced capabilities over the base UTAS sensor system. The new telescope, in particular, combined with either the high-altitude capabilities of the U-2S or the RQ-4, could let those aircraft peer even further into denied areas using a slanted flight path , all while still remaining safely away from enemy air defenses or other threats . The Dragon Lady remains in service and able to fly in “ marginally contested ” areas in no small part because of this operating concept. It can also fly considerably higher than the Global Hawk, improving its capabilities in this regard, which convinced the Air Force to abandon plans to replace the Cold War-era jets with drones , at least for the foreseeable future. Adding aerial LADAR, also known as LIDAR , to the mix would also give the sensor suite the ability to produce three-dimensional renders of a target area. These systems can also detect objects underneath dense foliage and spot subtle differences in surface elevation that could be indicators of buried objects, such as improvised explosive devices . An image of prehistoric Native American mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument created using aerial LADAR. In military applications, laser imaging systems can use these same capabilities to map and uncover similarly subtle structures and other objects of interest. , National Park Service Hyperspectral imaging also allows for the collection of imagery that can show variations in surface density or otherwise identify objects by their physical composition. This again could help spot roadside bombs and other objects hidden under various types of natural and man-made camouflage. By configuring the entire sensor suite to fit inside the AgilePod , the Air Force is also setting it up to be easy for personnel on the ground to rapidly swap it out for other sensors, if necessary. Lockheed Martin, which developed the U-2S and continues to support the aircraft, is already working with the service on ways to consolidate and expand the aircraft’s sensor capabilities. At present, the Dragon Lady can carry either Senior Year Electro Optical Reconnaissance System-2 ( SYERS-2 ), from which UTAS derived the MS-177, or the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System-2 ( ASARS-2 ) in its nose, but not both. So-called “super pods” under the wings carry electronic and signals intelligence sensors. Substituting one or both of the super pods for AgilePods could offer a way to allow the U-2S to carry both the MS-177 and the ASARS-2 at the same time, as well as other sensors, depending on how much space there is left over. Having more and more varied sensors on a single aircraft would only improve its flexibility during every sortie, as well as reduce the total number of aircraft and sorties necessary to gather the same amount of intelligence. A U-2S fitted with the ASARS-2 nose., USAF Regardless, swapping out the modular pods or the sensors inside of them would be easier than reconfiguring the Dragon Lady’s nose. Ground crews could even have multiple pods with different combinations of sensors ready to go, further reducing the time it might take to install the desire sensor package on an aircraft before a mission. Units operating RQ-4s would see the same benefits from using an AgilePod-based system. The Global Hawk has its own modular Universal Payload Adapter and any upgraded MS-177-based sensor that retains the basic size, weight, and power requirements would be able to fit inside that space, as well. An RQ-4 Global Hawk carrying the SYERS-2 system via its Universal Payload Adapter., Northrop Grumman The Air Force is also looking at integrating AgilePod onto other types of manned planes and drones, including the MQ-9 Reaper , and has tested the pod on a World War II-era DC-3 , an RC-26 surveillance aircraft , and Textron’s Scorpion light jet . This would help the service save money and reduce logistical strain since it could buy the basic pods in bulk and then issue them to different units no matter what aircraft they operate. It’s not obvious how the Air Force expects to fit the pod onto either the U-2S or RQ-4. Unlike the previous AgilePod test platforms, both of these aircraft have long, slender wings that are ill-suited to underwing stores and low ground clearance, which would make it difficult to attach the pod to the underside of the fuselage. Whoever the service hires to perform the work will have to solve this integration challenge, along with the aforementioned issue of having to find a way to consolidate all of the sensors to begin with. AgilePod under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper drone, a mounting option that is not likely to work with either the U-2S or RQ-4., USAF But if the upcoming CHASM demonstration is successful, the additional capabilities on top of the existing MS-177 camera system could definitely be a major boon to both the U-2S and the RQ-4 and for the Dragon Ladies it would present yet another argument for continuing to keep them flying for years to come. It’s also yet another example of the many potential benefits of the AgilePod. The Air Force had originally hoped to begin work on the new sensor suite sometime in the 2019 Fiscal Year, but now that the service is planning to hold an open competition for the contract it’s likely whatever the original schedule was has gotten pushed back. It’s still very possible that we could see a U-2S or RQ-4 flying with the new podded sensors in the coming year and we’ll definitely be keeping our eyes out for any indication that the flight testing has started.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are only limited details available, but a U.S. Air Force T-38C Talon training jet from the 80th Flying Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas crashed when the aircraft veered off the runway. There were two pilots on board at the time, both of which ejected. The service has now lost four T-38s to accidents since November 2017 and Talons account for nearly half of the crashes it has suffered so far in 2018. This latest incident occurred at 10:03 AM local time in Texas on Sept. 11, 2018, according to an official statement. One of the pilots is now at the United Regional Medical Center in Witicha Falls, Texas and the other is at the Sheppard Clinic. Both are reportedly in stable condition. An investigation into the cause of the mishap is underway. The crash reportedly caused a small fire, but first responders and explosive ordnance disposal specialists declared the scene safe as of 12:45 PM local time. The latter personnel were on scene to ensure that there were no remaining explosive hazards associated with the aircraft’s ejection seats. The last 12 months have been especially rough on the T-38 community. In November 2017, a pilot from the 87th Flying Training Squadron, part of the 47th Flying Training Wing at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas died when their Talon crashed. Six months later, another T-38 from the 14th Flying Training Wing at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi crashed, but both pilots were able to eject safely. Most recently, in August 2017, yet another Talon from the 71st Flying Training Wing at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma came down in a field. The pilot in that incident was also able to successfully eject. This latest T-38 mishap is the seventh non-combat related crash the Air Force has experienced in 2018 and the third involving a Talon. The U.S. military’s aviation communities as a whole have seen a significant rise in major , deadly accidents this year. The T-38C force has received a number of major upgrades over its lifetime, but the average age of jets is approaching 50 years. The USAF will supposedly announce the winner of the Talon trainer replacement program, known as T-X , at the Air Force Association’s annual symposium later this month.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elements of the U.S. Army’s 1st Cavalry Division have begun testing a new armored vehicle that has the ability to jam enemy communications systems and other emitters. With potential opponents, especially Russia , investing heavily in similar systems , the service is looking to reinvigorate its own electronic warfare capabilities, which largely eroded after the end of the Cold War. Earlier in September 2018, the 1st Cavalry Division’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team sent personnel to the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona for a two-week course in operating the new system, known as the Electronic Warfare Tactical Vehicle (EWTV). In August 2018, the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force (REF) first announced plans to build the EWTVs on a prototype basis for field testing in the United States, as well as potentially Europe and South Korea. “We had nothing and now we have something,” U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Alexander Torres, an electronic warfare technician in the Brigade, explained in an official interview . “We need to make sure it is effective. If we go out there and just let it sit and collect dust and don’t use it and make sure that it also enables the commander to maneuver his forces and gain the advantage in the electronic spectrum, then really it is wasting a valuable resource.” The EWTV uses a 4×4 M1235 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored truck to carry the complete electronic warfare package. We don’t know the exact specifications of the system, but SRC, Inc. is the supplier and has based it around a modified version of their AN/VLQ-12 Duke jammer, according to Breaking Defense . Soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division stand in front of an Electronic Warfare Tactical Vehicle at Yuma Proving Ground., US Army Duke is an outgrowth of a U.S. Army development effort to defeat remote-controlled improvised explosive devices that began in 2005, known as Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare, or CREW. The initial versions of the AN/VLQ-12 went into Humvees , MRAPs, and other Army armored and unarmored vehicles, to provide short-range jamming to prevent terrorists and insurgents from setting off those bombs with cell phones and other remote triggers. SRC has since upgraded the range, power, and capabilities of the Duke system, though, and the latest iterations have the ability to scramble a wider array of signals. The company even demonstrated its ability to knock down drones during one of the U.S. military’s Black Dart counter-unmanned aerial vehicle exercises, Breaking Defense noted . On its website, SRC also now offers what it calls “ Integrated Electronic Warfare Systems ,” which add “plug-in” modular components to Duke. These additional systems provide direction finding, electronic attack, and signal recording capabilities, to allow personnel to better spot hostile emitters and then decide to either attack them or monitor their activities. It seems very likely that the EWTV carries Duke with one or more of these additional components. The vehicle also features various antennas on an extendable mast that would help expand the coverage area of the vehicles. Line-of-sight communication systems often have trouble transmitting across complex terrain, such as hills and mountains, and from within constrained urban areas. Jammers, which flood those emitters with electronic “noise,” have the same limitations. This kind of multi-functional electronic warfare system would give Army units the ability to quickly identify the location of potential hostile units, helping commanders either avoid potential threats or decide how best to attack against them, as well as just gain a better overall picture of how the enemy is positioned around the battlefield. Troops could then decide to jam their transmissions, hampering their opponent’s ability to coordinate their own offensive and defensive operations, warn their comrades of an approaching American force, or request reinforcements or supporting air and artillery strikes. SRC’s integrated concept also includes networked, data-sharing capabilities, which could allow multiple EWTVs to quickly share information with each other, with other Army units, and with other U.S. military or allied forces. Depending on the range and capabilities of any direction finding or geo-location functionality the new vehicle-mounted system has, it might be able to provide target information to directly cue friendly artillery or airstrikes. The EWTV remains very much an experimental capability, which could evolve more in the near future. The EWTV’s mast in a partially deployed position. The coil of black wire gives a sense of how high it would be at its maximum extension., US Army The electronic warfare capability the EWTV offers “has never been used at the brigade-level, so we have to really put it through its paces and see what its capabilities and limitations are,” Torres, the electronic warfare technician, noted . “We have to develop best-practices and TTPs [Tactics, Techniques and Procedures] that will help future units as well as continue the development of a dedicated EW platform.” This isn’t entirely true, though. When the Cold War ended, the Army had so-called Combat Electronic Warfare and Intelligence (CEWI) elements in each of its divisions that would have provided this type of support to their subordinate brigades during operations. By the early 1990s, there were a number of different truck- and tracked-vehicle mounted jamming systems available to Army units with colorful names such as Trackwolf and Traffic Jam . As with short-range air defense , after the end of the Cold War, the Army steadily began phasing out these capabilities without any replacement, with the short-sighted belief that the specter of high-end conflicts against nation-state adversaries with large conventional militaries had effectively come to an end. The service decided it could do this by instead relying on the Air Force and the Navy to provide aerial electronic warfare capabilities using jamming aircraft, such as the EA-6B Prowler and EC-130H Compass Call . The Navy has since replaced its Prowlers with the EA-18G Growler , though the U.S. Marine Corps continues to fly the EA-6B, albeit it will be fully retired in a matter of months. Army units did retain a signals intelligence capability with a secondary electronic support capability to detect, geo-locate, and monitor hostile emissions. However, this system, known as Prophet , has no ability to launch electronic attacks on the enemy by itself. An example of the US Army’s latest Prophet Enhanced system, which uses an M1229 Medium Mine Protected Vehicle (MMPV) as the carrier., US Army The problem, of course, is that this arrangement means Army ground units have no dedicated electronic attack option available to them if aircraft from another service are unavailable for any reason. “This is a huge benefit because now we have it on our time instead of relying on our sister services to provide us with jamming capabilities and hoping it is available when we need it,” the 1st Cavalry Division’s 3rd Brigade’s Torres explained . The aerial assets are already limited in number and could end up spread thin across a wide front during any large-scale conflict. Enemy integrated air defenses or other aerial threats , or just bad weather, might hamper their operations, as well. In contrast, Russia , and to a lesser extent China , has been pouring resources into the development of ground-based electronic warfare systems of varying sizes and capabilities , many of which are mobile and some of which can jam radios and radars at relatively long ranges. The Russians have reportedly been employing some of these systems against U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in Syria. Russia’s Krasukha-2 mobile electronic warfare system, just one of a number of types the Russians have in service, and which can reportedly jam radars and communications systems at extended ranges., Russian Ministry of Defense. So, in addition to developing systems such as the EWTV, the Army is planning to reestablish CEWI-type units – as part of a larger operating concept it has now dubbed Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) – within its combat brigades, which could help get it back on par with potential high-end opponents. There will eventually be electronic warfare companies in each one of its military intelligence brigades, which are dotted around the world to provide support to ongoing and future operations, as well. Depending on how successful the EWTV experiment is and how the vehicle evolves, it might become an attractive option for the Marine Corps, which is also looking to expand its electronic warfare capabilities . Whatever happens, the Army’s new electronic warfare truck is a sign that the service is taking electronic warfare seriously again and is definitely an important stepping stone to revitalizing this critical capability.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s troubled KC-46 tanker program has experienced a double whammy of much needed good news as of late, with the aircraft receiving its FAA Supplemental Type Certification and the USAF placing another order for 18 additional aircraft and associated items, all of which has occurred this month. The purchase is worth $2.9B and brings the total number of Pegasus tankers on the order books to 52 airframes. But even though these are very positive developments, the major ‘category 1 deficiencies’ with the aircraft still have not been mitigated. These include problems with the aircraft’s refueling boom scraping the skin of receiving aircraft and butting back against them during certain conditions, as well as issues with the Remote Vision System that has replaced the traditional boomer’s pod, among others. You can read all about these deficiencies here . According to Boeing, they are still working with the USAF to find fixes to these critical issues. All this comes as the first of the initial batch of 18 KC-46A tankers and nine hose and drogue refueling pods is promised to be delivered to McConnell AFB next month. This target was set after the last delivery date—August of 2017—was blown. Last June, the primary customer for the KC-46—the USAF— had posited publically that Boeing’s goals were too optimistic and that they could deliver the jet in Spring of 2019 at the earliest. Boeing had pushed back against that estimate, keeping to their late 2018 target and last June the USAF acquiesced, with Air Force Under Secretary Matt Donovan stating : “As a result of months of collaboration, the Air Force and Boeing KC-46A teams have reached an agreed joint program schedule to get to the first 18 aircraft deliveries. This includes the expectation the first KC-46A aircraft acceptance and delivery will occur in October 2018, with the remaining 17 aircraft delivered by April 2019. … While the KC-46A flight test program is nearly complete, significant work remains. The Air Force is looking forward to KC-46A first delivery and will continue to work with Boeing on opportunities to expedite the program.” Boeing The last major certification hurdle will be to obtain an FAA Military Type Certificate for the unique, militarized Boeing 767 derivative. Boeing is hoping to receive this certification very soon, but without the major deficiencies fixed, not to mention the possibility of not meeting the agreed upon delivery goals, the company could be running headlong into another round of penalties based on the fixed-price contract negotiated with the USAF. The company has already incurred over $2B in out of pocket expenses for the KC-46 program due to delays and cost overruns. Even with these issues outstanding and the skepticism surrounding the delivery timeline, the KC-46 is here to stay and the USAF absolutely needs this aircraft and in significant quantities. The latest order shows that the flying force is more than willing to bet big on the KC-46 regardless of the developmental hurdles that still plague the program. Additionally, the airframe itself has a very high likelihood of being adapted for other Pentagon uses, including an emerging initiative to replace the E-4B, E-6B, and C-32A with one common platform. The USAF envisions 179 KC-46s being built, but that number could grow and it does not include the possible addition of other missionized variants. We will keep you up to date as the October delivery deadline for the first Pegasus tanker approaches.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",The Pentagon’s Tiny Covert Mics That Clip Onto Your Teeth Are A Game Changer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The days of the iconic image of plainclothes law enforcement , military , and intelligence personnel wearing a small speaker in one ear and talking discreetly into a microphone in the cuff of their shirt may be coming to an end. The U.S. military has handed a small tech company a contract worth approximately $10 million dollars for tiny combination microphone-and-speakers that clip onto the back of your teeth and use vibrations to transmit sounds right into your head. Though it sounds like a gadget you might find in a spy thriller or a superhero movie, the product from California-headquartered Sonitus Technologies is very real and works using well-established science. Defense One was first to get the details about the latest developments of the system, which members of the Air National Guard have already taken to Afghanistan and used during the response to 2017’s Hurricane Harvey along the United States’ Gulf Coast . “The ability to communicate by radio is crucial for our mission,” an unnamed pararescueman from the California Air National Guard’s 131st Rescue Squadron said in an official press release on Sept. 11, 2018. “It enables us to execute in extreme conditions and save lives. But despite having amazing technology, communication still commonly breaks down because of the extreme environments where we operate.” The 131st is situated at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California. This individual is also a “Warrior In Residence” at the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), which is overseeing the contract with Sontius. In 2015, the U.S. military opened this office, which is also in Mountain View, to facilitate more active engagement with private companies developing novel technologies with possible military applications. Sonitus’ system, nicknamed the Molar Mic, helps address many issues units such as the 131st have with their existing communications gear. It completely eliminates the need for headsets or earbuds, head-mounted microphones, and the wires that link all of that together with a larger radio. Instead, an operator with the Molar Mic simply clips that tiny system into the back of last upper molar on one side of their mouth and that’s it. You can speak as normal, even in a whisper, and the built-in microphone will pick it up. When messages come in, the system translates them into vibrations on your teeth, which then reverberate inside your head and into your inner ear. Though the wonders of biology, your own body is able to process all this and turn it back into understandable sounds. The company actually derived the system from a hearing aid that it had developed using the same principle. “Over the period of three weeks, your brain adapts and it enhances your ability to process the audio,” Sontius’ CEO Peter Hadrovic told Defense One . But “out of the gate, you can understand it.” A series of images showing Sontius’ original Medical Soundbite hearing aid and how a user would insert it. This system is very similar to the Molar Mic., Sonitus The Molar Mic is similar in some conceptual respects to throat microphones , which use the vibration of your throat rather than your actual spoken voice. This technology dates back to before World War II and remains in common use today, but only works for outgoing transmissions, not incoming ones. By sticking the microphone-and-speaker inside the mouth, Sonitus’ system also has the ability to pick up someone talking even with a cacophony of sounds around them, such as the spinning blades of a helicopter or the rushing air as someone parachutes out of an airplane, and also effectively cancels out much of that same background noise. The Molar Mic still requires a normal radio to work and connects directly to a low-profile receiver the user wears around their via a wireless Near-Field Magnetic Induction (NFMI) link, similar to how Bluetooth devices link up with your smartphone. NFMI allows for encryption and can work underwater. A second wireless or wired connection then transmits the information to and from the radio or radios, which work as they would if they were connected to any other combination of microphone and speaker. There are also no external components on the head that can get damaged or knocked off. A notional breakdown of how a military operator might employ the Molar Mic together with other more typical communications gear., Sonitus What this then means is that an individual can rapidly change headgear – imagine as U.S. Navy SEAL switching from a diving mask to a combat helmet or soft hat after swimming ashore on a covert mission – without any loss communications connectivity. There is also no need for head-mounted items at all, or to speak into discreet directly into a microphone under your clothes. A person passing by an individual wearing the Molar Mic on a covert or clandestine mission might just assume that they were talking quietly to themselves. With that latter scenario in mind, it’s not surprising that Sonitus received some of its earliest funding from In-Q-Tel , a Central Intelligence Agency-funded non-profit venture capital firm that seeks out new technologies for the U.S. Intelligence Community. Since 1999, it has invested in dozens of companies, most notably Keyhole, Inc . , which became Google Earth in 2006. A US Air Force pararescueman assigned to the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron in Afghanistan speaks through a more traditional microphone headset, giving a good sense of how bulky and complicated existing communications gear is., USAF In-Q-Tel was the organization that helped introduce Sonitus to the Pentagon and the DIU, then known as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), in 2016, which in turn procured a small number of the Molar Mics for the 131st. The squadron then took them to Afghanistan, where they did not employ them on any operational missions, but did experiment with them during training exercises, according to Defense One . However, that experience informed the unit’s decision to bring them to the Gulf Coast in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey, where pararescumen did use the systems. It proved to be especially beneficial in that environment given the need to go above and below water at certain points and to work with the constant drone of helicopters and other machine noise in the background, Sonitus’ Hadrovic explained to Defense One . “This guy is standing in neck-deep water, trying to hoist a civilian up into a helicopter above,” Hadrovic said. “He says, ‘There is no way I would be able to communicate with the crew chief and the pilot if I was not wearing your product.’” There may still be limitations, though. The most obvious one is that each Molar Mic is fitted to an individual user. Any spares would have to be custom made, too, and wouldn’t be interchangeable among other personnel within an organization. It’s not clear how much a person’s teeth might have to move over time before it renders the device uncomfortable to wear or otherwise unusable. Loss of the relevant molars for any reason might cause problems, as well. Poor dental hygiene has already been a surprisingly significant factor in U.S. military readiness problems in the past. At the same time, Sontius says it is continuing to improve the technology and potentially expand its capabilities to be able to pick up and transmit a host of other biometric data. For the U.S. military, this might allow commanders to monitor the vital signs of troops in the field for signs of stress and exhaustion remotely or try to immediately assess a wound while rescue personnel are on route. The Molar Mics do appear to be particularly valuable in various circumstances, such as covert operations and disaster relief scenarios, regardless of any limitations. We don’t know for sure, but it seems very likely that the CIA, which has been funding the project for years, is already using them for clandestine work, especially given that Sonitus had demonstrated a working example of its original hearing aid design nearly a decade ago. With hurricanes and other extreme weather bearing down on the southeastern United States, Hawaii, and Guam, it is possible that the 131st might make another more public deployment again to help in recovery efforts with the mouth-mounted communications gear.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 21, 2018",USAF Trying To Find Weapon Used In Mystery Attacks On US Diplomats As Evidence Points To Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government reportedly has intelligence that indicates Russia is behind a spate of bizarre attacks on American diplomats in Cuba and China. At the same time, American officials are trying to recreate the weapon the attackers might have used with help from the U.S. Air Force. If the Russian connection is true, the incidents would represent a significant escalation in the Kremlin’s already aggressive policies toward the United States , but it would also be in line with a growing number of brazen Russian acts against their opponents overseas, including the attempted assassination of a former intelligence agent in the United Kingdom. On Sept. 11, 2018, NBC News reported , citing unnamed U.S. government officials, that American intelligence agencies had unspecified communications, such as phone calls or Emails, that they had intercepted, which pointed to Russian involvement in the attacks . As of June 2018 , doctors have diagnosed more than two dozen individuals with traumatic brain injuries and other serious health issues that allegedly stem from incidents involving an unknown weapon dating back to at least late 2016. “The State Department has come to the determination that they were attacks,” Peter Bodde, who was previously U.S. Ambassador to Libya and is now in charge of the interagency task force looking into the incidents, told members of Congress earlier in September 2018. There is “no reason to believe this was anything but an intentional act,” another U.S. official separately told NBC News . U.S. officials do not feel confident enough to publicly accuse the Kremlin and the investigation has not yet reached a formal conclusion. The weapon that the attackers used, as well as how it actually injures or sickens an individual, remains undefined, at least publicly. A worker cleans the coat of arms of the United States at the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba., US State Department On Sept. 1, 2018, The New York Times reported that doctors and scientists were more and more inclined to believe that the incidents involved some sort of high-powered microwave directed energy weapon. Research in these systems for both destructive and non-lethal applications dates back to the 1960s and continues in the United States to this day. The Soviets spent considerable resources on the development of these systems, as well. Modern day Russia has since inherited that knowledgebase. In 2014, the National Security Agency (NSA) confirmed that it had “intelligence information” regarding a “a high-powered microwave system weapon that may have the ability to weaken, intimidate, or kill an enemy over time and without leaving evidence,” according to a statement that Washington lawyer Mark Zaid , who routinely works with clients on cases dealing with classified material, obtained and subsequently released to The Times . “The 2012 intelligence information indicated that this weapon is designed to bathe a target’s living quarters in microwaves, causing numerous physical effects, including a damaged nervous system.” At the time, the NSA said it had no evidence that the unnamed “hostile country” in question had or had not used this weapon against Zaid’s client. It was unclear whether the agency had information to confirm or deny whether it even existed, either. Statement from the NSA regarding a potentially lethal microwave weapon given to lawyer Mark Zaid., NSA via Mark Zaid via The New York Times Regardless, it did indicate that there continue to be at least raw, unconfirmed intelligence reports that these kinds of systems exist or at least remain in development among the United States’ opponents abroad. Now, Ambassador Bodde’s task force has reportedly been working to try and reverse engineer the weapon with help from U.S. Air Force personnel at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, who are also helping to develop various directed energy weapons . On Aug. 14, 2018, the U.S. government also brought together representatives from the Department of Energy – including Sandia National Laboratories’ facility in Livermore, California – the National Institutes of Health , and the State Department to video conference with experts attending a neurotrauma conference in Toronto. Physicians from the University of Pennsylvania , who have been treating the victims, had presented their latest findings at that event. Members of the Canadian government, who says its diplomats in Cuba also suffered from mysterious attacks , were also present at this multi-location meeting. Unfortunately, there remains no exact medical explanation for what happened or that might conclusively point to a particular type of weapon. The video below shows an experimental non-lethal high-powered microwave weapon the U.S. military is developing to stop vehicles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=H-tNhWSLufA Even with the available evidence pointing more and more toward the Kremlin, it’s still difficult to identify the exact motives for the attacks or determine whether Cuban or Chinese authorities might have been or still be involved in some way. The most obvious objective for Russia would be to try and drive a wedge between the United States and Cuba and China, as well as make it difficult, if not impossible for the U.S. government to just conduct diplomatic activities in either of those countries. It is possible the Kremlin felt that the thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations under President Barack Obama threatened its position as the island’s main political and international partner, which in turn could have potentially curtailed its ability to conduct military and intelligence operations there. In 2014, Russia had reopened a Soviet-era listening post and around the same time the first attacks reportedly occurred, there were reports that the Kremlin was looking to restart operations at other bases , as well. If this is the case, the Russians have been successful to some degree. The United States has removed all non-essential diplomatic personnel , as well as dependents, from Cuba and, at least initially, the incidents caused a rupture in U.S.-Cuban relations. Despite authorities in Havana denying any knowledge or understanding of what was going on, the U.S. government expelled Cuban officials from the United States in retaliation. In June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump also announced he was reimposing various restrictions on American engagement with Cuba that Obama had relaxed. However, Trump had already pledged to do this as a presidential candidate in 2016 well before the first attacks occurred. Cars drive past the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba., Ramon Espinosa/AP The U.S. should “desist from the continued political manipulation of the alleged health cases,” Cuban officials said after a bilateral meeting in Washington in June 2018. Cuba’s Foreign Ministry also accused the U.S. government of exploiting the situation as a pretext to downsize its diplomatic activities on the island and bring efforts to further normalize relations between the two countries to a virtual halt. Still, despite the incidents, the two countries do continue to maintain formal diplomatic relations. When it comes to China, the Trump Administration has done a lot to chill relations with that country itself with an escalating trade war . As such, it is difficult to tell if the reported incidents at the American consulate in the city of Guangzhou have done anything to contribute to the animus between Washington and Beijing. It has, however, led to a similar drawdown in U.S. government activities at that site . Of course, the motivation would only have to make sense to the Russians themselves, who are already waging a massive information warfare campaign against the United States and its allies , peddling a wide array of conspiratorial claims to deflect from their own malign activities . At the same time, Russia is still working to influence the outcome of various American elections , or at least sow confusion and chaos in their proceedings. Violent attacks on American diplomats wouldn’t necessarily be unprecedented, either, given Russia’s recent willingness to engage in brazen attacks against their opponents, including outright attempts to kill them . In March 2018, the Kremlin’s agents haphazardly used a secretive nerve agent to try to assassinate Sergei Skripal , a retired intelligence agent living in the United Kingdom, underscoring the Russian government’s apparent attitude toward these types of clandestine operations. Emergency services personnel in the United Kingdom inspect a site for evidence of nerve agents in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal., Andrew Matthews/PA Wire via AP The use of some sort of less-than-lethal microwave weapon that creates complicated and difficult to categorize symptoms would offer much greater plausible deniability than a nerve agent attack, or really any kind of direct physical assault for that matter. Depending on how big the device might be, it could be much easier to conceal from the host country’s own authorities, too. Whatever is actually going on, the State Department has no way of doing anything about, at least not yet, according to NBC News . It is now offering bonus pay to anyone who goes to work in Havana in an attempt to get the Embassy running closer to full capacity again. There haven’t been any reports of new attacks since May 2018, but there have been extended periods without any apparent incidents before. In the meantime, the U.S. government’s investigation continues, but, if NBC News ’ report is accurate, we may finally be getting closer to at least some answers.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I recently wrote an article about a Qatari Amiri Flight VVIP 747-8i that was up for sale. The post drew a lot of attention and it was parroted without credit all over the net. Now it seems that the super luxury jumbo jet has repositioned itself from Basel Mulhouse Freiburg Airport in France to Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport in Turkey in a very peculiar way. It flew an eight and a half hour route that saw the jet venture out over the Atlantic, seemingly near the Azores, before heading back towards the northeast, over Brussels, and arching southeast over Budapest and down into Istanbul. Here’s VQ-BSK’s very odd flightpath to Turkey: Flightradar24 I looked into the VQ-BSK’s movements after being pointed towards the Twitter post below, but as the day progressed, the flight’s path looked increasingly odd. It also led me to dig a little deeper as to the aircraft’s movements since it was put up for sale last Spring. Flightradar24.com has some puzzling information regarding its activity. Below you can see it was going about its normal business until those operations ceased around the 15th of March. Then it appears in Tunisia on April 22nd, flying from there to Moscow. Then over the next five months, there are a string of flights without data originating in Moscow and Vladivostok, before the strange September 11th flight from Basel to Istanbul. Flightradar24 Flightradar24 These could very well be anomalies. It does happen, but, in this case, it seems to happen very frequently and between two major Russian cities over a continuous period of time. Assuming these are just errors, today’s flight to Istanbul is still quite odd. If it is a delivery flight to a new owner, who is that owner? Could it be the supposedly cash-strapped Erdogan government? The Turkish government already has a fairly extensive executive airlift fleet. This includes a customized A340-500 and an A330-200, as well as an A318ACJ, and a couple Gulfstream and Citation private jets. Erdogan was famously flying on one of the Gulfstreams during a military coup attempt in the Summer of 2016 —the repercussions of which are still being felt today . This A340-500 serves as Turkey’s top VVIP transport. It was bought from Tunisia in 2016 which had it in storage for the better part of a decade. , N509FZ/wikicommons So it’s not like Turkey isn’t a known consumer of widebody jets used for elite head of state travels. Currently, the 747-8i is the top aircraft used for such missions, two of which will serve as Air Force One in the coming decade. So maybe Erdogan decided to splurge on the best of the best. Controller.com VQ-BSK is already elaborately outfitted for such a role, so even though it is certain to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, buying it second hand would be far less expensive than buying a 747-8i and outfitting it similarly from scratch. Such a project would also take a couple of years to realize at the least. Controller.com It’s also possible that the aircraft is being delivered to another owner in Istanbul. It would be the ultimate flying toy for an oligarch and there may even be a business case for a top-end charter company to acquire it. In addition, sometimes it can be advantageous to execute such a transfer in certain countries, or in the case of the U.S., even in certain states. But regardless of who the buyer may be, it does seem as if the aircraft has been sold as listings offering to for sale have disappeared from major aircraft sales sites. Controller.com We may have to wait a bit to conclusively find out the answers to these questions. But something is clearly going on with this extremely high profile aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 20, 2018",Navy’s Revamped Stealth Destroyer Looks Less Stealthy As It Leaves San Diego For Trials,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ​​​​ USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a controversial ship, to say the least. After much fanfare among the mainstream press, the truth about the ship’s watered-down design , tiny fleet size, useless deck guns , and the implications of these factors, among others, became much more clear. As we reported two years ago , in yet another cost-cutting move, the Navy decided to forego the ship’s very stealth concept—which is the major reason the ships look the way they do, cost as much as they do, and have certain design tradeoffs for doing so—and bolt on communications systems and some sensors in a very unstealthy manner. These corner-cutting measures even included the addition of a rickety looking mast above the ship’s deckhouse. Now we are getting our first glimpses of this disappointing configuration. Zumwalt , which has been undergoing its combat systems outfitting for over a year and a half, emerged from its pier in San Diego Bay and took to open waters on September 11th, 2018. The vessel’s otherworldly appearance drew a lot of attention. As a result, we have our first images of the near fully outfitted ship underway. As you can see, there are EHF and UHF satellite communications systems (ball like structures) tacked onto either side of the ship’s deckhouse. Atop it, towards the forward edge of the deckhouse are two Tactical Common Data Link communications systems. Between them is the new mast, and no it isn’t a temporary structure. To the rear of the ship, above the hangar, we see the cupolas for the 30mm Bushmaster cannons. These were also downgraded from the far more capable 57mm guns as another late-in-the-game cost-saving move. Joshua Gathright- Random Naval History‎ Joshua Gathright- Random Naval History‎ Joshua Gathright- Random Naval History‎ Also worth noting, although it may not significantly impact the radar cross-section of the ship, is the bubble like structure atop the deckhouse and forward of the ships flush-mounted exhaust. This houses the X/Ka band satellite communications antenna system. Generally speaking, these modifications vibe with this graphic released by the Navy that shows the vessel’s final, revised, and cheaper configuration that we originally posted in 2016: David Heath/USN Zumwalt is slated to continue its combat system tests and other trials through 2021 when it will supposedly be ready for combat. Its sister ship, the USS Michael Mansoor (DDG-1001) has been undergoing initial sea trials out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, during which it had a major engine failure that required the complete replacement of one of its Rolls Royce MT30 gas turbines. The repair cost at least $20M. The MT30 is based on the Trent 800 engine found on the Boeing 777. The Zumwalt class’s highly powerful hybrid powerplant is one of its most advanced and exciting features. USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002), the third and last ship in the tiny fleet of ships, is under construction. It will feature a heavier and more radar reflective deckhouse and hangar deck made out of steel instead of composite materials—another cost-cutting measure. The decision could impact seakeeping as well as the ship’s radar signature. The Navy is still working to define the role of these ships within their larger fleet. It has recently declared that they will be focused more on surface strike than anything else, but the big question is what will their longevity be within the surface combatant fleet overall? With fat budgets under the Trump administration, there is money to attempt to push these ships into an operational state and possibly sustain them once there, but that could very well change. As they age and become more expensive to maintain, and especially if budgets retract to their pre-Trump levels, it’s questionable if all three would remain in operational service or if they would be used operationally at all—possibly acting as a test force for future technologies instead. Because of these ships’ unique hardware and software and tiny fleet size, it isn’t hard to imagine one or two being cannibalized to keep at least one active in any capacity. We’ll just have to see how this all plays out. The entire program is a missed opportunity of sorts and another damning example of the paradoxical ‘Pentagon death spiral.’ But the Zumwalt class’s decline in capability and force size has been even more extreme than other programs that experienced a similar fate, such as the B-2 Spirit. The original DDG-1000 concept prioritized low-observability. , USN A fully realized DDG-1000 could have been an amazing fighting ship. The Navy will likely realize this once they see what even the dumbed-down Zumwalt class can do. But with the Navy betting big on the far less ambitious Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer, there is very little chance that expanded production of the Zumwalt class will come to pass. There may be some hope, at least when it comes to the DDG-1000 hullform, though. The Navy needs a new cruiser-sized vessel and they desperately want a hullform that is off-the-shelf. The only one available in the size they are looking for with immense power generation capabilities is DDG-1000. If the ship’s controversial tumblehome hull design doesn’t prove too restrictive during actual operations—or if it can be redesigned with a flared bow—maybe the Zumwalt class will rise again in a vastly remodeled, and probably even less stealthy, cruiser form.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 14, 2018",How U.S. Taxpayers Are Spending $1.8B For Afghanistan To Fly A Couple Dozen A-29 Attack Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military recently awarded the Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, a deal worth over $1.8 billion dollars to support and grow the Afghan Air Force’s fleet of A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft over the next five years. Now we know much more about the exact costs involved in supporting the Afghan planes, the total number of which will grow to least 25 in the coming years. On Sept. 11, 2018, the U.S. Air Force released an official justification for the spending on the U.S. government’s central contracting website, FedBizOpps. Any U.S. government agency has to submit one of these documents for approval when it proposes handing out a sole-source deal, as was the case in this case. The Pentagon had initially announced the contract, a modification to a previous award, in its daily contracting announcement on Sept. 4, 2018 . “SNC is the only company capable of providing these services … without experiencing substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling AAF [Afghan Air Force] requirements,” the contracting document explained . “Delays will result in the reduction of the AAF’s ability to directly support and assist Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) with air-to-ground fires and limit the ANSF’s ability to conduct operations that provide security to the people of Afghanistan and foster legitimacy for the GIRoA [Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan].” The justification says that the approximately $1.808 billion covers work between Jan. 1, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2024, and is broken into seven different components, each with their own estimated value. The money will come out of the Afghan Security Forces Fund within the Pentagon’s budget. Here are the salient details: $339 million for “Interim Contractor Support,” or ICS, at the Afghan Air Force’s two “Main Operating Bases” for the A-29 – Moody Air Force Base in the U.S. state of Georgia and its section of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan – as well as up to two “forward operating locations” at a time. “ICS includes all support actions required for: operating and maintaining the aircraft, aircraft subsystems, and support equipment; aircraft maintenance and personnel; materials and inspections; engine repair, engine overhaul and/or replacement; and maintenance of the ejection seat and canopy to include specialty components.” This means that contractors have to be on site at all of the four locations and are responsible for any work in any of these categories that Afghan Air Force personnel cannot perform themselves. $453 million for “Contractor Logistics Support,” or CLS, covering the entire Afghan Air Force A-29 fleet, which will eventually grow to a minimum of 25 aircraft, as well as three ground training devices. “CLS includes all support actions required for: maintaining the aircraft; fleet-sustainment; aircraft subsystems; accompanying subscription requirements thereto (such as navigational databases); supply of all required A-29 ground support equipment (GSE); and maintenance, repair, or replacement of all SE [support equipment].” As such, it also requires total management of the spare parts pipeline and maintenance oversight in Kabul and at the two designated forward operating bases. $122 million to “develop, document, and process changes” to both the aircraft themselves, such as the integration of new weapons, as well as the sustainment process. This is separate from $40 million for the development of a “Systems Engineering Management Plan” (SEMP) to support the “sustainment, modification, performance, and procurement” of the Afghan Air Force’s A-29 fleet. $22 million for “Over & Above” (O&A) work, which described unforeseen circumstances such as the need to repair battle damage or support surges into operational activity. $823 million to pay for a variety of things, including, but not limited to, as many as 10 more A-29s – which would help bring the Afghan Air Force’s fleet to the goal of at least 25 total aircraft, but could grow the fleet to almost 30 planes – as well as ground training devices, ancillary equipment, and modifications to the existing aircraft. This money, in part, will likely pay for the six Super Tucanos the Air Force announced it was buying on behalf of Afghanistan in November 2017 . This funding will also go toward the relocation of the Afghan Air Force’s A-29 training mission from Moody Air Force Base to Afghanistan proper, which is set to occur sometime after December 2020, and the relocation of main and forward operating sites within Afghanistan to accommodate those additional aircraft and personnel. That money does not include an additional $9 million to pay for the physical shipping of those assets from the United States to Afghanistan. The Super Tucanos represent a core part of the U.S.-backed Afghan Aviation Transition Plan , which aims to grow the Afghan Air Force into a capable force that is able to conduct operations against internal threats on its own. The planes flew a third of all Afghan air strikes between April 1, 2018, and June 30, 2018, according to the Pentagon . Unfortunately, As we at The War Zone have documented on multiple occasions , the NATO-led coalition has and continues to struggle to help Afghanistan meet this goal due to a host of factors, including corruption , desertion , and low literacy rates – something U.S. officials have referred to as “ the Afghan condition .” Only in March 2018, did the Afghan A-29s finally drop laser-guided bombs for the first time in combat , almost four years after the program began and nearly two years after the aircraft entered combat. That the aircraft gave the Afghan Air Force a precision-guided munitions capability had been a major talking point for the U.S. military, as well, despite the planes were actually incapable of doing so until 2017. We at The War Zone were first to report on that reality. An official satellite image of the Afghan Air Force’s Kabul Air Wing’s facilities at Hamid Karzai International Airport as of June 2018. The buildings outlined in red are among those where the US military helps pay the operation and maintenance costs., US Army Corps of Engineers “The AAF’s diminishing ability to directly support and assist Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) with air-to-ground fires limits the ANSF’s ability to conduct operations that provide security to the people of Afghanistan and foster legitimacy for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA),” the Air Force said in its own justification for the sole-source contract to SNC. So, it’s already that the United States feels compelled to spend more than $1.8 billion in the next five years to ensure the Afghans maintain at least a modicum of capability in the meantime. However, it’s not clear exactly how the Air Force arrived at these estimated cost figures, which are significantly higher than one might expect them to be, even for the full future fleet of 25 A-29s. The combined ICS and CLS totals alone seem exorbitant, working out to more than $158 million dollars every year . In 2013, the RAND Corporation evaluated the costs associated with operating and maintaining U.S. Air Force units flying F-16 Viper fighter jets, which are much more expensive to operate and sustain than the A-29. Using Fiscal Year 2010 dollars, the think tank estimated that it cost the Air Force approximately $63.6 million – closer to $70 million in 2018 dollars – to keep Alabama Air National Guard’s 187th Fighter Wing, which has around 22 Block 30 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, running for 12 months. Using RAND’s figures, the annual operating cost of a U.S. Air Force F-16 squadron in 2013, adjusted for inflation, was less than half that of what the Afghan Air Force could find itself spending to operate an equivalent number of A-29s for a year. The annual ICS costs alone are comparable to the costs the 100th Fighter Squadron was incurring when the think tank conducted its study. Contractor’s talk with a member of the Afghan Air Force, in blue, while working on an A-29 Super Tucano at Hamid Karzai International Airport in 2016., USAF It’s hard to understand how this could be an accurate representation of the costs. Part of this could have to do with the need to support activities spread across four locations in two countries, but one would still expect the final price tag for these services to be lower given the much smaller logistical footprint and overall operating costs of the A-29 versus the F-16. The Air Force says that the per-flight-hour cost for a Viper is around $22,000 . SNC says the Super Tucano’s operating cost is closer to $1,000 per flight hour . It is more difficult to accurately assess whether the other cost categories the Air Force outlined in the contract seem overly expensive since they include a far more diverse selection of items and services and there is no line-by-line breakdown. The estimated $1.8 billion is a contract “ceiling,” as well, suggesting that the final value of the deal might not reach that amount. Regardless, it’s also worth noting that the contract will only go toward supporting Afghanistan’s Super Tucanos and doesn’t include any of the money that the United States will also spend over the same period on supporting many of the Afghan Air Force’s other aircraft.  At present, the Afghans are only capable of supporting one type, the Mi-17 helicopter , with only a minimum of contractor support. As part of a U.S.-backed transition plan, refurbished UH-60A+ Black Hawks , which presently require contractors to support nearly 100 percent of their maintenance and logistical needs, are set to replace those choppers in the coming years. The Afghan Air Force relies entirely on private companies for maintenance and logistics support for its six C-130H cargo planes, as well. Afghan Air Force UH-60A+ Black Hawk helicopters., AP Photo/Rahmat Gul This all comes as a resurgent Taliban continues to challenge the country’s government , even briefly taking control of Ghazni , the capital of the province of the same name, in August 2018. The insurgents appear to be trying to pressure the United States and its foreign allies into negotiating a settlement favorable to their agenda and that could include the departure of NATO-led forces . American airpower was essential to ejecting the Taliban from Ghazni, as it has been to keeping the insurgents, along with other militant groups , at bay for nearly two decades now. On Aug. 22, 2108, in his last press conference as head of all U.S. and NATO-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, retiring U.S. Army General John Nicholson went so far as to laud the progress of the Afghan Air Force toward achieving operational independence as an indicator of broader successes in the country against the insurgency. “The [Afghan] air force is doing over half of the airstrikes in the country,” Nicholson said. “This was never the case before.” But if the case of the Afghan Air Force’s A-29s is any indication, it remains very much an American force, and a costly one at that, which looks set to remain dependent on U.S. support for at least the next five years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 17, 2018",Photos Leak Of What Appears To Be Maverick’s Specially Painted Super Hornet For Top Gun 2,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The buzz around the long-awaited sequel to Top Gun is growing as production heats up. Last time we checked in regarding the film some very exciting actors were announced as being attached to the film and camera crews were deployed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln operating with Joint Strike Fighters and Super Hornets in the Atlantic. Now it appears that a custom painted F/A-18F Super Hornet with Pete Mitchell’s name and Topgun titles on it has emerged from the paint barn. You can see the photos of the baby blue and black accented Rhino over at Revengeofthefans.com . We have not attempted to authenticate the photos just yet beyond a cursory examination. There’s is always the chance that this is some sort of an elaborate photoshop, but it doesn’t look like it. The jet has Topgun’s iconic seal on its tail, which means it would belong Naval Air Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC) at NAS Fallon. So it looks like Maverick is an instructor at the school, which is not surprising. There is one issue I see with this paint job. The centerline tank that is painted like the jet says ‘Topgun’ on it—the correct spelling of the Navy Fighter Weapons School’s nickname. But the movie took the artistic license to rename it ‘Top Gun.’ They could always drop the tank for production, and it makes sense to paint it with the real name on the government’s dime so that the jet can be flown normally by the school without the discrepancy. The scheme is a bit odd, with the light blue stripes, as I’m not exactly sure what it draws from, but it looks nice. The three Hornets painted on the side of the cockpit are also a bit puzzling, but if I remember correctly, in Top Gun , Maverick shoots down three ‘MiG-28s’ during the final dogfight scene. Maybe that’s what they are supposed to signify. It’s also an interesting, albeit far-fetched choice to give Maverick his own highly unique looking jet, but it’s Top Gun we are talking about here, so we can’t be too surprised if realism ends up flying a cargo plane full of rubber dogshit out of Hong Kong. It’s also possible that this is a tribute jet to Tom Cruise’s character that was designed by Topgun independent of the production, although that seems a bit too convenient. Production of the movie is definitely accelerating at a rapid pace. Miles Teller, which is going to co-star in the film as Maverick’s young counterpart, recently spent some time at Naval Air Station Fallon—the home of Topgun—checking out the jets and getting a feel for the culture. I have gotten two direct reports on this from aircrew at Fallon saying he has been all over the base and has spent time at the officer’s club with Topgun crews and other Navy staff. Tom Cruise has also been soaking up the world of modern air combat. Just days ago he flew his P-51 Mustang out to Fort Worth to go check out Lockheed’s F-35 production line and learn more about the aircraft. He also made a stop at Marana Regional Airport in Arizona for gas on the way back. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Scott Pasmore (@scottpasmore) It seems clear that everyone, from Paramount to the Pentagon, as well as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are finally realizing just how big of a deal this movie is going to be. And just as I predicted in my last post, the release date has been pushed back a year, from July 2019 to July 2020. Now the big question is what aircraft will be playing the bad guys? Let’s hope it is an actual airframe that flies and not a squadron of computer-generated fighters. The War Zone will continue to keep you up to date as Top Gun: Maverick’s production unfolds.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2018",U.S. Refuses To Allow New Russian Planes To Fly Open Skies Flights Over Its Territory,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. officials have made an apparent snap decision to not certify that Russia’s Tu-214ON reconnaissance aircraft are in compliance with the Open Skies Treaty . This comes as members of Congress have taken an increasingly hard-line stance on the deal, which permits its members to fly legal surveillance missions over each other’s military and other sensitive facilities, claiming that Russia has been violating the spirit of the agreement with restrictions on American missions over Russia and the introduction of new sensor packages on their own planes. On Sept. 12, 2018, the Russian government announced that the United States alone had refused to approve the two Tu-214ONs for Open Skies flights the day before. The Kremlin had begun the certification process for the aircraft in May 2018 . Russia had taken delivery of the first aircraft in December 2013 and received the second one in July 2014. “In breach of the Open Skies Treaty provisions, the head of the U.S. delegation refused to sign the final document, without giving any explanations or reasons, and citing direct instructions from Washington,” Sergei Ryzhko, head of Russia’s National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, which oversees the country’s participation in Open Skies, told the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official news outlet Zvezda . “We insist that the US side return to the Open Skies Treaty framework and demand that the current situation be explained with reference to the treaty’s provisions.” The Russian Ministry of Defense said that the delegations from 22 other countries that visited the Kubinka Air Base outside Moscow to inspect the Tu-214ON had all declared it to be in compliance with the treaty. A total of 72 experts from various countries, including the United States, had arrived in Russia on Sept. 2, 2018, to examine the aircraft as part of the certification process. One of Russia’s two Tu-214ONs., Maksim Blinov/Sputnik via AP But while the United States apparently did not offer any specific reason for its refusal to approve the aircraft at the time, American opposition to aircraft is well known and dates back at least to 2014 . At the core of the U.S. government’s publicly-stated complaints have been concerns about plans to install digital cameras, including ones with infrared capability, and radar imaging equipment on the Tu-214ONs. The Open Skies Treaty does not prohibit any particular type of sensor, but it does require that they provide only limited fidelity. The goal of the agreement is to allow countries to monitor each other’s routine military activities as a confidence-building measure to help prevent any party to the deal from believing that another signatory is planning a surprise attack. In principle, it is not supposed to provide a mechanism to enable anyone to gather otherwise useful intelligence information about an opponent’s specific capabilities. Critics of the arrangement have long argued that Russia gets more out of it than the United States does, given the former’s much more limited access to organic satellite imagery. American legislators have regularly charged that the Kremlin is seeking to further improve its ability to collect more valuable data during its Open Skies flights with the upgraded sensor packages . It’s worth noting that the U.S. government previously certified Russia’s upgrade of its existing Tu-154M-ON aircraft to include an infrared-capable digital camera package. Neither that aircraft, nor the Tu-214ON, features a radar imaging system. So, blocking the approval for the newer aircraft does not prevent the Kremlin from gathering many of the same types of imagery on Open Skies flights. Russia’s Tu-154M-ON, a converted Tu-154M-LK-1, as it says on the side., Dmitry Terekhov via Flickr In 2014, members of Congress had attempted to insert a provision into the annual defense funding bill that would have prevented the U.S. government from using any funds to certify new Russian Open Skies aircraft or their sensors, whether they met the treaty’s requirements or not. In the end, legislators agreed to a compromise in which the Direction of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would submit a report on the potential national security implications within 30 days of any Kremlin proposal to upgrade its planes. In the defense spending package for the 2019 Fiscal Year, which President Donald Trump signed into law in August 2018, lawmakers succeeded in finally inserting the language some had proposed four years earlier. By law, the United States has now banned itself from spending any money – even if it gets approved in a separate bill – in the upcoming fiscal cycle, which begins on Oct. 1, 2018, on certifying Russia’s Tu-214ONs, unless the executive branch meets certain requirements. Before the U.S. government can even consider agreeing to allow the Tu-214ONs to make Open Skies flights, the Congress wants its own certification that it wouldn’t be harmful to American national security and that Russia is otherwise complying with the terms of the treaty. In September 2017, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, told lawmakers that the Russians were in violation of the agreement by restricting flights over Kaliningrad, Chechnya, and South Ossetia. The Kremlin has since relaxed its position on Chechnya, but not the other locations. The U.S. has responded in kind to the Russian moves by blocking requests to fly over certain portions of Alaska and Hawaii. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford., AP On top of all this, the defense spending law demands a thorough assessment of how vulnerable sensitive U.S. military information is to the Russian Open Skies overflights with the new sensors and what it might cost to mitigate the impact of Russia’s improved surveillance capabilities. Congress also wants to know what the Kremlin is actually doing with the information it gathers during the missions and whether it might be cheaper to simply help facilitate access to equivalent commercial satellite imagery to all treaty members, except Russia. This latter demand would seem to point to the actual objective of this provision as being to render the Open Skies Treaty increasingly unworkable with the ultimate goal of doing away with it entirely. By forcing Russia to rely primarily on its lone aging and fuel-hungry Tu-154M-ON, the United States can impose a certain de facto limit on what the Kremlin can do under the treaty immediately. This would all fit with Congress’ complimentary decision to block the U.S. Air Force from spending any funds to replace its own increasingly old and unreliable OC-135Bs . This only limits the United States ability to conduct its own missions under the agreement. One of the US Air Force’s OC-135B Open Skies aircraft., Rostislav Kalousek/CTK via AP The problem is that if the Open Skies treaty collapses, it’s not just the United States and Russia who will see the impacts. The deal provides a very valuable mechanism for smaller countries to observe their neighbors’ military activities and force larger potential opponents to be transparent about what they’re doing. It’s not at all clear whether commercial satellite imagery offers a viable substitute for the surveillance overflights under the treaty, which can occur at more irregular intervals on relatively short notice. There are intangible benefits for a smaller country, such as Ukraine, being able to legally demand access to the territory of a larger neighbor, such as Russia, even in the face of ongoing disputes , as well. A specially modified An-30B surveillance aircraft that the Ukrainian government uses to conduct Open Skies missions., Bomberpilot via Wikimedia Doing away with the treaty also helps Russia erode an important arms control agreement, but without any real repercussions to the Kremlin. The United States is positioning itself as the outlier on this matter, which fits a growing Russian information warfare narrative that it is actually the U.S. government that is seeking to undermine well-established international norms . At the same time, Russia continues to seek to weaken various other international deals. These include the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which Russia has effectively refused to honor since 2007 , and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), which the United States says Russia is also in violation of after having deployed a long-range, ground-based cruise missile system . It remains to be seen what steps either the United States and Russia will take now in response to this most recent dispute over Open Skies. But when the new fiscal year starts at the end of the month, the U.S. government will have little choice but to continue in its opposition to certifying the Tu-214ONs, unless it can assure members of Congress to their satisfaction that the two aircraft do not present a security risk.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 18, 2018",Iran Claims Successful Ballistic Missile Defense Test as Israel Builds A Missile Corps,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran claims that it has successfully tested its Bavar 373 long-range surface-to-air missile system in a ballistic missile defense role. True or not, the announcement comes as Israel is expanding its own conventional ballistic missile and long-range rocket artillery capabilities, some of which it has already used against Iranian interests in neighboring Syria , as part of a larger plan to create a new “Missile Corps.” Iranian Air Defense Force Brigadier General Mahmoud Ebrahiminejad, Deputy Commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base said that the test had occurred in 2017 during an interview with Iran’s Tasnim News Agency on Sept. 10, 2018. Iran has been working on the Bavar 373 since at least 2011 and declared that it completed its initial operational evaluation in January 2018 . Bavar 373 as “more powerful and more reliable” than Russia’s S-300PMU-2, which Iran also operates , Ebrahiminejad claimed. The “biggest advantage,” however, is that Iranian defense companies make the system, so the country does not have to rely on outside suppliers, he added. It’s not clear how much the Bavar 373 does or doesn’t draw from the S-300. When Iran first showed a prototype to the public in 2016, the transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) appeared to be significantly different visually, featuring rectangular launch canisters more in line with the U.S. Patriot surface-to-air missile system than that of Russian designs. The Iranian system also uses a distinct and apparently locally produced phased array radar. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in white turban, learns about the phased array radar associated with the Bavar 373 surface-to-air missile system, seen in the background, in 2016., President.ir However, subsequent examples of the TEL look very much like a variant of the S-300PMU-2. It is possible observers have misidentified these and that they are actually the Russian launchers, but mounted on Iranian-made vehicles. There is also an indication that the TEL with the rectangular launch canisters is actually part of the shorter-range Talash-3 surface-to-air missile system. The Sayyad-4 interceptor itself is visually reminiscent of the Russian 48N6E2 missile for the S-300 system. The 48N6E2 has a maximum range of around 120 miles and Russia claims that it has some ability to engage tactical ballistic missiles. The missile system identified as the Bavar-373 in 2016, which may have been in error., President.ir Whatever the exact connection between the Bavar 373 and the S-300PMU-2, the two systems do appear to be roughly analogous. The Iranians began developing the Bavar 373 in the first place after experiencing difficulties – including sanctions and contract disputes – in acquiring Russian-made long-range surface-to-air missile systems to help defend against the threat of Israeli or American air strikes against sensitive sites , including elements of their controversial nuclear program . Based on what is publicly known about the S-300 and what information is available about the Bavar 373, the latter system would likely only have a limited capability against short-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase of flight. There is also a question about whether or not its radars would be able to adequately spot and track those incoming threats and cue the interceptors to hit them. Still, it’s not surprising that Iran would now be increasingly interested in developing a ballistic missile defense system of its own and looking to see if Bavar 373 could provide at least some capability in that role. Though most reports focus on Iran’s own ballistic missile development programs , it faces its own threats from various regional opponents, such as Saudi Arabia, which has an arsenal of Chinese-made DF-3 Medium Range Ballistic Missiles and more recently purchased much more capable DF-21s . Plans for a new “missile corps” in Israel may be even more worrisome to Iran, though. In January 2018 , Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), agreed on the plan, which could cost Israel up to $2 billion in total in the coming years. The effort entails the expansion of Israel’s long-range, precision-guided rocket artillery capabilities, centered on the Extended Range Artillery (EXTRA), which has a range of 80 miles. The Israeli Navy’s existing Sa’ar 5 – and future Sa’ar-6 -class corvettes would also get a navalized version of this system. A ground-launched EXTRA system., IMI Systems When the Israelis first announced the plan, there was also talk of introducing an air-launched version of EXTRA, which had already been in development for some time at that point. In June 2018, the manufacturer, Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems, publicly unveiled this weapon, now known as Rampage . Under the initiative Lieberman and Eisenkot put together, the IDF would also eventually receive unspecified missiles with ranges of more than 185 miles. In June 2017, Israel Aerospace Industries demonstrated its containerized Long-Range Artillery (LORA) system using a truck-mounted launcher sitting on a ship. LORA can hit targets almost 250 miles away and is readily adaptable to various ground- and naval platforms. The immediate driving force behind the missile corps plan is the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and its own growing missile and rocket arsenal . Israel is looking to establish a layered response involving air, land, and sea assets that could quickly engage those targets if necessary and provides different vectors of attack depending on the exact nature of the threat. The range of the systems involved would also allow them to challenge Israel’s other opponents in the immediate vicinity, chiefly Syria , where it has already been conducting routine air strikes for years as a sideshow to that country’s brutal civil war . In May 2018, the IDF launched a massive series of strikes against Iranian interests in Syria, as well as Syrian air defense systems, with air and artillery strikes , which would seem to indicate that the IDF has already begun to institute the new concept of operations. The expanding IDF ballistic missile and rocket artillery capabilities, especially the air- and sea-launched types, would also improve Israel’s ability to project conventional power further beyond its borders, including to Iran. Rampage boasts supersonic speed, while ballistic missiles generally reach hypersonic speeds, allowing both types of systems to better punch through hostile integrated air defenses. This would also give the Israelis an improved ability to conduct short-notice strikes on time-sensitive targets. The Missile Corps could also target air defense nodes to pave the way for follow-on strikes. Beyond that, the combination of surface-based and aerial stand-off strikes from multiple vectors would give the IDF additional operational flexibility and make it harder for an opponent to respond in general. The country’s already robust intelligence and electronic surveillance assets could help feed targeting information to the new missile- and rocket-equipped units, further reducing the time it takes for Israeli forces to identify a target and then engage it. “There is no reason we won’t be able to strike every single target with intensity and precision, even without jets,” Lieberman told Al-Monitor in August 2018. “We absolutely must have an alternative to the air force. We can’t afford to put all our eggs into one basket, no matter how sophisticated that basket may be.” Historically, the IDF has relied almost exclusively on its Air Force to conduct long-range or otherwise high-risk unilateral strikes against its opponents. The increasing capabilities and proliferation of modern air defense systems have steadily increased the dangers to those operations. Even aging surface-to-air missiles can be threatening in quantity and in constrained environments, as Israel has seen in recent operations over Syria. In February 2018, Syrian air defenders managed to shoot down an Israeli F-16 with a Cold War-era SA-5 surface-to-air missile system . There are also unconfirmed reports that Iran deployed a Bavar 373 system to Syria earlier in 2018 in an attempt to shield its interests against Israeli aircraft. “The luxury of having an air force that operates freely and almost without being threatened is ending soon,” an unnamed Israeli military official admitted to Al-Monitor in August 2018. “They won’t be able to neutralize the air force but they can make it difficult for us, maybe circumscribe the air force’s circle of activities one way or another.” But Iran is well aware of this reality, too, and now it appears to be actively working to try to develop its own countermeasures to Israel’s new missile corps initiative.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Navy’s new MQ-4C Triton drones went sliding down the runway on its belly at Naval Base Ventura County in Point Mugu, California earlier today, causing significant damage. Unmanned Patrol Squadron One Nine, or VUP-19, has been flying the unmanned aircraft at the base since June 2018, ahead of an eventual move to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The mishap occurred at approximately 2:45 PST and an investigation into the cause is already ongoing. The MQ-4C had been conducting a test flight when it experienced a mechanical issue, according to the Navy . The controllers at Point Mugu aborted the mission and attempted to bring the drone back to base. “As a precautionary measure, the pilots shut down the engine and attempted to safely land the aircraft on the runway,” the release said.  “The aircraft’s landing gear did not deploy and the aircraft landed on the runway with its landing gear retracted.” It’s not clear who was in control of the aircraft when it hit the runway. During earlier test flights in July 2018, VUP-19’s pilots flew the drones from ground control stations at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in Florida, while crews at Point Mugu were responsible for takeoffs and landings, according to Navy Times . The Navy and other U.S. military services routinely use this method, known as remote-split operations , for unmanned aircraft missions. A US Navy MQ-4C lands at Naval Base Ventura County., USCG via KVTA Radio We also don’t know when whoever was at the controls decided to power down the MQ-4C’s single engine. If the drone was still in flight, this would have meant the pilots would have been forced to perform a dead-stick landing . The Navy has classified the mishap as a Class A incident, which references to accidents that cause more than $2 million in damage, result in a fatality, or both. The Triton carries a sensor turret in its nose and additional systems, including its advanced radar, in its belly. A wheels-up landing could easily have damaged one or more of these sensitive and expensive items as well as the airframe.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 8, 2018","Air Force Says It Knows Why T-6 Trainers Are Choking Pilots, But It’ll Take Years To Fix","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it has devised a set of fixes for its T-6 Texan II trainer that will hopefully reduce the number of aviators reporting potentially dangerous “hypoxia-like” symptoms during flights. Unfortunately, the process, which includes a total rework of the aircraft’s on-board oxygen generation system, or OBOGS, a revised software package, and changes in maintenance routines, could take up to four years to fully implement – and there still might be more work to do afterward. The Air Force’s Air Education and Training Command (AETC) announced plans to institute the “corrective measures,” which it had crafted together with Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and with input from the Navy and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), late on Sept. 13, 2018. U.S. Air Force General David Goldfein, the service’s Chief of Staff, in an interview with the San Antonio Express-News earlier in the month , had said the news was coming, but had declined to offer any specifics. “So far, technical efforts to date and analysis of data collected have determined that pilots have been exposed to significantly changing levels of oxygen concentration,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Steve Kwast, head of AETC, said in a statement on Sept. 13, 2018. “The varying levels of oxygen concentration, even though in excess of what the body typically needs, has caused physiological stress that most pilots on most days actually adapt to without noticing.” Kwast said that AETC and AFMC’s six-month review had determined that these fluctuations caused physiological stress in T-6 pilots whose bodies were not able to adapt quickly enough. This, in turn, produced symptoms akin to hypoxia , which is a lack of sufficient oxygen in the body, hypocapnea , or insufficient carbon dioxide, as well as other “related conditions.” Symptoms of these conditions can include headaches, disorientation, and even blacking out, all of which can be especially dangerous for a pilot in the air. A US Air Force T-6 Texan II., USAF To ensure consistency in oxygen supply in the future, the Air Force has begun a process to redesign the T-6’s OBOGS. The service has not said what this might entail, but it likely has to do, in part, with the system’s filters and drain valves. After the U.S. Air Force’s 19th Air Force, part of AETC, grounded all of its 444 T-6s in January 2018 over concerns about hypoxia, a subsequent inspection found that those parts of the OBOGS had been failing a higher than expected rate. At the time, one pilot, posting anonymously on the Flying Squadron Forums website, claimed that officials had found the systems to be in an “ absolutely horrendous ” state. The individual wrote that approximately four out of every five of oxygen generation systems failed in the inspection due to a build-up of dirt and other particulate matter in the filters, stuck valves, and kinks in various hoses, which led to water buildup in some cases. There is still no explanation for why this was the case and why it appears to have only become an issue in recent years, despite AETC having first started flying the T-6 in 2001. In addition, the Air Force is working with the T-6’s manufacturer, Beechcraft, which is now part of Textron, to revise the software that controls the OBOGS to help better regulate oxygen flow and reduce variations. The service says the entire process could take anywhere from two to four years to complete and that it plans to pursue a “broader redesign” of the Texan II’s oxygen system related components and systems to fully address the issue. There is no timeframe from when this second effort might finish up. An instructor pilot and their student get ready for a training flight in a T-6., USAF In the meantime, the Air Force will implement new maintenance and inspection procedures to make sure the T-6’s existing OBOGS is working as well as it can. The service said that its review uncovered evidence that having ground crews purge moisture from the system on a more regular basis improves its efficiency. We don’t know what that process entails, how often maintainers will now need to perform it, or how this particular issue managed to escape notice in the nearly two decades that AETC has already been flying the Texan II. It is definitely a good thing that the Air Force has identified likely issues with the OBOGS on the T-6. Beyond problems with the system simply being potentially life-threatening, groundings and flight restrictions have hampered the service’s ability to train new pilots it sorely needs . However, the announcement of these fixes might provide little immediate comfort to Air Force aviators in Texan IIs. The service’s senior leaders have now vindicated their complaints, acknowledged that there are issues with their aircraft, and will keep them flying for years before they can fully implement the fixes. In August 2018, Aviation Week reported that there had been an average of eight reports of hypoxia-like symptoms from T-6 pilots every month since February, when the 19th Air Force rescinded its grounding order from the month before and began flying the planes again. There is a hope that the issues the Air Force has uncovered with its T-6’s might help in resolving persistent reports of hypoxia-like symptoms among U.S. military aviators flying other aircraft, especially within the U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet and U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet communities. There have also been reports of problems with some of the Air Force’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft. The Air Force was able to quickly link problems with older A-10s that use a liquid oxygen-based oxygen system to poor maintenance rather than a design flaw and fixed those issues. What caused the hypoxia-link symptoms among pilots in newer Warthogs, which have a modern OBOGS that generates its own oxygen continuously, remain unanswered. Pilots flying the US Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, like the one seen here, have persistently reported hypoxia-like symptoms for years. Just in May 2018, one of the jets had to divert to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey while on a combat mission after the pilot experienced a worrying physiological episode., USN On Sept. 11, 2108, the Air Force and the Navy also announced they were pooling their resources to form a Joint Physiological Episodes Action Team, or J-PEAT. “Physiological episode,” or P.E., is the official U.S. military term for unexplained reports of hypoxia-like symptoms. In August 2018, NASA began conducting research flights to have collect baseline data on how pilots’ bodies respond to various stresses of flying to support the U.S. military’s efforts to determine the cause or causes of why aviators do not appear to be getting enough oxygen in various aircraft. The baseline data will help organizations such as J-PEAT understand what they should be seeing compared to the information they are getting from pilots. “Since our T-6 operational pause [the January 2018 grounding], we have made every effort to communicate with every instructor and every student exactly what we’ve found,” U.S. Air Force Major General Patrick Doherty, commander of the 19th Air Force, said in a statement on Sept. 13, 2018. “Transparency remains of utmost importance to use as we all work together to ensure that our pilots are safe and know the way ahead.” For now, T-6 pilots do now know the way ahead, but they also know that it is still years away from becoming a reality.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 16, 2018",Mysterious Evacuation Of Solar Observatory Overlooking White Sands Smells Like Espionage,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A bizarre, unexplained situation has unfolded in and around the tiny enclave of Sunspot, New Mexico. A week after U.S. federal government officials ordered the evacuation of the National Solar Observatory facility there, as well as a nearby post office, the first site remains closed due to a “security issue” and no one can or will say what it is. Members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and potentially other federal government agencies, arrived in Sunspot on or about Sept. 7, 2018, at which point they ordered everyone out of the National Solar Observatory site, which is technically at Sacramento Peak, situated above the tiny town. They also told the clerk in the Sunsport Post Office to evacuate. “The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy [ AURA ] who manages the facility is addressing a security issue at this time,” AURA spokesperson Shari Lifson, told the Alamogordo Daily News on Sept. 7, 2018. “We don’t know [when the facility will open again].” “We are working with the proper authorities on this issue,” she continued. “The local authorities do know and are aware of the situation. I don’t know when the facility was vacated but it was within the last day. It’s a temporary evacuation of the facility. We [will] open it up as soon as possible.” The National Observatory Facility at Sacramento Peak above Sunspot, New Mexico., National Science Foundation This “temporary” evacuation has now lasted seven days and it’s not entirely clear how much of Sunspot is still off limits , with some residents complaining about not being able to get to their homes. Lifson had no additional information when the Albuquerque Journal asked for an update on the situation on Sept. 12, 2018. The Apache Point Observatory, about half a mile away from the Sacramento Peak site, never closed and remains in operation. Lifson might be right that local authorities know that there is a situation , but there is no indication that they know what it is specifically. No one, including AURA’s spokesperson, seems to know knows for sure what law enforcement entity told people to leave the post office. Otero County Sheriff Benny House said the FBI asked him to support the initial evacuations at the observatory itself, but gave him no other information and that he and his deputies left after there was no evidence of an ongoing or imminent threat. A map showing all of Sunspot, New Mexico, with the town’s post office marked to the right and the Sacramento Peak observatory facility at the lower left., Google Earth “There was a Black Hawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers but nobody would tell us anything,” Sheriff House explained to the Alamogordo Daily News on Sept. 7, 2018. “We went up there and everything was good. There was no threat. Nobody would identify any specific threat. We hung out for a little while then we left. No reason for us to be there. Nobody would tell us what we’re supposed to be watching out for.” It’s important to note that AURA has consistently described the situation was a “security issue” rather than a “risk” or a “threat,” which strongly suggests the reason for the evacuations was not tied to something such as a bomb threat. Had there been a danger of some sort chemical or biological hazard, the responding officials would have been wearing suitable protective gear . There are unconfirmed reports that some individuals were dressed as if they were responding to some sort of hazardous material spill, but it seems curious that Sherrif House would have left this detail out of his comments. That sort of incident, or even a crime such as murder, also wouldn’t explain why the FBI and other federal officials would have had to descend on Sunspot, do so without apparently alerting local law enforcement or U.S. Postal Service officials in advance, and then refuse to explain the situation in any way to them. The FBI declined to even confirm or deny that it had been or was still in Sunspot to the Albuquerque Journal . But given AURA’s statements and what else we know about the situation, there is a distinct possibility that “security issue” is actually related to espionage or a similar operational security concern. The National Solar Observatory’s site enjoys a wide and largely unobstructed view of both the U.S. Air Force’s Holloman Air Force Base and the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range , both of which regularly host a very wide array of U.S. military research and development programs . A map showing the general area around the National Solar Observatory facility at Sacramento Peak near Sunspot, New Mexico. Hollman Air Force Base is marked to the left. White Sands Missile Range is off the map, due north of Holloman., Google Earth “The Sacramento Peak Observatory serves the solar physics community as the only high-resolution solar facility with extensive spectroscopic capabilities open for community access in the United States and as a development testbed for the high-order AO [Adaptive Optics] capability needed for DKIST [Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope ],” the National Science Foundation, which technically owns the site, said in a draft environmental impact statement that it published in February 2018. “The 4-meter Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is currently under construction on Haleakalá in Maui, Hawai’i, and is planned to replace the function of DST [Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope ] for NSO [National Solar Observatory].” The National Science Foundation commissioned the environmental impact survey as part of deliberations about whether to curtail operations at the site, transfer greater responsibility for the facilities to another entity, or shutter it all together, due to funding constraints. Before the U.S. government closed the National Solar Observatory at Sacramento Peak completely due to the ongoing “security issue,” there were reportedly only a limited number of researchers and other personnel there anyway, as the Dunn Solar Telescope is the only remaining part of the facility that is still in operation . The Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope inside the observatory is a vacuum telescope designed to track the Sun and its movements while gathering imagery and spectroscopy data about the rays it emits and its sunspots. It is possible that the telescope could point low enough to gather useful information about objects at Holloman or White Sands in the valley below. It is also possible that the U.S. government could have had concerns about what it might be able to see in outer space , or at least who saw what and what they did with that information, but this seems quite unlikely. Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope is a massive installation. It doesn’t just resemble an iceberg, it’s similar to one in that the majority of it is hidden from view below the surface. The facility looks right out of a science fiction movie and penetrates hundreds of feet below the ground. , NOAO/AURA/NSF It seems more plausible that a foreign operative or an operative working on a foreign government’s behalf might have been able to install an antenna/sensor apparatus onto the top of a structure that is part of the facility and within line-of-sight of the valley below without anyone noticing. This could allow them to persistently gather electronic intelligence on whatever might be happening on, around, and over White Sands and at Holloman. With the capabilities of modern electronics and batteries, it’s possible that such a system wouldn’t even need to be hard wired. For instance, check out this 360 photo of a publically accessible viewpoint and weather station adjacent to the main solar telescope tower up at Sacremento Peak. The small building is covered with antennas and electronics which have a perfectly clear line of sight to the valley below. Clandestinely placing a sensor package here that is able to collect certain emissions while blending in with the clutter seems like a relatively rudimentary task—hiding in plain sight if you will. This is just one area of a fairly large complex of observatories and other buildings, many of which are in disuse, but which may already be adorned with antennas and other electronics and have an unobstructed line-of-sight towards White Sands. Otero County Sheriff House’s comment in which he states there were officials and workmen inspecting towers and antennas could indicate that there were looking for just such a device. An annotated satellite image of the National Solar Observatory complex at Sacramento Peak, at the low left, and the associated enclave of Sunspot, New Mexico., National Science Foundation Individuals looking to spy on Holloman or White Sands could have been using the local post office to send copies of that information to their handlers or to an intermediate location, as well. A suspect could even work or live up there. As such, the FBI or other agencies could have decided to temporarily shut down its operations in order to comb it for evidence, even just as a basic precaution. “We don’t know what they [the FBI] took, what their reason for being there was,” Sergeant Jon Emery of the Otero County Sheriff’s Office told KOB 4 , a local NBC affiliate television station in Albuquerque, on Sept. 13, 2018. “We have no information on it.” It is not clear if federal authorities have removed anything from the site, or, if they did, what it might have been. Using the site as a possible testing location for some sort of sensor or directed energy weapon, or even commandeering the high-powered telescope for a national security use, such as spying on or blinding enemy satellites, also comes to mind. The telescope has been used for laser experiments in decades, but there isn’t even circumstantial evidence that points to the U.S. government using it for a similar purpose today. Nor would evacuating a town to do so make much sense. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sunspot Solar Observatory (@sunspotsolarobservatory) The nearby Apache Point Observatory, which is more active than its northerly neighbor, does have a high-power laser system that is used for taking lunar measurements. A Notice To Airman (NOTAM) is currently posted warning aviators to stay away from the site, but that isn’t too odd considering the facility openly uses a device that can harm pilots’ and passengers’ eyes. The NOTAM reads: !FDC 8/9292 ZAB NM..AIRSPACE SUNSPOT, NM..LASER RESEARCH WI AN AREA DEFINED AS APACHE POINT OBSERVATORY, 324649N1054913W OR THE BOLES /BWS/ VOR 098 DEGREE RADIAL AT 10NM, SFC-FL600.

It sounds more like the opening of an ’80s science fiction adventure film than something that is actually happening and it has begun to trigger all types of outlandish theories. These include that the telescope identifying a world-changing solar flare or spotted proof of alien life in our solar system. Both of these suppositions seem to have been shot down by the director of the telescope facility, who said his team would gladly release the data the telescope was collecting before feds arrived. But something is going on out of the ordinary up there, and based on what we do know, it seems like espionage is a real possibility.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 15, 2018",Mysteriously Evacuated Sunspot Observatory Set To Reopen According To Official Statement,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The mystery as to what exactly is going on at Sunspot Solar Observatory that sits high above White Sands Missile Range has resulted in a media frenzy and a maelstrom of theories, some of which are beyond bizarre. The facility and the small town that supports it were completely evacuated as the FBI descended onto the complex without explanation ten days ago. Not even the local sheriff was informed on what was going on and the place was still officially declared off-limits long after investigators had left. You can read our completely in-depth coverage and analysis on the very peculiar series of events here and here . Now the organization that runs the observatory has put out a statement declaring that it would reopen this week and offering a few new but vague details about the circumstances surrounding the evacuation. The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy ( AURA ) released the following statement on their website: “Sunspot Solar Observatory is transitioning back to regular operations as of September 17th On September 6th, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) made the decision to temporarily vacate the Sunspot Solar Observatory at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico as a precautionary measure while addressing a security issue. The facility closed down in an orderly fashion and is now re-opening. The residents that vacated their homes will be returning to the site, and all employees will return to work this week. AURA has been cooperating with an on-going law enforcement investigation of criminal activity that occurred at Sacramento Peak. During this time, we became concerned that a suspect in the investigation potentially posed a threat to the safety of local staff and residents. For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location. The decision to vacate was based on the logistical challenges associated with protecting personnel at such a remote location, and the need for expeditious response to the potential threat. AURA determined that moving the small number of on-site staff and residents off the mountain was the most prudent and effective action to ensure their safety. In light of recent developments in the investigation, we have determined there is no risk to staff, and Sunspot Solar Observatory is transitioning back to regular operations as of September 17th. Given the significant amount of publicity the temporary closure has generated, and the consequent expectation of an unusual number of visitors to the site, we are temporarily engaging a security service while the facility returns to a normal working environment. We recognize that the lack of communications while the facility was vacated was concerning and frustrating for some. However, our desire to provide additional information had to be balanced against the risk that, if spread at the time, the news would alert the suspect and impede the law enforcement investigation. That was a risk we could not take.” The nature of how this was done and how the residents were removed from the site without any warning and without any explanation could potentially mean a multitude of things, but it still seems like suspicion of espionage is the likely reason. Also, the most detailed statement we have on what actually went on up there during the investigation is from a highly credible source—the sheriff—and points to this possibility more so than a workplace dispute or something of that nature. Otero County Sheriff Benny House stated to local media : “The FBI is refusing to tell us what’s going on,” House said. “We’ve got people up there (at Sunspot) that requested us to standby while they evacuate it. Nobody would really elaborate on any of the circumstances as to why. The FBI were up there. What their purpose was nobody will say…. But for the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there… There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers but nobody would tell us anything.” As we discussed in our large analysis piece on the event, the facility is very low security—as in not really any at all—yet sits in a highly strategic location overlooking one of America’s preeminent weapons test complexes, White Sands Missile Range, and Holloman AFB. Sunspot Solar Observatory has multiple places where sensors, such as antenna aerials, could potentially be planted without drawing outright attention. These could be used to record and intercept electronic emissions related to military activities in, above, and around the valley below. The network the telescope works on could have also been compromised. We were told it was upgraded some time ago for remote operations, but we are still trying to confirm this fact and get an understanding of just the system works. We also don’t know if foreign nationals were working at the site at the time of the incident. We have reached out to the observatory’s director in an attempt to get some basic answers to questions about the site itself, but we have yet to get a response. Rest assured we will keep updating you as to how this strange story unfolds and with any interesting information we find about the site and its surroundings.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As a followup to our widely circulated analysis on the mysterious evacuation of the Sunspot Solar Observatory complex that looks over White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, I wanted to post this video of a Youtuber driving up to the taped off entry and proceeding to walk all around the totally deserted compound. The video is outright eerie. Nobody was there, not even a security guard. The only thing moving was a small drone he spotted overhead. Who was controlling that drone is unknown. Maybe the most bizarre moment, albeit in a coincidental way, is when he spots an X-files: Unrestricted Acces s DVD laying out prominently in one of the buildings. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_AVdVBvSjcU It’s also worth noting that the video reminds us that there is a large water tower at the site (see 11:17) that could offer an ideal and unassuming location for placing sensors to monitor the activities that go on in, above, and around the valley below—many of which are classified. One area that is not seen in the video is the small rough-field landing strip that is nestled below the summit but is also a part of the facility. It’s unclear when the airfield was last used, but judging by its size, it could only accommodate bush planes and helicopters. The landing strip is on the western edge of the property, below the summit. An access road leads there from the north part of the complex. Sunspot was originally a USAF installation., Google Earth The video was shot on September 13th, 2018, but on Sept. 14 The Washington Post reported that a pair of guards, from Red Rock Security & Patrol, based in Las Cruces, New Mexico, more than 60 miles to the southwest, were stationed at the entrance to the enclave. They said that had no information on what was going on and were on orders to only allow the observatory’s “director and an assistant” past. It is not clear who hired them, but the nature of their instructions would imply that AURA had arranged from the security detail. The Post said that there had been no other signs of law enforcement in the area, which reinforces the general state of affairs we can see in the video above, taken on the day before. The Washington Post , talking to James McAteer, a professor at New Mexico State University and director of the Sunspot Solar Observatory consortium writes: McAteer said his consortium assigns four researchers to the facility, although the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), another consortium, manages the buildings and other infrastructure with another four or five people. That consortium, McAteer said, had ordered the site vacated, providing no other reason than a “security” issue. He said the researchers did not spot anything in the sun to necessitate them leaving, nor were they aware of any scientific reason — such as an anomaly in the data they were collecting — for doing so. The property manager also came in to the post office on the facility and asked the woman working there to leave, but gave no indication why that was necessary, said Rod Spurgeon, a Postal Service spokesman. Spurgeon said post office operations have continued at the nearby Cloudcroft facility. Kinsey Featherston, a spokeswoman for Rep. Stevan Pearce (R-N.M.), said the congressman’s office had reached out to the FBI and were told “it is an ongoing investigation.” “We will continue monitoring the situation, but at this time, we have no information,” she said. Even with these new tidbits of information, it seems we are still left with more questions than answers, but a counter-intelligence operation focused on some form of espionage still seems like a likely explanation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2018",The Striking And Fast Superyacht ‘Yaz’ Was Born From A 40 Year Old Dutch Frigate’s Hull,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of all the world’s superyachts, Yaz stands out as one of the most exotic. The 463 foot long gleaming white and turquoise vessel is intended to resemble a dolphin. It’s hard to argue that its designers didn’t achieve that goal. But Yaz’s slender, sculpted hull didn’t emerge from the CAD software at a top naval architect’s office, it came from the past—literally. Yaz is built on the hull of the Kortenaer class frigate HNLMS Piet Hein. HNLMS Piet Hein was the fifth ship in her class and was launched in 1978. The ship displaced 3,900 tons and was equipped with a ‘ combined gas or gas propulsion ‘ system that allowed for highly efficient loitering and cruise operations by using small, lower powered turbines, while also having the ability to run at high speed with the help of larger gas turbines. This was a particularly relevant setup for submarine hunting operations, which was the Kortenaer class’s primary role. HNLMS Piet Hein , Royal Netherlands Navy/Wikocommons The Netherlands also built two Jacob van Heemskerck class ships which were basically air defense versions of the Kortenaer class and Germany’s Bremen class was based on the Kortenaer class design as well. The Cold War era Dutch frigates were built tough as it would spend much of its life operating in the rough and unforgiving waters of the North Sea. The class was somewhat of an export success as well with Greece receiving two Kortenaer class ships right off the line. Once the Royal Netherlands Navy moved to retire the type in the late 1990s, they were snapped up by foreign Navies, namely Greece, which bought all but two of them, with the outstanding pair going to the United Arab Emirates. Piet Hein during the height of her Navy career with the Royal Netherlands Navy., Hr. Ms. Piet Heyn Facebook Page The second-hand frigates served with the UAE Navy as Al Emirat and Abu Dhabi for a decade, finally being decommissioned in 2008. But that was not the end of their story. The hulls were in good shape and their hardy qualities and efficient hull-forms made them attractive for repurposing. The fact that prominent UAE royal and politician Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was looking for a new pleasure boat and a project to help jumpstart a new shipyard group in Abu Dhabi also helped the prospects for such a project. Al Emirat while during her decade of service with the UAE Navy., Hr. Ms. Piet Heyn Facebook Page Al Emirat was the first to begin what would be an incredibly dramatic conversion (look at this crazy pic of her in a half-built state here ). Designed by vaunted Pierrejean Design Studio, the project was dubbed Swift141— a name indicating she was to be fast and 141 meters long — during its development and reconstruction. The vessel that had worn two other names in its past would reemerge from Abu Dhabi’s ADMShipyards after three years of work as Yaz— one of the world’s largest, fastest, and certainly most unique superyachts. But it wouldn’t be until 2015 that she would be fully outfitted and delivered in a fully operational state. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hMl9vvxpi1g I wish I could post a large series of pictures or videos showing what is surely the incredible interior of this frigate turned superyacht, but there aren’t any images available. This isn’t really surprising when you consider who owns the vessel and that it is not available for charter. But we do have a couple renderings from Pierrejean Design Studio of what it is supposed to look like. Most notable is the master suite, which, judging by the rendering, sits just below the bridge as part of the glazed superstructure. One can only imagine what the view from the stars to the horizon would be like at night as you drift off to sleep in your futuristic floating palace. 500 individual pieces of specially formed reinforced glass were required to complete the ship’s superstructure. It was one of the program’s most challenging aspects. pierrejean-design.com The owner’s suite looks like it belongs on a starship instead of a yacht. It is totally self-contained and private. A Forward door opens up to private deck overlooking the bow., pierrejean-design.com We also don’t know exactly what the ship is capable of performance wise. The Kortenaer class were fast ships, able to hit speeds in excess of 30 knots. But even though her powerplant was swapped for a far less powerful, but more conventional system, the ship’s slender hull should provide high efficiency and good stability. Many state that the vessel can do 26 knots and cruise efficiently just a few knots slower on a pair of MTU 10,500hp diesel engines. Her original powerplant configuration was way more powerful, but she would have had a much larger displacement while serving as a surface combatant. In fact, Yaz’s superstructure is made almost entirely out of lightweight composite materials which helps dramatically in keeping weight down to improve performance. You can read all about this huge and unprecedented undertaking here and in this downloadable powerpoint . It’s even claimed that the ship, in its new configuration, can be considered ‘green’—everything is relative in the superyacht world. If she really can hit nearly her original design speed on a fraction of the horsepower, this claim is true. The ship’s steel hull is mated to an all-composite superstructure. , JFCI Composites The frigate’s hull was upgraded with bow thrusters and stabilizers during her transformation from Al Emirat to Yaz . The photo below shows these features and it also gives us a better idea of just how gorgeous the hull on this ship really is. No wonder they used it as the foundation for an exotic and highly expensive superyacht. pierrejean-design.com Here’s another really nice view of the vessel’s remodeled hull-form. Yaz , which one would assume is named after its owner’s son who has the same name, may not appeal to everyone aesthetically speaking, but I think it is absolutely gorgeous. Just doing something creative and different while still delivering a strong set of features and an overall logical design is no easy task. Combine that with recycling an old frigate’s hull with the goal of achieving extreme performance, not to mention pulling off something that works both visually and operationally, and you have one amazing accomplishment that differentiates itself from pretty much everything else in the superyacht world. And what’s so cool about Yaz’s design is that the hull-form really does pull the entire concept together and doesn’t conflict with the ship’s ultra-modern superstructure. For how bulbous it is in some places it still looks like it was born to slice through the seas. With what was likely a very steep learning curve building Yaz now under ADMShipyards’ belt, one would think her sister hull, the ex- Abu Dhabi, would be under construction. Somewhat different in design, this project is named Swift135. Here are the renderings of it: pierrejean-design.com pierrejean-design.com pierrejean-design.com The design represents a more of a conventional affair than its dolphin-like sister ship. Overall it appears less sleek and is more of a modern take on classical yacht designs. It also doesn’t feature the added streamlined stern extension found on Yaz . But at this time it isn’t clear if the project is underway or if it is still even a possibility. In satellite imagery, the last date we see the stripped hull of the proposed Swift131 outside ADMShipyards is in late October 2013. Since then it is nowhere in the vicinity. It could have been towed somewhere for prep work, but it has been half a decade and still no sign of it at the shipyards. The last satellite image we see the second frigate hull in at ADMShipyards in Abu Dhabi., Google Earth We don’t know how much Yaz actually cost. A royal customer supporting the country’s own shipbuilding enterprise is one thing, but finding an external customer for a follow-on project may have proven to be a challenge. And a buyer spending hundreds of millions of dollars may just want something totally new regardless of the advantages of converting an existing hull. It’s also possible that the second hull could be under construction elsewhere too. We just don’t know at this time. Currently, Yaz is the world’s 11th largest yacht and when it comes to luxury and amenities, it delivers. It features a pool, spa, multiple saloons and entertainment areas, as well as all the other toys you would find on a top superyacht. Yaz also has an oversized helipad that is usually occupied by a white AW139 and its entertainment system is supposedly the most advanced in the world. pierrejean-design.com She sails with a complement of about 60 and can accommodate as many guests. Due to her frigate hull, she is adept at quickly crossing oceans but seems to usually spend her time in the Mediterranean with visits to the Persian Gulf. So there you have it, the truly one of kind Yaz— a highly innovative design that blends the old with the new and the tactical with the incredibly impractical, all in a beautifully seamless and effective manner.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 16, 2018",Let’s Talk About The Air Force’s Plan To Increase Squadrons From 312 To A Whopping 386,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You know you are truly living in a flush defense budget era when the Secretary of Air Force can present an initiative to massively expand service’s force structure, going from 312 squadrons today to 386 by 2030, with a straight face. This is an increase in overall size of nearly 25 percent. Just a couple years ago the USAF couldn’t even afford the fleet it already had yet alone the one it planned to procure. Now it wants to execute the biggest end-strength expansion since the Cold War. The proposal, which was introduced today by Secretary Heather Wilson at this year’s Air Force Association symposium, is very similar to the Navy’s 355 ship fleet initiative . In all reality, it was very likely developed at least partially as a response to the seagoing service’s plan that has proven to be quite marketable on Capitol Hill. Wilson said that the increase in combat capacity is needed to confront potential threats posed by Russian and China in an age of “great power competition” . That justification is up for debate, but Secretary Wilson is right, the USAF needs more capacity, at least in certain areas, to meet even current demands. Over the last decade and a half, the force as a whole has shrunk continuously to become just a shadow of what it was during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, let alone what it was during Desert Storm over a decade earlier. In 30 years, the number of fighter squadrons the service has on hand alone has dropped by 59% , from 134 to just 55. The last major round of cuts, which occurred around 2013-2014 , left many highly concerned that the USAF was being cut to the point that there was be little left in the tank, a move that could be paid for with blood should a major conflict arise. The fact that the USAF leadership seemed dangerously obsessed with prioritizing procurement over readiness and combat capacity didn’t help the matter either. Secretary Heather Wilson, USAF The cold hard truth is that you can have the best aircraft in the world, but they can only be in one place at one time, and that place is as often as not sitting broken on the ground. Additionally, the Air National Guard has morphed into something far more akin to a frontline force due to the proportion of the total force’s combat power they provide. Its air defense tasked fighter units would struggle greatly to maintain their air sovereignty mission over the United States should a major conflict erupt overseas. This is not just about fighters, quite the contrary. The USAF’s notional plan is to expand in most capability sets. Here is the USAF’s official breakdown of where the extra squadrons would be added: USAF There is a lot going on here and I am going to save our in-depth analysis for a larger article on an ideal force structure for the USAF that has been in the works for some time. But there are a few big questions worth highlighting. First off is the obvious one, where will the money come from? We are talking major procurement increases, infrastructure investments, and expansion in personnel under this plan. It is unlikely future defense budgets will continue to grow or even be maintained at their current size. I predict a significant retraction in defense spending in the coming decade regardless of the threat situation short of an impending war. Rapidly ballooning end strength like this could prove to be incredibly wasteful if much of it has to be rolled back in a number of years. America’s new ‘and the kitchen sink’ nuclear strategy is similarly an issue. But even if current budget levels are maintained, these funds have to come from somewhere even if that somewhere is Congress’s willingness to blow an even larger hole in the national deficit in the years and decade to come. But one issue unique to the USAF’s flying squadrons when it comes to the feasibly of realizing an ambitious goal like this surrounds pilots, or the lack thereof I should say. The USAF is experiencing a major pilot shortfall and is scrambling to recruit new candidates and retain the pilots they already have. This initiative includes large incentive bonuses aimed at retaining pilots, as well as making significant changes to how squadrons function . The increasingly corporate culture of the USAF and the heavy administrative burdens placed on pilots, combined with a shrinking number of annual flying hours, has negatively impacted the USAF’s ability to do its mission. Constant deployments overseas by an overtaxed force that is too small to meet demands hasn’t helped keep pilots interested either. USAF The pilot shortage issue alone can really be a deal breaker for this plan. I have some ideas on how to solve this issue and achieve more end strength in the most economical and effective way possible that I will present in my upcoming piece, but under the current circumstances, even if the money was there, you need highly trained individuals to operate the aircraft and the USAF doesn’t have them now and may struggle to obtain them in the future. In the end, yes the USAF needs to increase its capacity in certain areas, but the devil is truly in the details. What’s missing here is any sort of an estimate on what this would cost, both in terms of initial startup and sustainment over time. Exactly what planes it plans on filling these billets with and where they would be located will be a major factor in those figures as well, one that will also have huge industrial repercussions. Considering the branch was doing anything it possibly could to retire roughly 300 tactical jets — A-10 Warthogs of course —that it already owned and operated just months ago, it’s a bit nauseating to think that a relatively short time later the same service is saying it needs to expand its tactical jet squadron count significantly. It reminds us of just how poor the flying service’s track record is when it comes to these kinds of critical force structure decisions. The USAF is already facing a pilot shortage of around 25% yet it wants to grow its squadron number by more than 25% in the coming decade. , USAF With so many hands trying to force their way into the Trump era defense budget honey jar, the USAF is going to have to fight hard to make any of this a reality. Finding many billions of dollars to procure and sustain a much larger Air Force, especially over multiple administrations, in order to reach its 386 squadrons goal will be a challenge, to say the least. There are so many competing priorities, from nuclear arsenal recapitalization and enhancement , to the looming hypersonic arms race , to missile defense , to a 355 ship Navy , and so much more, that the dollars may be in greater supply than they were under the Obama administration, but that doesn’t mean they are easily spoken for. Even the Space Force initiative, which comes directly from the President himself, is slated to cost $13B just to get up and running. The upside here is that Wilson’s plan still seems to be very much a work in progress and will probably change a bit in the future. There are five separate studies that are looking into the USAF’s force structure as well that will impact the case for this plan and potentially the plan itself. But don’t expect the USAF to back off that number once they brand it. And brand it they will! The goal here is to make it a catchphrase just like the Navy did with its 355 ship fleet concept. A big round accessible number like that is easy to reference and for Congress to toss around during hearings. It sets the marker high and comes with a disclaimer stating anything less will incur too much risk. So don’t be surprised if you start getting bombarded by the number 386 when it comes to USAF talking points that are often forced into press releases and official speeches. Because if you say it enough it has to come true…. Right?

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 18, 2018",Russian IL-20 Surveillance Plane Went Down Off Syrian Coast During Israeli Missile Barrage (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Syrian air defense forces may have accidentally shot down a Russian Il-20 Coot electronic intelligence aircraft during an attempt to respond to apparent Israeli air strikes against targets in Syria’s coastal Latakia governorate. Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claims that a French frigate may have been responsible and the French have yet to confirm or deny that they had anything to do with the loss of the aircraft. On Sept. 17, 2018, CNN , citing an unnamed U.S. government official, reported that the U.S. military believed Syrian surface-to-air missiles had brought down the Il-20. The Russian Defense Ministry did confirm the aircraft had gone missing in the early hours of Sept. 18, 2018, local time in Syria, but did not say who or what might have been responsible for the crash. “The connection with the crew of the Russian Il-20 aircraft was lost over the Mediterranean Sea when the plane was returning to the airbase of Khmeimim, 35 kilometers from the coast of Syria,” a Russian Ministry of Defense official said, according to state-run media outlet TASS . The “Il-20 … disappeared during the attack of four Israeli F-16 aircraft on Syrian targets in the province of Latakia.” Il-20 Coot, Royal Navy The Israel Defense Forces have not commented on the strikes, which appeared to involve F-16 fighters firing stand-off weapons , possibly from Lebanese airspace, into Latakia at a Syrian Organization for Technological Industries facility. This organization is linked to Syria’s chemical weapons and advanced missile programs. Syrian state media claimed the country’s military had shot down a number of incoming missiles. This the third reported Israeli strike in Syria since the beginning of September 2018. Israel reportedly conducted another raid on targets at Damascus International Airport on Sept. 15, 2018, and had hit targets near the port city of Tartus, where Russia has its only naval port on the Mediterranean, on Sept. 4, 2018. The United States reportedly learned that the Il-20 had crashed when Syrian forces broadcast an emergency message on an international frequency, according to CNN . American officials then got confirmation of the incident and additional details from a third country, which the source declined to identify. The U.S. military has denied any involvement in the strikes in Latakia. However, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that “Russian radars fixed missile launches from the French frigate Auvergne , which was in that area,” according to TASS . Auvergne is an Aquitaine -class, or FREMM multipurpose frigate , that carries both Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN) land-attack cruise missiles and Aster 15 surface-to-air missiles. In April 2018 , her sister ship Languedoc took part in a massive U.S.-led missile barrage against Syrian chemical weapons-related sites. In August 2018, The United States, the United Kingdom, and France reiterated their willingness to take action again in response to another one of Syria’s chemical weapon attacks. The French frigate Auvergne. , USN The increasingly convoluted war in Syria is highly susceptible to a major miscalculation that could spark an international crisis. The shooting down of a large surveillance aircraft with over a dozen lives onboard could be that spark. Hopefully, that’s not the case, but there is always the risk that the event could be used as an information warfare fulcrum even if it was a simple case of friendly fire. Alternatively, Moscow could downplay the incident out of embarrassment if it becomes clear to external parties that Syrian air defenses did indeed down the aircraft by accident. We are monitoring for any major movements of air traffic in the Mediterranean and will update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 12:20pm PDT— The French government finally commented on Russia’s insinuations. Multiple outlets report that officials categorically denied any involvement in the incident. It will be interesting to see if we get additional denials as the day goes on. Meanwhile, activity in the area has been sparse, at least as far as plane a ship trackers are concerned. A Russia tug departed Tartus toward the waters off Latakia but that makes sense as there is some sort of search and rescue operation underway. Air traffic has been very light in the area after the incident as well. Even the usual snoopers haven’t shown up. A RAF Tornado did pop up flying a fairly normal route into Eastern Syria, but they held up for a while over the Eastern Mediterranean, directly off Latakia. It isn’t clear what this was all about, but it could be something unrelated to the incident. After last evening’s tragic event, squawking while transiting the area is probably a smart move on the Tornado crew’s part. Update: 2:25am PDT— Russia now says that a Syrian SA-5 (S-200) surface-to-air missile did indeed accidentally take down its Il-20 Coot electronic intelligence gathering plane, but that the Israeli Air Force is also to blame for the friendly fire incident that claimed 14 lives. According to Russian officials, only a one minute warning was given by Israel of the impending attack, leaving Russian forces nowhere near enough time to make sure their personnel and materiel would be safe from the onslaught. According to Moscow, four F-16s approached Latakia at low altitude from the Mediterranean. A statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense obtained by RT.com reads : “The Israeli pilots used the Russian plane as cover and set it up to be targeted by the Syrian air defense forces. As a consequence, the Il-20, which has radar cross-section much larger than the F-16, was shot down by an S-200 system missile.” The wreckage of the aircraft has been found by Russian search parties roughly 17 miles west of Latakia. Here is a diagram of the incident, at least according to the Russian government, that has been provided to the press: Russain Government The idea that Israel used the Il-20 for cover is questionable at best. Just look at the chart above, the timing of such an operation without coordination with the Il-20’s crew would have to of been uncanny. What likely happened is that Israel executed its standoff strike from a launch position over the Mediterranean and the Il-20 happened to stumble into the area. If the IAF used man-in-the-loop air-to-ground missiles, as it often does, those F-16s would have had to loiter for a period of time to maintain data-link connectivity with the missiles as they careened towards their targets. Also, it’s important to note that strike missions into Syria are usually seen as critical operations by Israel and risk is accepted in exchange for destroying often high value and time-sensitive targets. In addition, the F-16s didn’t infiltrate deep into enemy territory in any way before sending their missiles toward their final destinations and the Il-20 wasn’t even over the water for long. It had been flying a route primarily over land. The surveillance aircraft probably ended up being a decoy by happenstance and that’s if the F-16s were even in the vicinity by the time Syrian missile batteries responded to the strikes. We’ll have to wait and see how all this unfolds, but just like how it was possibly the French frigate’s fault before this information was released, Russia seems to be willing to do whatever it can to redirect blame. In this case, Israel struck right at Russia’s doorstep in Syria, which is a highly peculiar escalation that is sure to enrage Russian commanders and the powers that be in the Kremlin. Update: 7:25am PDT— Israel has now responded, expressing “ sorrow ” for the loss of the Russian service members, but place the blame for shooting the plane down on the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad. In addition, the Israelis blamed Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, ostensibly for provoking the incident in the first place by being in Syria at all. “Overnight, IAF [Israeli Air Force] fighter jets targeted a facility of the Syrian Armed Forces from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon,” the Israeli Air Force Tweeted out on Sept. 18, 2018. “These weapons were meant to attack Israel, and posed an intolerable threat against it.” Israel also confirmed that it does have a deconfliction mechanism in place with Russia and that it employed it before the strikes, though they did not release any other details to support or contradict the Russian assertion that they had only gotten one minute in which to react. They did, however, release four important pieces of information about the incident in a series of Tweets, which we have reproduced below: 1. Extensive and inaccurate Syrian anti-aircraft (Surface to Air missile) fire caused the Russian plane to be hit and downed. 2. When the Syrian Army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, IAF jets were already within Israeli airspace 3. During the strike against the target in Latakia, the Russian plane that was then hit was not within the area of the operation 4. The Syrian anti-air batteries fired indiscriminately and from what we understand, did not bother to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air The Israeli Air Force says it is willing to share any other relevant details with the Russians to support their own inquiry into what exactly occurred. Update: 9:25am PDT— U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has released a statement that also “expresses sorrow” over the incident, but makes no mention of Israeli involvement at all. He also warned about the “danger of tragic miscalculation in Syria’s crowded theater of operations” and called for both a peaceful resolution to Syria’s civil war and an end to Iran’s “provocative” activities in the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 16, 2018",Here’s Why The USAF’s Top Civilian Says It Will Take Nearly $13B To Do Space Force Right,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s top civilian has laid out a proposal for creating a new, independent Space Force that offers the clearest picture yet of how such a plan might work. However, the service’s concept, which would cost the U.S. military an estimated nearly $13 billion over five years to implement, diverges in important ways from the Pentagon’s own ideas about its possible sixth branch. Various outlets obtained the 16-page memo that Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, which is dated Sept. 14, 2018. Wilson also alluded to the fact that she had been working on the proposal in her keynote speech at the first day of the annual Air Force Association’s Air, Space, and Cyberspace conference on Sept. 17, 2018. “As airmen, we have a responsibility to develop a proposal for the president that is bold and that carries out his vision,” Wilson declared in her public remarks. “That proposal must contain all of the elements needed for space to be fully successful as a department.” On Sept. 10, 2018, Deputy Defense Secretary Shanahan had asked both Wilson and Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin, a major advocate for expanding the size and scope of the U.S. military’s role in space, to come up with possible plans for Space Force. We do not yet have any information on Griffin’s proposal. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson speaks at the Air Force Association’s 2018 Air, Space, and Cyber conference on Sept. 17, 2018., USAF “This proposal establishes a clear mission, directly related to the strategic problem we are trying to solve,” Wilson wrote in her memo, according to Space News . “It preserves close ties to the warfighter, ensures strong authorities and avoids unnecessary delays and disruptions to ongoing programs.” The plan would cost around $12.9 billion in total over the course of five years and require approximately $3.3 billion in the first year, according to Aviation Week . At the Air Force Association conference, Wilson said that President Donald Trump’s administration planned to ask Congress to approve the new service in its defense budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year, which is set to come out in February 2019. It is immediately worth noting that legislators would have to approve any Space Force plans and it remains unclear how many lawmakers truly support the idea . A multi-billion dollar proposal could be off-putting if it threatens to take money away from a wide array of existing major air , land , sea , and space modernization priorities or from funding to expand the size and improve the readiness of the existing services. Space News says that the notional first-year budget that the Air Force laid out for Space Force includes $425 million to support the organization’s headquarters, which will have around 2,400 personnel, including the new service’s civilian secretary and chief of staff. There would be another $1.3 billion for unspecified “space force elements,” $1 billion for military construction, $351 million to pay for the operation and maintenance of subordinate units, and $114 million for actual personnel costs. A Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) missile warning satellite during final assembly. The SBIRS constellation would be among the U.S. military’s space assets that an independent Space Force would be in charge of operating., Lockheed Martin The full Department of the Space Force would have a total of approximately 13,000 people to conduct satellite operations, threat analysis, and support forward deployed units and active operations. These individuals would come from the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, the U.S. Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command ( SMDC ), and U.S. Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command ( SPAWAR ), but it’s not clear if these organizations would continue to exist in any form within their existing parent services. Under Wilson’s concept, Space Force would also include the Space Development Agency (SDA) to take charge of space-related research and development and procurement programs. The Pentagon had included this new organization in its first roadmap for the transformation of the U.S. military’s “National Security Space Components” ahead of the possible creation of a Space Force, which it released in August 2018. This initial plan envisioned SDA subsuming the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center, which presently handles around 85 percent of all military space-related acquisition programs. Instead, Wilson has proposed that the Air Force’s Space Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) run the SDA until such time as either a joint-service U.S. Space Command or a fully independent U.S. Space Force is ready to take control. Congress has already funded the creation of the Space RCO. As such, this organization “exists now and has the personnel and expertise to meet the needs of U.S. Space Command,” Wilson argued in her memo, according to Space News . She acknowledged her idea “contrasts sharply with an [Office of the Secretary of Defense]-level technology policy organization that is far removed from operational needs, fielding, and sustainment issues.” Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan at his confirmation hearing in 2017., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images The Air Force’s top civilian also proposed that the director of the secretive National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) take on the additional role as head of SDA. Though technically a part of the Department of Defense, NRO is the U.S. Intelligence Community’s central satellite arm and reports directly to both the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence. Its work is so sensitive that its very existence was classified until 1992. As we at The War Zone have noted in the past , the U.S. military has a long history of working closely with American intelligence agencies with regards to space-related activities, but there has been little discussion of how an independent Space Force would maintain this linkage. Wilson said that her plan would ensure that NRO and other U.S. intelligence stakeholders would maintain their “equities” with regards to national security decisions about activities in space. Space Force “must maintain a close connection between acquisition and the warfighter,” Wilson said at the Air Force Association gathering. “It must deepen the already close connection between military space and the space elements of the intelligence community.” Her proposal to Deputy Defense Secretary Shanahan also suggested Space Force could eventually take on a variety of roles and functions that other organizations presently perform. This could entail the transformation of the U.S. military’s Missile Defense Agency and Strategic Capabilities Office , as well as the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and Space Traffic Management office and the independent National Aeronautics and Space Administration . A chart showing NRO’s internal organization as of May 4, 2017. Of note is the organization’s existing connections with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and National Security Agency, all of which also have significant interests in activities in space., NRO “The Air Force proposal accomplishes several things: it focuses Department attention on what problems need to be solved; maximizes the utilization of existing resources; avoids the creation of duplicative functions; and provides a path to accomplishing the President’s vision for a separate Department of the Space Force,” Wilson wrote in her memo, according to Defense One . “The approach avoids disrupting programs and increasing risk to ongoing effort, while providing a vision for a comprehensive space force.” It remains to be seen whether or not the Pentagon will entertain any of the Air Force Secretary’s proposal, however. The U.S. military’s top leadership notably cut the service out of the process of crafting the August 2018 space policy plan. Wilson herself had been publicly and categorically opposed to the basic idea of an independent Space Force until earlier in September 2018. “If we’re going to do this, let’s propose to do it right,” she said at a conference Defense News hosted on Sept. 5, 2018, where she said she was now in “complete alignment” with the Trump Administration’s Space Force plans. “Let’s have this debate, support the president’s proposal and put it forward – and make sure that we don’t do this with half measures. I think that’s probably the most important part for me.” Her memo shows that this alignment is actually far from total. We’ll have to wait and see how this continued friction impacts the structure of the final proposal that makes its way to Congress early next year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 18, 2018",Russia’s Claim That Israeli F-16s Used Their Doomed Il-20 Spy Plane As Cover Doesn’t Add Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has threatened an unspecified response to future Israeli air strikes in Syria , though Russian President Vladimir Putin has since taken a less aggressive stance. Their statements follow an incident in which Syrian surface-to-air missile operators accidentally shot down one of Russia’s Il-20 Coot electronic surveillance planes over the Mediterranean Sea. They were responding to Israeli Air Force F-16s that fired stand-off weapons against targets in the country’s coastal Latakia governorate. The Russians first reported the Il-20 had gone missing in the early hours local time in Syria on Sept. 18, 2018. Russia subsequently confirmed that Syrian forces had inadvertently brought down the plane with an SA-5 surface-to-air missile, but blamed Israel, claiming that its jets had used the aircraft to hide their movements ahead of a series of standoff strikes. Israel subsequently responded by expressing “sorrow” over the incident, but insisting that the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad, as well Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , were the ones truly responsible for the loss of the Coot and the 14 personnel on board. “We have informed today our Israeli colleagues, and I have also informed personally the Israeli Defense Minister [Avigdor Lieberman], that such actions will not be left unanswered by us,” Shoigu said at a press conference in Moscow later on Sept. 18, 2018. “The Israeli side didn’t issue a notification or, to be more precise, they warned us a minute before conducting the strike. They told us they were about to attack facilities on the Syrian territory, and they did it.” Later Putin seemed to contradict Shoigu , describing what happened as a “chain of tragic circumstances” and dismissing completely unsupported conspiracy theories that the Israelis deliberately shot the Coot down. “The retaliatory measures will be directed above all to boosting the security of military men and installations in Syria,” Putin said. “These will be measures everyone will see.” In addition, Israel has used a deconfliction hotline in the past to alert Russia of impending strikes in Syria. The Israeli Air Force says it did give the Kremlin advance notice in this case, as well, but did not say how much time elapsed between that notification and the first missiles hitting various targets in Latakia. The IAF posted their official response to the incident on Twitter, stating the following in a string of tweets: Israel expresses sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane that was downed tonight due to Syrian anti-aircraft fire.Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident. Israel also holds Iran and the Hezbollah terror organization accountable for this unfortunate incident. Overnight, IAF fighter jets targeted a facility of the Syrian Armed Forces from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon. These weapons were meant to attack Israel, and posed an intolerable threat against it. The IDF and the Russian army have a deconfliction system, which was agreed upon by the states’ leaders and has proven itself many times over recent years. This system was in use tonight as well, 1. Extensive and inaccurate Syrian anti-aircraft (Surface to Air missile) fire caused the Russian plane to be hit and downed. 2. When the Syrian Army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, IAF jets were already within Israeli airspace. 3. During the strike against the target in Latakia, the Russian plane that was then hit was not within the area of the operation. 4. The Syrian anti-air batteries fired indiscriminately and from what we understand, did not bother to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air. Israel will share all the relevant information with the Russian Government to review the incident and to confirm the facts in this inquiry. The target of the strikes was reportedly facilities belonging to the Syrian Organization for Technological Industries, which is linked to Syria’s chemical weapons and ballistic missile development programs , and Iranian interests . Israel said that the goal of the strikes was to prevent the transfer of munitions to Hezbollah. The Israelis have conducted hundreds of strikes since the Syrian civil war first erupted in 2011 targeting the Lebanese group . They have since broadened that campaign to target Iran’s own forces in the country and other groups aligned with them . Latakia is also home to Russia’s Khmeimim air base , which has hosted a number of Il-20s since Russia first intervened in the conflict in 2015. In this particular instance, the Coot was returning from a mission over neighboring Idlib governorate to monitor the implementation of a Russian-Turkish ceasefire plan in that region and gather intelligence on rebel groups operating there . A map the Russian Ministry of Defense released regarding the incident. The large red and white circle is Russia’s Khmeimim air base, which the smaller blue circles above are the targets that Israel struck in Syria., Russian MoD That deal averted what experts and observers had worried would be an especially brutal campaign by the Syrian regime to finally reassert complete control over the province, which you can read more about here . Now, Turkey is providing de facto cover for groups there who remain opposed to Assad and the region could become an extension of areas it already occupied in northwestern Syria, which you can read about in more detail here . “It’s clear to any specialist the strike was delivered using our Ilyushin-20 as cover, because they [the Israelis] thought the Syrian air defense systems would not act in that direction,” Shoigu asserted in his press conference . “As a result of countermeasures to the Israeli attack, the Syrian air defense troops brought down the Ilyushin-20.” A Russian Il-20 surveillance aircraft., Alan Wilson via Wikimedia Not only is that not at all clear, but it’s also highly unlikely. As our own Tyler Rogoway has already noted, unless the Israelis and Russians were actively collaborating on this operation, it is difficult to see how Israel’s F-16s could time their movements so perfectly. By all accounts, the Israeli Air Force aircraft never actually flew over Syrian territory. In addition, the Israeli Air Force claims that its aircraft had launched their weapons before the Il-20 entered the area and that the F-16s were long gone before Syrian air defenders fired any surface-to-air missiles. If the F-16s launched Small Diameter Bombs at their targets as Russia claims, there would be no reason to remain in the area after the weapons dropped off their bomb racks. In addition, there is significant evidence from prior Israeli and U.S.-led operations that Syria’s forces have a penchant for firing anti-aircraft weapons indiscriminately during and after a strike in order to lay the groundwork for claims that they shot down incoming threats or drove off the attackers. After U.S., U.K., and French forces launched a massive missile barrage against targets in Syria in April 2018, Syrian and Russian officials claimed that most of the incoming missiles had gotten shot down . The U.S. military, however, said that Syrian forces fired some 40 missiles on a “ballistic trajectory” and “without guidance” and that they had taken most of their shots after the strikes had actually ended. This is also not the first time that Syrian and Russian sources have tried to claim that Israel is using third-party nations to cover their operations as a way of excusing the apparently limited capabilities and skills of Syria’s air defense system operators. In late April 2018, rumors swirled, without any supporting evidence, that Israeli Air Force F-15s had mimicked their American counterparts to sneak into Syria unnoticed. It was similarly hard then to imagine why Israel, which carries out perfectly routine strikes in Syria regularly and routinely accepted significant risk in order to carry them out because it sees them as vital to protecting its national interests , would have needed to use this tactic or would have done so at all. It’s important to note that the strikes in Latakia were unusual and that Israel typically does not attack that far to the northwest in Syria, but it is not the first time they have reportedly done so and potentially points to an especially time-sensitive target set. In addition, Russian air defenses, which are technically linked in some fashion with their Syrian partners, have repeatedly either been unable or unwilling to engage Israeli aircraft. The very nature of the standoff weapons used in the strike also negates the need to penetrate into denied territory using some sort of an unwitting decoy plane. This new incident appears to be particularly embarrassing for Russia. The Kremlin has touted efforts to improve Syria’s air defense capabilities, declared total victory in the country multiple times despite continued attacks on its forces , and has now abandoned plans to support a Syrian regime offensive into Idlib and settled for a deal with Turkey that it had previously rejected . Russia, which initially implied that France might have been responsible for bringing down the Il-20, seems eager to find a way to deflect blame from its erstwhile Syrian partners and save face over the entire situation. At the same time, Israel and Russia have grown closer in recent months over a certain amount of shared interests in the region, including a desire to check Iran’s spreading influence . The Kremlin has had relatively timid responses to the loss of its aircraft to hostile fire in the past, as well. In 2015, it similarly threatened to attack Turkish forces and cut ties with authorities in Ankara after Turkey’s F-16s shot down a Russian Su-24 Fencer combat jet along its border with Syria. The Russians never made good on those threats and, as we already noted, the two countries are now coordinating their Syrian campaigns. Combined with Putin’s more conciliatory comments, it’s unlikely that either country is looking for a larger fight, but the Russians could still promise to engage Israeli aircraft in the future under certain circumstances. Whether they actually plan to or not, the Kremlin might hope that create no-go areas for the Israeli Air Force or at least make their risk planning process more difficult. This, in turn, could make them more wary of attacking targets near Khmeimim Air Base or Russia’s naval base in Tartus further to the south. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu., Sputnik  via AP Russia might also look to employ some sort of hybrid warfare concept that blends military and political activities, such as doing nothing to prevent Iranian militias from congregating along Israel’s border with Syria or to keep Assad from making incursions into the internationally-recognized demilitarized zone in the contested Golan Heights region . This could be easier in this case given recent revelations that Israel had secretly supported anti-regime militants in southern Syria for years. Russia has long twisted American and other foreign support for rebel groups in Syria, as well as normal operations elsewhere, into unfounded conspiracy theories about those operations actually being a cover for providing aid to terrorists, such as Al Qaeda and ISIS. Israel and Russia could also decide to go in an entirely different direction and strike deal or set of deals to deconflict their activities. Regardless, the incident highlights just how quickly the situation can change in and around Syria and how fast it can escalate to the point of touching off a broader regional conflict. In his statement on the matter, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo highlighted how dangerous the region has become before calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Syria and an end to “provocative” Iranian activities there. “The United States expresses deep sorrow for the death of the aircrew of the Russian plane that was downed by Syrian regime anti-aircraft fire,” Pompeo wrote on Sept. 18, 2018. “Yesterday’s unfortunate incident reminds us of the need to find permanent, peaceful, and political resolutions to the many overlapping conflicts in the region and the danger of tragic miscalculation in Syria’s crowded theater of operations.” Russia appears to have chosen not to downplay this particular situation in the interests of de-escalating the situation. At that same time, it remains to be seen what the Kremlin’s actual response will be to future Israeli air strikes, which are sure to come. We will be keeping our eyes open for additional developments and update this story as necessary.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 1, 2019","USAF T-6A Training Plane Crashes Near Shopping Mall In San Antonio, Texas (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are few details so far, but a U.S. Air Force T-6A Texan II turboprop trainer from Randolph Air Force Base has crashed near the Rolling Oaks Mall in the northeastern portion of San Antonio, Texas. Initial reports indicate that the two individuals on board the aircraft were able to successfully eject, but we have no additional information on their status. Randolph Air Force Base is one part of Joint Base San Antonio and is home to the 12th Flying Training Wing, which flies T-6As, along with T-38 Talon and T-1A jet trainers. It is situated less than 10 miles from the crash site, which is a grass plot behind the Rolling Oaks Mall designated FM 2252, according to KSAT television , a local ABC affiliate. An investigation into the cause of the accident is already underway. Pictures that have emerged so far show most of the plane’s tail section lying separate from the rest of the aircraft on the grass. There was at least one parachute caught in nearby trees. This comes just a week after a T-38 from the 80th Flying Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base, also in Texas, veered off the runway, prompting both pilots to eject. This is the eight aircraft the Air Force has lost to major accidents since the beginning of 2018 and is the last mishap to befall the U.S. military, which has seen a significant spike in serious and often fatal crashes and other aviation incidents as a whole this year. Update: 6:20pm EST— The Air Force has now confirmed that the two pilots thankfully survived the crash with only minor injuries . Update: 7:00pm EST— The Air Force’s Air Education and Training Command has issued a formal press release regarding the mishap, which further confirms the earlier information. It also says that no one on the ground was injured when the plane crashed and that the service is still assessing the extent of the property damage. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 24, 2018",USAF Wants Units To Rapidly Build And Fly From New Bases In The Middle Of A Future War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. military’s primary focus shifts to potential high-end conflicts with adversaries such as Russia and China , senior U.S. Air Force leaders are warning that the service must be prepared to deploy to a region and quickly set up new bases . Otherwise, the service risks seeing its operations hampered, if not brought to a halt entirely for at least some amount of time, if an enemy has destroyed or otherwise render established facilities unusable in the opening stages of a major war. At the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber conference on Sept. 18, 2018, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein announced plans to have many of the service’s major regional and functional commands work together to update and expand doctrine and concepts of operation for these possible expeditionary missions. The service had debuted a set of expeditionary concepts in 1998, building on lessons learned from previous rapidly deployment concepts , but has not significantly updated them in the decades that followed. “Over time, we’ve migrated away from the original design of the expeditionary Air Force from a force organized to deploy forward, establish new bases, defend those bases, receive follow-on forces, establish C2 [command and control], fight the base, and operate while under attack – to a force that often cannibalizes itself to send forward sometimes individual airmen from every wing of the Air Force to join a mature campaign with established leadership, basing, and C2 infrastructure,” Goldfein explained . “Make no mistake: From Bagram [ Airfield in Afghanistan] to Al Udeid [Air Base in Qatar], to Kunsan and Osan [Air Bases in South Korea], we know how to defend an establish base, receive follow-on forces, and take the fight to the enemy,” The problem is that American’s potential high-end opponents are only continuing to improve and diversify their capabilities to hold these types of established sites at risk or deny access to areas with those facilities that are closer to the front lines. China, in particular, is expanding the size and scope of its ballistic missile arsenal. Russia and China are now pushing ahead with various types of hypersonic weapons , which will only expand their options for rapidly attacking operational bases, as well. It is virtually assured that many American bases, or bases to which the Air Force has access, will find themselves under a massive missile barrage at the beginning of a major, all-out high-intensity conflict. Any known secondary dispersal sites and “bare bases,” which may have an existing runway, but little else, will be similarly vulnerable. So, it may not just be prudent for the Air Force to have a plan to fight without the benefit of these facilities, it may be a vital necessity, Goldfein said . The ability to conduct expeditionary, distributed operations has inherent benefits, as well. An opponent will only have so many missiles and other long-range weapons with which to target the bases and possible bases that it knows about. Being able to rapidly establish functioning airfields in austere locations could force an enemy them to spread their resources thinly across a larger number of objectives or create surprise vectors of attack that simply disrupt their operational planning. Goldfein offered few specific details about how the Air Force might reorganize itself or otherwise change its posture to be better suited to deploying to an area with very limited, if any, established airbase facilities and possibly having to build them up, under fire, from scratch. The service’s top officer did focus heavily on the need to improve expeditionary base defense capabilities , but there would also need to be significantly increased the attention given to civil engineering and Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers ( RED HORSE ) units, explosive ordnance disposal personnel , rapidly deployable air traffic control systems , and other, often neglected ground support functions. “We must always take integrated and layered base defense to a new level by increasing investment in our defenders with new equipment, new training, new tactics, techniques, and procedures, and renewed focus at every echelon of command,” Goldfein said . “This is the year of the defender because we don’t project power without the network of bases and infrastructure needed to execute multi-domain operations.” The Air Force won’t need to start from scratch, though. The service will be able to pull some amount of pre-existing knowledge from the concepts it developed in the late 1990s. The manuals for bare base operations, for instance, remain available and some even got minor updates in the early 2010s. A notional layout for setting up facilities at a bare base airfield from Air Force Pamphlet 10-219, Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning., USAF In addition, both Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) have experimented with various rapid deployment concepts, including one known as “ Rapid Raptor .” This force package typically includes four F-22 Raptor stealth fighters and a C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane with everything necessary to support those aircrafts’ operations for at least 24 hours.  The Air Force has more recently been working to find a way to get all of the necessary equipment into a C-130 airlifter , or a specialized HC-130 or MC-130 type . AFSOC also has considerable experience in readily identifying potential improvised landing strips that can serve as limited, temporary bases of operations. For example, in 2013, what are known as Assault Zone Reconnaissance Teams conducted site surveys and other inspections at almost 300 separate sites throughout the Middle East to help support existing and future operations. Non-US airfields the US military has identified for possible use in future operations., USAF via FOIA This information almost certainly came in handy when the U.S. military rapidly established a series of airfields inside Syria starting in 2016 – if not before – to support the campaign against ISIS terrorists. Both special operations and conventional Air Force units have employed similar rapid deployment concepts throughout Africa . This included an instance where the 3rd Special Operations Squadron established an unmanned aircraft operation with one MQ-1 Predator at an undisclosed location within three weeks . Translating this existing experience to modern operations involving fifth-generation aircraft and ever-improving enemy air defenses , combat aircraft , and other threats, won’t necessarily be easy. The logistical demands of operating and maintaining advanced fighter jets, even from established bases , are only likely to increase as time goes on. An up-armored forklift belonging to the US Air Force’s 441st Air Expeditionary Squadron helps unload a US Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor at an austere airfield in Syria., USAF These difficulties are especially pronounced for stealthy types, which will be critical in the opening phases of an operation to help penetrate through enemy defenses and clear the way for follow-on strikes and deployments. These types of aircraft, such as the F-22 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , have complex sustainment and maintenance requirements due to their low observable features that might be difficult to perform at a remote location, especially if forces find themselves cut off even briefly from their supply lines. It looks increasingly likely that the Air Force may need stealthy or otherwise better protected aerial tankers and cargo aircraft just to get forces to some of these locations safely in the first place. Not all aircraft are as suitable for operations from unimproved or improvised runways, either. The Air Force’s A-10 Warthogs have the ability to use highways as impromptu air bases if necessary, and their crews train to do so , but this isn’t an option for more advanced combat jets such as its F-35As. The service could have to revise its inventory in addition to its force structure to be best prepared for uncertain expeditionary operations in the future. A stealthy, blended wing aerial refueling tanker concept from Lockheed Martin that could also have cargo-carrying capabilities., Joseph Trevithick The Air Force could find itself considering obtaining capability similar to the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B, if not that exact aircraft, which has the ability to conduct short and vertical takeoffs and landings. The Marines have already demonstrated that these planes can operate from relatively short concrete pads. With this in mind, it’s also important to note that the Air Force won’t be conducting these sorts of expeditionary operations independent of the other services. The battlefield construction , logistical , and other relevant capabilities that the Army and Navy possess will be essential, as will the ability to tap into a robust, overarching set of communications and intelligence-sharing networks to keep appraised of the situation and coordinate continued support at austere facilities. Training forces to operate as joint units that blend the necessary components for these types of missions will be key. In addition, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Mark Kelly, head of 12th Air Force, which is part of ACC, warned at the 2018 Air Force Association conference in September 2018 that forces are likely to be in danger of kinetic and non-kinetic hazards even when mobilizing or transiting to a theater of operations. “No one opposes airmen driving to BWI [Baltimore-Washington International Airport],” he said. “No one is in the computer systems tracking their luggage. No one is in [Air Mobility Command’s] computer systems that keep the equipment flowing forward,” he continued. “But if great powers can get into your election networks , then trust me, they can get into your baggage handlers.” Cyber attacks and other traditional electronic warfare will also threaten personnel once they arrive at a certain location, too. In September 2017, a group of A-10s from the Maryland Air National Guard’s 175th Wing practiced operating from a highway in Estonia , a NATO member that sits along the Baltic Sea and shares a major border with Russia . The exercise included a simulated cyber attack on the unit’s forward operations center by Estonian military personnel and British civilians playing the role of “ politically motivated hackers .” That exercise, nicknamed Baltic Jungle , showcased just a small number of the capabilities Goldfein and Kelly are now saying it is vital for the Air Force to have in greater quantities. It also reflected a tiny portion of the sorts of multi-faceted threats that U.S. forces might face during future operations. Still, the lessons learned from this drill, and other recent ones similar to it, will likely serve as important stepping stones as the Air Force looks to reinvigorate its expeditionary capabilities in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 26, 2018",Pork Floats!: Congress Inserts Three Littoral Combat Ships The Navy Doesn’t Want Into Budget,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In yet another sign that expanded defense spending isn’t necessarily smart defense spending, your elected representatives on Capitol Hill just inserted three more Littoral Combat Ships into a committee markup of the 2019 defense budget. These are three ships the U.S. Navy does not want , pushing its truncated LCS buy from 32 of the unreliable and questionably effective ships to 35. Your tax dollars at work folks! Shipbuilding is really the most politicized facet of weapons procurement. It’s heavily infested with special interests and diseased with pork-barrel log-rolling. But regardless, it’s abundantly clear that the LCS is a loser. Even the Navy finally understands that money would be better spent on other platforms. The upcoming FFG(X) frigate , in particular, will be far more capable and adept at taking on the threats the country is slated to face in the coming decades than largely toothless , ill-conceived , and fragile half billion dollar jet boats. LCS-1 Freedom and the other three initial LCSs are now training ships after a massive restructuring initiative following a spate of breakdowns and other negative news on the status of the program and the vessels’ readiness. , USN Congress wants to order more LCS hulls regardless of this reality and that’s pretty much what they are getting as they have slashed funds for the already long-delayed mission modules that give LCS a purpose. And that purpose used to be multi-fold, with mission modules being switched out in a very short period of time in port, but that idea—the backbone of the LCS concept since it genesis—has since been tossed overboard. Now the ships will have a single mission module installed for the long term. In other words, what was supposed to be the example of multi-role flexibility and efficiency has become the exact opposite. David Larter over at Defensenews.com broke the story and gives a great overview of the paradox Congress has created for the program: “…When it comes to the mission modules destined to make each ship either a mine sweeper, submarine hunter or small surface combatant, that funding has been slashed. Appropriators cut all funding in 2019 for the anti-submarine warfare package, a variable-depth sonar and a multifunction towed array system that the Navy was aiming to have declared operational next year, citing only that the funding was “ahead of need.” The National Defense Authorization Act had authorized about $7.4 million, still well below the $57.3 million requested by the Navy, citing delays in testing various components. Appropriators are also poised to half the requested funding for the surface warfare package and cut nearly $25.25 million from the minesweeping package, which equates to about a 21 percent cut from the requested and authorized $124.1 million. Nor are this year’s cuts the only time appropriators have gone after the mission modules. A review of appropriations bills dating back to fiscal 2015 shows that appropriators have cut funding for mission modules every single year, and in 2018 took big hacks out of each funding line associated with the modules. The annual cutting spree has created a baffling cycle of inanity wherein Congress, unhappy with the development of the modules falling behind schedule, will cut funding and cause development to fall further behind schedule, according to a source familiar with the details of the impact of the cuts who spoke on background. All this while Congress continues to pump money into building ships without any of the mission packages having achieved what’s known as initial operating capability, meaning the equipment is ready to deploy in some capacity. (The surface warfare version has IOC-ed some initial capabilities but is adding a Longbow Hellfire missile system that will be delayed with cuts, the source said.) That means that with 15 of the currently funded 32 ships already delivered to the fleet, not one of them can deploy with a fully capable package of sensors for which the ship was built in the first place — a situation that doesn’t have a clear end state while the programs are caught in a sucking vortex of cuts and delays. … But the appropriators shouldn’t take all the heat, he added. The development of the different modules have hit technical issues and are all drastically behind schedule. The minesweeping package, for example, was initially supposed to deliver in 2008, but now isn’t slated to IOC until 2020, a date that will be further in doubt if Congress passes the appropriations bill as it left committee, sources agreed. The Independence class Littoral Combat Ships offer some advantages, like their large flight deck, but they also require an immense amount of dry dock time, something the Navy is very short of. , USN So we are buying more buns, but not the hotdogs to go inside them while everyone at the party wants pizza anyway. It is the epitome of waste. Oh, and let’s not forget that the Navy is still buying two brands of hotdogs and buns at two different markets across town just so that they can support their local grocers. USN Food analogies aside, the Navy is betting all its chips on the LCS for one increasingly critical task—mine sweeping. Larter also makes note of this and the fact that the last Avenger class minesweeper will be put out of service in the early part of the coming decade. Larter writes: The minesweeping package, for example, was initially supposed to deliver in 2008, but now isn’t slated to IOC until 2020, a date that will be further in doubt if Congress passes the appropriations bill as it left committee, sources agreed. Avenger class minesweeper. , USN The Navy could very well find itself without any dedicated surface anti-mine warfare capabilities just as these nasty weapons are entering into a renaissance of sorts threat-wise. The delay in fielding the LCS’s minesweeping package has forced the Navy to ponder migrating some of its minesweeping capabilities to heavily armed but also already heavily tasked surface combatants. But in the past, similar initiatives haven’t worked well and bogging down multi-billion dollar assets to clear mines surely isn’t an attractive proposition to many in the seagoing service. Other concepts are also being looked at to decentralize and distribute minesweeping capabilities. But actually doing so is more challenging than it sounds. Minesweeping is a risky art that requires expertise and training. It’s not an ideal task to be tagged on to already mission saturated sailors’ to do lists. Unmanned vehicles and other concepts can help streamline and automate the mission, but they too require specialized support. LCS-2 deploys the Remote Mine Hunting system unmanned underwater vehicle. , USN But when you take a step back you realize that the whole thing would be silly if it weren’t so infuriating. The Navy could just replace its minesweepers with far less expensive and smaller vessels than Littoral Combat Ships—the Freedom class LCS is roughly three and a half times the displacement of an Avenger class minesweeper and far more complex. There are plenty of allied designs of ships this size that can be acquired off the shelf as well.  And seeing as only eight of the LCS are currently slated to receive the minesweeping package, the raw number of ships dedicated to the task will shrink to an even smaller size than what the tired Avenger class represent today. The Avenger class aren’t glamorous but they are effective.  , USN In the end, the LCS has created far more problems than it solves for the Navy, which some of us have been saying for many years while the Navy brass made laughably reaching statements about virtually all aspects of the program in order to keep it afloat. Now those chickens have come home to roost. And when it comes to a mission that has been largely neglected but no longer can be, like counter-mine warfare, the Navy would have been far better off just building a ship to do just that. Instead it is getting the same thing, just in a far larger and more expensive package.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force officer has disclosed that an MQ-9 Reaper drone scored its first ever air-to-air kill in an exercise nearly a year ago. This comes months after the service announced that it was looking to give at least some of these unmanned aircraft the ability to take on aerial threats. Military.com got the details in a September 2018 interview with U.S. Air Force Colonel Julian Cheater, head of the 432nd Wing , the service’s premier drone unit , which is situated at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway outlined this exact capability back in March 2018, after the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio had said it would give General Atomics, which builds the MQ-9, a sole-source contract to support the first step of what it referred to as the Reaper Air-to-Air Missile (RAAM) program. “Something that’s unclassified but not well known, we recently in November [2017] … launched an air-to-air missile against a maneuvering target that scored a direct hit,” Cheater told Military.com . “It was an MQ-9 versus a drone with a heat-seeking air-to-air missile, and it was direct hit … during a test.” Cheater did not name the exercise, the type of target, or the weapon the Reaper used to shoot it down. It is very likely that the “heat-seeking air-to-air missile” was an AIM-9X Sidewinder . At present, the MQ-9’s typical loadout can consist of precision-guided air-to-ground missiles and bombs , fuel tanks, and sensor pods . An MQ-9 carrying an AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile., USN In November 2016, U.S. Navy Captain James Stoneman, in charge of the Air-to-Air Missiles Program Office at Naval Air Systems Command, released a picture, seen above, of an MQ-9 carrying an AIM-9X in a briefing at the Gulf Coast chapter of the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Air Armament Symposium. Stoneman’s presentation at the 2017 iteration of this gathering is unfortunately not available online. The Navy is the central manager for the Sidewinder family across the services. Reports that the Air Force has been considering adding air-to-air weaponry to the Reapers dates back as far as 2003 . At that time, the service had armed its now retired MQ-1 Predators with the air-to-air version of the heat-seeking Stinger missile to give them some modicum of protection against Iraqi jets. You can read more about that in detail here . “We develop those tactics, techniques and procedures to make us survivable in those types of environments and, if we do this correctly, we can survive against some serious threats against normal air players out there,” Cheater explained to Military.com . “In many parts of the world, it’s almost a hybrid fight by proxy … the MQ-9 Reaper will certainly be a big part of that. So if you package this aircraft in properly with other aircraft, it will be survivable.” A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper with a more common loadout consisting of AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles and an underwing fuel tank to extend its range., USAF Compared to Predators with Stingers, Reapers with AIM-9Xs are a far more capable combination. This Sidewinder model is an impressive missile by itself, especially in its latest Block II configuration, which features a data link that allows for a lock-on-after-launch capability. Combined with the Reaper’s own Link 16 data link , this also means that a third party could help supply targeting information to the unmanned aircraft’s pilots and on to the missile itself. This would improve the situational awareness of the drone’s crew – who might otherwise be limited by the “soda straw” view through the sensor turret in the aircraft’s nose – during an air-to-air fight and allow them to engage enemies at the very limit of the AIM-9X’s range, which is beyond the distance the naked eye can see. Additional radar warning receivers and other sensors to spot incoming threats and sense-and-avoid technology that detects other aircraft in the vicinity could also help aid the drone pilots in spotting and engaging their opponent. The AIM-9X, which you can read about more here , also has a limited ability to engage ground and surface targets, and there has been talk of whether it might be able to intercept low-flying cruise missiles under certain circumstances, as well. As such, the weapon could give the MQ-9 an additional set of multi-mission capabilities. A slide from US Navy Captain James Stoneman’s 2016 briefing showing various engagement options available to aircraft with AIM-9Xs. , USN Of course, none of this would allow the Reaper to operate in highly contested airspace. But it might allow the aircraft to fly in lower risk areas adjacent to them and give them some defense against threats that might suddenly appear while conducting missions during complex and uncertain hybrid or “gray zone” conflicts that exist in a state somewhere between peace and open fighting. We’ve already seen how this might occur over Syria, where Russian combat jets have shadowed Air Force Reapers conducting armed reconnaissance missions. Russia’s pilots have harassed manned American aircraft in various portions of the country, as well, creating the potential for dangerous miscalculations. Iran has also sought to hamper American drone operations in international airspace in the Persian Gulf, which prompted the Air Force to deploy manned aircraft to escort them for a time. More recently, the Iranians have stepped up the use of their own unmanned aircraft in that region to harass U.S. military forces in the air and at sea. Arming Reapers with AIM-9Xs would serve as a deterrent to any potential opponent. Any attacker would no longer be able to assume that the drones wouldn’t try to shoot back. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oi_qJFzmV_g A Reaper armed with AIM-9Xs would also offer another option to shoot down enemy manned aircraft and drones that might be threatening American or allied forces at a remote location. In 2017, U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle manned combat jets swooped in on two separate occasions to shoot down Iranian drones that were attacking a small garrison in Syria that hosts U.S. and partner forces. An MQ-9 with a load of air-to-air missiles could orbit over a site like this and provide persistent, albeit short-range air defense . In the future, especially in a high-end conflict against an established opponent, such as Russia or China , Reapers could find themselves suddenly under threat while flying to a theater of operations or between bases within a region . With the Air Force working on concepts for rapidly deploying MQ-9s to a conflict area, it might become increasingly important to give them a way to defend themselves along the way. “We can fly from one continent to the next,” Col. Cheater, the 432nd Wing commander, noted to Military.com . “We [recently] flew nine [Reapers] from one operating area to another, and that is agile, that is flexible, and it provides options to the combatant commander.” Adding AIM-9Xs to the Reaper’s arsenal could help ensure expand the drone’s flexibility and ensure the unmanned aircraft remain agile, even in riskier environments than they typically fly in now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2018",Here’s What A Sinister Looking Giant Black Pyramid Is Doing At An Abandoned Military Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You see all types of crazy looking structures on and around military bases when perusing satellite imagery. But once in a while you find something that is just too bizarre to move on from without an explanation. Looking more like the evil lair of a comic book pharaoh brought back to life than something you would find on an ex-missile test range, the strange installation seen in the banner image above is a burial tomb, but of a different kind. The peculiar site is situated on the western edge of the long defunct Green River Launch Complex in Utah and measures 530 feet by 450 feet—the Luxor Hotel is 600 feet by 600 feet for comparison—and covers five an d half acres. But the thing is that this imposing fixture isn’t even a structure— it’s a pile. What you are seeing in the image above is a giant, contoured mound of radioactive waste. Originally a mill on the site was operated by Union Carbide from 1957 to 1961—at the height of the atomic age. During just three years of operation as a uranium upgrading facility it produced 183,000 tons of ore and generated an estimated 114,000 cubic yards of radioactive tailings, a predominantly sandy material, that covered about 9 acres to an average depth of 7 feet. The mill remained for decades after its closure before the State of Utah took over the site in 1988. The DOE then stepped in to manage the disposable of the toxic tailings on the site in 1989. The mound also contains radioactive waste from 17 other sites from the region as well. Dubbed the Green River Uranium Disposal Cell, it is ringed by chain link fencing with signs everywhere warning of the toxic danger of its contents. The ominous waste pile site just off a major highway that bisects the abandoned launch site in half. To the west is the Green River. , Google Earth Geologicnow.com , an absolutely fascinating site, has an awesome little article about what exactly this thing is, and apparently it has plenty of radioactive cousins splattered around the U.S. that were also born out of the Cold War: Though the underground nuclear catacombs for America’s spent nuclear fuel are yet to be created, radioactive tombs of America’s various nuclear programs already exist today, with more to come. Most are repositories for the remains of uranium mills, processing facilities, weapons plants, and contaminated tailings, bulldozed into engineered isolation mounds designed to limit contact with their surroundings for hundreds of years. There are dozens of these mounds, across the country from Pennsylvania to Arizona, built mostly by the Department of Energy, and maintained by their Legacy Management office. These disposal mounds are generally low, rectilinear piles with flat, sloping tops – terrestrial umbrellas, keeping moisture out of the pile as much as possible. In arid environments, the outer layer is a coating of coarse riprap rock, a dead space where nothing grows, where no soil forms, and no roots take hold that could pierce the radioactive core. This tough skin allows occasional rains to pass through it to the next layer, a low-permeability clayey mixture a few feet thick. Water drains off to the side of the pile through channels at the base held in place with more layers of crushed stone. These disposal cells are located primarily in the Southwest, where natural uranium deposits were found and exploited. Some of these former uranium mills were set up secretly for the Manhattan Project. Most started in the 1950s, and many operated until the 1990s. Presently, only one conventional uranium mill is operating in the USA, the White Mesa Mill in Blanding, Utah, in the heart of the uranium district and Indian country. However, that may change as the nation shifts towards more self-reliant energy sources. Each disposal cell covers many acres and as much as half a square mile. They resemble ancient pyramids or relics from a geometrical mound-building culture, like archeological forms made for the future. They represent the legacy of the most advanced technology of a global culture: the creation of the atomic bomb, the ability to destroy the world at the push of a button. They are part of the nationwide network of industrial sites created to extract, process, manufacture, and engineer nuclear fuel for reactors and weapons–a continent-wide landscape machine to concentrate a naturally occurring trace material into such compressed atomic density that it explodes with galactic energy. These mound sites, byproducts of this effort, are the end of the line, meant to be unconnected to the rest of the world, like deadly anachronistic time capsules. These are the most negative of spaces, non places, meant to stay inert and isolated for as much of forever as possible, kept from the present, but destined for the future. A fact sheet that is publicly available online about the site includes details about its particular construction: The cell was excavated to bedrock and was lined with 6 feet of low-permeability soil. Most of the contaminated materials are below grade. A clay-rich soil layer placed over the contaminated materials extends to the edge of the cell below grade and serves as a lowpermeability radon barrier. Above grade, the radon barrier is covered by a layer of rock (riprap) placed on granular bedding material. The cell design promotes rapid runoff of precipitation to minimize leachate. The walls around the edge of the disposal cell are lined with riprap and bedding material. A large riprap apron extends outward from the edge of the disposal cell for about 20 feet. Precipitation flows down the 20-percent side slopes into the surrounding rock apron. The disposal cell was located and designed to prevent or minimize erosion from storm water. The cell is located 75 feet above the Brown’s Wash floodplain. Existing gullies were filled and regraded during cell construction, and all disturbed grass surrounding the disposal cell were reseeded with native vegetation. DOE The document continues, stating: The disposal cell at Green River is designed and constructed to last for 200 to 1,000 years. However, the general license has no expiration date, and DOE understands that its responsibility for the safety and integrity of the Green River site will last indefinitely. So like the pyramids of Egypt, these are also eternal resting places with the contents within not ever intended to be moved or molested. An indestructible reminder of a very dark time in mankind’s past. One also has to wonder what toxic impact this waste had on its surrounds before it was organized into a neat and isolated, albeit huge pile? Tuba City Uranium Disposal Cell in Arizona, one of number of uranium tailings disposal sites in various configurations scattered around the country. Some sites have entire mills buried beneath them along with their tailings. , CFLUI As for the Green River Launch Complex, the largely abandoned site may ring a bell as it was ridiculously claimed  by Popular Mechanics in 1997 that operations at Area 51 had packed up and moved there, as well as to Dugway Proving ground that lies about 200 miles to the Northwest. This was totally unsubstantiated and incorrect, but the myth propagated for years and drew attention to the crumbling base. Now, even as the base’s once important Cold War infrastructure continues to be demolished or just disintegrate with the passage of time, that huge charcoal colored pile of atomic waste will sit begrudgingly for ages. Some things mankind simply can’t reverse and the Green River Uranium Disposal Cell is a stark and ominous reminder of that.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 10, 2018","It’s Great To See North And South Korea Get Along, But Kim’s Nukes Aren’t Going Anywhere","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following their third summit in less than a year , South Korea’s President Moon Jae In and North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un have made a number of important announcements, including a reduction in forces along the intra-Korean border and a North Korean pledge to shut down the facilities at Yongbyon that makes fissile material for nuclear weapons , at a historic summit in Pyongyang. At the same time, the agreements, as they stand now, would do little to impede North Korea’s continued growth as a nuclear power and have no clear mechanisms so far to verify that they are holding up their end of any arrangements. The outcome of this latest meeting also raises serious questions about whether the South Koreans are on the same page policy-wise as their American counterparts , which could impact the prospects for future U.S. government negotiations with Pyongyang. Moon and Kim held three days of meetings in the North Korean capital between Sept. 17 and Sept. 19, 2018, before signing what they called the Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018. South Korean Defense Minister Song Young Moo and his North Korean counterpart Rho Kwang Chul also signed a separate document. The two countries’ leaders met for the first time in a historic summit at the border enclave of Panmunjom in April 2018. The two returned to the village the next month for further talks. “We have planted seeds of peace of prosperity which have ripened into fruits in this autumn,” Kim said in prepared remarks after the signing of the latest declaration. “We will accelerate the pace of inter-Korean cooperation…The destiny of our people lies in our hands.” You can watch Moon and Kim make their statements, with English translations, below. Moon used his remarks to explain in greater depth what the two parties had just agreed to do. Here are the pertinent details of Moon and Kim’s joint declaration , as well as Song and Rho’s military agreements : Both countries reasserted their pledge to implement the earlier agreement they had signed in April, the specifics of which we at The War Zone have previously analyzed here , as well as a promise to continue to communicate and coordinate closely to enact various confidence-building measures to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The latter provisions include creating “buffer zones” on either side of the border and a “no-fly zone” above that area where no military activity can occur. No military maneuver or live-fire exercises will occur within 3.1 miles of the formal land boundary and within similar distances of the maritime boundaries between the two countries. Both countries will cover the muzzles of any artillery pieces emplaced along the shore. The two Koreas will also remove guardposts within one mile of the land boundary and work toward the goal of removing all guard posts along the demilitarized zone (DMZ). Both countries will demilitarize their respective sides of the Panmunjom village, including the removal of guard posts, landmines, barbed wire, and other obstacles.  Each country will have a maximum of 35 unarmed guards at the site, who patrol the enclave and monitor tourists, and will now be able to freely move between the two countries within the confines of a small, designated area. North Korea pledged to the “permanently dismantle” facilities at Dongchang-ri , which is ostensibly a launch and test facility for North Korea’s space program, and allow international experts “from relevant countries” to witness the demolition. North Korea said it was willing to “permanently dismantle” the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which produces fissile material for nuclear weapons, as long as the United States “takes corresponding measures” in the spirit of the declaration that Kim signed with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in July 2018. South and North Korea once again pledge to work toward the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” By the end of 2018, South and North Korea will hold groundbreaking ceremonies for road and rail links between the two countries on the east and west coasts of the Peninsula. The countries will work to reboot the shared industrial complex at Kaesong (also written Gaeseong) and the Mount Kumgang (also written Mount Geumgang) joint tourism project, as well as pursue talks about establishing new, similar economic and tourism zones. Improved environment cooperation, including forestry conservation. Improve ties with regards to public health and medicine, especially with regards to preparedness for epidemics and other outbreaks of disease. Work toward a permanent site to facilitate in-person meetings between families separated by the Korean War, as well as resolve issues tied to video conferencing and the exchange of video messages via the Korean Red Cross. Promote art and culture exchanges, including the first-ever performance of the Pyongyang Art Troupe in South Korea’s capital Seoul in October 2018. Continued joint participation in the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan and a joint bid for hosting the 2032 Summer Olympics. Coordinate celebrations of various significant anniversaries. Chairman Kim Jong Un will make a visit to Seoul as soon as possible. The plans and pledges to reduce military forces along the intra-Korean border limit their activities near the DMZ, increase the size and scope of demilitarized areas, and for North Korea specifically to dismantle sites linked to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs are definitely significant. The military confidence-building measures are particularly important given the two countries’ long history of skirmishes along their borders and the very real potential for miscalculations that could quickly lead to a devastating all-out conflict . The removal of certain fixed defenses could make it more difficult for either side to decide to abandon the plan and “snap back” its forces into place. The loss of ability on both sides to monitor activities along the DMZ as tightly as before could also introduce a certain mutual risk that could also be beneficial in deterring breaches of the deal. The plans won’t hamper the rapid movement of mobile artillery and other heavy weapons back into those areas, though. When it comes to Dongchang-ri and Yongbyon, it’s less clear if the plan the joint declaration describes will lead to the desired impact. North Korea had already pledged to demolish the facilities at Dongchang-ri, also known as the Sohae Satellite Launching Station at the Singapore Summit with Trump, so they are leveraging an old offer again in that case. Map of the Korean peninsula locating Tongchang-ri (Sohae Satellite Launching Station), which North Korea agreed to permanently close pic.twitter.com/3nlD3zX9Zj — AFP News Agency (@AFP) September 19, 2018 It remains to be seen whether they will make good on their willingness to allow experts to observe the work and who will qualify as a “relevant country,” too. The North Koreans had made similar promises with regards to the demolition of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, but ultimately only allowed select journalists to visit the site on one specific occasion. There was no opportunity for experts to assess the exact size and nature of that facility, verify that the destruction of the known tunnel entrances had truly rendered it unusable , or conduct any analysis about whether the loss of the site would have any impact on North Korea’s nuclear program at all. It is also unclear how much the loss of Dongchang-ri will hamper North Korea’s nascent space program, which many experts believe has served as a cover for their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Even if it does, the North Koreans have made no pledges to halt their now very public and separate ICBM developments. The loss of the engine and other test facilities at Sohae might limit Kim’s ability to test new missile developments, but he has working ICBM designs on mobile transporter-erector-launchers now and may have other, more robust testing options elsewhere. Similarly, Kim’s stated willingness to dismantle Yongbyon , which is still dependent on unspecified “corresponding measures” from the United States, may be equally meaningless given the existence of the Kangson enrichment facility and the possibility that the North Koreans may have additional covert fissile material production sites. “I don’t know,” South Korean presidential spokesperson Yoon Young Chan told reporters at a press conference after the signing ceremony when they asked about how many other such nuclear facilities might exist. S. Korean presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan, asked if there are any N. Korean nuclear-enrichment sites other than Yongbyon: I don't know. pic.twitter.com/r4FwFQfaFM — Jonathan Cheng (@JChengWSJ) September 19, 2018 Beyond that, Yoon was also unaware if Moon’s Administration had secured even an initial declaration of how many nuclear sites and total nuclear weapons North Korea has, no matter how dubious it might be. The United States has also unsuccessfully attempted to obtain this information through diplomatic channels. The South Korean presidential spokesperson did say that there were other agreements that did not make it into the public declaration. Without this data, it’s essentially impossible to gauge how significant North Korea’s offers to dismantle sites or eliminate capabilities might be. Without knowing where the North Koreans are hiding all the parts of their nuclear program, its similarly difficult to verify whether or not they’re implementing their pledges rather than simply moving things to another, unknown site. Without a robust inspection and verification regime, what is or isn’t happening at known sites, and whether there might be any freeze in activity, would be equally difficult to judge. With all of this in mind, the economic and social elements of the September 2018 declaration form a significant signal about future relations between the South and the North. For South Korea, the document in many ways appears to chart a course to a paradigm shift on the Peninsula that accepts North Korea as a nuclear power and seeks to reduce tensions and the possibility of conflict through greater economic and societal linkages. South Korean president Moon Jae In, left, and North Korean premier Kim Jong Un wave and gesture from a limousine after Moon’s arrival in Pyongyang for the summit on Sept. 17, 2018., Kyodo via AP Images This greater alignment between the two Koreas could make it virtually impossible for the United States to return to a policy of maximum pressure toward the North. This raises questions about how closely the United States and South Korea have been coordinating on the latter’s diplomatic endeavors. In particular, while Moon and Kim were talking, the United States was highlighting problems with the existing sanctions regime against North Korea, especially Russia’s apparent non-compliance with those international restrictions. It could be increasingly difficult for the U.S. government to complain about lax sanctions enforcement as one of its own major allies in the region continues to promote greater economic cooperation with Pyongyang. The present state of North-South affairs could also impact the ability of the United States to make credible threats during its own negotiations with North Korean officials and could set the tenor for any future second meeting between Kim and Trump in Pyongyang’s favor. It could be hard for U.S. officials to outline reasonable repercussions for Pyongyang’s failure to follow through on any deal regarding its nuclear and missile programs, or pressure them to agree to one in the first place, if North Korean officials are already making significant progress with South Korea on a bilateral level. On Sept. 19, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke positively about the outcome of the latest North-South summit and revealed that he had spoken earlier that day with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho to discuss restarting stalled negotiations between the two countries. “This will mark the beginning of negotiations to transform U.S.-DPRK relations through the process of rapid denuclearization of North Korea, to be completed by January 2021,” he said. Moon and Kim walk and talk on Sept. 19, 2018., Kyodo via AP Images Still, it’s hard to see how North Korea would feel compelled to keep to that already wildly optimistic timeline given the latest declaration from Moon and Kim. It’s also worth noting, as always, that the North Koreans have a completely different understanding of “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula. For Pyongyang, this is a process that has to begin with a formal peace treaty ending the Korean War and could lead to the removal of U.S. troops from the region and other steps well before they even consider eliminating their nuclear arsenal. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the various declarations between the North and South in 2018 will produce real results. It’s not the first time the two countries have pledged to make progress on many of these same issues and have then failed to do so. But the tone and scope of the continued summits between Moon and Kim continue to show positive signs. However, this, in turn, could prove to be awkward for the United States, which is looking to preserve the option of a more hard-line approach if its own diplomatic efforts collapse. The bottom line is that no matter how warm relations between North and South Korea appear to be, there still has yet to be any clear and detailed discussion over actually eliminating North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and the delivery systems that go along with it. So far the Kim regime has benefited greatly from the increased engagement while giving up next to nothing tangible regarding its nuclear program in return.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-52 is at it again. The relatively ancient bomber is on a path to become far more capable than it ever has been as the USAF now plans for it to serve into the second half of the century and even possibly past its 100th birthday. New engines, communications equipment, weapons racks , and sensors are included in an emerging upgrade roadmap that will keep the bomber relevant for decades to come, but the BUFF’s new arsenal of weapons is probably what’s most exciting about this initiative. Beyond a number of hypersonic weapons and guileful air-launched decoy jammers , this new weapons menu includes the Quickstrike family of naval mines equipped with JDAM-ER guided wing kits. This weapon gives the big bomber the unprecedented ability to lay down entire minefields over wide areas, in a single pass, with pinpoint accuracy, and all while standing-off at over 40 miles away. Proof of this emerging capability was recently captured on video showing a B-52H launching on a training sortie from Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam during exercise Valiant Shield—a biennial U.S. only set of drills that focus on interoperability and high-end tactics employment. In the video, the bomber is clearly seen equipped with four of these still very rare weapons. A P-8 Poseidon is also seen monitoring their impact on the water’s surface. A Quickstrike mine is used in relatively shallow waters of about 300 feet or less. It is delivered by aircraft and sits on the seafloor awaiting targets of opportunity. The weapon itself is a Mark 80 series general purpose bomb that has been adapted into a mine via the installation of an arming device in its nose and a target detection device in its tail. The target detection device will detonate when a vessel passes within lethal range of its position on the seafloor. Arming devices and target detection devices can be used in tandem to activate a mind field for a certain window in time and to only detonate when the acoustic/seismic/magnetic signature of certain vessels is detected. Mk62 Quickstrike mine with fin kit., USN Advanced naval mines can be very discriminating as to which vessels qualify to receive their deadly payload and when. The Quickstrike family of components has been upgraded in recent years to keep pace with these developments, although their exact capabilities aren’t known. Quickstrike mines have to be delivered using a ballute or folding-fin retarder tail kit as they have a fairly narrow envelope for deployment—usually below 500 feet and around 300 knots or less. In this day and age, sauntering into an area where there is supposed to be enemy vessel traffic at low altitude and at turboprop speeds and carefully laying a minefield is likely to get an aircrew a one-way ticket to Davy Jones’ locker. So deploying minefields using the Quickstrike would only be possible under a narrow set of tactical circumstances without taking on extreme risk. Youtube GIF This is a major problem because mine warfare is coming back in vogue along with pretty much every other anti-access/area-denial capability as the U.S. confronts peer state threats from China and Russia and as threats by rogue state actors and non-state actors evolve . But just the idea that the U.S. can rapidly deploy deadly minefields via strategic bombers or tactical aircraft impacts the enemy’s decision cycle. That’s one reason why the USAF has been showing off this capability during international exercises that occur right in Russia’s backyard. But still, Quickstrike’s tactical limitations are a glaring issue. Enter JDAM-ER, the GPS and inertial navigation-guided free-fall Joint Direct Attack Munition’s winged cousin. While the Pentagon has largely passed over JDAM-ER, Australia has embraced the concept and has fielded it for use by their Hornets and Super Hornets. The kit allows a MK80 series-JDAM combination to be transformed into a standoff weapon, which is great for striking highly defended targets or wiping out air defense sites. But the kit also presents another opportunity, one that the Pentagon is capitalizing on. Because Quickstrike mines are basically Mk80 series general purpose bombs with some modifications, including sharing their same form factor, the JDAM-ER kit can just as easily equip a mine as a general purpose bomb. In fact, it doesn’t know the difference. Its only goal is to get the bomb to a specific point on the planet’s surface, whether that’s water or land makes no difference. By pairing Quickstrike with JDAM-ER, the Pentagon solved its mine-laying issues with Quickstrike alone. Instead of an aircraft having to troll around low and slow over a potentially contested waterway while laying out a complex field of Quickstrikes, that same bomber or maritime patrol plane can now standoff nearly 50 miles and release its entire payload in one pass. Alternatively, a formation of tactical jets can relate a barrage of JDAM-ERs to obtain the same effects. The JDAM-ER kitted Quickstrikes fly to their pre-planned impact points on the surface of the water, in effect, laying a complex minefield without actually having to directly lay one at all, and doing so with robotic precision. We are talking about a major game-changing and super relevant capability here—one that is the definition of ‘totally off-the-shelf.’ The first major test of the weapon by the U.S. came four years ago during an earlier iteration of Valiant Shield in Guam. Then in 2016, Navy Hornets released a number of inert GBU-62 Quickstrike-ERs during the next Valiant Shield and the results were clearly impressive: In additional tests, the weapons have proven so accurate that if targeted to hit the same spot on the surface of the water, the mines would actually be found touching on the seafloor when divers went to recover them. USN Because of the precision and standoff range of Quickstrike-ER, American aircraft can deliver them not just over broad areas around open bodies of water, but they can plant them in rivers, tributaries, canals, and inside port facilities without having to even get near the targeted area. This makes Quickstrike-ER an incredibly nasty and insidious weapon that could wreak havoc on an enemy’s naval forces and deny them the ability to make amphibious landings or even leave port. You can also imagine how this same capability could be paired with low-observable combat aircraft—namely the B-2 Spirit and upcoming B-21 Raider—to mine very high-value littoral waterways deep in enemy territory. 40 plus miles is a good margin for very stealthy aircraft even in highly defended airspace, but when you consider that the B-21 is likely to operate at altitudes well in excess of 50,000 feet, Quickstrike-ER’s range would increase quite significantly. USAF Photo by Col Mike Pietrucha What’s significant about the video taken on Guam just days ago is that the B-52 appears to be carrying a Mk84 2,000lb derivative of the Quickstrike-ER. This is the first time I have seen this configuration. 2,000lbs of high explosives detonating in shallow water would mean certain death for even the largest vessels passing overhead. Just showing off the weapon is a reminder to America’s potential adversaries that the shallow waters of regions like the South China Sea could easily be turned into a minefield via aerial delivery without even putting an aircraft directly over the kill zone. B-52s, in particular, have spent a lot of time plowing the skies around China’s manmade islands as of late. In addition to Quickstrike-ER, the Pentagon has adapted the standard JDAM kit for use with Quickstrike mines as well. This variant is called the Quickstrike-J and offers far less standoff range, but provides the ability to accurately mine a large area on one or a small number of passes and higher altitudes. Maybe the promise of Quickstrike-ER will make the Pentagon reevaluate the merits of JDAM-ER. It’s a relatively low-cost way to achieve some standoff range against highly defended targets, which will add much-needed flexibility even for stealthy fighters as enemy integrated air defense systems continue to mature. USAF Photo by Col Mike Pietrucha In the meantime, the B-52 has gotten a little bit more versatile and a whole hell of a lot more threatening to adversary’s vessels. Just knowing that the 60-year-old bombers could shutdown waterways within 40 to 50 miles of either side of their flight path at any given time will help make America’s enemy’s think twice about their maritime actions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2018",Lockheed Martin Is Crafting New Stealth and Drone Tanker Concepts For The USAF,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy may have passed over Lockheed Martin’s submission for its MQ-25 Stingray drone tanker program, but the company is still looking to make its mark in the aerial refueling sector with the U.S. Air Force’s KC-Z tanker project. The firm’s legendary Skunk Works special projects office is crafting various proposals, including stealthy hybrid wing body and flying wing designs, as well as a concept based around a fleet of smaller unmanned aircraft. The Maryland-headquartered contractor prominently displayed a model of one Advanced Tanker Concept, the hybrid wing type, below artwork depicting a different aircraft concept in action paired with the text “Rapid Global Mobility,” at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber conference earlier in September 2018. Lockheed Martin first unveiled this particular design concept in 2016, which was itself an outgrowth of earlier work the company had done as part of the joint Air Force-NASA Speed Agile project . On the show floor, a representative from Skunk Works told The War Zone that the goal was to provide the Air Force with a set of tiered options as the service continues to iron out its requirements for the future KC-Z . They added that the USAF had not yet indicated to them what type of aircraft or operating concept it might be leaning toward at present. That being said, earlier in 2018, the Air Force Research Laboratory showed off its own model of a stealth tanker concept with the title “ Advanced Aerial Refueling .” Stealthy or low-observable features that reduce the aircraft’s radar and infrared signatures will be core components of any final design. Traditional airliner-based tankers, such as the Air Force’s forthcoming Boeing KC-46A Pegasus , will only become more vulnerable to steadily improving ground-based air defenses , advanced combat aircraft , and associated radars and sensors , as time goes on. At the same time, U.S. military combat aircraft, especially fuel-hungry stealth combat jets that cannot carry typical range-extending external drop tanks without losing their low-observable edge, are going to continue needing tanker support in these high-risk areas. The War Zone made a detailed case for this exact capability on multiple occasions in the past, which you can read in full here and here . A model of Lockheed Martin’s hybrid wing body KC-Z concept., Joseph Trevithick The Air Force intends to fill this emerging stealth tanker gap with KC-Z, but it remains to be seen what else it might expect these aircraft to do. The Skunk Works representative said that those secondary requirements may be among the biggest drivers in the in the configuration of the final design. The Advanced Tanker Concept model that Lockheed Martin has publicly shown features a conventional wing-and-tail configuration with hybrid wing body planform . This is specifically to provide the internal space and allow for other features, such as rear loading ramp, necessary for the notional aircraft to adequately fill the “C” role, or cargo carrying function, in KC-Z. Another view of Lockheed Martin’s KC-Z model., Joseph Trevithick Though it doesn’t get nearly as much attention as the tanking aspect, the Air Force’s existing KC-135s and KC-10s, as well as the new KC-46A, are all set up to move cargo and personnel as necessary and do so routinely. If the Air Force were to replace any significant portion of them with an aircraft that cannot perform this mission, the service could find itself creating a new gap in logistical capabilities. If the Air Force did decide to turn KC-Z, at least in part, into simply K-Z, Lockheed Martin says a flying wing design could be more efficient and potentially stealthier. Though the company did not bring a model of this concept to the Air Force Association gathering, the representative from Skunk Works described it as akin to a scaled up version of the firm’s pitch for the Navy’s MQ-25 competition. KC-Z requirements that allow for a flying wing design could open the door to a submission from Northrop Grumman, as well, which could leverage its extensive experience in this arena and continuing work on the B-21 stealth bomber to create a “KB-21” tanker derivative. The Air Force actually investigated what it might take to transform the B-2 stealth bomber , another Northrop Grumman product, into an aerial refueling platform, though it decided not to pursue that plan and has never made details about that study public. “Imagine MQ-25 with that [improved stealthy] signature ability and perhaps longer legs,” Jack O’Banion, Vice President of Strategy at Skunk Works told Aviation Week in a separate interview. “Most tankers carry fuel in the wing to distribute the weight of the fuel with the lift of the wing, and since that is what the majority of the payload is, we’re doing an all-wing design,” John Vinson, who had led Lockheed’s Stingray program, had told this same outlet when talking about the Stingray back in March 2018 . With an eye toward joint operations and cooperating with foreign allies, O’Banion also told Aviation Week that Lockheed Martin was exploring ways to hybridize the actual aerial refueling equipment on any future tanker to allow a single system to provide fuel regardless of the configuration of the receiving aircraft. At present, the Air Force primarily uses the “boom” method of aerial refueling, which involves the tanker sticking a probe into another aircraft. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, as well as many of American’s foreign partners, favor the “probe-and-drogue” system , which is also common for helicopters and tilt-rotors, where the receiving aircraft has a probe that the pilot guides into a basket on the end of a fuel link trailing behind the tanker. A tanker with some sort of common system would be able to eliminate the extra weight and bulk of having to carry, or at least being able to carry, the equipment necessary to support both refueling methods. But Lockheed Martin is also prepared for the Air Force to go in an entirely different direction with regards to aerial refueling. This could involve a distributed tanking scenario in which KC-46As operating outside the range of enemy air defenses dispense fuel into stealthy KC-Zs, which then fly back into high-risk areas to refuel other aircraft, according to Aviation Week . An overview of the key features and capabilities of the Boeing KC-46A, including its ability to support aircraft with both the boom and probe-and-drogue refueling method and its cargo and passenger carrying configurations., Boeing The Skunk Works representative at the Air Force Association conference told The War Zone that the company was already exploring the possibility of using larger numbers of smaller unmanned aircraft, similar in size and configuration to its MQ-25 proposal, to perform the tanking mission in high-risk areas. This distributed model could also force a major conventional opponent, such as Russia or China , to devote more resources to hunt down all of the smaller tankers and make it more difficult for them to locate them in the first place. “They’re [the Chinese] trying to find out where are there integrating nodes in our force structure that they can attack, whether it’s the overhead [satellites], or [E-3] AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control Systems] or [E-8C] JSTARS [Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Systems] or tankers,” O’Banion explained to Aviation Week . “One of the easiest ways to defeat that strategy is dispersement, so if I can disperse the fuel … it’s harder to defeat the ability to fuel my assets and stay in the fight.” With all this in mind, the Air Force might eventually settle on a multi-part KC-Z concept that includes both larger, stealthy manned, or even pilot-optional, aerial refuelers and smaller tanker drones. These planes would then likely work together with existing, non-stealthy designs. Concept art showing Lockheed Martin’s MQ-25 proposal. The company could potentially repurpose this design and propose it to the Air Force as part of a distributed concept of operations for KC-Z., Lockheed Martin The Air Force already uses “stacked” tanking concepts, especially during special operations missions , with larger KC-135s and KC-10s refueling smaller C-130-based tankers , which then link up with tilt-rotors, helicopters, or other smaller aircraft. Lockheed Martin’s concept art notably shows its Advanced Tanker refueling an HC-130J Combat King II rescue aircraft and tanker, which typically work with HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters. How the Air Force plans to perform combat search and rescue in denied areas is another area of growing concern and HC-130Js and HH-60Gs would simply not be able to operate in highly contested environments. It isn’t hard to imagine a KC-Z tanker supporting any future stealthy rescue aircraft, though. There will be an increasing demand for low-observable transports , too. “We wanted to make sure that we were materially communicating to [Air Mobility Command] that full range of possibilities,” Skunk Works’ O’Banion noted to Aviation Week . “And then as AMC considers which track they want to head down they’ve got a position that maximizes their level of understanding.” Whatever design or designs the Air Force eventually decides it wants for its KC-Z program, it’s clear that the service is well aware of the increasing vulnerability of traditional tankers. With Lockheed Martin already crafting various concepts, and its competitors, especially Boeing and Northrop Grumman, almost certainly doing the same, its aerial refueling fleet looks set to transform significantly in the years to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 17, 2019","Stealth Pushes Forward: B-2s Refuel On Wake Island, F-22s Fly From Austere Base In Mideast","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the USAF comes to terms with the realities of what a peer state conflict would look like and just how vulnerable its sprawling, well-established bases are, the flying force is taking its most capable but also most finicky aircraft and challenging them to operate from less developed locations. This is part of a larger Air Force initiative that aims to make combat units able to deploy on very short notice to locales where bases really don’t exist at all and will have to be built quickly from the ground up. Just in the last week, F-22s from Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE packed what they could in a single KC-10 Extender and flew to an austere field far closer to the Syrian conflict. Meanwhile, B-2s that are temporarily forward deployed to Hawaii used remote Wake Island as a pitstop during combat training operations. Spirits On Wake The B-2s are currently on rotation to Hawaii as part of the U.S. Strategic Command’s Bomber Task Force. It’s the first deployment of B-2s to the island ever—B-2s have only stopped over briefly before—with a handful of the stealth bombers calling Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam home on the island of Oahu for a number of months. B-2s arriving in Hawaii on August 15th, 2018., USAF The B-2’s training sorties can see them fly to distant locales in the Pacific region and operating with various allied assets, but on September 14th, 2018 the B-2s made their way to America’s remote airfield outpost on Wake Island. Wake Island and its main ramp area. , Google Earth The island was made famous during WWII, but today it is dominated by a relatively large airfield that has extensive dispersal areas that can accommodate the largest aircraft in the USAF’s inventory. Although it sees fighters being dragged across the Pacific by tankers, as well as military transports and occasional airliners making emergency landings, this seems to be the first time a B-2 has set down there. USAF Traditionally, the B-2s are locked into operating out of just four airfields—their home base in Whiteman AFB in Missouri, Andersen AFB on Guam, Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom. At Fairford and Diego Garcia, large clamshell retractable shelters have been installed specifically to provide a place to keep the stealth bomber’s sensitive skin out of the elements. The other bases have large hangars that the B-2s can use if need be. So opening up operations at Hickam AFB in Hawaii—which is co-located with Honolulu International Airport—is certainly a departure from the norm, as is landing on austere Wake Island—which is 2,300 miles from any form of robust support infrastructure. In the past, B-2s have bombed targets on Pohakuloa Training Area in Hawaii, but they flew from Guam to do it USAF The method used for this operation was ‘hot pitting’ which means keeping the engines running while the aircraft is refueled by ground crews. The tactic is used for everything from increasing training sortie rates to rapidly refueling and rearming combat aircraft at forward operating locations near enemy lines during a time of war to get them back in the fight faster. For a plane as complex as the B-2, not shutting down the aircraft during refueling can work as a big helping of extra insurance that it will not break before getting back into the air. Lt. Col. Nicholas Adcock, Air Force Global Strike 393rd Bomber Squadron commanding officer, described the tactic and the reason for making the pitstop at Wake Island in a USAF release: “Hot-pit refueling allows us to maximize time in the air versus on the ground… It saves turnaround time. Practicing this technique helps us ensure our effectiveness as a force and keeps us ready, capable and lethal. This deployment [and training] shows that the B-2 stealth bomber force can do more than operate from Whiteman Air Force Base… It shows that we’re adaptable enough to fly and strike from at home or abroad.” USAF Wake Island, which serves as something of middle-point between Guam and Hawaii, is incredibly significant strategically. During a crisis in Pacific Theater, especially one with China, the island’s 9,800-foot runway, ample fuel reserves, and large dispersal area would act as a refuge for aircraft forward based in Japan and elsewhere from barrages of ballistic and cruise missiles. Even Guam is at risk from high-volume ballistic missile attacks. With tanker support stretched very, B-2s could find themselves using the remote outpost for refueling as they transit between Hawaii and their targets far to the west. With all this in mind, it makes great sense that B-2 crews would become familiar with operating from Wake Island. But above all else, this operation shows how even the finicky B-2 Spirit, of which only 20 exist, are getting in on the dispersed operational doctrine that the USAF has said it will begin focusing to a far greater extent than in the past. Raptor On The Road Two days prior to the B-2’s visit to Wake Island, F-22s assigned to the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE forward deployed a handful of F-22s to an ‘undisclosed location’ in the Middle East (which is really no mystery and can be discovered in a matter of minutes with the help of Google Earth). The F-22 team accomplished this by taking just what they could fit in a KC-10, with the tankers also working as a personnel transport and refueling platform for the trip. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hl6_8UsLW8U This exercise was an operational, streamlined version of the Rapid Raptor concept that the F-22 community has evolved over the last half-decade. Rapid Raptor is a quick deployment capability that aims to see four F-22s deploy virtually anywhere in the world with just 72 hours notice. Locales can include very austere locations with minimal permanent support infrastructure. In the case of this ‘combat agility’ exercise, the F-22s and their support personnel only had what they could pack in a KC-10 to sustain themselves. During their stay at the ‘undisclosed location,’ the F-22s flew combat air patrols over Syria, which also adds another realistic facet to such an operation. F-22s at the ‘undisclosed location’ in the Middle East., USAF It’s exciting not only to see America’s most capable combat aircraft expanding their operational portfolio, but also that the USAF is really coming to terms with just how vulnerable their big bases are in pretty much every major flashpoint region on the planet. We have already gone into great detail as to why being able to quickly distribute air power throughout a theater is so tactically important beyond survivability concerns—and clearly, stealth aircraft aren’t stealthy or uniquely survivable at all while sitting on the ground at a huge base—but being able to do so can also help alleviate logistical hurdles as well, like lack of tanker support. With all this in mind, there can be little doubt that we will be seeing stealth aircraft pop-up at less than established or pristine operating locations far more regularly in the very near future and periphery logistical bases like Wake Island will begin to emerge at forefront of America’s air combat doctrine going forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",SpaceX Exec Says Company Would Launch A Weapon Into Space In ‘Defense Of This Country’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As it looks to pave the way for a new Space Force , the Pentagon is also reexamining the possibility of putting weapons, especially anti-missile systems , into orbit. But the U.S. military will need help getting them there and private space launch firm SpaceX says it could do the heavy lifting if asked. On Sept. 17, 2018, SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell took the stage at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber conference to tout the company’s space launch capabilities. She also promoted the firm’s growing relationship with the Air Force , which is presently responsible for procuring the bulk of the U.S. military’s satellites and launch services, and took questions from the audience about the ever-growing importance of space to military operations. “Would SpaceX launch military weapons?” someone asked. “I’ve never been asked that question,” Shotwell said. “If it’s for the defense of this country, yes, I think we would.” It’s not surprising Shotwell hasn’t considered this issue. The U.S. government largely brought serious discussions of space-based weapons to a halt in 1993, when President Bill Clinton’s administration brought the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to an end and shifted focus entirely to terrestrial missile defense systems . By treaty , the United States is barred from placing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction into orbit, as well, though it has stymied efforts to expand those restrictions to cover conventional weapons. At least officially, the U.S. government’s position is that the newer proposed agreements do not do enough to prevent countries from development ostensibly peaceful systems that could double as weapons. A particular point of contention is the matter of small, highly maneuverable space-based “ inspectors ,” which primarily exist to examine and potentially repair other satellites, but could also disable, damage, or destroy an opponent’s satellites. Whether or not this is the real reason the United States has opposed new space-based weapons treaties has come into question recently after Congress inserted language into the annual defense policy bill cover the 2019 fiscal year that orders the U.S. military to start development of orbital anti-missile systems. The provisions express a hope that the Missile Defense Agency-led effort will have a workable prototype or prototypes by 2022 – less than four years from now. An artist’s conception of a “ brilliant pebble ” space-based kinetic missile interceptor inside its “life jacket” satellite. This was one of the concepts the United States developed as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory So, it also means that SpaceX, among others , will have to grapple with questions about whether it will be willing to support these efforts. The company has already been working with the U.S. military for years, but has only used its novel low-cost Falcon 9 rockets, which each feature a reusable booster that lands back on Earth after launch, to put payloads into orbit that fill non-kinetic military roles, such navigation , and intelligence gathering . But while Shotwell’s comments elicited applause from uniformed and civilian members of the U.S. military, defense contractors, and others in attendance at the Air Force Association conference, for her apparent patriotism, she smartly inserted a very diplomatic caveat into her answer. “I think” is in no way a guarantee that SpaceX would agree to launch an armed satellite into orbit in the coming years. Shotwell is almost certainly aware of the potential problems for the company’s carefully managed public image and internal culture that could come from helping place weapons in space. Participation in an “offensive” military project recently caused significant trouble for Google internally. In June 2018, Google’s cloud computing arm announced it would not look to renew its contract with the Department of Defense for a program known as Project Maven . This effort seeks to use artificial intelligence algorithms to rapidly sift through mountains of intelligence imagery and quickly identify items of potential interest. The goal is to speed up how quickly analysts can pore over the pictures to aid in locating terrorists or militants and the planning of subsequent strikes against those targets. As it turned out, a group of employees had led a mutiny within the company, objecting on moral grounds to the work on Project Maven. Despite the lucrative nature of the deal, the multi-billion dollar company apparently decided that anything remotely related to “ drone strikes ” cast too negative a pall over the company’s public image as a whole. The decision sent a ripple through other parts of the tech industry. A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone carrying the Gorgon Stare wide-area persistent surveillance system. Sensors suites such as Gorgon Stare have enabled the US military to collect more intelligence imagery than it can reasonably analyze manually., USAF SpaceX has gone to great lengths to cultivate a similar “ hip ” image and has been heavily promoting its space travel and tourism plans . On the same day Shotwell made her comments at the Air Force Association conference, the company’s founder and CEO Elon Musk announced plans to launch Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa on a first-of-its-kind trip around the moon aboard one of the companies Big Fucking Rockets, or BFRs, as early as 2023. Musk is hopeful that these spacecraft, or derivatives thereof, will enable humans to eventually travel to Mars . At the same time, SpaceX’s lucrative contracts with the Air Force have been important to the company’s growth and expansion. The two parties are forming an ever more inseparable bond, which Congress has now in many ways enshrined into law by requiring the U.S. military to at least consider using lower-cost reusable booster rockets for any future space launches. An artist’s concept of a musician entertaining tourists aboard a BFR during a trip around the moon., SpaceX SpaceX already dominates that market with its Falcon 9 and tested its larger Falcon Heavy design for the first time in February 2018. The latter type will be able to launch significantly bigger payloads than the Falcon 9 thanks to its three reusable boosters. In June 2018, the company won its first ever contract to launch a payload with the Falcon Heavy – a $130 million deal with the Air Force . With the U.S. military pushing hard to expand and improve its space-based capabilities in the face of growing threats including anti-satellite weapons , jamming , and signal spoofing , the demand for space launch services is going to explode in the coming years. SpaceX has positioned itself to be at the forefront of that boom, but competitors are growing in number and in the variety of capabilities they offer. If the California-headquartered company won’t take a particular mission, there will surely be others lining up to take their place. In addition, if the Air Force decides to hire SpaceX for standing launch services over a specified time frame, the company might have to launch a space-based weapon system or risk violating the terms of that deal. A demand to include a provision allowing the firm to refuse to launch an armed satellite might be a deal breaker. Space-based weapons with a purely defensive role, such as missile defense, might be an easier sell for SpaceX’s stakeholders. Unlike Elon Musk’s automotive venture, Tesla , the company isn’t publicly traded, either, which might better insulate it from any public protests regardless. “We would like to put large cargo on the surface of the moon by 2022. And we have our eyes on the prize to send people to Mars in 2024,” Shotwell said during her speech at the Air Force Association conference. “Imagine what we could do for the defense of the United States.” If the Pentagon’s space-based weapons plans become a reality, SpaceX’s president may soon need to give a more definitive answer on whether or not what the company can do – or is willing to – includes empowering the U.S. government to conduct kinetic military operations from outside the Earth’s atmosphere.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scaled Composites’ optionally manned H03 Firebird surveillance plane has captured our imaginations since we first posted detailed single aspect images of its intriguing tail configuration last April. Since then, we reported that it had taken to the skies and had images to prove it. You can read everything we know about this highly unique aircraft and its interesting lineage in both of those past posts linked here and here . Now we have the clearest images yet of this supposed production-ready Firebird and its sensor suite, taken at Mojave Air And Space Port by our good friend and regular contributor Matt Hartman of Shorealonefilms.com . Here are those shots and some captions about what we can see in them: Once again, Scaled Composites ground crews are wearing logo gear associated with the aircraft they are supporting. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The wingspan of the H03 is really impressive, a necessity for very long-endurance loitering operations up at altitudes where jet airliners fly. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Note the small round fixtures above the aircraft’s LED landing light and on its horizontal tailplane. These are very likely cameras that would be used for unmanned operations. The cockpit area of the Firebird can be replaced with a high-bandwidth satellite communications system covered by an opaque fairing. This image also gives us a good look at the beyond-line-of-sight UHF satcom antenna installed on the lefthand sponson., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The cone-like fairings under the nose and above the right tail are line-of-sight data-link antennas that can send the intelligence the H03 collects directly to ground stations for exploitation. They can also be used for command and control of the vehicle during line-of-sight unmanned operations., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Here is by far our best view of Firebird’s primary sensor as it is configured now, the FLIR systems Star SAFIRE 380. The sensor ball is a highly capable and features HD multi-spectral imaging as well as laser capabilities. Most important is that it has a 120X zoom that would be very useful considering the altitudes Firebird operates at. It also features a fairly wide field of view of 30 degrees at the short end just .25 degrees at the short end. The latest versions can also fuse multi-spectral imagery together in real time. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Here is a sample of just how incredible this sensor system is: Here we see the engine configuration, with its big twin air scoops. Supposedly Firebird uses a turbocharged Lycoming TEO-540E, but this could have changed. There was also mention of it having the option of running a heavy fuel engine as well. The FAA lists the aircraft’s engine as AMA/Experimental., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The up-turned dihedral of Firebird’s wings may have an aerodynamic advantage but the configuration also improves line-of-sight of its sensor turret during banks. Considering the aircraft could loiter over a localized area for a long period of time this is quite important. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Note the other antennas arrayed neatly atop Firebird’s spine and the aircraft still carries a flight test data probe. Overall the fit and finish on this aircraft is very impressive. It does look very much like a production-ready design, something that is a bit unique for Scaled Composites. Supposedly a customer does exist and eventually, this aircraft, along with a number of others, will end up in their hands. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The images are certainly interesting, but this video of Firebird taxiing is even more so just for the audio alone: Firebird is meant to be quiet due to its spy/surveillance mission set. Trying to get the drop on some bad guys while droning overhead like a buzz saw sort of defeats the point. Its five-bladed prop helps with its audible signature but clearly, other measures have been taken to make it as silent as possible. As the H03’s testing commences hopefully Scaled Composites will tell us a little bit more about the aircraft and even possibly who is slated to take ownership of it. Its unique and highly flexible feature set seems as if it would be really attractive, especially to export customers who can’t afford all different types of manned and unmanned aerial surveillance assets. Just being able to easily forward-deploy the H03 to new locales with a pilot at the controls is a huge advantage over strictly unmanned medium altitude long endurance platforms. Other high-altitude, prop-driven surveillance aircraft do exist and remain in demand , but none are built to be optionally manned. We also know that the EO/IR sensor ball is just the start of the aircraft’s payload capabilities and it’s designed to carry many types of systems, including radars, electronic intelligence suites, air sampling gear, and possibly even weapons. Seeing that Scaled Composites is owned by Northrop Grumman, its parent company may now have a product to offer that nobody can really compete directly with. We will keep you in the loop as to any new developments with this truly intriguing aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is no secret that China is speeding ahead with hypersonic weapons development. Now a video has appeared that seems to show hypersonic glide vehicles being lifted aloft by a sounding balloon for high-altitude drop tests. You can read all about hypersonic weapons and why they are such a big deal in this past explainer of ours. We can’t confirm with absolute certainty if this is in fact the case, but those wedge-shaped payloads look nearly identical to hypersonic vehicle shapes we have seen China working on in the past. In addition, using a high-altitude balloon as a platform to launch glide tests of different hypersonc boost glide vehicle configurations seems like an incredibly logical and efficient process for gathering important real-world testing data. The basic concept behind hypersonic boost glide vehicles. , DARPA I came across the video on Twitter, it was posted by @Defengchao who always has fantastic content to share on Chinese military activities. Check it out in full below. It looks like the balloon’s payload adapter is carrying three glide vehicles, two of which are very similar with the third being clearly a different design. In fact, they appear to closely match the two designs that we have seen pictures of (also shown in this article below). China is surprisingly open about sharing some advanced research and development of concepts with direct military applications by its academic institutions, but is far more guarded about capabilities directly in development for operational use by the Chinese military itself. So the video isn’t as surprising as it may seem. Also remember, China only shows us what they want to, so this shouldn’t act as an indicator of where they are with this technology developmentally speaking. A photo of one of China’s hypersonic boost glide vehicle designs in wind tunnel testing. You can read more about this revelation here . , Chinese Internet Another configuration China is supposedly testing. , Chinese Internet We also have no clue when this video was actually shot. China is known to have the WU-14 hypersonic boost glide vehicle (also known as the DF-ZF) deep in development at this time with an operational fielding date thought to be some time in the next couple years or so. If anything else, this is just another reminder that a great hypersonic arms race is indeed underway, with the U.S. , China, and Russia all rushing to usher ultra high-speed weapons concepts into an operational state. And with every new measure, countermeasures are certain to emerge. These weapons are no different. The U.S. is already moving to develop defenses to repel them and its competitors aren’t likely to rest on their laurels either.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 8, 2019",U.S. OKs Canada’s Purchase Of 25 Second-Hand Australian F/A-18 Hornets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada’s deal to purchase 25 used F/A-18A/B Hornets from Australia has received approval from the U.S. federal government. The acquisition is seen as essential by the Canadian Ministry of Defense as the roughly 75 CF-18 Hornets it has in service currently are in the twilight of the lifespans and will need major upgrades just to make through another decade of operations. The fleet is also becoming harder to support and it’s not like the world is getting any friendlier. The rise of a far more belligerent Russia that has taken a heavy interest in the Arctic is especially concerning. The relations between leadership at the highest levels of the U.S. and Canadian governments have devolved in recent months due to a frosty relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau and an unsolved trade dispute between the two historically chummy neighbors. This, combined with Canada walking away from its original Super Hornet interim purchase due to yet another trade dispute and the possibility that the Trudeau’s administration could put U.S. entrants into Canada’s upcoming next-generation fighter competition at a serious disadvantage led many to believe the Trump administration would work to hold up the deal. With the required third party approval in hand, Canada and Australia look to close the deal by the end of the year, according to the National Post . If everything goes as planned, the first pair of jets would arrive in Canada in the Summer of 2019, with the rest following shortly thereafter. How they would be transported across the Pacific is still being decided. Of the 25 jets being purchased, seven will be stripped and used as spares donors or for testing. The remaining 18 will go into service with the RCAF’s 3 Wing at Bagotville and with the 4 Wing at Cold Lake, the latter of which is the home of RCAF’s Hornet schoolhouse. As for Australia, their legacy Hornets will be drawn down rather quickly as the F-35 comes online. We described this process as such in a previous article : Australia originally ordered 57 F/A-18As and 18 F/A-18Bs, for a total of 75 airframes, in 1981. The vast majority of the jets were assembled in Australia. 71 are still flying today, which is pretty amazing in itself and a testament to the maintainers and pilots who worked with the fleet over the years. Australia’s Hornets are also close to the same block and age as Canada’s jets and have received similar upgrades throughout the years. The plan is for the Australian Hornet fleet to be divested as a near equal number of F-35As—72 at this time but that number could grow—come online. The process that should be completed by 2023 with an initial operating capability (IOC) slated for 2020. CPL David Cotton—© Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The ex-Australian jets will be flown without the structural upgrade that their CF-18 counterparts will receive, which would limit their service life but hopefully give Canada enough extra fighter capacity until the first of its next-generation fighters are delivered around 2025. Ottowa hopes to receive 88 of the new jets by roughly 2030, at which time the Hornet fleet will truly be on its last leg. The Canadian Ministry of Defense has stated that the fleet could make it to 2032 with upgrades, but no farther. It’s possible that the Australian Hornets could get the structural upgrade as well if the next generation fighter procurement timeline moves to the right. Beyond structural enhancements needed to keep the 40-year-old fighters flying, combat capability upgrades will also likely be needed. The USMC, which is facing similar age-related issues with its own worn-down Hornet fleet, will have its Hornet cadre boosted by younger jets that will be leaving U.S. Navy service under the new NAVAIR fighter roadmap . The Marines are also going to upgrade the best 98 F/A-18Cs in the fleet with AESA radars which will give the aircraft a massive capability boost. Other smaller upgrades are in the works as well. Canada could, or really should, do the same with their Hornets, which would allow them to take full advantage of the AIM-120D air-to-air missile that has already been approved for export to the country. Canada’s relatively small fleet of Hornets has been taxed hard over its lifetime, including extensive combat operations in Europe and the Middle East. , USAF It’s also possible that Canada could purchase more surplus Aussie Hornets even just for spares. Once they begin being retired en masse from RAAF flightlines, Canberra may be more motivated to unload them. Supposedly Canada has set aside $500M for the interim second-hand Hornet purchase. We have no clue what terms have already been agreed upon, but there could be additional money left over for extra airframes once the initial 25 make their way to North America. We will continue to keep you up to date as the deal progresses.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Brand New ‘Beast’ Presidential Limousine Emerges During Trump’s Visit To NYC,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been waiting for a new presidential limousine, also known lovingly as the Beast due to its heavy armor and high stance, for years now. The last major iteration of POTUS’s chariot was introduced way back during Obama’s inauguration in 2009. Since then, there has been constant talk that a new model would emerge at various events over the years. Now that time has finally come, with the new super-sized Caddy making its debut appearance at the Wall Street Heliport in downtown Manhattan on Sunday, September 23th, 2018. The Beast is the heart of the presidential motorcade, the anatomy of which you can read all about in this past feature of mine , and like any vehicle, the presidential limousines do wear out. But before being fully retired, they usually funnel down to working as VVIP vehicles for subjects with lower threat profiles, like visiting dignitaries or even the Vice President, before eventually being pulled from service. VP Biden was still using the first iteration of the ‘DTS’ style presidential limousine in 2013. It looks like a simply quaint affair compared to the Beast we know today and this new version of it that just appeared. , AP Over the last decade, up-armored Suburban’s have increasingly taken up this slack, putting less pressure on the older limousines that once served in the Secret Service’s presidential fleet and on the presidential limousine pool itself. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ka69wK3UeMY This new Beast was known to be in the final stages of testing when images of it draped in camouflage fabric to hide its true appearance popped up last April. The vehicle was the first publically viewable result of a $15.8M contract awarded to General Motors in 2014 for “Next Generation Parade Limousine Phase 2 and 3.” Fox News queried GM and the Secret Service about the limousine in testing and they responded, stating: “We’ve completed our task and we’ve handed over the vehicle to the customer,” Cadillac President Johann de Nysschen told Fox News. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Secret Service added that “the program to build and deploy the next generation of Presidential limousines is on track and on schedule — both in terms of vendor production and internal Secret Service post production requirements. The public can expect to see the new vehicles put into operational use late summer of this year.” It looks like they nailed that goal. https://youtube.com/watch?v=AWI14HZGnWY Even though the presidential limo has stayed the same for nearly the decade, we have seen other major changes and upgrades to the presidential motorcade, including this even beastlier communications and command and control truck that brings up the rear guard of the procession. Meanwhile other heads of state have upgraded their own limousines in recent months. Most notably, Vladimir Putin finally got an indigenously developed beast of his own, giving up the armored Mercedes limousines he had used exclusively in the past. That car debuted during Putin’s inauguration last May. Chinese President Xi Jinping also received a new , indigenously developed limo, with that vehicle appearing during his trip to Africa just last month. Putin’s new executive limousine. , AP But above any foreign executive limousine, the Beast is truly an icon and has fascinated automotive enthusiasts the world over. Even Kim Jong Un, who is known to have a high interest in transportation vehicles of all types, was given a special look of the Beast while meeting Trump in Singapore back in June. The ruler of North Korea has used a small fleet of Mercedes Pullman Guard limos that date back the better part of a decade. The new presidential limo carries over some of the aesthetic design elements of Cadillac’s flagship CT6 sedan, but that’s where the similarities end. The exact capabilities of the presidential limousine are classified, but we do know some of its features. These include heavy armor of various types and layers that can repel direct attacks and a mine-resistant, ambush protected hull design which gives the vehicle its tall silhouette. A highly tuned suspension allows for this driving fortress to be still nimble and self assured enough on the road to allow Secret Service drivers to execute complex escape and evasion maneuvers , like J turns, in relatively tight spaces. Remember, the vehicle and its crew’s mission is not to take on an attacking force, but to evade and/or escape from one. A fire suppression system assures that even in the worst of wrecks, the occupants won’t burn alive inside the armored cocoon. Kevlar reinforced run-flat tires ensure the limo can keep rolling to safety even after taking multiple direct hits. The Beast is based on a highly reinforced and armored truck frame, not a car frame, and is equipped with heavy running gear that can handle its immense weight. The cabin is sealed from the outside world and a military-grade environmental system allows for protection in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) warfare environments. A night vision driving system is also included and a communications suite that links into the motorcade’s rolling highly-secure wireless network. Bags of blood that match Trump’s type are kept refrigerated inside the vehicle in case of an emergency where the motorcade’s ambulance cannot gain access to the president. The Beast’s defensive measures are kept very hush-hush but some many have stated they include the ability to deploy smokescreens, oil slicks, disperse teargas, and even send electrical charges through the car’s door handles. As a last line of defense, Secret Service agents inside the vehicle are ready and able to defend it with small arms. As I have noted in the past, the Presidential motorcade is both the most threatened place to be on the road and the safest, depending on how you look at it. But this new Beast should only improve the President’s odds of survival should a complex attack occur. At the same time, it’s worth remembering that no vehicle can protect the president alone. The presidential limo has become increasingly heavily armored and militarized as the years go by. This shot taken inside Reagan’s limo in 1984 shows an interior that doesn’t look much different than what you would find in a normal limousine of the era. , Reagan Presidential Library A sprawling ecosystem that includes elaborate pre-planning, training, intelligence gathering, engagement with local law enforcement and aviation assets, route clearing, and the motorcade workings seamlessly as an integrated package are what makes each journey as success. The same can be said for when the President attends higher risk events or travels to any location for that matter. It is a very complex, exhaustive, and expensive ballet that doesn’t really get recognized unless something goes wrong, and it rarely does—a testament to the dedication and skills of all involved. What do you think of the Beast’s new look? Let us know in the comments below. UPDATE: 6:45pm PST— Another angle from Dan Scavino aboard Marine One.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 3, 2018",Giving Syria S-300 Surface To Air Missile Systems Won’t Halt Israeli Strikes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it will supply Syria with S-300 surface-to-air missile systems , will jam the radar, navigation, and communications systems on any aircraft attacking targets in that country via the Mediterranean Sea, and will also provide equipment to the regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad to rapidly identify Russian military aircraft. This all follows an embarrassing incident where Syrian forces accidentally shot down one of the Kremlin’s Il-20 Coot surveillance aircraft following an Israeli air strike. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the announcements in a recorded statement in Moscow on Sept. 24, 2018. He had previously said that there would be a response to the shootdown, which occurred on Sept. 18, 2018. Russia had acknowledged the incident was Syria’s fault and was unintentional, but also blamed the loss of the Il-20 and its 14-person crew on how, where, and when Israel decided to strike. In addition, The Kremlin claimed that Israeli officials did not give enough advance warning of the mission via an established deconfliction hotline. “I will underscore – at the request of the Israeli side, in 2013 we suspended the delivery of S-300 systems that were ready for the dispatch, while the Syrian military had undergone training,” Shoigu said . “Now the situation has changed, and we are not to blame.” At a second press briefing on Sept. 24, 2018, seen below and unfortunately only available in Russian, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov outlined Russia’s official timeline of the incident together with tracks reportedly from the radars associated with their own S-400 surface-to-air missile systems in the country showing the aircraft involved. Russia continues to insist that Israel only gave them “seconds” of advance warning via the hotline and that the relative position of Israeli F-16s to the Il-20 was directly responsible for the outcome of the incident. Initially, the Kremlin went so far as to claim that Israel’s jet’s deliberately shadowed the Coot in an attempt to avoid detection ahead of their attack. So far, Israel has not given its own statement on the exact amount of advance notice it gave the Kremlin ahead of its strikes on Sept. 18, 2018. The country does deny its planes were even still in the area when Syrians brought down the Coot and sent Israeli Air Force Major General Amikam Norkin, along with a small delegation, to Moscow in part to brief the Russians on this point. Whatever the exact details of the inciting incident, long-range S-300s would offer a significant boost to Syrian air defense forces, which rely primarily on older Soviet-era long-range surface-to-air missile system, as well as a variety of old and more modern medium- and short-range Russian-made designs. One of Syria’s SA-5s , also known as the S-200, a long-range system that first entered service in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s, was reportedly responsible for bringing down the Coot. In addition, “Russia will jam satellite navigation, onboard radars and communication systems of combat aircraft, which attack targets in the Syrian territory, in the regions over the waters of the Mediterranean Sea bordering with Syria,” Shoigu declared . “We are convinced that the implementation of these measures will cool hotheads and prevent ill-considered actions threatening our servicemen. Otherwise, we will have to respond in line with the current situation.” Transporter-erector-launchers belonging to the S-300 surface-to-air missile system in their deployed configuration., Uliana Solovyova/Sputnik via AP “Command posts of the Syrian troops and military air defense units will be equipped with automatic control system, which have been supplied only to the Russian Armed Forces,” Shoigu also noted. “This will ensure the centralized management of all Syrian air defense forces and facilities, monitoring of the situation in the airspace and prompt target designation. Most importantly, it will ensure identification of all Russian aircraft by the Syrian air defense forces.” Shoigu’s remarks are significant and worth taking seriously. The delivery of S-300s to Assad’s regime would be a “ significant escalation ” of the situation in Syria, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said at a press conference to mark the beginning of the annual U.N. Nations General Assembly gathering in New York on Sept. 24, 2018. He added that he hoped Russia would reconsider. “[Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu said that transferring advanced weapons systems into irresponsible hands will increase the dangers in the region, and added that Israel will continue to defend its security and its interests,” in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to an official Israel government statement. Putin, who had earlier downplayed the seriousness of the Il-20 shoot down, said the plan was “compliant with [the] current situation and aimed at eliminating any potential threat to life of Russian servicemen,” according to a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry. However, this is not the first time Russia has threatened to give Assad S-300s. After the massive U.S., U.K., and French cruise missile barrage against various targets in Syria in April 2018, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that his country would reconsider a long-stalled sale of the surface-to-air missile systems to the Syrian regime. There were rumors later that month , and again in May 2018 , that the Kremlin had made good on this threat, but there has not been any evidence to substantiate those claims. Russia has its own S-300s in Syria. In addition, Shoigu was very careful to stress that Russia would only jam aircraft that appeared to be inbound for attacks on areas of Syria that are situated along or near the country’s Mediterranean coastline, which just so happens to be where the Kremlin’s Khmeimim air base and Tartus naval base are located. Israel has conducted hundreds of air and missile strikes in Syria since the country’s civil war began and routinely sends aircraft across Lebanon , where they then release standoff weapons and often never actually enter Syrian airspace. In the U.S.-led operation in April 2018, in addition to strikes originating from the Mediterranean, American aircraft also flew into Syria via Jordan, and U.S. Navy ships launched cruise missiles from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. There are also steady reports that Russian forces have been jamming U.S. military manned and unmanned aircraft in Eastern Syria, but we don’t know how much of an impact that has actually had on American-led operations. If the Russians did follow through in this case with the S-300 deliveries, we still don’t know how many full systems Syria might receive, or of what generation, and how broad an area they might be able to defend. Regardless, Israel has experience training against older Greek S-300PMU-1s and has undoubtedly prepared for operations involving the threat of advanced versions of the system, which are also in service with its arch nemesis Iran . A Greek transporter-erector-launcher from one of its S-300PMU-1 surface-to-air missile systems., Greek Ministry of Defense More importantly, Israel had made it clear, both rhetorically and with its actions , that it will not sit idly by and allow Iran and Iranian-backed groups, such as the Lebanese militant organization Hezbollah, to exploit the situation in Syria to expand their military capabilities and spread their influence. In particular, strikes against weapons shipments to Hezbollah are seen as an existential threat to the country and are non-negotiable. The Israeli Air Force’s loss of an F-16I Sufa multi-role combat jet to a Syrian SA-5 in February 2018 has done nothing to slow their operational tempo – if anything, the opposite has occurred . In addition, the country has a squadron of F-35I Adir stealth fighters for missions it deems high-risk, but absolutely necessary and says that it has already sent them into combat , but to what extent remains unclear. Israel’s increasingly broad menu of standoff weapons and their highly advanced electronic warfare and cyber capabilities also make the news of S-300s being supplied to Syria less of an issue than some want to believe. Furthermore, Israel routinely targets Assad’s air defenses to clear the way for further strikes and is likely to destroy any Syrian-operated S-300s. There is no indication that Russia would be inclined to continue supplying replacement systems to Syria or to engage in any direct conflict with Israeli forces – risking a potential broader conflict with a nuclear-armed opponent . It was Shoigu’s less threatening comments about improving the situational awareness of Syria’s air defenses, which had been linked together on some level since August 2017 , that seem to point to the more pressing objective of preventing Assad’s forces from accidentally shooting down any more of Russia’s planes. Despite unfounded conspiracy theories that the Syrian government should have been able to immediately identify the Il-20 as Russian, there is no indication that Assad’s forces had this capability, which now appears to be of critical importance. An SA-5 surface-to-air missile on a fixed launcher on display at a museum in Ukraine., George Chernilevsky via Wikimedia The inescapable truth of the Il-20 incident is that the routinely indiscriminate actions of Syria’s air defenders put Russian aircraft at nearly as much any Israeli attackers. The entire episode has been immensely embarrassing for the Kremlin, which has long brushed off reports of taking casualties in Syria and otherwise managed to defuse tensions with other neighboring countries in the region over past shoot downs . A similar situation occurred after Turkish F-16s shot down a Russian Su-24 Fencer combat jet in 2015 that led to a period of significantly escalated tensions between the two countries, but in the end, gave way to improved relations based on intersecting policy objectives . Israel and Russia have found themselves in some level of alignment over their mutual desire to reduce Iran’s influence in Syria. As we noted, Putin had tried to dismiss this incident , as well, but it appears that public outrage at home has forced his government to take some sort of visible action. What the Russian moves are unlikely to do is change the status quo in any meaningful way and there will almost certainly be a flurry of diplomatic maneuvers behind the scenes to fully resolve the issue. With all this in mind, it is entirely possible that Russia will effectively loan Syria one or more S-300s, make an elaborate display of setting them up in select locations, only to take them back when the “threat has passed” in order to “promote regional stability.” This scenario would allow both Russia and Israel to meet their respective policy agendas and leave the entire situation effectively unchanged. Alternatively, Russia could simply choose not to replace if they are destroyed by Israeli forces. It’s also worth noting that handing over S-300 batteries to Syria puts Russia at risk of having the perception of its air defense products damaged if Israel continues to successfully strike at will in the country or even if it simply destroys them. So far, Syria’s dated Russian-made air defenses have performed poorly during the conflict, while Russia’s higher-end S-400 and advanced S-300 batteries located South of Latakia and in Tartus have not actively engaged any targets. With Syrians trying to defend their own airspace, weaknesses in the S-300 system may become glaringly clear. Any Russian-Israeli machinations will also come as Assad continues to try and defend his airspace in one of the most complex air combat environment in decades, with multiple nations and non-nation state actors all with different agendas requiring different rules of engagement in different portions of the country . At present, the Syrian regime is trying to guard its skies in accordance with its own interests, but with strong influence from both Russia and Iran, all the while using Cold War-era technology that was never intended for such a complex combat environment. All told, improving Assad’s air defense capabilities could definitely reduce the likelihood of future accidental shoot downs, but it will also increase the geopolitical volatility surrounding Israel’s slow-moving conflict with Assad’s forces that will no doubt continue to try to challenge Israeli air strikes. That is if Russia really turns over these systems to Syria in relevant quantities at all, and is willing to replace them repeatedly as Israeli warplanes knock them out.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 3, 2016",Dark Horse Contender Boeing Snags Air Force Deal To Replace Aging UH-1N Hueys With MH-139,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In an upset victory, the U.S. Air Force has selected the team-up of American plane-maker Boeing and Italian defense contractor Leonardo and their MH-139 helicopter as the replacement for the service’s aging UH-1N Hueys . The new choppers will support the service’s security forces elements charged with guarding America’s nuclear missile silos , as well as units that conduct VIP transport , training, local base rescue, and other utility roles in Washington, D.C. and other locations in the United States. The Pentagon announced the deal in its daily contracting announcement on Sept. 24, 2018. The firm, fixed-price deal is worth more than $375.5 million and covers the first four MH-139 helicopters , which the Air Force expects to take delivery of in 2021. If the service exercises all of its options, the full value of the contract could be approximately $2.38 billion and would cover work through 2031. This would include the purchase of up to 84 MH-139s in total, as well as training systems, other equipment, and support services. Boeing and Leonardo will conduct the majority of the work at facilities in Ridley Park and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “Strong competition drove down costs for the program, resulting in $1.7 billion in savings to the taxpayer,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in a separate statement on Sept. 24, 2018. The original cost estimate for the program to replace the existing UH-1Ns was more than $4 billion. “A safe, secure and effective nuclear enterprise is job one,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, added . “It is imperative that we field a capable and effective helicopter to replace UH-1Ns providing security for our ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] and nuclear deterrence operations.” The MH-139 is a variant of the AW139 , which Italy’s Augusta and Bell Helicopter, now part of Textron, originally developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Augusta eventually morphed first into AugustaWestland and then into Leonardo Helicopters. In 2005, AugustaWestland had bought out Bell’s share of the program. The MH-139 demonstrator., Boeing Variants of the twin-engine AW139 are presently in service with the Italian military, as well as other military forces, government agencies, and civilian operators around the world, including the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol . The Italian government also flies VIP AW139s on behalf of the Vatican and the Pope. HeliVert, a joint venture between AgustaWestland and Russian Helicopters, license-produced examples in Russia, some of which ended up in that country’s presidential helicopter fleet , shuttling President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials around. The MH-139 for the Air Force will come with sensor turret under the nose with electro-optical and infrared cameras and provisions for machine gun mounts on either side of the helicopter, among other features. Depending on a particular unit’s intended missions, sub-variants might have hoists for search and rescue missions in difficult to reach areas and other mission equipment. A US Customs and Border Protection AW139 flying over Washington, DC., CBP The Air Force has been trying to replace its Vietnam War-era UH-1Ns for decades. In 2010, the service started the Common Vertical Lift Support Platform program, only to cancel it the next year, In 2015, it finally rebooted the effort and issued a formal call for bids in 2016. Boeing and Leonardo’s helicopter beat out two separate UH-60 Black Hawk-based offerings from Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, and the Sierra Nevada Corporation. Many had seen Sikorsky’s HH-60U as the front-runner, as the Air Force already operates a small number of those aircraft, reportedly to provide security, local base rescue, and other support services at various test ranges, including the Nevada Test and Training Range, or NTTR , and the top-secret Area 51 test facility. Sierra Nevada’s pitch, initially known as the Force Hawk, and then rebranded as the Sierra Force , would have consisted of ex-U.S. Army UH-60As rebuilt to a configuration similar to the more recent UH-60V conversion . These helicopters would have featured more powerful General Electric T-701D engines, a full glass cockpit, and updated avionics. One of the HH-60Us Lockheed Martin had already supplied to the Air Force., Lockheed Martin Airbus had also put forward a version of its H-145 helicopter, a training and light utility variant of which is in U.S. Army and Navy service as the UH-72A Lakota. Bell offered its UH-1Y Venom helicopter, which has seen combat with the U.S. Marine Corps. The Air Force rejected both of these proposals earlier in the contracting process. But the MH-139, which is smaller and lighter than the UH-60-series, offered commercial-off-the-shelf airframe that required minimal modifications to perform the missions that the Air Force’s present assigns to its UH-1Ns. “It’s still going to be cheaper to buy, it’s going to be cheaper to operate, and over the long term, a lot cheaper for the Air Force to sustain,” Rick Lemaster, the head of Boeing’s UH-1N capture team, had told Jane’s 360 in July 2018 . As noted, the MH-139’s most visible mission will be patrolling ICBM silos and responding to any threats to those sites. They will also conduct convoy escort missions in and around those facilities, including protecting the transportation of nuclear warheads .

While 25 are assigned to the IBCM fields, another 20 are part of the 1st Helicopter Squadron situated at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington, D.C., where they are on hand to fly VIPs around and perform other emergency missions. One of which includes transporting select members of the U.S. government to safety during a crisis as part of the federal government’s continuity of government operations plans. Another 13 active Hueys are assigned to Air Education and Training Command and Air Force Materiel Command to help with training, local base rescue, flight test, and other missions. In total, the Air Force expects to replace around 60 UH-1Ns at seven different locations across the United States. There is no plan, as of yet, to replace a small number of Hueys attached the 459th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base in Japan. However, it’s worth noting that if the Air Force decides to buy the full number of MH-139s, it will not be a one-for-one replacement, so that could change in the future. Another briefing slide from 2015 showing the missions of the UH-1Ns assigned to the 1st Helicopter Squadron in support of the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW)., USAF via FOIA This is a major win for Boeing, which also just picked up the contract to build the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25A Stingray tanker drone. The company is also still in the running for the Air Force’s even more highly anticipated and lucrative T-X jet trainer contract , which the service could award before the end of September 2018. The Chicago-headquartered plane-maker has teamed up with Swedish firm Saab in its bid for the T-X contract. Leonardo has also made a T-X offer, but directly through its own U.S.-based subsidiary Leonardo DRS . It’s also important to point out that both Lockheed Martin and Sierra Nevada will have an opportunity to contest the award if they feel the Air Force acted improperly. This could delay the process or even up-end it entirely if federal watchdogs decide the contracting process was flawed. An artist’s concept of a pair of missionized MH-139s for the US Air Force., Boeing In February 2018, Lockheed Martin had actually filed an unusual pre-award protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), complaining that the Air Force had made unreasonable demands for technical data rights as part of the contract. The whole matter became moot in May 2018, when the Air Force eliminated the requirements requiring the winner to give up rights to software code and other proprietary information. This had forced the service to push back awarding the contract from July until now. If everything goes according to plan, the Air Force will finally be able to start replacing its antiquated UH-1Ns starting in the next two years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 30, 2019",USMC Cancels Upgrades For Amphibious Vehicles With Replacements Still Years Away,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has canceled plans to upgrade its tracked Assault Amphibious Vehicle family, or AAVs, as it begins to acquire a new fleet of wheeled Amphibious Combat Vehicles , or ACVs. However, the service still plans to operate a portion of the older AAVs through at least 2030 and it could take up to five years just to find appropriate funding to begin increasing production of the ACVs to fully meet the Marines’ demands. Defense News was first to report that the Marines had axed the AAV update project, known formally as the Assault Amphibious Vehicle Survivability Upgrade program, or AAV-SU, on Sept. 24, 2018. The Corps had issued a stop work order to defense contractor SAIC, which was building the kits that include improved underbelly and hull armor, blast-absorbing seats for the crew and passengers, along with a new engine, transmission, and suspension components to improve the vehicle’s performance even with the added weight. “Rather than continue to invest in that vehicle that, even in upgraded form, will not provide adequate maneuverability, survivability, or ship-to-shore performance, the Marine Corps believes these funds would be better used elsewhere to support modernization initiatives across the force.” Manny Pacheco, a spokesperson for the Program Executive Office for Land Systems, told Defense News . “The key there really is, ACV performed a lot better than expected,” he added in separate comments to USNI News . SAIC first began developing the AAV-SU upgrade in 2015 and the cost of updating a single one of the amphibious tracked vehicles was approximately $1.65 million . The Marines will still take delivery of four “production control modules” from the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor, but it’s unclear what will happen to them then. SAIC had been under contract to upgrade 21 vehicles , with the Corps’ original plan being to update more than 390 AAVs in total to ensure they remain a capable part of the force into the 2030s. In June 2018, the Corps announced they had picked BAE Systems’ offering, which the company had developed in cooperation with Italy’s Iveco , as the winner of the ACV 1.1 program, the first of what could be three phases in the development of the wheeled vehicles. That $198 million contract covers the cost of 30 ACVs and well as various ancillary items. The deal also gives the Marines the option to expand the purchase to a fleet of 200 vehicles. The wheeled ACV is smaller, lighter, and has less carrying capacity than the older AAVs and offers debatable advantages in mobility and survivability in its present form over the Cold War-era design, all of which you can read about in more detail here . Each one of the BAE-Iveco vehicles comes along with a $4 million price tag, as well, making them substantially more expensive than the AAV-SU upgrade package. “The fact that the deliveries of ACV and AAV SU were approximately two [fiscal year] quarters apart, basically six months or so apart, I think the decision was made, let’s just focus our resources on ACV,” Pacheco explained to USNI News . In the long-term, “the vision for ACV is that in the out years we’ll be able to pick up the pace on deliveries and replace the AAVs a little bit quicker than originally planned.” A pre-production example of the Marine Corps’ future ACV., BAE Systems But regardless of the merits of one vehicle versus the other, it’s unclear what the Marines actually stand to gain from canceling the AAV-SU program in the near- or mid-term timeframes. Pacheco acknowledged that the decision would free up very little of the funding the Corps received for the 2018 fiscal year and there is only $96 million allotted to the upgrade project in the Marines’ expected budget for the 2019 fiscal cycle – which would cover the cost of more than 100 update packages, but only around 24 ACVs. Far more importantly, the Marine Corps spokesperson told USNI News that it could take between three to five years – 2021 to 2023 – for the service to secure the funding it needs to really get the ACV program going. We don’t know if that refers to buying the full 200 vehicles under the present contract or awarding additional contracts. A purchase of 200 ACVs would not be nearly enough to replace the nearly 900 AAVs on a one-for-one basis. Even with follow-on contracts, the AAVs will continue to support Marine operations for the foreseeable future. One of the Marine Corps’ existing AAVs during a training exercise., USMC He also noted that service was already working on a number of different modernization efforts , including plans to replace its aging Humvee wheeled vehicles with new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV), which could compete for those same monetary resources. After JLTV purchases begin to slow, “hopefully there will be a little breathing room in a little bit where we can put a little more money in the ACV line,” Pacheco said to USNI News . By their own admission, the Marines do not appear to have a clear plan for any money they do save by canceling the AAV-SU project. They might even just put it back into other upgrades for the tracked vehicles, including improved communications equipment and a new remote weapons station, according to Pacheco , which calls into question the entire argument about there being a lack of value in continuing to invest in the platform. The Marines also stand to lose out on the benefits of a relatively low-cost upgrade project they already funded in the first place. The AAV remains in production and the U.S. military concluded a deal worth more than $83 million with BAE Systems to purchase three dozen of the tracked vehicles on behalf of Taiwan in June 2018. Japan began receiving its first examples in 2017 to support its plans to expand its amphibious forces . These countries, along with other long-standing American partners who operate AAVs, such as South Korea and Thailand, could still be interested in the AAV-SU upgrades, which might further drive down the unit price. A Marine highlights the new running gear on an AAV with a prototype of the upgrade kit installed., USMC None of this is to say that the Marines shouldn’t be working to replace the AAVs, a design that first entered production in 1972 and has a checkered combat record . At the same time, the examples they have are going to be in service to some degree for years to come and the development of the upgrade package – which the vehicles sorely need – is already bought and paid for. In what could easily turn out to be a short-sighted decision, in canceling the AAV-SU program, the Corps’ looks to be positioning itself to be stuck operating vehicles that are less capable and survivable without any guarantee that it will be able to speed up the acquisition of ACVs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 8, 2018",Bell Unveils V-247 Vigilant Tilt-Rotor Combat Drone Mock-Up at USMC Tech Expo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Marine Corps looks to move ahead with its multi-role, vertical landing and takeoff-capable drone program, known as MUX , Bell has unveiled a new, full-scale mock-up of its V-247 Vigilant unmanned tilt-rotor at a technology exposition at one of the service’s own bases. The company has been actively pitching the design as an option for MUX project, but it has a modular design that could make it appealing to other U.S. and foreign military services , as well. Bell showed the full-size model to the public for the first time at the 2018 Modern Day Marine Expo at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia on Sept. 25, 2018. The firm first announced it was working on the V-247 design at all in 2016, around the same time that the Marines first revealed the MUX concept , which officially stands for Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary. “The Bell V-247 Vigilant is leveraging combat-proven technology making the future of aviation a reality today,” Todd Worden, Bell’s Senior Manager for Global Military Business Development speaks, told attendees at the Modern Day Marine Expo while standing in front of the model. “It’s a testament to the power and versatility of tilt-rotor flight.” The V-247 uses technology derived from both the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, which the Marines already fly , as well as the still-in-development V-280 Valor , which the company has pitched to the U.S. Army as part of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. The unmanned Vigilant will be capable of autonomous flight and will have the necessary data links to support teaming up with manned aircraft, according to Bell. The company also says the drone can turn its wings and fold its rotors in order to fit within the same physical footprint as a Marine UH-1Y Venom utility and light attack helicopter, which is a key MUX requirement. The company has long pitched the design as a multi-purpose platform, with multiple internal payload bays for weapons, radars and other sensors, and other specialized mission equipment. The new model is in a light attack configuration with four underwing pylons and sensor turret under the fuselage that could carry various electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator. Bell’s mock-up at the Modern Day Marine Expo was carrying four dummy AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and a dozen inert Fury multi-mode precision-guided miniature munitions. Textron, Bell’s parent company, produces Fury, which is a small glide bomb that can use either laser or GPS/INS guidance options to attack stationary or moving targets in various weather and environmental conditions. The full-size V-247 model at the 2018 Modern Day Marine Expo had four of these triple ejector racks fully loaded with Fury glide bombs., Joseph Trevithick What the Marines refer to as “Offensive Air Support” is relatively low on their priority list for the MUX drone, ranked fifth out of seven total potential missions for the system, according to documents the service publicly released in June 2018. An airborne early warning platform is the Corps’ most pressing demand as it is a capability the Marines presently rely on other services to provide. You can read about the MUX’s possible mission profiles in greater detail in a past War Zone feature on this system. The modular nature of the V-247 could give it the capacity necessary to carry the powerful air search radar necessary for the airborne early warning mission. The Vigilant in this configuration would also need significant communications systems and data links necessary to send out critical information to other Marine assets and command centers. The V-247 model at the Modern Day Marine Expo also notably features an in-flight refueling probe, which was not present on earlier models and in previous concept art of the design. This feature, combined with the Marines’ plans to adopt an aerial refueling tanker kit for the Osprey, would help extend the overall range of the drones or allow them to loiter over a particular area of the battlefield for extended periods of time. This could be especially useful for examples of the drone operating in the airborne early warning role, but would also be valuable for versions flying other MUX missions, such as persistent surveillance, armed over-watch, and communications relay missions. Unfortunately, Congress has not been as enthused about the Marine Corps’ plans for MUX, regardless of what design they might use in the end, raising concerns that the service has not properly outlined its need for the system or now they plan to integrate it into their overall force structure. Legislators cut nearly the service’s proposed budget for the program by nearly half , from around $25 million to approximately $14 million, when they passed the defense policy bill for the 2019 fiscal year in August 2018. The Marines are moving forward with the project, regardless, but they’re also unlikely to be the only element of the U.S. military that might be interested in using the Vigilant to fill many of the same missions. One of the driving factors in the V-247’s design was also the desire to make it able to fit inside the hangar on board an Arleigh Burke -class destroyer , which could make it appealing to the U.S. Navy. Bell has previously shown a model of a version in an anti-submarine warfare configuration with a side-mounted sonobouy launcher. The Navy is also working separately with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Northrop Grumman on another vertical take-off and landing capable maritime strike and reconnaissance drone project called the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN). A model of a V-247 configured for anti-submarine warfare missions., Joseph Trevithick The Army is also exploring the possibility of fielding some form of multi-role, pilot optional, vertical take-off and landing capable aircraft, which could be either a helicopter or a tilt-rotor. The V-247 can’t carry a pilot and is probably too small to meet this and other requirements for this Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype ( FARA CP ), but the design could serve as the basis of future Bell offering for the program. The Vigilant also could be of interest to foreign military operators, as well. With Bell’s emphasis on the drone’s shipboard capabilities, the company might be inclined to pitch it to Japan or South Korea, both of which are looking to significantly expanding the amphibious warfare capabilities. Both countries could soon be interested in operating the vertical take-off and landing capable F-35B Joint Strike Fighter from new and existing amphibious assault ships and light carriers. The Marines see their future MUX operating together with these stealthy fighters on some missions, as well. A Marine Corps “operational view” showing various potential MUX missions., USMC Japan is also the first, and still only, V-22 export customer and could eventually fly them from the country’s Izumo -class “helicopter destroyers,” which Japanese authorities have now conceded were originally designed as light aircraft carriers. One of the missions the Marines first envisioned for MUX was escorting Ospreys as they flew ashore. Whatever happens to MUX in the end, as well as another U.S. military or foreign drone program that considers the V-247 design, Vigilant appears to have a lot of potential and it’s likely that we’ll see more notional configurations for various missions as Bell gets the aircraft ready for its inaugural flight. This could come in the next few years if the company hopes to stick to its plan of having the unmanned tilt-rotor ready for production by 2023 .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 27, 2018",Marine F-35Bs Flew Surveillance Missions Near Somalia And Were Ready To Strike If Necessary,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters have reportedly conducted reconnaissance missions over or near Somalia and were ready to respond to requests for close air support from American forces in that country during their first-ever deployment to the Horn of Africa region aboard the USS Essex amphibious assault ship. There are now reports that U.S. military could employ these same aircraft to conduct strikes in Afghanistan , flying all the way from the Persian Gulf. CNN first reported the activities of the F-35Bs, citing unnamed sources, which could be the first missions in support of active combat operations for American Joint Strike Fighters, as well as the potential for their first-ever actual strikes, on Sept. 25, 2018. The six jets from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Two One One ( VMFA-211 ) arrived off the cost of the Horn of Africa earlier in the month where they were due to conduct a routine training exercise. The jets are attached to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which is presently embarked on the ships of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), which includes the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Essex , the San Antonio -class amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage , and the Whidbey Island -class amphibious dock landing ship USS Rushmore . The F-35Bs took to the skies around Somalia to perform surveillance missions and to stand guard in case there was a need to respond to requests for support from U.S. forces in the country or their African Union and Somali partners, according to CNN . On Sept. 21, 2018, unspecified U.S. military aircraft, typically understood to be armed drones, conducted a so-called “self-defense” strike on Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab militants who had attacked a combined patrol of U.S. and local forces. A similar mission occurred on Sept. 11, 2018. CNN says that the F-35Bs did not take part in the Sept. 21 mission and there is no indication that they participated in the one on Sept. 11. It is not clear what portion or portions of Somalia the jets have been monitoring, either. An F-35B from VMFA-211 flies alongside a US Air Force KC-135 tanker somewhere in the Horn of Africa region on Sept. 15, 2018. The aircraft has radar reflectors fitted and the gun pod reduces the plane’s stealth capabilities. As such, it is possible that this picture was taken during a patrol off the coast of Somalia., USAF In March 2017 , President Donald Trump’s administration did designate a wide swath of southern Somalia, where Al Shabaab is particularly active, as an area of active hostilities. This gave U.S. forces there greater leeway to call in air strikes and other support, as necessary. Since then, American operations in Somalia have steadily, if quietly increased in size and scope. In May 2017, a U.S. Navy SEAL died in a controversial raid near the town of Barii. Another operation in the same area in August 2017 led to reports of a full-blow massacre of innocent civilians. After initially denying the accusations, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) initiated a second investigation into the latter incident. A third incident in May 2018 prompted yet another investigation. AFRICOM has not made any results of these reviews public. At the same time, as they have stepped up their operational tempo, U.S. forces working together with African Union and Somali personnel have increasingly come under attack. In June 2018, U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and a C-130J airlifter worked together to help wounded American personnel evacuate to safety after an Al Shabaab attack on a combined force working to establish a new forward operating base. Armed air support is typically on standby during these types of large, multi-day operations. This could have been the missions VMFA-211’s F-35s found them tasked with while operating in the area and would explain pictures the U.S. military released showing the jets carrying a detachable gun pod under their fuselage that is typically reserved for close air support missions in lower threat environments since it reduces their aircraft’s stealthy characteristics. Of course, there would have been little need for the Joint Strike Fighter’s stealth features during any missions over Somalia, since Al Shabaab forces have limited access to advanced anti-aircraft weapons. They have acquired capable short-range, man-portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles in the past, though. Al Shabaab militants in Somalia., AP The F-35’s primary advantage, in this case, would have been its ability to respond quickly and act flexibly given its ability to fly patrols in close proximity to potential target areas thanks to the mobile nature of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group. This is exactly the sort of crisis response mission MEUs excel at and train to conduct on a regular basis. Those capabilities are less likely to show in any future strike in Afghanistan, which CNN ‘s sources said could be coming soon now that Essex and her entourage have moved into the Persian Gulf. Though the Afghan theater of operations is equally low-risk, VMFA-211’s F-35s will face a far more arduous task of getting there in the first place. The jets are unable to carry range-extending external fuel tanks and are heavily reliant on aerial refueling tankers to make up for their limited range. As such, U.S. Air Force tankers will have to accompany them back out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Oman and then into the Indian Ocean, before the aircraft turn and fly across Pakistan on their way to Afghanistan. A direct route from the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan is impossible as it would require flying over Iran. One of VMFA-211’s F-35Bs takes off from Essex earlier in September 2018., USMC There could be a risk that Pakistan air defenders might take the opportunity to observe the sensitive radar signature of the jets during this transit, but this is unlikely. It almost certain that the jets would be carrying radar reflectors that they use on non-combat missions given the entirely permissive air combat environment in Afghanistan. U.S. commanders may decide to deploy the aircraft to a base in Afghanistan proper, even just briefly in order to allow them to refuel. A likely basing option would be Kandahar Air Base in southern Afghanistan, which is close to where Marine Corps forces are operating in the country . It is possible that the jets could remain in the country for multiple days in order to maximize the value of the operation, as well. This could present other challenges, however, as the Marines recently revealed that the Joint Strike Fighters require specialized protection against lightning strikes while they sit on exposed the tarmac. One of VMFA-211’s F-35Bs receives fuel from a US Air Force KC-135 tanker while flying in the Horn of Africa Region., USAF Regardless, either option is an immense amount of effort for what would almost certainly be token strikes against Taliban or other militants in Afghanistan. The U.S. military has faced criticism, even from within its own senior leadership , about the recent use of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to conduct strikes against drug labs in the country. However, there could be immense training value in going through the motions of a real combat mission for the first time. It would also present an opportunity to test out rapid deployment methods in truly austere environments under combat conditions using the advanced jets, but with minimal risks. The Somalia missions already show that the U.S. military is taking steps to further integrate the F-35 in more routine missions, no matter how mundane they might be, just like any other combat jet. The Marines are no doubt eager to show off the still highly controversial Joint Strike Fighter’s capabilities in actual combat, no matter how limited, especially since the Israelis have already claimed the title of the first air arm to send the planes into action ever. All told, it wouldn’t be surprising to hear that VMFA-211 had flown the first-ever U.S. combat missions with the F-35 in the coming days.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 7, 2021","One Company Thinks Flying Platforms Have Finally Come Of Age, But Will The Military Hop On Board?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For decades, in spite of their popularity in movies, television, and video games, jetpacks and individual flying platforms have continually proven to be too costly and otherwise ill-suited to military use. But the allure of finally finding a practical system persists and within a month, SOFWERX, a U.S. Special Operations Command-funded public-private partnership that seeks out novel technologies , will finish up testing of Zapata’s EZ-Fly jet-powered personal flying machine. The project, formally known as the Individual Aerial Mobility System (IAMS), began on Aug. 22, 2018, and is set to conclude on Oct. 24, 2018. Initial over-water testing occurred at Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey, before the work moved to Burnet, Texas for more intensive evaluations. The vehicle itself has been in development since at least 2017 and a job offer that year called for two individuals with prior special operations forces (SOF) experience to help Zapata , also known as Z-Air, in crafting the militarized derivative of the company’s Flyboard Air . After crafting the vehicle itself, “SOFWERX, along with Z-Air, developed and tested a training protocol to determine its efficacy for SOF operators, and to determine how quickly they could be trained to pilot the EZ-Fly,” the Florida-headquartered tech incubator said in an official fact sheet . “The trainees performed advanced skills assessments and were able to successfully pilot the EZ-Fly through a slalom course with three weeks of total training.” The vehicle itself consists of a platform with seven small, computer-controlled jet turbines, each with their own independent fuel supply. The “pilot” stands on top and uses controls in two sticks, similar in basic appearance to ski poles or those on an elliptical exercise machine, to take off, land, and hover. The operator also uses them, along with the motion of their body, to steer. Zapata, and its French founder Franky Zapata, already had significant experience with similar systems. The company’s first project was the water-jet powered “hoverboard” called Flyboard , which then evolved into the jet turbine-powered Flyboard Air. A tablet-sized display mounted between the Fly-EZ’s control sticks provides important information, such as remaining fuel, and offers automated features, such as an automatic hover mode. Zapata says the entire system can carry an individual and their gear with a combined weight of up to 280 pounds, fly a maximum of 80 miles per hour, for up to 12 minutes, and at altitudes as high as around 9,000 feet. One of the vehicles carrying the maximum load is likely to have reduced range, speed, and maneuverability. The basic details of the IAMS program., SOFWERX The company also says it’s intuitive and safe to use, with the computer-controlled systems providing built-in redundancies and automatic compensation if one of the jet engines fails. “I thought it was a gust of wind,” Henry Berkowitz, one of the two former special operators who now work for Zapata, told CNBC in 2017. Zapata is pitching Fly-EZ as having broad military applicability , including supporting quick-reaction missions and routine patrols and helping personnel get quickly from a ship to shore or vice versa. With its high speed and minimal radar and infrared signatures, it might even offer a way to rapidly insert conventional or special operations forces into denied areas, its website explains. The company also says that the computer-controlled nature of the system might allow it to operate semi-autonomously as an unmanned aircraft. A former US military special operator pilots a Fly-EZ platform during testing., Zapata But while the Fly-EZ is definitely an impressive piece of technology, it’s not clear whether it can truly overcome the long-standing issues with jetpacks and flying platforms. In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Army, in particular, spent considerable time and resources to evaluate a wide array of such systems, before ultimately deciding they were too impractical for a real battlefield. Zapata’s latest creation is far faster and more reliable than these Cold War-era experiments, such as the Hiller VZ-1 Pawnee and the de Lackner HZ-1 Aerocycle . The Fly-EZ’s computerized controls are worlds ahead of those designs, though, making it far easier to train individuals with no prior flight experience to use them in the first place and keep going even in the event of an engine failure. These are significant advances in the overall concept of personal flying machines that substantially lowers the barrier to entry for adopting this technology for widespread use. It still may not be enough to make Zapata’s offering practical, especially given its continued limitations in terms of range and overall flight duration. At 80 miles per hour, with 12 minutes worth of fuel, the Fly-EZ can over around 16 miles before it runs out of fuel. The 1950s HZ-1, early prototypes of which are seen in the first video below, had a range of up to 50 miles when carrying an additional fuel tank. This might be enough time to cover the distance a typical “presence patrol” might travel around a base or small outpost, but hardly enough to provide the actual “presence.”  It also wouldn’t offer enough range for troops to get ashore from ships without putting those vessels at risk from shore-based defenses during traditional amphibious operations , though it might offer a means for special operators to try and sneak on land from smaller boats . Unless operators fly a loop from a base and back, they would have to carry extra jet fuel to fly it back out again, as well. The prospective unit cost of around $250,000 is around half that of small, purpose-built 4×4 light special operations vehicles , but it’s still unlikely that any U.S. military service would consider the Fly-EZ a disposable system. That price point also raises questions about how cost effective it would be to equip even small units with these individual flying platforms – just kitting out a single nine-man Army infantry squad would cost more than $2 million. On top of all that, as with earlier designs, Fly-EZ continues to leave the operator entirely exposed to enemy fire and it’s not clear if the user can fire a weapon, even one-handed, while flying. Its speed, maneuverability, and altitude capabilities would help mitigate this vulnerability, but videos of the testing show that the platform is moving relatively slowly when it takes off or comes in to land. It’s loud, as well, largely ruling out covert insertions into denied areas or discreet operations at night. Just some of the missions that Bell envisioned for its various jetpacks and flying platforms in the 1960s., Bell That’s not to say that the system wouldn’t have any military or other practical uses. Depending on how well it packs up, it is possible that U.S. forces could drop them to downed pilots or other personnel who need to rapidly escape to safety . They could definitely offer a valuable way for personnel to respond to quickly to crises in and around established base areas, too. Fly-EZs might offer a useful and cost-effective alternative to larger helicopters as a means of redeploying forces from one forward base to another with minimal support. It’s possible that they could offer a similar capability for employees other U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. State Department , to safely and quickly travel between facilities overseas. Fly-EZ could also have various uses in non-combat, disaster relief missions, allowing personnel to quickly get into difficult reach areas to assess damage and potentially rescue trapped individuals. Unfortunately, there seem to still be serious challenges to making individual flying machines work as well in real life as they do in action flicks and video games. Still, whether or not the system ends up in military use, Zapata’s Fly-EZ looks set to come closer than ever before to making this capability a reality.

Leonardo is by far the dark horse candidate with their subsonic, twin-engine M346 (T-100 in U.S.) Master, but the aircraft is an established trainer with cutting-edge synthetic training capabilities. Could the USAF surprise everyone by picking an aircraft that lies outside of its own supersonic performance requirements? Cost and risk are huge factors too. Lockheed’s T-50 is a known commodity with roughly 200 in various configurations serving with five countries. As such, it requires little developmental funding. But some say it is too much jet for the mission as the T-50 also serves as a light fighter in FA-50 and F-50 form. Leonardo’s Master is also mature with dozens in service and won’t require big additional development or inject risk into a program that is going to have to compete with many other priorities in the coming decade. Boeing’s entrant could surprise everyone when it comes to a balance of performance versus price as it was tailored to the USAF’s training needs. At the same time, a clean sheet design like Boeing’s is riskier and would take more development dollars—that is unless Boeing is willing to eat a portion of those costs under a fixed-price contract, and especially if they rise beyond the budget of the original procurement plan. In the end, each entrant has their own distinct advantages and disadvantages. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0FbGE-YWyIw The winner of T-X could realize additional sales well beyond the 350 T-38 replacement aircraft. The Pentagon could acquire the aircraft for aggressor duties and foreign customers are certain to be heavily swayed by the fact that the type will be in service with the USAF. This goes beyond a pedigree consideration. It also means the aircraft will have a very strong support infrastructure and economies of scale when it comes to upgrades and just the basic spare parts supply chain. Even the Navy could seek a navalized version sometime in the future. And a replacement really can’t come soon enough. The T-38s are all nearly 50 years old or older and crashes have increased. There have been four Talon losses in just the last 10 months. So who do you think will win and why? Let’s hash it all out in the discussion section below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 26, 2018",Marine F-35Bs Fly First-Ever Strike Missions Against ‘Fixed Targets’ in Afghanistan (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Two One One, abbreviated VMFA-211, have claimed the title of being the first American Joint Strike Fighters to fly actual combat missions with strikes against unspecified “fixed targets” in Afghanistan. These sorties came after the same jets flew surveillance and reconnaissance missions off the coast of Somalia with full combat loads, poised to strike in that country, if necessary. CNN was first to report the strikes in Afghanistan, which came on Sept. 27, 2018. The U.S. military has declined to say how many aircraft in total took part in the mission, exactly what munitions they employed, or any specifics about the targets themselves. CNN ‘s sources described the mission’s objective as “a fixed Taliban target.” The Marines declared they had reached initial operational capability with the F-35B in 2015 and forward deployed the aircraft to Japan for the first time in 2017. In March 2018, a detachment of the stealth fighters joined the first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS Wasp and her Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) for their first-ever deployment as part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The, in July 2018 , another six jets, from VMFA-211, joined the Wasp -class USS Essex and her ARG as part of the 13th MEU, ahead of a routine cruise that would take them to the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. On Sept. 25, 2018, CNN reported that the Essex ‘s ARG had moved or was moving into the Persian Gulf. That same story said that strikes in Afghanistan could be imminent. We don’t know whether or not any of VMFA-211s remained in Afghanistan after the strike or how they arrived there in the first place. As we at The War Zone noted just days ago, it would have required significant resources for the F-35Bs to get from the Persian Gulf to any Taliban targets. The most logical course of action would have been for some of the U.S. Air Force’s substantial aerial refueling assets based in the Middle East to have supported the operation, helping the F-35Bs fly from the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Oman, before proceeding into the Indian Ocean and then sending the jets zipping across Pakistan on their way to Afghanistan. In 2017, the Air Force sent a detachment of KC-135 tankers back into Afghanistan proper for the first time in nearly five years to support a surge in aerial operations against the Taliban and other militant groups. A US Air Force KC-135 tanker refuels one of VMFA-211’s F-35Bs somewhere near the Horn of Africa earlier in September 2018., USAF Those aircraft could have then supported the Joint Strike Fighters before and after the strikes and sent them on their way back to the Persian Gulf. It is also possible that the F-35Bs landed at a base in Afghanistan to refuel. One of the pictures the Marines subsequently released from the mission, seen at the top of this story, showed crews loading GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs onto the aircraft, which would be well suited to strike “fixed” targets. Another image of VMFA-211’s jets on board Essex on Sept. 22, 2018, had shown crews loading live laser-guided 500-pound class GBU-12/B Paveway II bombs onto at least one aircraft around the time they were flying missions near Somalia. A pair of VMFA-211’s F-35Bs ahead of the strikes in Afghanistan. There is a JDAM positioned under the weapons bay of the aircraft in the foreground., USMC There are bound to be questions about the utility of using the stealth fighters for this mission, especially given the permissive nature of the air combat environment in Afghanistan that in no way requires the expensive jet’s advanced defensive features. The employment of U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters for similar low-risk strikes in Afghanistan has drawn criticism, including from that service’s own top civilian official. “We should not be using an F-22 to destroy a narcotics factory,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in June 2018 . At the same time, the Marines continue to push to further integrate the F-35B into their day-to-day operations as they move to replace all of their fixed-wing combat jets with the Joint Strike Fighters. As such, the service will increasingly have no alternative but to use the aircraft for typical combat missions, no matter how mundane. Marines load GBU-12/B Paveway II bombs onto one of VMFA-211’s F-35Bs aboard the USS Essex on Sept. 22, 2018., USMC These strikes in Afghanistan have given the Corps a valuable opportunity to go through the motions of an actual combat mission for the first time, but with minimal risk. This will help inform future development of tactics, techniques, and procedures for future operations. The Marines have probably been eager to put their Joint Strike Fighters into action since Israel announced it had become the first country to ever send an F-35 into combat in May 2018. We will keep our eyes and ears open for any additional information about this historic mission and update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 3:20pm EST— U.S. Naval Forces Central Command has released an additional statement about the mission via U.S. Central Command, describing the strikes as “in support of ground clearance operations.” It does not offer any additional detail about the target or targets the F-35Bs engaged in Afghanistan. However, a U.S. Central Command public affairs officer told The War Zone in a phone call that the Marine jets flew “ close air support ” missions in support of personnel on the ground. American combat jets do strike fixed targets, such as emplaced heavy weapons or enemy forces situated inside a building, as part of close air support missions. In past, U.S. military officials have also used the separate and distinct terms “interdiction” and “close air support” interchangeably , despite the former referring to strikes against targets far removed from any immediate fighting on the ground. It’s also worth noting that official video of the F-35Bs taking off for the strikes shows that they were carrying 25mm gun pods, as well. We don’t know if they conducted any strafing runs against Taliban targets. Update: 5:05pm EST— Task & Purpose spotted an interesting detail in the official video the Marines released of the aircraft heading out on the strike. One of them has “Lt. Col. C.K. ‘Otis’ Raible” written under the cockpit, which is traditionally where the pilot’s name appears. However, Raible was among those who died when a group of Taliban fighters infiltrated into Camp Bastion , then the Marine Corps’ main base, situated in Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province, in 2012. The insurgents killed two Marines, wounded another 17, and destroyed nine AV8 Harrier jump jets situated at the base. The aircraft were from VMFA-211 and Raible was the unit commander at the time. After the attack began, he hastily gathered a number of Marines to launch a counterattack against enemy fighters on the flight line. He remains posthumously nominated for the Silver Star for his actions, but has not yet received the award.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 26, 2018",Boeing Wins Big Again And Claims The USAF’s Huge T-X Jet Trainer Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has awarded the multi-billion dollar contract to build the much-hyped T-X jet trainer to Boeing. After a string of disappointments in recent years, just since August 2018, the Chicago-headquartered planemaker has now grabbed three major U.S. military aviation deals, with the other two being the contract to replace the Air Force’s UH-1N helicopters and a deal with the U.S. Navy to build their MQ-25A Stingray tanker drones. Reuters was first to report the deal, valued at approximately $9.2 billion, on Sept. 26, 2018, which Boeing later confirmed in a press release . The Air Force plans to purchase more than 350 new T-X aircraft to replace its T-38 Talon fleet , as well as nearly 50 training simulators, and other support equipment and services. Boeing was the only contender to submit a clean-sheet design , which it developed in cooperation with Sweden’s Saab . The two partners beat out a bid from Lockheed Martin and South Korea’s Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), who had jointly submitted a version of the T-50 jet trainer , as well as an offer from Italy’s Leonardo, who pitched a variant of their M346 design known as the T-100 . Boeing’s press release reads in full: “Today’s announcement is the culmination of years of unwavering focus by the Boeing and Saab team,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Boeing Defense, Space & Security. “It is a direct result of our joint investment in developing a system centered on the unique requirements of the U.S. Air Force. We expect T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century.” Boeing and its risk-sharing partner Saab designed, developed, and flight tested two all-new, purpose-built jets ― proving out the system’s design, repeatability in manufacturing and training capability. “This selection allows our two companies to deliver on a commitment we jointly made nearly five years ago,” said Håkan Buskhe, president and CEO of Saab. “It is a major accomplishment for our partnership with Boeing and our joint team, and I look forward to delivering the first trainer aircraft to the Air Force.” Boeing is now clear to begin placing orders with its suppliers, including Saab. More than 90 percent of Boeing’s offering will be made in America, supporting more than 17,000 jobs in 34 states. Saab serves the global market with world-leading products, services and solutions within military defense and civil security. Saab has operations and employees on all continents around the world. Through innovative, collaborative and pragmatic thinking, Saab develops, adopts and improves new technology to meet customers’ changing needs. The Air Force’s original request for proposals said the winner of the competition would have to submit five aircraft for testing, after which it would make a decision about whether to proceed with two lots of low-rate initial production aircraft. It would then move on to at least eight lots of full-rate production aircraft. The service hopes to reach initial operational capability with the T-X in 2024. The Air Force’s contract is a big deal by itself, but it might also spur further developments and sales of the T-X, or derivatives, abroad. Saab had previously said that if the design it crafted with Boeing won the competition that it would build a U.S.-based plant to build the aircraft. A pair of Boeing T-X prototypes., Boeing The size of the deal with the Air Force could attract U.S. allies and partners who are looking at buying new jet trainers themselves. Joining the larger American program would allow them to avoid much, if not all, of the cost of developing a new aircraft and to take advantage of the economies of scale from larger orders of the final production aircraft. The design might serve as the basis for future, combat-capable derivatives, as well, that could be of interest to smaller air forces. The USAF has long been interested in using the T-X for aggressor duties in the future. There is also a possibility that private contractors who provide “red air” aggressor support to U.S. military training exercises could be interested in acquiring the T-Xs, as well. The Air Force is presently running a separate and potentially lucrative competition to hire a contractor these types of services at a dozen locations or more. The service’s requirements call for jets that can mimic fourth generation combat jets and most of the competitors have been acquiring older types and refurbishing them to meet that demand. Boeing’s T-X could potentially offer a modern alternative with a big support infrastructure available to sustain it. Given how significant the contract could be, it’s important to remember that Lockheed Martin and KAI and Leonardo could decide to protest the award if they think they can make a case that the Air Force’s contracting process was flawed or unfair in any way. This would also potentially delay the program, even if federal watchdogs rule in favor of Boeing at the end of the day. But if everything moves ahead smoothly, Boeing and Saab could be looking a very significant future with their new jet trainer design.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 27, 2018",Here Are The Specific Terms Of The USAF’s T-X Contract That Boeing Just Won,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing, along with its partner Saab, has just won out big in securing the U.S. Air Force’s long-awaited T-X jet trainer contract. Now, additional, more specific details have emerged that shed more light on the service’s plans and what the Chicago-based planemaker does and doesn’t stand to gain from the deal. The Pentagon released a number of relatively detailed specifics about the deal in its daily contracting announcement on Sept. 27, 2018. The Air Force offered further information in its own statement and in comments to reporters, according to Defense News . At present, the Air Force expects to purchase just over 350 T-Xs to replace its existing T-38 Talons , as well as 46 simulators and other items. It’s official! @USAirForce selects #NewBoeingTX as the next advanced pilot training system for the #USAF mission! Turn your sound up and celebrate! RELEASE: https://t.co/FKxqtYECwP pic.twitter.com/bWzK8TVxjg — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) September 27, 2018 Here’s what we know now: The Air Force expects to purchase 351 T-X aircraft, also known as Advanced Pilot Training aircraft, as well as 46 simulators, and additional parts and services. This is a so-called “indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity” contract and under the existing terms, the Air Force could potentially order as many as 475 planes and 120 simulators. The contract would only hit its full $9.2 billion value if the Air Force exercises all of its options and buys that larger number of aircraft. Around $813 million of the $9.2 billion contract covers building five pre-production examples of the planes and seven simulators. After that, the Air Force could buy the aircraft in two low-rate initial production lots, followed by at least eight lots of full-rate production, for a total of 10 lots. The contract starts out as a fixed-price deal with certain incentives, but transitions to a firm, fixed-price arrangement when the fifth lot of total production starts. The Air Force says this structure helped it trim the total cost of the program down from the original estimate of $19.7 billion. Boeing and Saab will perform the majority of the work at facilities in St. Louis, Missouri. The contract covers work, including the expected delivery of 351 aircraft, through 2034. The Air Force expects the first simulators will arrive at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas in 2023. The service’s target date for reach initial operational capability with the T-X is 2024. This follows a trend in both Air Force contracts and Boeing’s recent string of significant successes in offering aircraft to the U.S. military as a whole. Until recently, the Chicago-headquartered planemaker’s last major contract award from the Air Force had been for the KC-46A tanker , program that has proven to be vexing for both parties, which you can read about in more detail here . This was also a firm, fixed-price deal, which has meant that Boeing has had correct millions of dollars worth of problems without receiving any more money. Earlier in the week, Boeing, in partnership with Italy’s Leonardo, won the Air Force’s $375.5 million contract for new helicopters to replace its UH-1N Hueys , which is also a firm, fixed-price arrangement. The company had also won the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25A Stingray drone tanker competition, receiving another contract worth more than $800 million, but one that again has a fixed price. Boeing was the only competitor to pitch a clean-sheet design for T-X, which increases the likelihood that it will have to pay out of pocket to correct any issues that emerge as the program proceeds. Developing a new plane is an inherently riskier proposition than choosing an established design and it is hardly uncommon for problems to crop up during testing and as production ramps up that can lead to cost growth and delays. Boeing and Saab’s T-X., Boeing But the structure of the deal suggests that the Air Force and Boeing might be expecting growth of a certain kind. We at The War Zone have already noted that the size of T-X program could attract additional buyers, either in the form of U.S. allies or private contracts. That the contract includes its own provisions to purchase dozens of additional planes could make it even easier for the United States to woo partners to join the project. Derivatives of the jet could find themselves taking on new roles in the future, which could further expand the prospective customer base. For Boeing, the deal appears to remain a lucrative opportunity, not only to become a key provider of jet trainers to the Air Force, but also to leverage the baked-in mechanisms in the contract to begin making inroads in selling the aircraft elsewhere.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 14, 2018",Boeing’s T-X Win Is Really Much Bigger Than Just Building A Replacement For The T-38,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What exciting news it was yesterday. After years of waiting, we finally got to hear the USAF’s choice for the jet that would replace the hugely successful, but half-century-old T-38 Talon trainer. But the reality is that Boeing’s victorious T-X design represents so much more than just a new piece of equipment intended to replace another that has reached the end of its service life. This decision has wide-ranging impacts on many different levels, and for Boeing, in particular, it is a game changer. First off, a huge congratulations to Boeing that has pulled off a trifecta of big aircraft competition wins spanning rotary-wing , fixed-wing unmanned , and now fixed-wing manned aircraft capabilities in just the span of a single month. Also, their competitors, Lockheed and Leonardo, really did put up a great fight and all are super passionate about their products, both of which have already found success globally. But above all else, let’s just take a moment to fathom just how big of a winner Northrop’s iconic T-38 Talon has been. The YT-38 on its first flight nearly 60 years ago. , USAF The design first flew in April of 1959 and has not only successfully trained tens of thousands of pilots, but it also served a stint with the Thunderbirds and has kept U-2 and B-2 aircrews’ and NASA astronauts’ flight hours up. It has also played the role of aggressor as well, a job it still does to this very day for air wings equipped with target-hungry F-22s. Tyndall AFB-based T-38A aggressor alongside its F-22 stablemate. , USAF Yet it’s not just what the Talon did, but it’s also what came out of it that is significant. The USAF’s first supersonic jet trainer gave birth to one of the most successful and important families of fighters in history, the F-5A/B Freedom Fighter and F-5E/F Tiger II. Those jets allowed the U.S. to export American airpower all around the globe, even to less reliable allies and poorer nations who couldn’t afford more complex and capable machines. In addition, for many decades the F-5 served as the backbone of the Navy, Marines, and the USAF adversary support programs, including those involved with the Navy Fighter Weapons School and the USAF Weapons School. In fact, the F-5 continues to provide aggressor capacity for the Navy and Marines till this very day and will also serve in that role for adversary support contractor TacAir, which is just spinning up its F-5 operations now. Air Force F-5Es was the backbone of adversary support for fighter squadrons based all around the globe during the Cold War., USAF The F-5 still flies in a combat role for a handful of air arms around the world. Some of the jets that remain in frontline service are upgraded with modern avionics similar to those you would find on a 4th generation fighter. Even the F-5’s successor, the F-20 Tigershark , was hugely promising, although it never made it to an operational state. Randolph AFB T-38Cs in formation., USAF With all this in mind, it is sad that we really never got to know Northrop Grumman’s aborted T-X contender, an aircraft that was designed and built by Scaled Composites and even flew on multiple occasions . With the T-38’s illustrious heritage under Northrop Grumman’s belt, their T-X aircraft, another clear-sheet design dubbed the Model 400, could have been today’s big winner instead of Boeing’s offering. But for various rumored reasons , Northrop Grumman dropped out of the race, in the end ceding the Air Force jet trainer market to a major corporate competitor—Boeing. Northrop Grumman’s T-X had direct T-38 roots and flew on multiple occasions before the company’s participation in the competition abruptly ended. , Scaled Composites So yeah, Boeing’s T-X has some huge shoes to fill, and doing so will be no easy task. Yet the selection of Boeing to provide this capability means that the storied planemaker will be building tactical jets for decades to come, regardless of what happens to their F-15 and F/A-18 production lines. Paired with winning the Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone contract, Boeing’s historic St. Louis plant now has a bright future. And this means that Boeing will remain capable of bidding on future tactical aircraft programs, with the capacity and brain trust intact to remain a serious contender. Just a year or two ago such a situation was very much in doubt. Boeing Although the loss may be disappointing for Lockheed Martin, which could have possibly become America’s only tactical jet manufacturer by the latter half of the 2020s, competition is not a bad thing, even for the companies that lose some contracts. And let’s face it, Lockheed has plenty already on its plate right now. Many indicators point to the possibility that Boeing was super aggressive fiscally speaking with their T-X bid, which is not surprising as they really needed this win. It was literally an existential necessity for the company’s defense arm. The possibility of slim margins and elevated corporate risk for an aggressively bid fixed-price contract like this could put into question its profitability proposition, but winning the T-X is not about short-term profits. If the T-38 is any indication, this plane will be flying for many decades, likely until a human isn’t really needed in the cockpit for most missions. That means there will be a steady flow of support and development contracts over the life of the fleet. Being the OEM, Boeing has by far the best chance of winning those contracts and in some cases, they will come without competition. And once again, and maybe most importantly, it keeps the company in the tactical jet production game for the long term. T-X under construction at Boeing’s St. Louis facility., Boeing There is also prestige involved here too. Do you know what every USAF fighter pilot minted in the last five decades has in common? They are all T-38 Talon pilots. Being able to claim the mantle of providing the platform at the very heart of USAF’s jet combat pilot production is a huge deal that provides unique influence. Boeing’s T-X will become the next generation of USAF fighter pilots’ first jet aircraft they will have ever flown. These men and women will start making their reputation and transform into fighter pilots at its controls. Some of them will even grow to become USAF decision makers. So that first impression can end up being a very powerful and potentially lucrative thing. A T-38C Talon taxies in after a training sortie. , USAF Outside of the Pentagon, on the international jet trainer market, Boeing’s airframe is set to become the latest and greatest airframe to be had, one which the USAF was willing to literally rest its air combat future upon. Plus, foreign air arms looking to buy advanced jet trainers will know that going with the USAF’s pick means they can take advantage of continued development and an expansive and robust logistical support system that will benefit deeply from economies of scale. So we aren’t just talking about the up to 475 trainer jets that the USAF could buy, we are also talking about high export potential as well. But let’s be honest here, this jet isn’t just a trainer, it’s also a light fighter. In fact, it has the same base powerplant as the F-20—an aircraft that was notorious for its agility and raw performance. When compared to its T-38 predecessor, the thrust difference alone is staggering. Boeing’s T-X takes off in full burner. , Boeing The T-38’s two J85 turbojets provide 5,800lbs of thrust combined. Boeing’s T-X, with its single GE-F404 turbofan, has nearly three times that at roughly 17,200lbs of thrust. The jet also has twin tails, slats, and big leading-edge root extensions (LERXs) that will provide exceptional low-speed handling and general agility. And none of this is surprising as these attributes likely helped when it comes to winning the T-X contract. The USAF has always eyed the T-X as a potential next-generation aggressor platform, offering somewhere close to F-16’s performance but at far lower operating and acquisition cost. The need for more adversary support has become glaring as 5th generation stealth fighters aren’t challenged by small formations of fighters and flying 5th generation fighters against other 5th generation fighters for basic air-to-air training is massively wasteful and frankly not fiscally sustainable. Private contractors will fulfill a portion of this demand, but the USAF will need to maintain the aggressor units it has today and provide additional capacity in the future, but in a more efficient manner. This is precisely where the T-X will likely come into play. Boeing’s T-X looks fast sitting still., Boeing The small size of the T-X will make it a real challenge to spot during within-visual range fights. Based on the design and the amount of thrust it has—as much as a JAS-39 Gripen multi-role fighter—it could turn out to be a very nasty little jet to tangle with. Even the embedded training systems that will be a main staple of the T-X, in general, could help provide expanded realistic air-to-air training at far lower costs than what has been realized in the past. Also, considering it will be able to lug around jamming pods and captive training missiles, it could really fill the role of a 4th generation bad guy nicely without major modifications. But strap on a small AESA radar and an electronic warfare system or infrared search and track—podded or internal—and you don’t only have an incredible aggressor aircraft but also a straight-up affordable light fighter. The Pentagon has no requirement for a light fighter aircraft today, but in the future one based on Boeing’s T-X could be exported abroad much like the F-5 was decades ago. Lockheed’s T-X entrant, the T-50/T-100, has done just that, with the F-50 and FA-50 version being exported by South Korea’s Korean Aerospace Industries to multiple air arms around the globe. FA-50 was derived from the T-50, which Lockheed Martin’s T-X entrant, the T-100, was directly derived from. There is a market for light fighters that possess many of the features of heavier designs but cost far less to purchase and operate. , ROKAF Considering it is more about sensors, communications, and munitions than raw performance and weight-lifting capabilities when it comes to succeeding in most aspects of air combat these days, a fighter version of Boeing’s T-X could offer a lot of capability in a small and relatively cheap package. But most of all, it would have a huge support infrastructure in place that benefits from economies of scale thanks to its trainer cousin. The U.S. also benefits strategically from having an aircraft like Boeing’s T-X in production. The F-16 has moved to reduced production in South Carolina and it’s not clear just how long that line will remain open. The Eagle and Super Hornet lines could also wind down in the latter half of the next decade. So having a non-stealth, far less complex and costly light tactical jet being produced gives the Pentagon flexibility should it find that such an aircraft, or just a more basic tactical jet capacity in general, is needed sometime in the future. Even during a time of great tension, a light fighter version of this aircraft could be produced, or even production could be diverted from trainer configurations to combat ones to help back-fill for more capable fighters. This flexibility comes at no cost as a new trainer is needed and will be in production anyway. Boeing There is also the U.S. Navy and their T-45 Goshawks that are already decades old to consider. The T-45 still has a lot of life ahead of it and some of the fleet is going through a service life extension program now, but the T-45 pales in comparison to the performance of Boeing’s T-X and eventually, the Navy will have to figure out what it will replace the T-45 with. As it sits now, Boeing seems poised in just about the best position imaginable to provide such an aircraft and I would venture to guess that they designed their T-X entrant at least with some consideration that a navalized version could be required in the future. That aircraft will be unique to the current iteration, but building a new variant of an existing type that is already in widescale use and production is far less expensive than starting from scratch. Boeing already has an amazing relationship with NAVAIR and knows the carrier-based aviation environment very well, producing the Super Hornet and Growler, as well as the upcoming MQ-25, that fly off of the Navy’s supercarrier decks. They are also the OEM for the T-45 itself after acquiring McDonnell Douglas—the T-45’s original manufacturer—back in 1996. Now consider that Boeing will very likely be building hundreds of USAF trainers in the coming decades and you will come to the conclusion that they would be pretty hard to beat when it comes to potentially building a couple hundred carrier-capable jet trainers for the Navy. The T-45 was based on the BAe Hawk trainer that was already decades old when the first T-45 airframe was delivered in the mid 1990s. The type has a lot of service life left but eventually, it will need to be replaced. , USN There are also roughly four dozen F-5Ns and F-5Fs that that provide fleet adversary support for the USMC and Navy that won’t last forever either. They are already on their second lives after being retired from the Swiss Air Force. The T-X would be very well suited to take up that role as well and would offer far superior performance over the F-5. Finally, Boeing’s win breaks Sweden’s SAAB—Boeing’s partner of the T-X design—directly into America’s tactical aircraft universe. If anything, SAAB has proven to be resourceful and innovative, and brings with it a unique operational mindset when it comes to fast jets. SAAB fighters are hardy, ultra-reliable, built to operate with minimal ground support infrastructure and personnel, and relatively inexpensive to fly. This is a very useful viewpoint to bring to the table in an era when the newest American fighters hitting the skies tend to have lower availability rates than those designed in the 1970s. They also rely on heavy infrastructure and long, pristine runways—something that won’t be assured in future conflicts . SAAB’s aircraft are designed with austere airfield operations very much in mind. SAAB JAS-39 blasts off a snowy strip. , Milan Nykodym/wikicommons I’m not saying that the T-X was designed to meet all of Sweden’s unique needs, but I think SAAB’s unique viewpoint when it comes to air combat and aircraft design is something that is sorely needed here in the United States. By the indications the USAF is giving about future operational demands, many in its highest ranks would probably agree. Beyond the terms of the deal that the USAF struck with Boeing, their T-X was the only clean-sheet design and thus the newest of the lot. Clearly, the USAF sees a lot of value in the aircraft’s fresh potential and ability to evolve. In essence, the flying force is accepting additional risk in order to benefit from this potential by choosing Boeing’s aircraft over two well-established and far more mature designs. Boeing Considering the budgetary realities of the present day, this makes a lot of sense. The USAF can afford to gamble a bit more on their next generation trainer in order to get the best future-proofing available via a totally new, purpose-built design. But even if defense dollars were more scarce, Boeing’s T-X, as we have established in detail, is more than just a new trainer. The country is better off with a design that is built specifically for the USAF’s unique needs today, while also having the ability to evolve and accomplish other missions for a wide variety of users tomorrow. We can’t wait to hear more about Boeing’s design, including some raw performance metrics. Stay tuned, once the appeal window closes, Boeing and the USAF should open the information floodgates and allow us to get a far better look at their brand new and incredibly promising jet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 21, 2019",Canada Considers Buying Huge Non-Flyable Drone From Germany To Meet Arctic Patrol Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Germany is reportedly looking to finally sell off what remains of its abortive RQ-4E Euro Hawk drone program to Canada, which could use the unmanned aircraft to patrol its claims in the steadily more contested Arctic region . Unfortunately, the pilotless surveillance plane lacks essential components, including its navigation and flight control systems, which render it unflyable in its present form, raising questions about what value it would actually have for the Canadians. The Associated Press was the first to report the possible deal, which is still very much in its infancy. Canadian authorities subsequently confirmed that had reached out to the Germans for information about the Euro Hawk, a variant of Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk drone , but said they were still far from making a final decision about what system to buy to meet the needs of the country’s Arctic drone surveillance program, according to CBC . “As part of its technical assessment, the government sought information from suppliers to better understand the technology and the solutions available,” Marie-Anyk Cote, a Canadian government spokesperson, told CBC . “It is still premature to speculate which remotely piloted aircraft system will be purchased.” For Germany, taking this opportunity to offload the lone RQ-4E, as well as ground control stations, and other components, would make sense. The Euro Hawk program has been a debacle for authorities in Berlin since the rollout of the inaugural aircraft in 2009. The first and only RQ-4E Euro Hawk at its rollout ceremony in 2009., Northrop Grumman The Germans originally planned for the drones to replace five aging Cold War-era Dassault-Breguet Atlantique maritime patrol planes it had converted into electronic intelligence platforms. European defense consortium EADS, which subsequently evolved to form present-day Airbus, was to have supplied a signals intelligence package for the new unmanned aircraft. After minor trouble during the initial test and evaluation phase, in 2013, Germany canceled the Euro Hawk program after it confirmed that European aviation authorities had refused to certify the plane to fly over the continent under U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization rules because it lacked an automatic anti-collision system. The concern was that the unmanned aircraft could put civilian aircraft at risk in Europe’s congested airspace, but the decision also meant that the German military would have been unable to operate the aircraft at home for training purposes or launch it on actual missions from their own bases. Better to have a “horrible end than a horror without end,” then-German Minister of Defense Thomas de Maiziere told legislators in justifying the decision to cancel the project. At that point, Germany had only taken delivery of the one RQ-4E, but had spent approximately $823 million on the program overall. An attempt to reboot the project in 2014 was unsuccessful. Attempt to recoup any amount of that cost could be a boon for the Germans, who are presently struggling to revitalize their military after years of neglect and accusations of mismanagement . Germany’s RQ-4E was derived from the RQ-4 Global Hawk., Northrop Grumman In theory, the proposal might give Canada a chance to acquire a Global Hawk-like drone, which it had considered purchasing in the past, at a fraction of the price of a new aircraft. A single new RQ-4 could set back the Canadians more than $130 million. The high-flying, long-endurance Global Hawk could be useful for patrolling the Arctic, which is growing in strategic and economic significance and seeing a steady increase in Russian and Chinese military and civilian maritime activity. However, the RQ-4E is not well suited to the demands of maritime surveillance, which would include the need to fly lower to investigate particular items of interest. The U.S. Navy has recently begun flying its own dedicated long-range, maritime surveillance derivative of the RQ-4, the MQ-4C Triton . This aircraft has a reinforced fuselage, structural changes to prevent dangerous amounts of ice from building up on the wings and air intake, and greater protection against lightning strikes. An infographic showing the various new features of the MQ-4C Triton., Northrop Grumman The bigger problem is that the RQ-4E is reportedly nowhere near flyable at all and the Germans do not even appear to still have the critical components, such as the navigation system and flight control system, to offer as part of the sale. The remnants of the drone have at best “scrap value,” Andrej Hunko, a German legislator from the country’s Left Party, who first obtained information about the possible sale to Canada on Sept. 19, 2018, told The Associated Press . “The sale will, therefore, recoup at best a small portion of the tax money spent,” he added. “I expect the loss will amount to several hundred million Euros.” If they were to pursue this deal, the Canadians would face the expensive prospect of getting the drone working again. Even then, the purchase would only give them a single Global Hawk-type aircraft to meet the broad area demands of the Arctic surveillance program. It is possible that Canada has inquired about the RQ-4E as a potential source of spare parts to support a larger Global Hawk or Triton purchase in the future. They could be similarly interested more in the ground control stations that would come as part of the package than the drone hulk itself. Unfortunately, Canada’s Arctic surveillance drone program has run into its own entirely separate problems, as well. In 2015, Canada spent more than $30 million on a technical assessment to help firm up its requirements for employing unmanned aircraft to patrol the Arctic. The plan was to have whichever drones the country selected in operation by 2017 . Despite the Canadian government’s plan to have the civil agency Transport Canada oversee the patrols, the country’s authorities have struggled to acquire any suitable aircraft due to the limitations of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) international arms control agreement. This set of export controls puts drones broadly in the same category as missiles, making it more difficult for any party to the arrangement to get the necessary approval to buy and sell them. Canada now only expects to start taking delivery of drones for Arctic missions in 2020 . If the shell of Germany’s RQ-4E, or any of the remaining portions of the Euro Hawk program, is still under the purview of the MTCR, it could easily render the entire proposal a non-starter. It is hard to see how Canadian authorities would be willing to go through all of that trouble to secure a single drone only to have to spend additional time and resources getting to get it into an operational state. If there is any actual value in the German components, officials in Berlin might have better luck selling them to the United States. The U.S. Air Force has lost two RQ-4s in the last two years and has salvage portions of both of those aircraft, which could include various mission systems. One of the U.S. Navy’s MQ-4Cs also recently suffered a serious accident , leading that service to ground its entire fleet of the drones. But if the pieces that are left of Euro Hawk are in the condition that the Left Party’s Hunko says they are, it seems more likely that they’ll continue to sit in storage until Germany finally decides to dispose of them for good and truly bring the program to its “horrible end.” Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air MQ-4C Q-4 Unmanned"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 26, 2019",My Observations And Questions After Finally Seeing F-35Bs Operate From HMS Queen Elizabeth,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What a crazy week it has been for the F-35 program and the F-35B in particular. In the space of just a few days, the type racked up its first U.S. combat mission , its first operations aboard the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , and its first total loss crash and pilot ejection . It was definitely a mixed bag, but as I noted to readers on Friday, the F-35 program can only be incredibly proud of its safety record. Sure there have been plenty of close calls, but going through nearly 12 years of tortured developmental and operational flying (18 if you count the Joint Strike Fighter X-plane fly-off, but you really shouldn’t) without an in-flight crash like the one of Friday really is quite amazing. F-35s hitting the Queen Elizabeth’s deck for the first time is a huge milestone for the Royal Navy and the UK Ministry of Defense as a whole. After entirely forfeiting its fixed-wing aircraft carrier capacity eight years ago with the retirement of the Harrier and the aging Invincible class carriers that took them to sea, getting that capability back, and in an expanded form, is quite exciting. In fact, I have never seen UK defense enthusiasts this amped up—almost to a comical degree, to be honest—about anything in the past. But when you consider they saw a staple Royal Navy capability suddenly strangled to its death nearly a decade ago, Friday’s milestone couldn’t have come soon enough. Apparently, there has been some controversy about how this big event was handled by the Royal Navy’s public affairs team. Regardless, some great images have come out of the F-35B’s inaugural operations from Queen Elizabeth’s deck as the ship sails off the east coast of the United States and I have some observations I would like to share and questions I would like to ask about a few of them. Royal Navy This is a great shot of the ship underway while an F-35B makes its approach. In the future, the aircraft will execute rolling landings on her deck, which you can read all about in this past piece of mine . I do wonder what that big tower is for? We know the F-35B is very sensitive to lightning (ironic I know) and the USMC has to set up special lightning towers around their aircraft when parked in the open in storm-prone locales, but I have never seen something like this on an American amphibious assault ship before. Maybe there is another reason for the tower. Let us know in the comments below if you have an answer. Royal Navy This image shows the stadium-like observation area inside the control tower area on HMS Q ueen Elizabeth . It’s a very cool setup, but I do wonder as to exactly what standards the ship was designed and built? Those huge panes of glass are great for visibility, but can they sustain any significant battle or accident damage? Compared to what we see on any other carrier around the globe, this almost looks like a commercial setup. Maybe some sort of new glass technology was used, but still, it seems a bit sketchy for a warship, especially for one with minimal defenses . Royal Navy The ship’s flight operations area looks huge in this shot. That is a ton of space for a STOVL fighter, more than on any ship before—that is aside from when USMC AV8 Harriers operated from U.S. Navy supercarriers on a couple occasions in the past. It will be interesting to see what tempo of flight operations they can squeeze out of these big ships in comparison to U.S. Navy LHDs and LHAs . It’s also a reminder of how these ships could have been CATOBAR equipped and how licensed-built new ones could potentially be in the future if the U.S. Navy ever actually moves to procure a smaller , conventionally powered carrier design. As it sits now, these ships cost a fraction of the price of Ford class supercarrier. Royal Navy If anyone says the F-35B isn’t fascinating to watch land vertically, they are crazy. Royal Navy Here’s a great shot showing the F-35B and the navigational and flight control islands and their various sensors and communications systems, with the Artisan 3D radar above the rear island and the S1850M Long-Range Radar mounted atop the bridge. Note the electro-optical/infrared sensor system above the corner of the bridge as well. This likely operates in a similar role as the Mk20 system found installed atop American destroyer and cruiser bridges. Royal Navy In this picture, you can see one of the ship’s three ‘big board’ digital flight information displays. They give deck crew up to the minute information on aircraft status, a feature not found on American carriers. A stoplights system is also used to inform deck crews the status of the deck during air operations. I’m not totally clear on the Royal Navy’s shirt colors for deck crew. There may be some slight deviation from the U.S. Navy’s color organization which you can read all about in this past piece of mine . Royal Navy A nice detail view of the F-35B’s nose here. Note all the electro-optical gear on the jet’s pointy end. You are seeing the EOTS below the nose, a DAS aperture above the nose, a flight camera system in the dash that is used for debriefing, and the pilot’s notoriously complex helmet mounted display has its own electro-optical/night vision sensors as well. Royal Navy This is a great shot, obviously, it shows a very happy test pilot, but it also highlights the reality of stealth airframes. Here you can see how some of the aircraft seams around the cockpit area and the canopy have been masked with radar absorbent tape and gap fillers. The process is maintenance intensive, although Lockheed claims they have made major inroads over the F-22’s design when it comes to making maintaining the F-35’s skin a less arduous affair, with most of the low-observable coatings being ‘baked in’ to the aircraft’s skin itself. You can also see evidence of the F-35’s canopy delamination issue. It looks like some fairly crude repairs have been done to keep canopy in service. It’s also worth noting that these are test jets, not ones that would be used in combat, so in some cases, their radar absorbent coatings may have been allowed to erode further than those found on their front-line counterparts. Royal Navy This is another nice detail shot with the canopy open. Once again, notice the crude tape around the canopy’s frame. Also, note the patinaed panel in front of the refueling probe door. Royal Navy This head-on shot gives a good view of the jet’s unique lines. Royal Navy Now for some ski-jump shots! It’s awesome to see an actual ship’s ramp in use after years of land-based testing . Video of the F-35 using it is pretty freaky, the aircraft looks to be moving way too slow to fly, but it has the benefit of two pillars of thrust from its F135 engine and its attached lift-fan. Royal Navy , Royal Navy Once again, the ship has a huge operating area. With the USMC’s help, the Royal Navy will hopefully be able to load that deck up with a few dozen F-35Bs in the coming decade. The ship also appears to be sitting quite high in the water, which makes sense as she has no air wing aboard. Royal Navy Leaping off the ski-jump.

These aircraft belong to U.S. Navy Air Test and Evaluation Squadron VX-23 ‘Salty Dogs’ based out of NAS Patuxent River. These aircraft are ‘orange wired’ for testing duties and their pilots have led-up the F-35B’s shipboard integration program. The Royal Navy’s F-35Bs are scattered about in other locations, including in the UK , but it won’t be all that long now until they too get a shot at the carrier’s deck, too. Royal Navy This sight will hopefully become all too common in the coming decade, with American and UK F-35Bs operating from the Royal Navy’s two new carriers. Royal Navy F-35Bs finally in the pattern above HMS Queen Elizabeth! Royal Navy The Queen Elizabeth’s unique deck layout offers a ton of room for moving about and for launching, recovering, and storing aircraft. Here is some official video from the historic day: This is just the start of a long and complicated process and it will be great to watch the Royal Navy’s fixed-wing carrier aviation capability to be reborn in the coming years. But even though this event may be full of high-fives and excitement, the Royal Navy’s new carriers remain controversial fixtures within the Ministry of Defense’s portfolio. Just how much capability is the Royal Navy, and the MoD as a whole, going to have to sacrifice to keep these ships serviceable, especially considering the fleet is already facing operational shortfalls . But we will leave the debate over these issues for another day. In the meantime, the Royal Navy can bask a bit in the glory of their new ship and its stealth fighters. As for that F-35B crash at MCAS Beaufort, there has been no grounding order from the Marine corps, so F-35B operations continue as normal, although we still have no idea of what could have been the cause.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 20, 2019",Iran Claims Their RQ-170-Shaped Drones And Missiles Hit Targets In Syria Near U.S. Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran claims that it has used its Saeqeh armed unmanned aircraft , supposedly derived in some part from the U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone , along with short-range ballistic missiles , to carry out revenge strikes in eastern Syria against terrorist groups responsible for a brazen attack on a military parade in the city of Ahvaz more than a week ago. Iranian authorities have also accused foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia and the United States, of aiding the militants in Ahvaz and launched its own retaliatory mission into a part of Syria just miles from where American and other coalition forces are operating in the country. Iran’s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) reportedly launched a total of six Qiam and Zulfiqar missiles and seven armed drones to attack members of the Ahvaz National Resistance , an Iranian Arab separatist group, and ISIS terrorists on Oct. 1, 2018. The target area was near the town of Haijin, north of the city of Al Bukamal , the latter of which is situated close to the Iraqi border. Iranian officials did not offer a detailed accounting of the results of the strikes, saying only that they had “ killed and wounded ” enemy fighters. On Sept. 22, 2018, five armed gunmen attacked a parade in Ahvaz as part the country’s Sacred Defense Week , which marks the beginning of the Iran-Iraq War . Members of the IRGC were present and the militants reportedly wore various military and IRGC uniforms, allowing them to better sneak into position before opening fire and killing 25 people, including a four-year-old child, and wounding 70 more. Iranian security forces killed all of the attackers and arrested nearly two dozen other suspects in the aftermath of the incident. “Iranian forces did conduct no-notice strikes last night and we see open source reports stating that they were targeting militants it blamed for the recent attack on an Iranian military parade in the Middle Euphrates River Valley,” U.S. Army Colonel Sean Ryan, a U.S. Central Command spokesperson, told CNN . “At this time, the Coalition is still assessing if any damage occurred and no Coalition forces were in danger.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=NxK2J9fNFec At the same time, an unnamed U.S. source also informed CNN that the strikes had come “within three miles” of American forces, which are currently engaged in operations with local partners against ISIS in the vicinity of Haijin. The same individual said that the United States had used satellite intelligence to observe Iranian forces moving mobile launchers into position in the country’s Kemansheh province. “Terrorists used bullets in Ahvaz,” General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the IRGC’s  Aerospace Force, said afterward in an interview with Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency. “We answered them with missiles.” Official video the Iranians subsequently released showed missile launches and drones dropping Sadid-345 miniature precision-guided glide bombs on their targets. One clip showed what looked to be a Saeqeh releasing one of the weapons from an internal bomb bay. It is difficult to confirm whether or not this video actually came from the latest strikes or if the footage is real at all. Observers have noted that previous pictures of the Saeqeh, which Iran says it reverse engineered from an American RQ-170 that it captured in 2011, does not appear to feature a sensor turret and would, therefore, not be unable to designate targets for the Sadids by itself. Similarly, existing publicly available images and video show the unmanned aircraft with external weapons rather than any sort of internal bay. Based on those pictures, it’s hard to see how there would be room inside the drone to carry any munitions at all. A lack of visible camera vibration when the Sadid falls away from the drone further suggests the clip might be entirely staged in some fashion. In addition, Iran continues to rely heavily on line-of-sight control links for its unmanned aircraft, which are range-limited and can easily experience difficulties in trying to transmit across complex terrain, such as hills or mountains. Since Iran doesn’t share a border with Syria, the missiles and the drones would have had to fly over Iraq to reach their targets, again raising the possibility that the footage of the drones is faked. If true, though, this would be the first-ever known combat use of the Saeqeh. But regardless of the immediate impact of the strikes, the Iranians seemed to have intended them more as a message to their international opponents. This also appeared to be the case after an unprecedented IRGC missile strike into Syria in 2017 . In September 2018, Iran also fired a barrage of Fateh 110 short-range ballistic missiles at Iranian Kurdish separatists based in northern Iraq. “This is the roaring of missiles belonging to the Revolutionary Guard of the Islamic Revolution,” a reporter in one Iranian state television broadcast said as he covered the actual launch of the missiles. “In a few minutes, the world of arrogance – especially America, the Zionist regime, and the Al Saud – will hear the sound of Iran’s repeated blows.” “The Zionist regime” is how Iranian authorities and state media refer to Israel. Al Saud refers to Saudi Arabia’s ruling monarchy. After the Ahvaz attack, Iran was quick to blame outside actors , specifically naming the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. One of the missiles carried the slogans “Death to America, Death to Israel, Death to Al Saud” in Farsi on its main body. “It is absolutely clear to us who committed this crime… and whom they are linked to,” Iranian president Hassan Rouhani had said afterward . “The government is ready to counter any action by the US, and the Americans will regret this.” In reality, it remains unclear who exactly was responsible for the death and destruction in Ahvaz. The Ahvaz National Resistance claimed to have carried out the attack on behalf of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz ( ASMLA ), a larger Arab separatist organization operating in self-imposed exile in The Netherlands. ISIS also took responsibility, releasing video of the attackers, but no clear evidence that they had pledged loyalty to the group beforehand. ASMLA subsequently released its own statement , saying it had nothing to do with the incident and that a splinter faction it had expelled in 2015 had committed the terrorist act in Iran. There is no clear evidence of the Ahvaz National Resistance and ISIS working together, either. A similar war of words had erupted after ISIS claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks in Iran’s capital Tehran on June 7, 2017. This was the incident that led to the first missile barrage in Syria, as well, which came along with a promise to conduct more such operations in the future if necessary. However, that was before U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration pulled out of the deal over Iran’s controversial nuclear program in May 2018 and began to reimpose a raft of sanctions against the Iranian government and that country’s economy, particularly in terms of oil sales. The United States’ regional allies, chiefly Israel and Saudi Arabia , have also taken an increasingly hard-line stance against Iran since then, all of which has led to tit-for-tat threats , actual skirmishes , and increasing tensions . Of course, it’s not the first time that American troops have been under threat from Iranian and Iranian backed forces in Syria, but the center of gravity for those previous skirmishes has been first to the southwest near a town called At Tanf . In 2017, U.S. Air Force combat jets shot down two much more proven Shahed 129 drones near this strategic location, one of which appeared to try and drop a Sadid munition near U.S. forces. By contrast, the latest missile strikes near Haijin are much deeper in areas under the control of the U.S.-led coalition and very publicly came from Iran directly. Whether or not the goal was specifically to make a threat to American personnel, the operation has made it clear that Iranian forces have the capability to strike in that part of Syria if necessary and are willing to do so to protect Iran’s interests. US special operations forces, at left, and a Jordanian UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter near the garrison at At Tanf., US Army The employment of the Saeqeh, which has dubious stealth qualities at best, still seems intended to further reinforce this point. Qiam and Zulfiqar also have the ability to strike targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and American-operated bases in the Middle East from other locations in Iran. It remains to be seen how this might change the calculus on the part of the United States and its allies, both in how they conduct operations in Syria and in their policy toward Iran. Just recently, it emerged that the U.S. military would be withdrawing U.S. Army Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries from Bahrain, Jordan, and Kuwait – which have the capability to engage short-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase of flight – in order to reallocate those resources elsewhere in the world . Separately, Trump has reportedly been interested in the past in extricating American forces from Syria and turning the fight over to a regional power , such as Saudi Arabia, but has since backed away from the plan. Now, the United States seems intent on remaining in Syria specifically to block the expansion of Iranian influence . The U.S. government is still supportive of the idea of building a new, formal regional political and military alliance to confront Iran , as well. US President Donald Trump, center, speaks at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Sept. 26, 2018. , Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA via AP Images Syria itself remains as volatile as ever as Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad continues to reassert control over the western portion of the country with Russian and Iranian help. Israel , and to a lesser extent Turkey , have thrown up roadblocks that continue to leave open the risk for miscalculations that could quickly lead to larger regional conflict. Iranian missiles and armed drones strike targets near American and other coalition forces only add to that danger. Reports that one of the Qiam missiles might have failed, sending a portion falling back to earth after launch, only further highlight the potential for even an accident to spark some sort of conflagration. An international incident between Tehran and Washington, where tensions are already high, could lead both sides to call upon their allies. In Iran’s case, this could easily include various non-state terrorist groups, specifically Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , too. Iran has its own asymmetric options, as well, including using weapons such as naval mines, swarming boat attacks, and shore-based missiles to blockade the strategic Strait of Hormuz, halting military and commercial maritime traffic in and out of the Persian Gulf. This is a serious threat you can read about in more detail here . https://youtube.com/watch?v=Hjeu6wBX7-Q In the end, whether or not the strikes had any immediate, tangible impact, the regime in Tehran has used the opportunity stand defiant against threats from the United States, and those from America’s allies, and show that it is willing to use the full extent of its very real arsenal to guard its own interests. The operation was a clear reminder to its enemies in the region that it can reach out and strike them without warning.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 2, 2018",Chinese Warship Passed Dangerously Close To American Destroyer During South China Sea Patrol,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has revealed that a ship from China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, recently maneuvered dangerously close to the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Decatur in the disputed South China Sea . The announcement followed reports that Chinese officials had decided not to hold a planned high-level meeting with U.S. defense officials, including Secretary of Defense James Mattis, as relations between the two countries become increasingly frigid over the status of the Southeast Asian body of water, an escalating trade war, arms sales to Taiwan , and accusations of Beijing’s attempts to influence American politics. The incident occurred on Sept. 30, 2018, near Gaven Reefs , in the especially contested Spratly Island chain. The PLAN destroyer, identified only as Luyang -class ship , came within 45 yards of Decatur ‘s bow, forcing the ship to change course in order to avoid a collision. The Chinese ship had already been conducting “increasingly aggressive maneuvers,” according to a statement from the U.S. Pacific Fleet, as well as issuing warnings for the American vessel to leave the area. The week before, U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers had also flown through international airspace above disputed portions of the South China Sea. “U.S. Navy ships and aircraft operate throughout the Indo-Pacific routinely, including in the South China Sea,” the Pacific Fleet release said. “As we have for decades, our forces will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows.” Decatur was on a so-called Freedom of Navigation Operation, or FONOP , a type of mission that is intended to reinforce the U.S. government’s disagreement with China’s assertion that the vast majority of the South China Sea is its sovereign territory. Since 2014 , the Chinese have been working on a massive reclamation project to turn previously uninhabitable reefs and other locations into manned outposts to bolster its claims. As of 2016, Chinese forces had expanded one of the two Gaven Reefs into a facility covering more than 170,000 square yards that includes a dock and a half a dozen fixed weapon emplacements. The first-in-class PLAN Type 052B destroyer Guangzhou , the lead ship of what the US government refers to the Luyang -class., Boleslav1 via Wikimedia That same year, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague in The Netherlands ruled that Gaven Reef (North) was entitled to a territorial sea 12 miles out to sea in any direction, but not an exclusive economic zone or any other national boundary. Gaven Reef (South) did not meet the criteria for any national claim. The Navy says Decatu r came within 12 miles of both Gaven Reefs and nearby Johnson Reef, which is also home to a Chinese outpost. All told, there are now eight major Chinese made-man outposts in the Spratlys. In May 2018 , China reportedly deployed both long-range surface-to-air missile systems and shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles to Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, and Subi Reef, a significant escalation in the situation that could make it more difficult for American forces to operate in the area during an actual crisis. There have also been reports that Chinese forces are stepping up efforts to try and jam American military aircraft flying in international airspace in the region, zapping their crews with at least temporarily blinding laser beams , and otherwise harassing those missions – something China has done in the past during periods of increased tensions . China’s air traffic controllers in the South China Sea have also increasingly sought to warn off American planes, telling them to leave the area to avoid any “ misunderstandings .” An annotated satellite image of the Chinese outpost at Gaven Reefs., DOD Though Chinese ships have shadowed naval FONOPs in the past, they have typically kept their distance. Before Decatur sailed by Gaven Reefs and Johnson Reef, the most recent naval FONOP had come in May 2018, when the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Higgins and the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Antietam cruised past islands in the equally contested Paracels chain , which lie further to the northwest of the Spratlys. This came after the U.S. military disinvited China from the annual Rim of the Pacific military exercise, or RIMPAC, near Hawaii, specifically citing Beijing’s man-made outpost construction and overall militarization of the South China Sea. That mission “contravened Chinese and relevant international law, seriously infringed upon Chinese sovereignty [and] harmed strategic mutual trust between the two militaries,” the Chinese Ministry of Defense said in a statement at the time, but there was no more serious attempt to hamper the American ships. “China will continue to take all necessary measures to defend the country’s sovereignty and security.” U.S. President Donald Trump did not order a single FONOP until almost six months into his tenure, amid what initially appeared to be warming ties between him and China’s President Xi Jinping. That has steadily proven not to be the case and we may begin to see an uptick in more controversial incidents as the U.S. and Chinese governments are now locked in an increasingly bitter trade war , as well as other disputes. “Maybe he’s [Xi] not [my friend] anymore, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump said during a press conference at the United Nations on Sept. 26, 2018. “I think we had a very good friendship.” The Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Antietam , which had taken part in the last FONOP in the South China Sea., USN At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Sept. 26, 2018, Trump accused China of meddling in the up-coming 2018 U.S. mid-term elections. The president did not offer any specifics about Chinese interference in the election process and it was not clear whether he had conflated the issue with reports of a Chinese-funded media blitz in the United States that is critical of the Trump Administration’s increasing tariffs on certain imported goods from China. This building friction between the two countries has also led to the cancelation of a series of significant meetings. On Oct. 1, 2018, the same day the Navy announced the incident with Decatur , The New York Times reported that Chinese officials had withdrawn from an annual diplomatic and security dialogue that was supposed to occur later in October. Secretary of Defense Mattis would have attended this meeting, which occurs specifically to offer a place for both sides to promote cooperation, voice grievances, and build trust. Unfortunately, as we at The War Zone have noted in the past, the Chinese have positioned themselves in the South China Sea very well both physically and politically, which will make it difficult, if not impossible for the United States to put pressure on them in any way that would force them to change course. FONOPs will likely have increasingly less of a meaningful impact this late in the game. Chinese military trucks carrying YJ-12 anti-ship cruise missiles during a parade in Beijing in 2015., Imaginechina via AP Images “In my interactions as U.S. chief of naval operations with the PLA Navy commander, Admiral Wu Shengli, Admiral Wu made clear that he thought the United States would have a more forceful reaction when China began its island-building,” retired U.S. Navy Admiral Jonathan Greenert, who last served as the Chief of Naval Operations under President Barack Obama, wrote in an August 2018 monograph for The National Bureau of Asian Research. “When there was no such response, the island-building campaign continued apace.” Now China is much more firmly ensconced in the region and has taken more aggressive action against foreign commercial activities in the past, sometimes leading to dangerous ramming incidents . The PLAN, along with the Chinese coast guard, which is now under the control of the country’s Central Military Commission, and the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, a sort of weaponized fishing fleet , work to provide a layered defense against intruders. Knowing all this, the unprecedented incident with Decatur may be an indication that China feels increasingly more willing to risk “getting physical” and challenge the U.S. military inside what it considers to be its own national territory.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 26, 2019",NATO Envoy Says U.S. Looking At Ways To ‘Take Out’ Russia’s Treaty-Violating Missiles (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has made a series of confusing remarks about Russia’s missiles that violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , and possible American responses to the deployment of those systems. The ambassador said the United States could pursue options to “take out” those weapons, but did not clearly explain whether this might involve the U.S. military fielding similar designs , greater missile defenses , or even a pre-emptive physical strike or non-kinetic attack . Considering the topic being discussed, the lack of clarity could have dangerous repercussions. Hutchison made her remarks at a press conference at the NATO headquarters in Belgium ahead of a meeting of top defense officials from the alliance’s member states on Oct. 2, 2018. Before taking up this post, she had served in the Senate from 1993 through 2013 as Republican from Texas and had spent time as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The U.S. government has accused Russia of violating the INF since at least 2013 with the development and subsequent operational deployment of a ground-launched, nuclear-capable land attack cruise missile , which the Russians call the 9M729, the U.S. military designates SSC-8, and the NATO has nicknamed “Screwdriver.” In 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the INF , which bans the possession of any type of land-based conventional or nuclear-capable missile that has a maximum range of between 310 and 3,420 miles. Russia has never publicly acknowledged the 9M729’s existence and the U.S. government has not released any specific details itself, but the missile reportedly has a range of more than 1,000 miles and possibly more than 1,500 miles. At the time of writing, Russia had not issued a direct response to Hutchinson’s latest comments. “If Russia continues to say they are not violating when the evidence is clear that they are, then diplomacy needs to be strengthened, and we need to look for other ways to bring Russia to the table on this issue,” Hutchison told the assembled reporters. “The countermeasures would be to take out the missiles that are in development by Russia in violation of the treaty.” U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison speaks at a press conference on Oct. 2, 2018., US DoS Confusingly, Hutchinson never once mentioned a “cruise missile” as being the weapon the Russians possessed that was in violation of the INF, instead stating twice that the system in question was a “medium-range ballistic missile,” or MRBM. There is no publicly available evidence that Russia is presently working on an MRBM and the U.S. government has never officially accused the Kremlin of pursuing such a weapon in violation of the INF. Furthermore, the ambassador described the Russian system that has breached the treaty as “in development,” when the United States described the 9M729 as operational in 2017. Experts had questioned whether Russia’s RS-26 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) actually had a range that fell under the terms of the INF, but the U.S. government treated that system as falling under and being in compliance with the separate New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). That issue is somewhat moot since the Kremlin publicly canceled development of that system earlier in 2018. There are no publicly available images of the 9M729 system, but it reportedly uses a transporter-erector-launcher similar to the existing 9K720 Iskander vehicle, seen here, which Russia also fields equipped with INF-compliant cruise missiles, as seen here, and short-range ballistic missiles ., Vadim Grishankin via Wikimedia There is also the possibility that the ambassador may have been referring to the U.S. government’s understanding of the range of Russia’s Avangard hypersonic boost glide vehicle, which the Kremlin says will enter operational service in 2019. Neither the United States nor Russia has ever publicly described this system as “medium-range” or in potential violation of the INF, though. Hutchinson did refer to the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 Fiscal Year, which ordered the U.S. military to begin examining the potential of fielding its own INF-breaching missile system , as well as dedicated defensive countermeasures to the 9M729. It seems most likely that she was describing a situation in which the United States could deploy these still notional systems to provide a counter to Russia’s land-based cruise missiles and seek to deter Russia from employing them. The video below includes footage of a test of Russia’s Avangard hypersonic boost glide vehicle on board what may be an RS-26 missile. “We are not moving in that direction right now,” she noted. “But we are trying to tell Russia, and you know, the United States Congress told Russia last year when they passed the Armed Services Bill about this time last year, that we know they have violated the treaty and we are beginning the research capabilities that are allowed by the treaty to deter a medium-range ballistic missile.” However, this appears to be the first time a U.S. official has ever suggested that any American development of an INF-breaking system would be specifically to hold Russia’s 9M729 units at risk. In addition, as a result of its latest Nuclear Posture Review , President Donald Trump’s Administration is already looking to develop and field sea-based ballistic and cruise missiles armed with low-yield nuclear warheads, which do not fall under the terms of the INF, ostensibly to deter various Russian developments. The U.S. government has even suggested it might be willing to halt work on those programs in exchange for Russia returning to compliance with the treaty. The Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland fires a Trident D-5 nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile during a test. The latest U.S. nuclear posture review calls for new low-yield warheads for this weapon to offer a more flexible response in part to Russian threats., USN Unfortunately, without any real clarification, there remains a possibility that Hutchison could have been referring to other means of neutralizing Russia’s INF-violating systems, or even a layered approach. This could include expanded and improved missile defenses in Europe or a so-called “ left-of-launch ” option that doesn’t seek to destroy the missiles outright, such as mass cyber attacks or electronic warfare strikes on command and control or even on the weapon’s guidance systems. There are reports that the United States considered employing these options against North Korea in 2017. In September 2018, the Trump Administration also announced that it had relaxed restrictions on offensive cyber warfare , at least in response to hostile cyber attacks, that the U.S. government had put in place under President Barack Obama. There is also the potential for the Russians to construe Hutchison’s remarks as a standing threat to launch a pre-emptive conventional or nuclear strike against their assets within their own borders. Similar concerns had emerged when the U.S. military began to more formally lay out its concept for what it referred to as “ prompt global strike ” under President George W. Bush. While Hutchison’s comments in context do not appear to actually include such a threat, they are so otherwise confusing as to run the risk of gross misinterpretation. This, in turn, is particularly dangerous given the present state of U.S.-Russian relations and the Kremlin’s own continued assertions that it needs to develop a wide array of new nuclear-capable “ super weapons ” to ensure that it can deter the United States and NATO. Russia says the video below shows its nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile , one of the Kremlin’s most controversial new strategic weapon developments, which you can read about in more detail here . Russia’s advanced strategic weapon developments “have shown the whole world that Russia is something to be reckoned with,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said on Oct. 2, 2018 . “To put it mildly, the whole world underestimated Russian industry, Russian defense industry, and all our achievements, saying that everything is rusty, their rockets don’t fly.” As always, it is important to note that the present U.S. military missile defense shield cannot even come close to negating Russia’s existing nuclear deterrent capabilities and looks unlikely to be able to do so at any time in the near future. But even the slightest implication of a pre-emptive American strike would help validate the Kremlin’s rhetoric and its decisions to pursue additional, highly flexible systems such as the 9M729. Russia itself has already taken an increasingly aggressive stance toward NATO members and other Western-aligned countries along its borders. While experts debate the exact nature of the policy , the Kremlin has also reportedly established an “ escalate-to-deescalate ” doctrine that could see the use of small nuclear strikes in an attempt to ward off outside military intervention in areas that Russia sees as within its sphere of influence. Neither Russia nor the United States have a “ no first use ” policy and both reserve the right to employ nuclear weapons, if appropriate, in response to non-nuclear threats. Hutchison’s unclear statements also increase the potential for a major miscalculation if Russia believes that the United States is seeking to undermine its weapon development programs. Computer and other system errors in the past have almost sparked apocalyptic nuclear exchanges and there is the distinct possibility that the Kremlin could now worry that any future failure might be the result of an American cyber attack or another form of sabotage – if it doesn’t already. This is something the United States has shown its willingness to do with the infiltration of the Stuxnet computer virus into Iranian nuclear facilities and reported plans for mass cyber attacks if the negotiations surrounding the controversial Iran deal had collapsed. The entire purpose of agreements such as the INF is to establish confidence-building measures and promote stability. It is right to want the Russians to be fully in compliance with this agreement and to criticize them for undermining its core principles. It is also important, for U.S. officials to be entirely clear about America’s stance and what it is prepared to do in response to the Kremlin’s violations of the treaty. Hopefully, there will be more clarity coming about exactly what the U.S. government’s policy is and what countermeasures Hutchison was referring that would let the United States “take out” Russia’s INF-violating missiles if it ever comes to that. Update: 3:30pm EST— Ambassador Hutchinson has issued a clarification making it clear that she did not intend her remarks to imply the threat of a pre-emptive strike. It still remains unclear, however, exactly what she meant when she said the United States could look into how it might “take out” Russia’s missiles and under what circumstances they would employ those options.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2018",U.S. Navy Releases Images Of Chinese Warship’s Dangerous Maneuvers Near Its Destroyer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has released a series of images showing the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Decatur ‘s close encounter in the South China Sea with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 052C Luyang II -class destroyer Lanzhou . The images show just how dangerous the Chinese ship’s maneuvering was and how close the two vessels were to a potentially serious accident . gCaptain was first to obtain the images, which showed Lanzhou pulling close in front of Decatur and then the two ships maneuvering apart. The images are likely to be still captures taken from the video feed from the sensor turret on the American destroyer’s MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter or an Insitu drone launched from Decatur . In its official statement, the Navy said the Chinese ship, which it initially identified only as a “ Luyang -class” vessel, came within 45 yards of the American destroyer, during the incident on Sept. 30, 2018. The Lanzhou , at right, is seen here sailing within 45 yards of the USS Decatur , at left., USN via gCaptain This might sound like a plentiful amount of space between the two ships, but for vessels displacing thousands of tons and which are relatively slow maneuvering, it is too close for comfort. Just for perspective, 45 yards is less than one-third of a ship length for Decatur . In 2017, two of the Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyers suffered separate collisions in the Western Pacific region, causing horrendous damage to the vessels and more importantly, the loss of multiple sailors’ lives. The two ships begin to separate., USN via gCaptain Decatur continues to maneuver away from Lanzhou. , USN After the Navy revealed the South China Sea incident had occurred, China’s Foreign Ministry responded by saying that Decatur had been in violation of their “indisputable sovereignty” in the area around Gaven Reefs in the disputed South China Sea . “We strongly urge the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistake and stop such provocative actions to avoid undermining China-U.S. relations and regional peace and stability,” the statement continued. The images show that the Lanzhou was the one responsible for the “proactive actions.” The Navy says that it remained 12 miles away from the actual Chinese-occupied man-made outpost on the Reef. Decatur had been in the area specifically to conduct a so-called Freedom of Navigation Operation patrol, or FONOP , which the United States performs in protest to China’s broad claims of ownership of the vast majority of the South China Sea. The U.S. government, along with the majority of the international community, does not recognize China position, which is an increasingly contentious issue you can read about in more detail in our initial analysis of the incident. It will also be interesting to see a more detailed account of this event as there is usually much more to these types of encounters than what is initially reported and still images can only tell us so much. We will report back when we find out more. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Around The Globe China Indo-Pacific News & Features"
Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 19, 2018",Sikorsky’s VH-92 Marches Towards Its Goal Of Flying The President As ‘Marine One’ in 2020,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, I have received a large number of inquiries from readers asking about what is going on with the VH-92 presidential helicopter program. It has been over a year since we last checked in about the next generation ‘Marine One’ that had just made its first flight. Since then, the program has been moving ahead and although risks remain that are concerning some, the program has been moving through development quite smoothly. Sikorsky posted a video of the VH-92 in testing last Spring, providing our first glimpses of its configuration. Check it out below: This VH-92 looks a lot like an ordinary S-92 Helibus, aside from a few aerials maybe. The biggest difference on this aircraft are the three ventral fairings for the helicopter’s AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis based Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) system. You can read all about DIRCM here and here , but the laser-based infrared-guided missile blinding system serves as the backbone of the defensive countermeasure suite on Air Force One, Marine One, and a wide array of American and allied military aircraft today. Components of the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system that is based around the latest, miniaturized AN/AAQ-24 laser turret assembly., Northrop Grumman Clearly, this test VH-92 lacks key components, including satellite communications and the missile approach warning sensors that cue the DIRCM system, but still, it’s great to see the final VH-92 configuration beginning to take shape in a flying form. Sikorsky also flies an aircraft it calls its VH-92 demonstrator—seen below in pictures from a Northrop Grumman event. It’s not clear how close this aircraft is to the final VH-92 configuration, but it does sport an HMX-1 -like color scheme and appears to have a broadband satellite communications systems installed, with its array being situated above the rear section of its fuselage, just before its tail boom. Northrop Grumman We still don’t know exactly what the VH-92’s interior will look like. You can see exactly what HMX-1’s fleet of 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns, which the VH-92s are set to replace, look like on the inside in this previous piece of mine. The S-92 has amazing potential when it comes to VIP interiors. The wide, long, and tall cabin offers more of a long-range private jet feel than that of the cramped confines that most helicopters offer. Multiple room layouts are common, with a wide variety of seating options. The S-92 really does offer great potential for spacious luxury, unlike most helicopters, a factor that makes it a logical replacement for the VH-3D that also has a spacious, luxury bus-like cabin., www.aircharter.co.uk A very talented 3D designer, Keith Peters of Kp3-D, who does a lot of rendering work for Sikorsky, delivered the renderings below to the company, according to his company website. It’s not perfectly clear if they reflect the final interior configuration of for productions VH-92s, but they are quite reminiscent of the interior of Donald Trump’s personal Boeing 757 jet. Trump does know helicopters , having operated a helicopter airline for a period of time and he has owned a small fleet of S-76s for decades for personal and corporate transport purposes. With this in mind, it wouldn’t be surprising if Trump has given some form of input on the design, especially as he certainly has done so with the upcoming Air Force One replacement aircraft. www.kp3-d.com www.kp3-d.com www.kp3-d.com As of April 2018, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) said it expected to wrap up the VH-92’s development phase, which began in 2014, sometime in the middle of 2019. After that, it would assess whether the helicopter is ready to enter production, starting with an initial batch of six aircraft. The Navy began the project after President Barack Obama ordered then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to terminate the previous VH-71 program in the face of “requirement creep” and massively escalating costs, which you can read about in more detail here . The service has already received more than $1.2 billion to develop the new VH-92A and is set to get another nearly $900 million to spend on the project in the Fiscal Year 2019 budget . Around $245 million will support continued developmental work, while the remaining funds are for the procurement of actual low rate production helicopters. The VH-3Ds have served for many decades but they are reaching the end of their service life. Yet it’s still amazing to think of just how many nice features the Sea King helicopter had for the VVIP role when they started flying the mission way back in the early 1960s . The big twin passenger doors are still tough to beat, even on the VH-92, as is it’s big picture window that has been a set piece in many famous White House photos. Even its latent amphibious capabilities could be useful in an emergency. But still, the VH-92 is a great replacement for the venerable ‘White Top’ Sea Kings., AP At present, the U.S. Navy plans to buy 23 VH-92As. A total of 21 of which will go to the Marine Corps’ Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), where they will replace the existing VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters in the “white top” presidential airlift fleet responsible for providing “Marine One” aircraft to fly the president, his family, and closest advisors around at home and abroad . Four of these Marine VH-92As will be dedicated training aircraft. The last two aircraft will remain with NAVAIR for continued testing purposes. This will help with the integration of improved and updated systems in the future, which could include upgraded communications and self-protection systems . “We’re not going to make any changes while in development. But with all aircraft, changes need to be made for obsolescence or new capability,” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Eric Ropella, the VH-92A program manager, told Rotor and Wing International magazine in April 2018. “One example I’ll give is the safety/situational awareness upgrade to add another MFD [multi-function display] to the cockpit. Right now the baseline S-92 comes with four … there’s two on the pilot and co-pilot sides, this one would be in the center.” NAVAIR That same month, however, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that raised concerns about the VH-92A program’s progress. In spite of a new cost estimate at that time that showed the Navy had actually found ways to save $123 million on the project, there were concerns that there were still pending changes that could potentially require significant modification to the helicopter’s design. “To date, there have been minimal design changes that required modifications,” GAO’s investigators wrote. “Some of the modifications included the addition of formation lights, wireless antennas, and design changes to radios needed for wideband line of sight capability.” The program office was also looking into changing the style of the forward door to improve the view for individuals entering and exiting the helicopter and therefore make it safer for them to do so. NAVAIR and Sikorsky, now a division of Lockheed Martin, had also not yet been able to find a way to prevent the force from the rotor blades from the destroying the grass and other plants on the White House’s South Lawn, which currently serves as the main helipad there. The GAO report states : “The lawn is a highly visible, size-constrained landing zone where damage to the White House grounds needs to be minimized. Currently, however, the program is not meeting a key system capability requirement to land the aircraft without adversely affecting the landing zone (including the White House Lawn).” More importantly, there was work still to be done to ensure features on the helicopter to harden it against an electromagnetic pulse associated with a nuclear blast work as intended. There were still tweaks necessary to the aircraft’s propulsion system, as well. All of this raised questions about the accuracy of the lower cost estimate. “The items cited by the Government Accountability Office have been resolved or are being addressed by Sikorsky and will not impact on-time delivery of fully capable VH-92A helicopters to our customer,” Lockheed Martin told Breaking Defense in a statement in May 2018. “Sikorsky design will meet all program requirements and we have been executing to an accelerated schedule.” If everything goes to plan, the Marines expect HMX-1 will begin transitioning to the VH-92As in 2019 and that this process will be complete by the end of 2022, according to their official aviation plan for 2018. The service expects to reach initial operational capability with the helicopter in 2020. To further support the initial phases of the transition process, in February 2018, NAVAIR hired private contractor PHI, Inc. to supply a single commercial Sikorsky S-92A to support pilot and aircrew proficiency training at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Maryland to support the VH-92A program. Spotters have since seen that helicopter , sporting PHI’s highly visible black-and-yellow paint scheme flying in the greater Washington, D.C. area and near the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia where HMX-1 is situated. USMC The Navy’s lease on this aircraft lasts for one year, with the helicopter flying approximately 30 hours each month for a total of 360 flight hours in total. The service has the option to extend this deal for up to another five months. PHI also happens to be the parent company of firm operating shadowy gray S-92s for another, unknown arm of the U.S. government. So there you have it, a snapshot of where the presidential helicopter replacement program is at and where it’s headed. Hopefully, when the time comes, the USMC and the White House will introduce their new helicopter with a bit more fanfare than how the new presidential limousine was introduced a couple weeks ago. But limousines come and go, a new Marine One helicopter comes only once in a generation and the VH-92 has some big boots fill considering the VH-3 has flown the President safely for over half a century. For the S-92 program, not only does VH-92 mean the type will fly the most powerful person in the world around, but it also means the type is finally entering service with the U.S. military—a reality that could result in other orders to satisfy other mission sets down the line.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 24, 2018","Syria Finally Gets Its S-300 SAM System, But It’s A Token Capability At Best","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it has completed shipping S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Syria’s government and will now begin training Syrian troops to operate them. Though it is possible that this is just an initial tranche of equipment, that is not what Russian officials are indicating and by sending just four transporter-erector-launchers, or TELs, the Kremlin appears to be giving Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad a very minimal capability. We at The War Zone had said this would likely happen after the Russians first announced their plans to deliver the weapons in September 2018. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the announcement at a Russian Security Council on Oct. 2, 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired the gathering. Russian authorities first announced they would turn over an unspecified number of S-300s to Assad’s regime on Sept. 24, 2018, in the aftermath of a bizarre incident in which Syrian air defenders accidentally shot down one of Russia’s Il-20 Coot surveillance aircraft after an Israeli air strike against targets near the country’s Mediterranean coastline. “In conformity with the presidential decision, we have begun to carry out a number of measures to reinforce Syria’s air defense systems in order to ensure better protection for our servicemen,” Shoigu reported to Putin during the meeting. “We have completed the delivery of S-300 systems. It included 49 pieces of equipment, including radars, control vehicles and four launchers.” Russia’s Defense Minister also said that the country had begun training Syrian personnel to operate the surface-to-air missile system. It will take approximately three months before Assad’s forces are ready to put their new S-300s into operation, according to Shoigu. A Russian trailer-mounted transporter-erector-launcher belonging to an S-300 surface-to-air missile system., Uliana Solovyova/Sputnik  via AP He did not specify what type of S-300 system the Russians had delivered. However, Shoigu did say it would have a maximum range of just over 124 miles, which observers noted would be in line with the specifications of the PMU-2 variant using the 48N6E3 missile. The S-300PMU-2, also known as the Favorit, is the most advanced export version of the system that Russia has produced. Separately, Shoigu noted that a unified air defense mechanism would be in place by Oct. 20, 2018. This is likely a reference to Russia’s plan to deliver equipment to Assad’s forces that will allow them to receive Russian identification friend or foe signals and rapidly identify the Kremlin’s aircraft, hopefully reducing the chances of future accidents. Whatever these systems entail, they should also give the Kremlin greater linkages to and situational awareness of the Syrian air defense network’s day-to-day operations, as well. “I would like to note that it is a very timely step and we are very grateful to Russia for its efforts,” Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem had said in an interview with Russia’s quasi-official media network RT on Sept. 30, 2018 . “[The] S-300 is enough to respond to these threats [from Israel].” However, as we at The War Zone have previously noted, it seems unlikely that this will be the case. It seems even less likely if the Russians do not supply any additional S-300 components to Syria in the coming months. There had been reports that Russia might deliver one or more full S-300 regiments to Assad’s forces, which would have included a dozen TELs and would have been potentially able to guard multiple sites simultaneously. With a third of that total, the minimum amount for what Russia considers a battalion-sized element, the system will provide a token capability at best. With a maximum range of around 124 miles, it’s true that a Syrian S-300 system situated in the southern portion of the country near the capital Damascus would be able to reach out into the Mediterranean and even into Israel proper . It would also cover much of Lebanon’s airspace, which Israeli jets routinely use to launch standoff strikes into Syria, but with the same limitations. But from that position, it wouldn’t be able to cover areas in northwestern Syrian. These include some of the same areas that Israel struck that touched off the entire chain of events leading to the delivery of the S-300s in the first place. The maximum range is a dubious metric to begin with since the systems would only be able to engage high-flying aircraft with specific signatures at the longer distances and only under optimal conditions where their radars have a good line-of-sight to the target. Israeli jets could fly low use hills, mountains, other terrain features, readily available along Syria’s southern borders, to help mask their approach. The Syrians will not be able to shoot them down as they take off in Israel, either. On top of that, it’s not at all clear what sort of density of fire four TELs, each of which can have at most four missiles ready to fire at a time, would provide within that coverage area. Russia already has its own S-300s , along with more capable S-400s , in Syria guarding its naval base in the port city of Tartus on the Mediterranean and its Khmeimim air base only slightly further inland. Previous satellite imagery shows a typical setup for TELs for the S-400 system, which are very similar to those for the S-300, grouped very closely together in fours to provide sufficient firepower against potential threats. The site also features a short-range Pantsir-S1 air defense vehicle to guard those launchers. Syria has its own Pantsirs , but only has a limited number of them, which it might not be able to spare to defend even higher priority surface-to-air missile systems. Even if the Syrians ultimately receive a more robust S-300 capability, though this would certainly increase the risks to Israeli aircraft, there is no indication that this would truly deter it from continuing its aerial campaign. Israel has made no secret of its determination of prevent Iran and Iranian-supported groups, such as the Lebanese militant organization Hezbollah , strengthen their position in Syria and potentially use it as a staging group to threaten Israeli interests. The Israeli Air Force lost one F-16I Sufa combat jet during operations over Syria in February 2018 and has seen other aircraft damaged, underscoring the costs it is willing to endure to follow through with these strikes. It now has an operational unit of F-35I Adir stealth fighters with which to conduct especially high-risk operations, as well. The video below covers the activities of Russia’s S-300s in Syria. The S-300s would also be prime targets during any future Israeli air strikes and it’s unlikely that Russia would be inclined to keep supplying replacement systems indefinitely, if at all. Israel has already reportedly launched operations specifically to target more modern surface-to-air missile systems that Iran has deployed to Syria and has destroyed other Syrian air defenses in the past. Israel has also already gained significant insight into the capabilities of the S-300 system specifically by participating in training exercises that feature older variants in Greece . Israel’s arch nemesis Iran has also received PMU-2 variants , making it even more likely that the Israeli Air Force has been developing tactics, techniques, and procedures to mitigate this threat. The constrained environment also places limitations on Syrian forces since Israelis are so close to the target areas that they have used their own Arrow 3 anti-missile interceptors to shoot down Syrian surface-to-air missiles on at least one occasion. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claim they have also used the shorter-range Iron Dome defense system , intended only to shoot down unguided rockets, artillery shells, and mortar bombs, to engage Syrian SAMs, as well. It’s not entirely clear how that would necessarily work, given the capabilities of Iron Dome, and the reports, though official, might be in error or actually be in reference to more Arrow 3 intercepts or the use of another system, such as David’s Sling . It is worth noting that in those cases, Syria’s air defenders fired older missiles and very likely did so along ballistic trajectories without locking on to a specific target, which would have made them easier to hit. None of this is to say that the delivery of S-300s to Syria isn’t a noteworthy development. Russia has threatened to do this multiple times before , but never followed through . Now that they have, there’s no indication that the Russians will limit the Syrians to only using the systems against Israeli aircraft or that they will necessarily be able to enforce such a rule even if they do. As such, it could potentially change the risk management plan for other parties to Syria’s conflict, including Turkey and the United States . Both of these countries are conducting air operations in the country that could be within range of the S-300s depending on how Assad deploys them – or how the Russians let him position them. During the opening phases of the U.S. military air campaign in Syria, when it was unclear how Assad might respond, the U.S. Air Force employed F-22 stealth fighters and F-16CJ Vipers loaded out to suppress and destroy enemy air defenses, as seen in the video below. The United States may have to return to such tactics, though it already continues to employ F-22s heavily in areas near Syrian government control. “I cannot confirm that that is accurate. I hope that they did not [deliver S-300s to Syria], that would be a serious escalation and concern,” top U.S. State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said when asked about Shoigu’s statements at a routine press conference . “It hasn’t changed anything,” U.S. Army Colonel Sean Ryan, the top spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, told Russian state media outlet Sputnik in response to a separate query about the surface-to-air missile systems. The bigger question may turn out to be exactly how the S-300s will change the potential danger of accidental shootdowns. Russia has stated publicly that its main reason for supplying the new surface-to-air missiles to Assad is to help ensure the safety of Russian personnel in the future. At the same time, it seems immensely unlikely that the Kremlin plans to force Assad to abandon his existing surface-to-air missile systems, including the Cold War-era Soviet-supplied SA-5s , which has proven to be among his most effective weapons and were responsible for bringing down the Il-20. However, if the Syrians continue to operate those systems, then the Russian military aid will have done little to nothing to mitigate the apparent risks to Russian aircraft, calling into question the value of the entire exercise. In three months time, when the Syrians are due to actually put their new S-300s into action, at least according to the Russians, we may get a better sense of exactly what capability Assad has or has not actually gained and what benefits the Kremlin might actually derive from the arrangement.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has confirmed it has been talking with American planemaker Boeing about a multi-billion dollar purchase around six E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft to replace its existing fleet of E-3D Sentries . The United Kingdom argues that the new design is a capable and cost-effective option that will share some components with the country’s forthcoming P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, as well as improve cooperation with the first Wedgetail operator, Australia . Unfortunately, there are already concerns and complaints brewing about whether the U.K. government’s potential decision not to hold an open competition doesn’t provide enough benefits to the country’s own domestic defense industry . In public comments ahead of a meeting with other top defense officials from NATO member states on Oct. 3, 2018, U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson acknowledged the discussions with Boeing and offered more detail about the prospective deal. Britain’s Financial Times had been the first to report that the country’s authorities were in “exclusive talks” with the American company about the Wedgetails. The prospective deal is reportedly for the purchase of between five and seven E-7As, as well as ancillary equipment and services, for a total cost of more than $2.6 billion. “The Wedgetail is the stand-out performer in our pursuit of a new battlespace surveillance aircraft, and has already proved itself in Iraq and Syria,” Williamson said . “Running air operations from the sky, it could be an excellent asset for the RAF and give us a real edge in this increasingly complex world.” Boeing began development of the aircraft, which is derived from the 737 Next Generation airframe, in the 1990s at the request of Australia. The Royal Australian Air Force formally took delivery of the first two aircraft in 2010. As Williamson noted, the country has since deployed them to support operations against ISIS terrorists in the Middle East. South Korea and Turkey have also bought small numbers of the aircraft. The E-7A, also known as the 737 AEW&C, standing for airborne early warning and control, features a large Northrop Grumman Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar mounted on top of the rear portion of the fuselage. The system has air and sea-search modes and a maximum detection range, depending on various environmental and other factors, of more than 370 miles. In addition, it has an expansive communications and data link suite to help coordinate friendly operations and share information between various assets in the air and down below. Australia has already embarked on a $443 million plan to upgrade the radar capabilities, networking functionality, and other features on its six aircraft in the future, enhancements that may then also be available for future Royal Air Force aircraft. All of this offers significantly improved capability over the Royal Air Force’s E-3Ds , another Boeing product, which first entered service in 1992. The smaller, more modern 737-derived design is also more fuel efficient and less maintenance intensive. On top of that, the Royal Air Force is already slated to begin operating Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in 2019 , another aircraft based on the Next Generation 737 (the closest commercial equivalent is the 737-700). With the two aircraft sharing the same engines and various other components, the United Kingdom could further reduce operating costs and streamline portions of the maintenance and logistics pipelines by selecting the Wedgetail. One of the Royal Air Force’s existing E-3D aircraft., Crown Copyright The U.K. Ministry of Defense also sees the E-7A as a path to greater cooperation and interoperability with long-time ally Australia. This could be particularly important as the United Kingdom looks to increase its military capacity in the Pacific Region . “Our future with Australia will already see us operate the same maritime patrol aircraft, world-class Type 26 warships and supersonic F-35 jets ,” Defense Secretary Williams explained . “Wedgetail may join that formidable armory and help us work together to take on the global threats that we both face.” Members of the Royal Air Force have already been in that country since the middle of 2018 training to fly the Wedgetail. This strongly indicates that the United Kingdom’s discussions with Boeing about the purchase may be quite far along already. All told, the E-7A does seem to be a good fit for the United Kingdom’s requirements and one that could help it cut sustainment costs in the future. This latter point is particularly important given fears about further rounds of defense spending cuts amid already tightening budgets and concerns about the economic impacts of the country’s planned exit from the European Union, also known as the British Exit or Brexit. An Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail., RAAF But with those same things in mind, there are also concerns about whether handing the E-3D replacement deal to a foreign company without an open competition will benefit domestic concerns in the United Kingdom. The U.K. Defense Ministry focused heavily on industrial cooperation on defense projects in its new Combat Air Strategy , which it released in July 2018. “The MoD [Ministry of Defense] will work closely with Boeing to ensure [exploration of] how Britain’s leading defense industry could also benefit from any deal,” Defense Secretary William noted . “If selected, U.K. industry could be involved significantly with the program, from modification work to through life support,” the Ministry said in a separate statement, according to Defense News . “We work with our U.K. supply chain, government and military partners to provide critical capability, U.K. content, U.K. exports, skills and value for money to our armed forces,” a Boeing spokesperson also told that outlet . The U.K.-based Marshall Aerospace and Defense Group already builds fuel tanks for the P-8A and Boeing itself already employs 2,300 people in the United Kingdom to support that program. The American firm could easily make similar arrangements to support a Royal Air Force E-7A program. There is still a growing fear that this could leave companies in the United Kingdom at an increasing disadvantage, though, and there has been growing criticism of the Ministry of Defense’s increasing use of sole-source contracts in general . The contract with Boeing for the P-8As was awarded without a competition, as was a separate deal with the company for more AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. A Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane., RAAF At the same time, the United Kingdom has to be eager to avoid a repeat of the debacle over the upgrade of its Nimrod maritime patrol and electronic intelligence planes, a project that dragged on for more than a decade before the Ministry of Defense finally canceled the deal in 2010.  U.K. authorities subsequently decided to purchase received Airseeker intelligence-gathering aircraft , a derivative of the U.S. Air Force’s RC-135W Rivet Joint , and the P-8As. Still, snubbing European firms as tensions rise over Brexit, could risk upsetting negotiations to cooperate on other high-profile defense projects in the future, as well. Airbus and Saab had reportedly been in talks to jointly pitch a design that would mate the latter company’s Erieye radar, a feature of its GlobalEye aircraft, with an Airbus airframe. Saab had plans to simply offer the GlobalEye itself , which is based on the Canadian Bombardier Global 6000 business jet and is much smaller than the E-7A. Israel Aerospace Industries had also expressed an interest in making an offer to the United Kingdom and is in the midst of its own spat with Boeing . If the deal does go through, it would be another significant win for Boeing, which has already secured three major U.S. military aviation contracts in 2018. The company is now set to build the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25A tanker drone and MH-139 helicopters and T-X jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. There have also been reports that the American planemaker is aggressively pursuing these deals with very appealing low-cost bid offers. With the other benefits the Wedgetail could provide the Royal Air Force in terms of improved airborne command and control capability and reduced sustainment demands, Boeing’s pitch may be too attractive to pass up. With the United Kingdom already sending pilots to Australia to train on the type, the deal may already be a foregone conclusion. There’s no set timeline for the Ministry of Defense to formally decide on its strategy for replacing the E-3Ds, but we could be looking another announcement coming about this program in the near future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The YF-23’s Weapons Bay Layout Was One Of Its Best Features And One Of Its Worst,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we continue our series on one of the most enigmatic, misunderstood and ahead of its time aircraft in military history—Northrop’s YF-23 Black Widow that lost the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition to Lockheed’s YF-22 Lightning—we turn our gaze toward its unique weapons bay configuration. Like so many things YF-23, this feature had big potential benefits, but it also represented a heightened developmental risk for the USAF. In the end, it very likely damaged Northrop’s prospects of supplying America’s air superiority fighter of the 21st Century, and maybe for good reason at the time, but today, the YF-23’s unique weapons bay configuration would almost certainly be highly prized. The YF-22 and YF-23 went about carrying their weapons in drastically different manners. The YF-22 featured a fairly straightforward affair, with a shallow weapons bay that spanned its lower fuselage configured to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMS nestled alongside one another and two small bays that flanked the aircraft’s waist—like a wild west gunfighter’s belt—carrying a pair of shorter ranged AIM-9 Sidewinders. ATF competitors side-by-side over the Mojave Desert., USAF The seeker heads on the Sidewinders would deploy into the slipstream at an angle once the side bay doors are open and before locking on and firing off their mounting rail at the enemy. The AIM-120s would be punched out of the ventral bay using a pneumatic trapeze-like vertical launcher. Each missile had its own one of these and could be launched freely regardless of the status of the other missiles in the bay. F-22A showing its weapons bays. Note the three ejector-launchers situated in the main weapons bay. Each on carries a single AIM-120., USN The final production configuration of the F-22 Raptor would hold six AIM-120C AMRAAMs internally—the clipped fins of this new model AMRAAM that was secretly in development during the ATF competition provided extra clearance for the two additional missiles—as well as the two sidewinders as originally envisioned. The F-22 can also carry a single GBU-32 1,000lb JDAM or four GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs and an AIM-120 per bay or six Small Diameter Bombs per bay and no AIM-120s, giving the Raptor a limited standoff strike capability against medium sized and medium fortified structures, as well as smaller targets. Four SDBs and a single AIM-120 can fit into each of the F-22’s main weapons bays. , USAF Northrop’s YF-23, on the other hand, went with a far less straight-forward weapons bay configuration. Instead of shallow, largely conformal bays, the YF-23 had a single, coffin-like, cavernous weapons carrying cavity that ran from behind the cockpit, back into the area between the aircraft’s widely spaced and very unique air intakes . The bay was covered by two very large outwardly swinging doors and the interior of the bay was far deeper than the one found on the YF-22, but also a bit narrower overall. USAF The technology demonstrator aircraft were designed to notionally carry three AIM-120s and two AIM-9s in this bay—three AIM-120s mounted in a staggered fashion on trapeze launchers and two AIM-9s attached to the bay doors. I say notionally because a useable launch system was never installed on either of the prototype airframes, although some reports state that a single instrumented AIM-120 was mounted in the aircraft’s bay for fit checks and possibly to measure vibrations during a test flight. Lockheed’s YF-22, on the other hand, actually test fired an AIM-120 during its demonstration phase, which was not even part of the ATF requirements, but was impressive none the less. It also further painted a picture that the YF-22 was a far more mature design than Northrop’s offering. Lockheed’s YF-22 executing an AIM-120 test launch. , USAF A big, deep weapons bay is great for air-to-ground applications, but it does invite potentially unwanted complexity for air-to-air applications. By stacking missiles above other missiles, it means that if one jammed, the ones behind it would not be usable—or worse. It also meant that an elaborate missile handling and launching mechanism would be required. This could add substantial weight and complexity to the design, and thus increase risk and possibly cost associated with it. At the same time, a big, deep, trough-like weapons compartment meant that the YF-23 could potentially carry substantial air-to-ground stores, including 2,000lb class weapons, and possibly even larger. Such a bay could also be subdivided for different types of off smaller weapons to be carried at one time. The YF-22 had far less air-to-ground potential but it also had none of the YF-23 weapons bay complexities and unknowns, and for what was supposed to be a thoroughbred air-to-air fighter the likes of which the world had never seen, putting a premium on air-to-ground capabilities that may pan out one day was not on the ATF program’s to-do list. Note the weapons bay seams are visible., USAF The final F-23 configuration would have been markedly different than its YF-23 progenitor. It would feature two weapons bays instead of one. A similar large bay roughly in the same place as the original, but also another smaller, shallower bay under the cockpit that would hold a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinders. By most accounts, this configuration would have allowed for four or maybe five AIM-120s and a pair of sidewinders to be carried, but some claim that elaborate and complex AIM-120 carriage contraptions could have drastically increased this to as many as eight or even 10 AIM-120s. Once again, this would rely on stacking missiles in magazines or using a form of a rotary launcher, among other concepts, some of which Northrop did receive patents for in the late 1980s when the ATF competition was underway. A Northrop patent for a vertical fighter missile magazine from the ATF era. , USPTO But any of these magazine designs could have left an F-23 pilot without a large portion of their arsenal if a missile jammed. And complex weapons carriage and deployment systems are not ideal for a fighter that constantly turns under the crushing force of 9Gs and is buffeted and vibrated like a jackhammer during hard maneuvering. Like so many things YF-23, in retrospect, an ATF that could carry a diverse air-to-ground weapons load, including munitions capable of taking out large and well fortified targets—and especially a fighter that had better kinematic, range, and low observable (stealth) performance than even the YF-22—would be a near ideal combat aircraft today. In fact, designs eerily similar to the YF-23 continue to get pushed around as representing the next leap in manned fighter capability nearly three decades after the YF-23 took to the skies for the first time. Lockheed has put forward renderings of an aircraft that looks awfully similar to the YF-23 as an example of 6th generation fighter almost 30 years after the YF-23 lost to its own YF-22 ATF competitor. Read more about this here. , Screencap via Youtube Even though the YF-23 may have represented a larger evolutionary leap in fighter design and had even more potential to evolve than its counterpart, the YF-22 was a safer bet based on the information available when the ATF decision was made. In other words, the YF-22 was a more mature, lower risk, and fully realized example of what Lockheed wanted to bring to life in the form of the F-22A than what the YF-23 represented. It was also a more traditional option, all of which were huge factors in the USAF’s final decision. Their choice of the Pratt & Whitney F119 over the General Electric F120 was also thought to have been made on similar grounds. I couldn’t write this piece without discussing the long-standing rumors surrounding the existence of a YF-23 derived regional strike aircraft, largely referred to as the F/B-23. It wasn’t long after the ATF program ended that talk began to spread of the USAF having an entirely different purpose in mind for the YF-23 design and the technology that informed it. There was even talk that one of the YF-23 ATF technology demonstrators was pulled from exhibition to be examined and components of it used for some form of follow-on program. PAV-1 and its experimental F119 engines before restoration at Wright Patterson AFB. , National Museum Of The United States Air Force In the mid-2000s, models and renderings of an F/B-23 emerged. The design, dubbed the Rapid Theater Attack concept, was an enlarged and elongated version of the YF-23 with room for two crewmen and featuring more traditional exhausts and supposedly divertless supersonic intakes—a feature that was slated to make it onto production F-23A’s as well. Literally, this was the supercruising, deep penetrating, hard-hitting, regional ranged strike machine that many of us had long dreamed of. An aircraft that possesses a multiple of the unrefueled combat radii found on tactical fighters and capable of transiting relatively long distances in short timeframes via sustained supercruise. F/B-23 TRA model., Public Domain Such a concept made a lot of sense then and it still does today. And the YF-23’s big weapons bay, expanded in this stretched version, could pack a lot of damage that could obliterate even deeply buried bunkers. Keep in mind, that once the F-117 was retired in 2008, the Pentagon had no tactical aircraft that could penetrate deep into enemy airspace and unleash 2,000lb class weapons. Only the B-2 strategic bomber would retain this capability until the F-35 would become operational a decade later. Bill Sweetman, previously of Aviation Week fame, noted that the F/B-23 would have had “a 10,000-lb. internal bomb load, a Mach-1.6 cruising speed and a 1,250-nm unrefueled combat radius.”, Northrop Grumman All this was happening as the USAF was pondering an FB-22 with similar, albeit likely less specialized capabilities as the YF-23, but the FB-22 would have had the advantage of leveraging much of the F-22’s support and manufacturing infrastructure. It ends up that the USAF passed on both aircraft, although the concept seems to be making a something of a comeback as of late as Japan and even the U.S. eye a new heavy fighter that incorporates both the F-35’s best attributes with those of an enhanced F-22 airframe. As for the F/B-23, or any other outgrowth of the YF-23 including a potential tactical reconnaissance variant, there is no hard evidence that anything of the sort ever existed in a prototype, let alone an operational form. But who knows, maybe one day we will find out that the YF-23 was recycled in certain respects for a deeply classified program, but for now, the fighter with serious bomber potential remains a dead-end in the annals of military aviation history.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 11, 2018","China Snuck Chips Into CIA, U.S. Military, Commercial Servers Leaving Them Open To Hacks: Report","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report is alleging the Chinese government directly interceded to insert small microchips into motherboards from a company called Supermicro, that are in use in servers everywhere from the adult film industry to U.S. military and U.S. Intelligence Community data centers, which make them vulnerable open them up to remote hacks . If the claims turn out to be true, it would be an intelligence operation of historic proportions that would have far-reaching and long-lasting ramifications. On Oct. 4, 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek published its story, which is the culmination of years of investigative work and cites nearly 20 anonymous sources from both the U.S. government and private companies reportedly involved in the affair. The piece says that American authorities first became aware of the existence of the chips in 2015, that the classified probe is still ongoing, and that U.S. officials have identified an unspecified unit of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for sneaking the malicious hardware into the servers. “Think of Supermicro as the Microsoft of the hardware world,” a former U.S. intelligence official told Bloomberg . “Attacking Supermicro motherboards is like attacking Windows. It’s like attacking the whole world.” By 2015, the San Jose-based firm had sold thousands of servers to more than 900 customers in around 100 countries. That the customer base includes the Central Intelligence Agency, various elements of the U.S. military, the Department of Homeland Security, NASA, and the U.S. Congress, as well as big-name tech firms such as Apple. The basic concept behind the alleged plan is relatively straightforward. The PLA unit in question allegedly infiltrated Supermicro’s China-based subcontractors who actually make the motherboards and added its own hardware, reportedly no bigger than a grain of rice or the tip of a pencil. These chips themselves don’t do much on their own, but what they do is immensely important. The small amount of computer code they contain instructs the completed servers to be open to outside modifications and to be ready to receive further code from other computers remotely, creating a backdoor for hackers to access the information they contain. It could potentially have other functions, as well, including acting as a remotely-operated kill-switch to just shut down a system entirely on command. Hackers could also potentially use it as a gateway to feed false or confusing information into a target system, as well. These types of threats is a long-standing security concern . Just in August 2018, President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that makes it illegal for U.S. government agencies to purchase devices from Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE Corp, over fears that the Chinese government might seek to tamper with them. The U.S. military had temporarily imposed similar restrictions on small drones from China-based company DJI over security concerns in 2017. The U.S. military stopped using DJI drones, such as this Phantom, for a time in 2017 over fears that they could be scooping up sensitive information and sending it back to the Chinese company., USMC Chinese hacking , or attempts to hack, private companies and government agencies are also well established at this point. In June 2018, The Washington Post reported that China had stolen information on a highly-classified anti-ship missile known as Sea Dragon from a U.S. government contractor’s computer system. There is no evidence as yet to indicate that this was as at all related to the hardware tampering Bloomberg has described. But implementing such a plan to exploit the actual hardware in specific systems is reportedly extremely difficult, with so many opportunities for authorities and private security experts to uncover the scheme. Intelligence agencies and security experts have dismissed the likelihood that it could occur on as grand a scale as Bloomberg ’s story suggests. “Having a well-done, nation-state-level hardware implant surface would be like witnessing a unicorn jumping over a rainbow,” Joe Grand, a hardware hacker and the founder of Grand Idea Studio Inc., explained to Bloomberg . “Hardware is just so far off the radar, it’s almost treated like black magic.” It’s not entirely clear when the chips first began appearing Supermicro’s servers or whether the Chinese tried at all to focus their efforts on hardware bound for specific destinations. The size and scope of the American company’s customer base would have made it a particularly attractive target for China’s intelligence services. The provincial offices of China’s Ministry of State Security, the country’s main internal and external intelligence agency, in Wuhan., Vmenkov via Wikimedia The issue reportedly only became apparent in 2015 after Amazon sent systems a company called Elemental had produced, which included Supermicro servers, for a deep security inspection, according to Bloomberg . Amazon Web Services was looking to acquire Elemental, which specialized in hardware to support online video-streaming services, to help with its own projects, such as Amazon Prime Video. The unnamed third-party security firm located the chips, after which Amazon reportedly informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prompting the still ongoing investigation. One of Bloomberg ’s anonymous sources said that U.S. officials identified at least 30 private companies, including Apple, that had the sabotaged servers. It is important to note, however, that Amazon, Apple, and Supermicro have all vociferously and publicly denied Bloomberg ’s reporting categorically. The three companies say they have never located a piece of malicious hardware in the servers, contacted the U.S. government about such an issue, or are aware of any investigation. The Chinese government, not surprisingly, issued a vague and indirect response when the outlet asked for comment. That being said, in 2016, Apple did stop buying products from Supermicro entirely, citing a security incident it said was unrelated to any hardware tampering. In August 2018, the Nasdaq stock market index suspended trading in shares of the company citing irregularities in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An Apple Store in Shanghai, China. Apple is reportedly one of the companies that ended up with the compromised motherboards., Chinatopix via AP It is also important to point out that this story has emerged just as President Donald Trump’s Administration has sought to impose restrictions on the importation of Chinese-made computer hardware as part of a rapidly escalating trade war . Tensions between the two countries have been steadily escalating as a result of other disputes, including the status of the contested South China Sea , American military assistance to Taiwan , and Chinese information operations that are reportedly seeking to sway public opinion against Trump in the United States. “Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States,” Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech at the Hudson Institute think tank on Oct. 4, 2018. “Worst of all, Chinese security agencies have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology – including cutting-edge military blueprints.” So, there is a possibility that Bloomberg ’s sources have been seeking to push this narrative as part of the U.S. government’s growing criticism of China. On the other hand, the outlet says it spoke with individuals with insider knowledge of Apple and other private companies involved in the microchip affair. The reported investigation into the security threat dates back to President Barack Obama’s Administration, as well, when relations with the Chinese might have been cool, but not nearly as tense as they are now. Given the highly sensitive nature of the situation, Amazon, Apple, and Supermicro may not be able to publicly comment on the ongoing investigation, even if they wanted to. Of course, if that were the case, they could have simply declined comment rather than issue their very explicit and detailed denials. In addition, the hardware seeding operation would have come after a massive Chinese counter-intelligence campaign , starting in 2010, which reportedly put a chill on CIA activities in the country, too. China could easily have seized on that situation as a prime opportunity to try and see if it was possible to infiltrate technology supply chains on a large scale. Regardless of the actual specifics of the situation and whether or not this malicious hardware threat was ever as real as Bloomberg ‘s sources contend, the implications are clear for both private industry and the U.S. government. In recent years, American firms have steadily subcontracted more and more of the actual manufacturing of components in various electronic devices to firms in China, opening up the possibility of these types of security breaches. “You end up with a classic Satan’s bargain,” a former U.S. official told Bloomberg . “You can have less supply than you want and guarantee it’s secure, or you can have the supply you need, but there will be risk. Every organization has accepted the second proposition.” A factory worker in China assembles electronic components., Imaginechina via AP Images That position may now be increasingly untenable if there are risks of the vulnerabilities becoming as widespread as Bloomberg ’s story suggests. There are no simple, fast, and cost-effective means to inspect motherboards and other components for malicious hardware that the Chinese have allegedly developed. That the tiny components do not do much themselves and contain very little computer code would make it difficult to attribute them to any particular source, further reducing the risks to the attacker. The U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community have also struggled to combat counterfeit computer chips from China from getting into the supply chain, which presents another possible vector for malicious hardware. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been working on ways to quickly spot knock-off components , which might also help spot tampering. “This stuff is at the cutting edge of the cutting edge, and there is no easy technological solution,” an unnamed individual who attended a Pentagon-sponsored meeting to discuss the potential risks of hardware tampering noted to Bloomberg . “You have to invest in things that the world wants. You cannot invest in things that the world is not ready to accept yet.” With that in mind, it seems hard to imagine that the Chinese, with a significant monopoly on the supply chains for computer and other electronic technologies, would not be interested in trying to leverage that reality for its own benefit. No matter how widespread or not the PLA’s infiltration of Supermicro turns out to be, it seems likely that reports of similar security breaches will appear for the foreseeable future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The last seven days have provided a plethora of awesome aviation related videos. Sometimes doing an entire post on a single video makes sense, but doing that daily doesn’t. So I have condensed the best of the best here for your viewing pleasure in a new segment I call Cinema Aero. First up, we have had some awesome, and I mean AWESOME video coming out of Australia showing RAAF aircraft rehearsing for the Riverfire celebration in Brisbane. You may remember this event as it featured probably the best ‘dump and burns’ by F-111s in the history of the maneuver. You can see what I am talking about in this old piece of mine . Since the F-111’s retirement, other RAAF have stepped in to keep the flyover tradition alive—and these aren’t just any sleepy aerial displays. In true RAAF fashion , the jets get down low and very fast. RAAF EA-18G Growlers starred this year in the event, making very high-speed and low passes deep below the skyline: That my friends is a growler #riverfire pic.twitter.com/eTw6wUquVg — Nathan Oldfield (@nathanoldfield6) September 29, 2018 You can check out the maneuvers from inside the Growler’s cockpit in the absolutely awesome 360 video below. Here’s a direct link in case the Facebook embed doesn’t pop up. While the Growler was certainly full of energy, a RAAF C-17 crew pretty much said ‘hold my beer mate!’ and put on one of the coolest flybys we have seen!

It often offers an interactive experience where you can basically choose your own point of view, but they can also offer creative production folks the ability to capture just the right series of perspectives in a smooth and almost panoptic manner. Check out what I mean here as you sit in the A-10’s cockpit during a low-level flight. Here is a direct link in case the video doesn’t show up below. The next video is one of the most gorgeous aviation videos I have seen in a long time. It uses a fixed horizon perspective to give us a view of what it looks like flying on the tail of one of Redline Airshows ‘ RV8 during a night display replete with pyrotechnics. Once again, hero-cam technology is evolving so fast now that it is providing us with views really never imagined before. Speaking of airshow demonstrations, this HUD footage from inside the cockpit of a Romanian MiG-21 Lancer during an airshow routine is really something. It reminds us of just how much of a ‘stick and rudder’ affair the ‘Kalashnikov of fighters’ really is and its flight-data probe sure doesn’t want to sit still does it? Not to mention that the steep split-s to landing at the end is straight-up bonkers. This video came to my attention in our own outstanding comments section which is an eclectic rabbit hole of great information. Here is a direct link just in case the Facebook video doesn’t propagate below. Then there was this ridiculously low pass by a Ukrainian Su-24 Fencer. You can’t get deeper into the weeds than this and have any chance of surviving to talk about it. Yes, it’s dangerous. No, it doesn’t have any distinct tactical value. But it must be one hell of a rush and it makes for a crazy video: This Bell 407 really got itself into a tight spot. On departure, it gave a palm tree a major trim. Scary, scary stuff, not just for whoever was onboard, but also for those on the ground nearby: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Diogo Araujo (@helipilotbr) Bonus video! Clearly, it isn’t new, but this is an absolutely awesome clip of Concorde departing in the twilight with its four Rolls Royce Olympus turbojets in full reheat: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmg7LcagbFu I remember driving into JFK one evening in the early 1990s with my dad to catch a flight back home and seeing this exact thing. It was absolutely spectacular , both visually and acoustically. Concorde was always a fixture right at the end of the terminal, fully visible from the road when you got dropped off for a flight. British Airways loved showing off their marvelous machine to the masses even though most could never afford to fly aboard her. Great memories of a bygone era.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 7, 2018",Navy Spends Millions On Sub-Launched Hypersonics As USAF Touts New Hypersonic X-Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The development of hypersonic weapons has become and continues to be one of the U.S. military’s top priorities . A recent contract award shows that the U.S. Navy is spending millions to keep developing a submarine-launched type that might eventually arm its future Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines. Now, the U.S. Air Force has announced that an air-launched hypersonic test bed it is developing in cooperation with NASA to support various projects will become the latest of America’s research and development “ X-planes .” On Oct. 1, 2018, the Pentagon announced that the Navy had awarded the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Massachusetts a contract worth more than $13 million for various services in support of actual hypersonic weapon flight tests. Then, on Oct. 4, 2018, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) revealed that space launch firm Generation Orbit ’s GOLauncher 1 (GO-1) hypersonic vehicle would now be known as the X-60A . The full contracting notice for the Navy’s deal with Draper Labs is as follows: “The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, is awarded a $13,380,171 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to provide research into the applications of technologies to meet guidance requirements for operations on the Common Missile Compartment for the U.S. Columbia -class program and the United Kingdom Dreadnought -class program; provide specialized technical knowledge and support for the hypersonic guidance, navigation and control application; provide technical and engineering services to support the Guidance, Navigation and Control system that will support the Navy’s hypersonic flight experiments.  Work will be performed in Cambridge, Massachusetts (81 percent); and El Segundo, California (19 percent), with an expected completion date of Sept. 30, 2019.  Subject to the availability of funds, fiscal 2019 research, development, test, and evaluation funds in the amount of $13,380,171 will be obligated.  No funds will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.  This contract was a sole source acquisition pursuant to 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1)&(4). Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity (N00030-19-C-0001).” The announcement does not specify what system Draper Labs, a non-profit research and development organization, will be working on. The basic description, though, sounds very similar to a submarine-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that the Navy said it tested for the first time in 2017. Boost-glide vehicles are unpowered and typically use a ballistic missile to get to the appropriate speed and altitude. Pictures and video recently appeared to show researchers in China using a test apparatus slung beneath a high-altitude balloon for this purpose. Air-breathing hypersonic vehicles also require some sort of booster initially to get going fast enough for a high-speed jet engine, such as a ramjet , to take over. The Navy’s test last year, officially known as the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike Flight Experiment-1 (CPS FE-1), involved an Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine. The Navy’s Strategic Systems Program (SSP) office also oversaw that event, which took place at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. An artist’s conception of the future USS Columbia ., USN The launch proved that “the first conventional prompt strike missile for the United States Navy in the form factor that would eventually, could eventually be utilized if leadership chooses to do so in an Ohio -class tube,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Terry Benedict, director of SSP, said afterward . The contract with Draper Labs would seem to suggest that the Navy’s main goal is eventually integrating this weapon with the Columbia -class. Since those submarines will have the same Common Missile Compartment missile launch tube architecture as the United Kingdom’s future Dreadnought -class ballistic missile submarines, it is possible that the U.S. military could share the design with the British government, as well. Though not mentioned in the contracting notice, the individual tubes in the Common Missile Compartment are also the same basic size and shape as the ones in the Virginia Payload Module , which will go into the future Block V Virginia -class attack submarines, leaving open the possibility that they too may be able to use this weapon in the future. A briefing slide from 2014, when the Columbia -class was still known simply as the “Ohio Replacement,” showing the plan for the Common Missile Compartments, each of which contains a “quad-pack” of four missile launch tubes., USN Of course, the U.S. military acknowledges that there is still much work to be done to fully understand that hypersonic vehicles will and won’t be able to do. Experiments continue simply to help identify materials that can withstand the heat and strain of sustained flight at five times the speed of sound or more, as well as advanced air-breathing jet engines that can handle that stress and keep the vehicle at a sustained speed. That’s where experimental systems such as the X-60A come into play. “The X-60A is like a flying wind tunnel to capture data that complements our current ground test capability,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Colin Tucker, the military deputy in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science, Technology, and Engineering, said in a press release on Oct. 4, 2018. “It enables faster development of both our current hypersonic weapon rapid prototypes and evolving future systems.” An artists conception of the X-60A speeding away from its Learjet 35 launch aircraft., Generation Orbit Generation Orbit has been working on this air-launched system , which uses a liquid-fueled rocket to boost payloads to hypersonic speeds, since the early 2010s. In 2013, the Atlanta, Georgia-headquartered company received more than $2 million to support that development from NASA. The next year, the AFRL got involved in the project. The Air Force sees the X-60A as a low-cost platform to test scramjet engines , high-temperature resistant materials, and autonomous guidance and control systems under actual flight conditions. The goal is to be able to use this surrogate system to help speed up development of other hypersonic vehicles and weapons, such as the air-breathing Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) that Lockheed Martin is presently developing for the service. Generation Orbit completed a series of captive carry tests at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, which is situated within Edwards Air Force Base, in January 2018. NASA’s Learjet 35 carried the vehicle through a series of basic flight and simulated launch maneuvers. In June 2018, the company conducted the first ground test of the rocket motor . The first actual flight of the X-60A is set to come in late 2019 . All in all, it continues to be an exciting time in the fast-moving world of hypersonics. The U.S. military as a whole has clearly developed a voracious appetite for the technology and it will be very interesting to see what comes from the Navy’s submarine-launched developments and what the Air Force decides to test onboard its new X-60As.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2018","The Storm Chasing A-10 Thunderhog Program Is Officially Dead, Jet To Be Returned To USAF","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up to our big expose on the sad story of the storm penetrating A-10 research aircraft—known internally as the SPA-10 ‘Thunderhog’—the National Science Foundation has now officially pulled the plug on the program once and for all. We were tipped off to the decision and inquired with the NSF directly to confirm that this was indeed the case. Unfortunately, the lead proved to be all too accurate. In an email reply to The War Zone , the NSF states: The National Science Foundation (NSF) will be returning the A-10 to the United States Air Force. NSF made this decision after a thorough review of the scientific needs of the community and an independent analysis of the capabilities of the A-10 aircraft. Given that more than five years had passed since NSF first acquired and began retrofitting the A-10, it was prudent to both reevaluate the scientific requirements of the community and, based on those requirements, the capabilities of the aircraft before investing additional resources. NSF conducted a workshop with the scientific community in 2017 and found that there remains strong interest in the research potential of a storm penetrating aircraft (SPA). This workshop also provided NSF with a clear view of the current scientific goals and the requirements for accomplishing them. Subsequently, NSF engaged an independent review of the capabilities of the A-10 aircraft as an SPA. Based on this review, NSF determined that the A-10 does not align sufficiently well with the updated science requirements. Many high-risk and very costly modifications would be needed to attempt to meet many of the scientific research goals the community has identified. Therefore, NSF has notified the Air Force that we will be returning the A-10. NSF will continue to evaluate the overall needs of the atmospheric research community and how to best allocate our resources to fund the most promising research in this area. The problem here is that according to everyone we talked to, there really is no other option for such a hardened flying laboratory and many millions of dollars have already been spent on the project in order to get it to the partially finished state it is currently in. So if that A-10 is going back to the USAF, the chances that another Warthog would be provided for such a task, as well as the funds required to convert it from scratch, are next to zero, at least for the foreseeable future. It is also worth mentioning that the NSF hasn’t found itself in a fiscal era of great certainty or bounty. Earlier this year, the White House proposed slashing the foundations budget by an eye-watering 30% and similar threats were made in 2017, but overall the NSF’s budget has remained fairly flat, with a slight bump in 2018 from $7.472B to $7.767B. As we stated before, it would be ideal if the USAF would take over the operational and modifications side of SPA-10 program. Doing so would solve so many issues and considering that the flying force has a budget of over $130B in 2018, finishing the SPA-10 and flying it in the name of important science—science that is very relevant to the USAF’s own mission—seems highly logical and economically feasible. But alas, the SPA-10’s sad story has turned into a tragedy. It’s not clear when the aircraft will make its final flight from Broomfield, Colorado where it is currently stored in the NSF’s hangar there to its new resting place, which will probably be Davis Monthan AFB where it came from in the first place. But now that its fate has been officially sealed, it will likely make the journey back into the USAF’s custody soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 26, 2018",Kenya and Lebanon Will Get Little Bird Choppers That Can Carry Up To Six Weapons At Once,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kenya and Lebanon are each set to receive six MD 530-series Little Bird light attack helicopters equipped with a new armament “plank” running through the main cabin that will allow them to carry weapons on up to six different stations at once, two more than on earlier versions. Now, the U.S. government has also approved the sale of five Bell 407GX light attack helicopters to Iraq with the same system. MD Helicopters received the orders for the six MD 530Fs for Kenya and the six MD 530Gs for Lebanon on Sept. 27, 2018 , and Oct. 1, 2018 , respectively. The deals came by way of the U.S. Army, which handed the company a contract in 2017 worth as much as $1.4 billion for as many as 150 Little Birds for subsequent delivery to American allies and partners via the Foreign Military Sales program. On Oct. 4, 2018, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency also announced a potential sale of Bell 407GX helicopters to Iraq, along with ancillary equipment and support services, worth around $82.5 million. All of these helicopters will come with Dillon Aero’s six-position Mission Configurable Aircraft System (MCAS) kits. The MD 530F and G are among the latest iterations of the Little Bird design, which is an outgrowth of the Vietnam War-era Hughes 369 , which the U.S. Army adopted as the OH-6A light scout helicopter. The primary difference between the F and G is that the latter comes standard with a new glass cockpit configuration with digital multi-function displays and an L3 Wescam MX-10D sensor turret . The MX-10D includes visual and infrared full-motion video cameras, as well as a laser designator, allowing the aircraft to employ precision-guided munitions. These are available as separate add-on options on the 530F, but there is no indication that the helicopters for Kenya will have these features. But both purchase orders include the MCAS kits. Dillon Aero’s system is one of the latest armament packages for the Little Bird family, which have included two- and four-position weapons arrangements in the past. The MCAS allow for a maximum of six positions, but, as a result, also provides the necessary space to carry stores combinations that might be physically impossible with other systems. It’s not clear when either Kenya or Lebanon might be able to take full advantage of the system, though. The only examples of six-position configurations Dillon has on its website involve attaching a Common Launch Tube to the tips of the plank. This launcher most commonly associated with the GBU-44/B Viper Strike GPS-assisted laser-guided glide bomb and the AGM-176 Griffin , a munition with a GPS and inertial navigation or laser guidance options that can function as an unpowered glide bomb or a powered missile. A 3D rendering of Dillon Aero’s Mission Configurable Aircraft System armament kit with weapons on six different stations., Dillon Aero There is no indication that Kenya or Lebanon plans to purchase these weapons. Unless the Kenyan helicopters subsequently receive an MX-10D or similar sensor system with a target designation capability, they will not be able to employ precision-guided munitions at all. Instead, Kenya’s 530Fs armament configuration will consist of two FN Herstal HMP 400 gun pods, each containing a .50 caliber M3P machine gun , and seven-tube 70mm M260 rocket pods , according to MD Helicopters . This will be a significant improvement in capability over the Kenyan Army’s existing MD 500 Defenders, which can only carry two stores at a time. Those older aircraft have been supporting Kenya’s operations against Al Qaeda affiliated Al Shabaab terrorists in neighboring Somalia as part of the African Union-led mission in that country. A Kenyan Army MD 500 Defender in Kismayo, Somalia in 2012., AMISOM Lebanon’s MD 530Gs will have an almost identical armament configuration, with the notable addition of laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) rockets, MD Helicopters said in a press release . The Lebanese Air Force’s new A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft are slated to get this capability, as well. These low-cost precision-guided rockets, combined with the MX-10D sensor turret, will give Lebanon’s helicopters significantly greater capability to engage targets precisely and do so at night. This latter point is especially important in limited conflicts against terrorists and other non-state militant groups, who have historically exploited the cover of darkness to mask their movements. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPXh0SpQU6w Though largely obscured by the fighting in neighboring Syria, as well as Iraq, Lebanon has been fighting its own complex campaign against ISIS terrorists along the Syrian border. With that in mind, the United States has stepped up military aid to the small country, including the delivery of the aforementioned A-29s, Bradley armored fighting vehicles , and precision-guided howitzer shells . There’s similarly no indication that if Iraq plans to use the MCAS kit’s six-position feature if it decides to go ahead with the purchase of the five Bell 407GXs. The prospective sale includes a mix of 7.62mm M240 machine guns , .50 caliber M3P machine guns, .50 caliber GAU-19/B Gatling guns , and M260 rocket pods able to fire APKWS II rockets. That deal would help offset the loss of seven older IA-407 variants that the Iraqi Air Force has suffered while fighting ISIS terrorists in the past four years, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The 407GX, which includes a full glass cockpit and avionics improvements over older 407-series helicopters, would still give Iraq a capability boost over its existing models. Those choppers already feature sensor turrets under the nose and have the ability to employ the laser-guided 70mm rockets, though. One of Iraq’s existing IA-407 light attack helicopters., via Qualitative Military Edge Still, the MCAS leaves open the possibility for all three countries to make use of the six-position feature at some point in the future, or simply take advantage of the modularity of the system to carry different types of stores. The plank can also accommodate AGM-114 Hellfire laser-guided missiles, which both Lebanon and Iraq use on AC-208 Combat Caravan light attack aircraft, for instance. There are still more than 100 potential Little Bird sales to come under the Army’s contract, as well. In addition to the 12 Little Birds for Kenya and Lebanon, another 30 are headed to Afghanistan under that arrangement. It is possible more armed examples with the MCAS could be headed abroad in the near future, further expanding the customer base who might be interested in taking full advantage of the system. El Salvador stands out, in particular, as a country that could be next in line, since its operating aging armed MD 500E types in support of the U.N. mission in Mali and continues to receive substantial assistance from the United States to keep those helicopters flying. With the MCAS appearing to be an increasingly standard addition in U.S. government-facilitated light attack helicopter sales, it seems likely we’ll be seeing more continues utilizing the system in the future in general. We’ll definitely be keeping our eyes open for an examples of choppers fully armed with a six weapon configuration.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 10, 2019",That VVIP 747-8i Jumbo Jet Qatar ‘Gifted’ To Erdogan Has Reemerged Wearing Turkish Colors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Back in August, we were first to report that an ultra luxurious, state-of-the-art jumbo jet that belonged to the Qatari royal flight was up for sale . A month later we were the first to point out the aircraft’s peculiar voyage from Bazal to Istanbul. At the time, we posited that the lavish 747-8i would join Turkey’s growing fleet of government-owned flying yachts. Now, this aircraft has emerged wearing a bold new paint scheme that leaves zero doubt as to its new owner and purpose. The jet, originally registered VQ-BSK, now carries the registration TC-TRK. Gone is its maroon and yellow paint scheme. Now it is adorned in the same brightly striped red ‘swoosh’ scheme found on other Turkish government VVIP transports ranging in size from Gulfstream private jets to quad-engine A340 widebody airlines. The newly minted TC-TRK also has large titles painted on its sides that read REPUBLIC OF TURKEY on one side in English with the same thing on the other side in Turkish. The aircraft has been at Sabiha Gökçen Airport in Istanbul since taking its roundabout acceptance flight from Basel Airport in France some three weeks ago. It had been undergoing modifications and receiving its new paint job under tight security in Turkish Technic’s hangar there before it reemerged and took to the air once again on October 5th, 2018. After our report on the aircraft’s mysterious flight to Turkey, Ankara was bombarded with questions about the aircraft’s status. Turkish officially begrudgingly said it was a gift from Qatar. That is quite the claim considering the aircraft costs nearly $400M new, and that’s just for the aircraft itself. Its ornate interior and unique features—like a gyro-stabilized surgical bed—cost many millions more. Eventually, Erdogan himself opined on the topic, saying the Turkish government had high interest in the jet before Qatari Emir Tamim Bin Hamad Bin Al Thani gifted the plane to Turkey free of charge—at least that is what the Turkish strongman claims. Turkey’s economy is in a bad place right now. Using taxpayer funds for what many would consider one of the ultimate luxury machines on the planet clearly wouldn’t sit well with many Turkish citizens or the opposing political establishment. And it’s not like Erdogan hasn’t come under fire for procuring extreme luxuries in the name of the Turkish government and prestige of the Turkish people in the past. Who knows what the true terms of the deal are, but it seems highly unlikely Qatar would fork over a half billion dollar asset to Turkey with absolutely no strings attached. But it’s undeniable that Turkey and Qatar have a close relationship in both a strategic and economic sense, with both sides coming to each other’s aid during recent crises. The jet could very well be seen as partial repayment for Turkey’s helping hand in the deep geopolitical roe Qatar has experienced with its Arab neighbors. But is another wide-body luxury jet really something Turkey needs right now? I don’t think many would attempt to make that case. Erdogan capped off his comments to reporters about the jet by stating : “The plane they mention is now being painted… God willing, we can have a trip with it when all is over.” That may have already happened as the aircraft was tracked flying from Istanbul to Antalya and then to Izmir, located on the picturesque Aegean Sea, before heading to the Turkish captial of Ankara.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 28, 2018","DARPA’s Virus-Carrying Bugs Aren’t Officially Weapons, But It Sure Sounds Like They Could Be","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. European researchers have called for greater clarity about a U.S. military program that is looking into whether insects carrying tailored viruses could rapidly genetically modify plants to resist naturally-occurring and man-made biological threats . The concern is that this research might serve as the basis for a biological weapon or simply create fears that it is a cover for such a project. That latter point seems particularly important in light of recent, but entirely unsupported allegations from Russia that the United States is running a covert biological weapons program out of a laboratory in the country of Georgia. The op-ed calling for more transparency about the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Insect Allies program appeared in the journal Science on Oct. 4, 2018. The Pentagon’s top research and development arm has been working on the project since 2016 . “Food security is national security,” Blake Bextine, who leads up the program at DARPA, told The Associated Press . “DARPA plans to harness the power of this natural system by engineering genes inside plant viruses that can be transmitted by insects to confer protective traits to the target plants they feed upon,” he explained in an internal news piece in 2016. DARPA’s idea is based around how insects naturally carry viruses and then infect plants with them. Using genetically modified viruses, scientists could potentially use bugs to quickly inoculate crops and other plants across a broad area against blights and man-made biological weapons. They might even be able to alter the genetic structure of the flora to be more resilient against those threats in the future. All of this would help protect the United States against mass crop failure, which could have potentially devastating and far-reaching impacts. A very rudimentary depiction of the concept behind Insect Allies., DARPA Genetic modification of plants is hardly new, but historically involved selective breeding and other techniques to achieve the desired results, which would not work nearly fast enough to respond to a widespread crisis, such as a biological weapon attack. Industrial agriculture now also includes genetically modifying seeds before they are planted, but this also wouldn’t provide a means to make immediate changes in mature, growing plants in response to a specific threat. An initial phase of the program, which DARPA conducted incorporating with the Department of Agriculture in a contained laboratory setting, demonstrated it was possible to use small insects called aphids infected with a modified virus to temporarily impart a new trait into mature plants. The goal remains to see if it is possible to create lasting genetic changes in the same way. The civilian and humanitarian benefits of the Insect Allies program are clear. Unfortunately, so are more malign applications. The entire project is predicated on the reality that insects already infect plants with disease. If scientists are capable of altering what viruses they carry to shield plants against certain dangers, it is just as feasible that they could carry deliberately engineered threats. There’s also the concern that a virus that might have a positive impact on one type of plant, might have negative effects on others. There’s no guarantee the infected insects would choose to stay inside designated areas, either. Aphids, the small yellow insects, on oleander flower buds., Luis Fernández García via Wikimedia Of course, there’s no guarantee DARPA’s program will actually lead to any sort of practical result and some scientists have questioned whether the Insect Allies idea could ever work. The U.S. military as a whole has previously explored using insects to attack opponents physically , detect bombs , and more , none of which made it into widespread use. The U.S. government, for its part, maintains that the program is in no way developing a weapon and is within the limitations of the Biological Weapons Convention , an international arms control agreement to which the United States is a party. But the authors of the piece in Science contend that the mere potential of the project to become a weapon may leave other countries with no option but to treat it as such and pursue their own similar research. “The pure fact that this is a military program would naturally raise these sorts of questions,” Todd Kuiken, a senior researcher at North Carolina State University who raised similar concerns about Insect Allies in 2017, told The Associated Press . He added that he does not believe the U.S. government is actually looking to develop an insect-borne biological weapon. “It’s really about how it’s perceived,” Dr. R. Guy Reeves, one of the co-authors of the piece in Science who is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany, explained to The Associated Press . It is his opinion that the technology DARPA is working on through Insect Allies makes much more sense as a weapon than as a safeguard. A researcher removes microbe colonies from a plate in order to begin the process of extracting their DNA as part of bioterrorism defense research at the Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services., AP Photo/Richmond Times-Dispatch, Bob Brown The U.S. has already weathered allegations that it used insects as vectors to spread diseases that would affect people, animals, and plants during the Cold War , but none of those claims were ever substantiated. That storyline did make it into an episode of the television show The Americans , in which fictional Soviet intelligence agents uncover supposed evidence of this plot. With all this in mind, there is also a potential for negative perceptions about Insect Allies, right or wrong, to get weaponized itself. On the same day the article in Science came out, Russia publicly accused the United States of covertly running a biological weapons program under the cover of a civilian laboratory situated in the country of Georgia. “To hide the true nature and purpose of this facility it was formally included in Georgia’s health care system,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Oct. 4, 2018. “The US provides no information on these dual-use activities as part of the confidence-building measures of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.” There is absolutely no evidence to support these assertions, though it is true that the United States funded the establishment of the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi, Georgia. The Georgian National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC), an analog to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs the facility, which conducts research on infectious diseases in humans and animals to guard against epidemics and biological attacks. A picture of the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research that Russian authorities released when making their allegations on Oct. 4, 2018., Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP There is no independent confirmation of claims that more than 70 volunteers died during a drug test at the facility at all, let alone that this was a cover for the development of a biological agent. This isn’t the first time Russia has made these conspiratorial allegations and it seems very likely that they raised them in this case in order to deflect from reports that Russian intelligence agents had sought to hack into the computer networks at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) at The Hague in The Netherlands. Both American and Dutch authorities say that Russia had targeted the OPCW. In response, the latter country expelled four Russians they had identified as members of Russia’s top military intelligence agency, commonly known as the GRU, and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation. “The Dutch government finds the involvement of these intelligence operatives extremely worrisome,” Ank Bijleveld, the Dutch Minister of Defense, said in a press conference . “Normally we don’t reveal this type of counter-intelligence operation.” An annotated image the Dutch Ministry of Defense released showing hacking equipment authorities in that country found after seizing a vehicle belonging to Russian GRU agents., Dutch Ministry of Defense via AP The OPCW has been among the organizations seeking to conclusively identify the chemical agent assassins used to try and kill former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom earlier in the year. U.K. authorities have already declared that the substance, one of a family of agents known popularly as Novichok, came from Russia . Russia routinely uses misinformation and disinformation to distract from its own malign activities, typically accusing its accusers of the same crimes or something tangential in nature. State and quasi-state media, along with individuals on social media, then boost those stories until they take on an organic quality all their own. Chief of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops Major General Igor Kirillov, who was among those to insinuate the United States was using the laboratory in Georgia as a front for biological weapons research on Oct. 4, 2018., Mikhail Pochuev/TASS These claims do not necessarily need to make sense to sow confusion and conflicting information into a broader narrative, but it certainly helps if they are plausible to any degree. Though the Russians haven’t specifically criticized the Insect Allies program, its basic details are very real, unlike the allegations about the Lugar Center in Georgia, even if there’s still no evidence whatsoever that it is actually a biological weapon development program. This could make it a prime target for an information warfare campaign in the future. “Once you make those kinds of breakthroughs, you are in a new world. It’s a morally ambiguous place,” Paul Thompson, an agriculture and ethics professor at Michigan State University who also sits on one of DARPA’s advisor boards told The Associated Press in reference to Insect Allies. “You wonder, ‘Is this something that we should never do?’” The U.S. military’s answer to that question is clearly, and at least presently, yes. It remains to be seen if its own perception of Insect Allies will change amid steady concerns about the project’s aims and public image, or any attempts to turn those issues into an entirely different kind of weapon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 26, 2019","Readiness Of Navy And Marine Aircraft And Crews Is Improving, But It’s Still Pretty Dismal","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Vice Admiral DeWolf Miller, head of Naval Air Forces, spoke at a forum put on by Center for Strategic and International Studies this week and the readiness—or lack thereof—of the aircraft under his purview came up. Among a string of interesting details he disclosed during the talk was the fact that aircraft availability has improved from a horrific one-third of the fleet being mission capable at any given time to “about 50 percent on average.” He went on to add that “we’re still not where we want to be… We found the hole is a little bit deeper than we thought.” You can compare this general number to those of various USAF aircraft here . The Navy, and especially the Marine Corps , let their readiness atrophy on an alarming scale during sequester, prioritizing modernization over the health of the total force and its ability to fight on short notice. Since Mattis stepped into the position as Defense Secretary under President Trump, a high priority has been placed on reversing this alarming trend. Of course, actually doing so was largely helped by Congress passing the fattest defense budgets the services had seen in years. As the admiral alludes to, the good news is that things are improving, but spinning up depot capacity, filling out the spare parts bin, and filling empty maintenance billets isn’t something that just happens overnight. The Navy’s greater plan to give many of its Legacy Hornets to the USMC and take the remainder out of front-line service —which is made possible by the service’s move to purchase additional Super Hornets, among a series of other measures—will continue to help with the cause. Seapower , which originally posted the Admiral’s remarks, as well as those made by Marine Lieutenant General Steven Rudder, the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, included some interesting metrics in their piece. Here are the highlights: 260 airplanes are ready on average, 341 are needed. USMC pilots averaged 13.5 hours per month in fiscal year 2016. 15.4 hours in fiscal year 2017 and 17.9 hours in fiscal year 2018. The USMC has 33 operational F-35Bs. 22 are forward deployed in Asia and in the Central Command area of operations. Also mentioned in the piece were a few important takeaways from both flag officers: USMC is still unhappy with the quality of some F-35Bs it is receiving from Lockheed Maritn, but Rudder states “if the taxpayers give the Marine Corps new airplanes, we’re going to use them.” Different readiness metrics, such as fully mission capable and flyable, are going to condescend into one key metric, with Miller stating that “it’s going to be very simple. We’re going to have an airplane that’s ready to fight, or it’s not.” The Navy is looking at a new program that will let midgrade naval aviators forego the normal track for command positions and remain permanent pilots in training units in an attempt to keep pilots in the force. During the latter part of the Obama years, the ballet of cannibalizing and swapping around aircraft and their components to prop-up deploying squadrons was totally gutting the rest of the force. As were reductions in manpower. As a result, it was very questionable as to how capable the Navy or the USMC would be of surging significant combat power for any sustained period of time during a crisis. You can read all about the realities of life as a maintainer in a USMC Hornet squadron during the height of sequester in this first-person expose we published last Spring. The video below also gives a surprisingly candid look at the issue: While the trend is heading in the right direction, the big challenge will be maintaining this initiative even if defense spending caps return in the budget for fiscal year 2020. Depending on how the midterm elections go, that could very well be the case. As I have noted repeatedly in the past, the current defense spending trend is not sustainable . So regardless, the Navy and USMC will have to come to terms with better balancing their readiness and modernization goals in the years to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 10, 2019",So Much For Sanctions! Kim Jong Un’s New Ride Is A Rolls Royce Phantom,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited North Korea on the 7th of October, 2018 to try and jump-start denuclearization talks with North Korean officials. After being snubbed by Kim on his last visit, Pompeo met with the increasingly visible North Korean leader this time around and Kim’s arrival at the engagement was quite grand indeed. Video from the meeting shows Pompeo waiting in a foyer when two big ornate doors swing open to the outside and Kim saunters over a red carpet and across the foyer to embrace Pompeo. But it’s not what happened in the foreground of this video that’s most interesting, it’s what was sitting in the backgroundâ€”a big, gleaming Rolls Royce Phantom. Â Kim’s Pullman Guard Mercedes limousines , based on the 2012 S600, have been fixtures in the ‘Dear Leader’s’ travels around Pyongyang, Panmunjom and most recently, abroad. Kim is known transportation aficionado, having a special interest in aircraft and cars since he was a young boy. This made international headlines when Kim took a peek at Trump’s limousine, popularly known as The Beast, during the summit in Singapore last June. Now it appears that despite extreme sanctionsâ€”especially on luxury goodsâ€”and a rickety economy that is supposedly slowly starving due to lack of energy stocks, Kim was able to get his hands on the most luxurious of luxury cars.Â The fact that the car was showcased during Kim’s grand arrival to the meeting with Pompeo was no accident. It was a North Korean show of defiance against the entire sanctions regime that the U.S. has championed, and a rolling symbol of its supposed futility. China and Russia have relaxed their enforcement of sanctions against rogue state since the thaw between North and South Korea began last Winter. Since then, Kim has been elevated on the world stage and his country seems to be increasingly viewedâ€”albeit begrudginglyâ€”an accepted nuclear power by some of its neighbors in the region regardless of if they claim otherwise.Â pic.twitter.com/MFvFWz8Wf1 — Opendprk.org (@opendprk) October 8, 2018 The ‘Young General’ has traveled to China three times since the de-escalation in North-South tensions began, in addition to his trip to Singapore to shake the American President’s hand in front of a global audienceâ€” no strings attached. In most of those instances, his limousines traveled with him aboard Air Koryo Il-76 ailifters . Now there are some indications that Kim, or a very high-ranking North Korean delegation, could soon travel to nearby Vladivostok, Russia to meet Russian officials. If Kim were to make the trip to Vladivostokâ€”the first of its kindâ€”Vladimir Putin would too. Closer ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have been in the works for months as the Kremlin clearly sees North Korea’s profile on the rise and views the country as yet another strategic locale in which to compete with the United States for influence.Â Airborne from Pyongyang, North Korea KJU > Vladivostok? ðŸ¤” ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ Air Koryo IL62 P-885 https://t.co/HMLz8gDo2i pic.twitter.com/moAdzb2WfA — CivMilAir âœˆðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ (@CivMilAir) October 8, 2018 ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ North Korea: 3 x Heavy lift IL76 cargo flights from Pyongyang, NK > Vladivostok, Russia scheduled for 7th October ðŸ¤” pic.twitter.com/cLqR1WDDx8 — CivMilAir âœˆðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ (@CivMilAir) October 6, 2018 What’s not known is if Kim Jong Un’s Rolls Royce is armored. Multiple companies convert these land-yachts into rolling fortresses .Â A number of companies offer armor packages for the Phantom, including this one by Alpine Co. , Alpine Armoring Company In particular, Mutec has had an affiliation with Rolls Royce directly and has been offering the Phantom with extreme VR7 level protection in a package that is virtually indistinguishable from the stock vehicle since roughly 2007. One would assume that this example has undergone such a transformation. Otherwise, it could be used just for moving Kim around is sprawling compounds in his own country. We’ll have to wait and see if it shows up on his next foreign engagement, or even outside the gates of his secured properties, and if there is more than one. The fact that one of his Pullman Guard limousines was used to ferry Pompeo and his team from Pyongyang airport to a government compound points the real possibility that he no longer uses the cars as a primary transport. In the past, North Korea has used very old limousines for second-tier VIP transport purposes, including Mercedes models from the 1980s and 1990s.Â pic.twitter.com/H420sQEQ2s — Opendprk.org (@opendprk) October 8, 2018 If Kim has replaced his Pullman Guard limousines with Rolls Royce Phantoms, it would stick with a recent trend in world leaders upgrading their own cars. China , Russia , and the United States have all unveiled new and totally custom presidential limousines in recent months. The thing is there aren’t that many of these vehicles around and especially if the one Kim has is armored. Roughly 10,000 Phantoms have been built between 2003 and 2017, and that includes many visually identifiable sub-types that this vehicle is not. Surely intelligence agencies are on the hunt to try and figure out how this car made its way into North Korean hands while the country is supposedly under an extreme sanctions regime. In that regard, Kim’s Phantom may present analysts with a unique opportunity to trace from who and from where North Korea is getting its high-end contraband imports. Clearly, if they can get an armored Rolls Royce Phantom into Pyongyang they can get just about anything else there too.Â Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway and Ivan Voukadinov,"Posted on Apr 24, 2019",Exclusive: Russian MiG-31 Foxhound Carrying Huge Mystery Missile Emerges Near Moscow,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s recent adaptation of their Iskander tactical ballistic missile into an air-launched weapon made major headlines and was among the least technologically reaching of Putin’s new cadre of superweapons that are supposedly in development . The carrier aircraft for that weapon, named ‘Kinzhal,’ is MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor. The MiG-31, which evolved out of the MiG-25 Foxbat, has the ability to carry heavy loads to high altitudes and at very speeds approaching mach three. This makes it an ideal launch platform not just for ballistic missiles meant to strike targets on the surface of the earth, but also for small suborbital or even orbital payloads, and especially direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons. On September 14th, 2018 what appears to be just such a launch system was photographed at Zhukovsky Airport outside of Moscow by aviation photographer ShipSash . Zhukovsky is a major testing base for Russian aerial weaponry, something very loosely akin to Edwards Air Force Base here in the United States, although Zhukovsky now has a small commercial terminal as well. At the heart of the airport is a huge runway measuring nearly 18,000-foot long runway, the second largest publically accessible runway in the world. That long runway is there because the storied Gromov Flight Institute is also based at the airfield. Zhukovsky Airport also hosts the biennial MAKS international air show., Google Earth The institute operates a wide variety of aircraft for testing purposes, from Tu-154 transports to MiG-29s. One of these aircraft is a unique variant of the MiG-31, the same as is seen carrying this large missile aloft in the photo at the top of this article with the ’81 Blue’ bort number painted on its side. This particular aircraft started to appear in photos about a year ago. Initially, it seemed like a regular MiG-31BM, which is the designation assigned to the MiG-31s which have been progressively upgraded and modernized by the Russian air force. The MiG-31BM is easily distinguished by the periscope fairing on the cockpit canopy , as well as a large blade aerial on the bottom port side of the fuselage, close to the nose gear. It also features low profile missile pylons on the wings, which are meant to carry R-73 and R-77 missiles, replacing the wing mounted R-40 missile that older MiG-31 versions used to carry. However, 81 Blue soon became a mystery since it had certain external features not present on standard MiG-31BMs. It lacked missile pylons completely and didn’t feature the large blade aerial. It did, however, have the periscope fairing, which suggests it went through a modernization similar to standard MiG-31BMs. It also featured two chin mounted blade shaped pitot tubes under the nose. Although there are some speculations, the purpose of the aircraft remained unknown. MiG-31BM, Dmitriy Pichugin After president Putin unveiling the new Kh-47B Kinzhal ballistic missile carried by the MiG-31 last March, a new version of the MiG-31 used to fire the Kinzhal, first dubbed MiG-31K by the media and later MiG-31BP by the Russian Ministry of Defense, was identified. It had all the same external features as the previously seen 81 Blue except the two chin mounted pitot tubes. This suggested that 81 Blue was still involved with a different program but one similar to Kinzhal. In addition, all the MiG-31BPs are based at Akhtoobinsk, which is a remote flight test airbase in southern Russia, while 81 Blue is based at Zhukovsky, near Moscow. Throughout 2018, as more pictures of the MiG-31BP surfaced, it became clear that all of them were in the same external configuration and all of them featured air-to-air refueling probes. About 500 MiG-31s were produced until the early 1990s, of which 349 were the basic version. Later, the MiG-31DZ introduced air-to-air refueling capability. The last and most capable version before production stopped in the early 1990s was the MiG-31B. It also featured a refueling probe. When the MiG-31BM modernization program first started, the Russian air force first upgraded its MiG-31Bs. Once they were all upgraded, older versions of the MiG-31 without air-to-air refueling started going through the modernization program. Oddly, the air-to-air refueling capable MiG-31DZs seemed to be skipped over. However, once the MiG-31BP came to light, all of them had refueling probes. Clearly, the MiG-31DZs had been routed towards the Kinzhal firing MiG-31BP program. MiG-31BP carry a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile., Russian MoD The photos of 81 Blue show it has a refueling probe, meaning it probably was upgraded from a MiG-31DZ and has a similar purpose as the MiG-31BP. In addition, a second aircraft similar to 81 Blue but carrying an ID ’06 Red’ was also spotted at Zhukovsky around the same time. It had all the same external features as 81 Blue, but lacked the periscope fairing. However, this might be a trivial detail. A photo of 06 Red shows a round convex antenna on the top side of the left intake with an AS-77 antenna of the PPA-S/V-04 space and long-range navigation system. The directional A-737 antenna used by the GLONASS system, characteristic of upgraded MiG-31BMs, is retained. The convex antenna is also present on 81 Blue. So there may be two examples of this unique Foxhound variant intended for the same project. According to unofficial information, the Mikoyan OKB has been working on two versions of the MiG-31 known internally as ‘article 06’ and ‘article 08.’ Article 08 was supposedly the carrier of the already known Kinzhal missile, with article 06 being a new version of the interceptor, with a completely different purpose—like potentially carrying an anti-satellite weapon or space launch system. It would feature a new inertial navigation system, radar, electronic warfare suite, and the suspension points under the fuselage have been reworked with the expectation of the weight of the new rocket. This would not be the first time the MiG-31 has been used in an anti-satellite project. More than 30 years ago, in January 1987, the MiG-31D (“article 07”), which was the carrier of the 79M6 anti-satellite missile, made its first flight. The aircraft and missiles were elements of the anti-satellite weapon 30P6 ‘Kontakt’ system. The rocket was developed by KB Vympel. The project was largely a response to the United States’ own direct ascent air-launched anti-satellite missile system, the ASM-135 , that used a modified F-15 called the Celestial Eagle as a launch platform. The weapon was successfully tested in 1985. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lBrJniNayHU Two MiG-31D prototypes were made, however in 1991, work on the MiG-31D and its improved version the MiG-31DM with a 95M6 rocket (upgraded version 79M6) was stopped. After the collapse of the USSR, both prototypes of the MiG-31D remained at the Sary-Shagan test site in Kazakhstan—the same place where they were tested. Bottom: The MiG-31D with its large winglets. Top: The aircraft and its anti-satellite missile. Note the resemblance of the missile to the one photographed just days ago., ruslet.webnode.cz The MiG-31D differed from the base Foxhound, first of all, in the fact that it removed all the old weapons, parts of its avionics equipment, and eliminated the fuselage mounting points for the R-33 missiles. Vertical “winglets” were installed on the wingtips to increase stability when the anti-satellite rocket was suspended. Its radar was removed and a metal fairing replaced its radome. The whole idea was to fly as high and fast as possible to get the heavy anti-satellite missile in position to fire. This is a graphic depicting the MiG-31 satellite launch concept., Public Domain In 1997, MAPO MiG, leveraging their experience working on the MiG-31D, began the development of the MiG-31S. This aircraft was designed to launch rockets carrying small satellites into space. The rocket, named RN-S (“carrier rocket launched from aircraft”), with a capacity of up to 440lbs was planned to be launched from the aircraft flying at an altitude of about 51,000 at a speed of 1,865mph (Mach 2.8). The rocket was developed by the Vimpel design bureau. The first launch was scheduled for 1999-2000 but it never happened. In 2001 RSK MiG tried to re-launch the design of the MiG-31S aircraft as a civil project for launching small satellites with a mass of 220lbs or less. This project didn’t evolve into an operational state either and there were other similar initiatives involving the MiG-31 that failed as well. With all this in mind, the idea that Russia would be recycling old Soviet-era concepts to rapidly gain the ability to deploy small payloads into orbit via an air-launched rocket, or even more likely, take down enemy satellites in orbit—or possibly both—is glaringly logical. The U.S. military and private industry have examined similar micro-satellite launch concepts, usually leveraging the F-15C Eagle as a launch platform. Today, multiple companies are working on using aircraft as first-stages for orbital access systems used to put a wide variety of payloads into various orbits, the heaviest-lifting being Stratolaunch with its Roc launcher aircraft. Anti-satellite weaponry is a different story, as the U.S. seems to have moved its focus from direct-ascent kinetic kill concepts to less invasive ones that do not risk turning large stretches of low-earth orbit into a cloud of super-destructive debris , among many other advantages as well. These concepts include putting satellites into orbit that can jam, blind, disable, or even kill enemy satellites. You can read all about them here . By all indications , Russia is also working on similar concepts and likely has experimental capabilities along these lines already orbit . These satellites are part of Russia’s larger and layered anti-satellite strategy that includes the development of an airborne laser intended to disable or destroy satellites (another recycled program from the Cold War era) and its emerging missile defense system also is thought to have distinct anti-satellite capabilities. China is moving along a similar path as Russia in developing an array of anti-satellite technologies. Having a tactical asset like the MiG-31 that is able to take down satellites by surprise from pretty much any location that Russia has access to doesn’t just seem possible, it seems probable. It would make up a critically important tier of Russia’s layered anti-satellite weapons ‘complex.’ And since Russia has already spent decades developing similar air-launched systems, that research can be leveraged to rapidly get such a capability into an operational form. The missile seen in the photograph is significantly larger than Kinzhal and appears to feature a set of folding fins at its rear. It is likely a two-stage system, or at least features a powered kill vehicle for anti-satellite duties. ShipSash It’s also possible that this is another air-launched ballistic missile like Kinzhal, but that seems doubtful as Kinzhal is still very new itself and adding a bit more range to an already forward deployable system would have questionable value. Also, the profile of this weapon looks more like a space-launch asset than anything else. There is also the possibility that this system is an anti-ship ballistic missile, which have major tactical and strategic merits. China is developing an air-launched version of its own DF-21D as part of its grand anti-access strategy aimed at keeping the U.S. Navy’s carrier strike groups at bay. But Kinzhal is already supposed to either have that capability or it is slated to acquire it sometime in the future. Developing a completely separate weapon for that role alone seems wasteful when an existing system can be adapted for it. The latest video showing a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile test: Another possibility is that this system is used to deploy an air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. But that speculation comes from an established interest in such a capability, not from any evidence in the photo, aside from maybe the thickness of the nose cone area. We can’t stress enough, that above all else, being able to swat-down force multiplying American satellites in low-earth orbit with the inherent flexibility and surprise of an aerial launch platform would be very valuable to Russian forces, regardless of the consequences to the future habitability of low-earth orbit. On the other hand, being able to rapidly and unpredictably put up small satellites, especially to replace ones that are lost in battle, is also become increasingly important due to the growing proliferation of anti-satellite weaponry. It’s even possible that one system could be adapted for both roles. This could be just such a system. We will report back to you as soon as we find out more about this mysterious missile and the Foxhound that carries it. Update: October 8th, 2018— A third aircraft, with tactical code 94 Red and the same distinguishing features as 81 Blue and 06 Red, has also been noted at Zhukovsky in May 2018. So at least three examples of this modification are known to exist. Tyler’s note: This is the first time that talented photographer and aerospace journalist Ivan Voukadinov worked directly with me in developing and writing a story, but he has assisted me in the background on some very high-profile articles that I have posted here and on my previous two sites in the past. He is unbelievably knowledgeable about Russian aviation subjects. Hopefully, we will see more of him here in the future, but before then here’s a little more about Ivan: “I live in Chicago but I’m originally from Bulgaria. I’ve been doing aviation journalism and photography for about a decade now. I’m interested in all aviation but I tend to focus more on Russian and Eastern Bloc aviation topics, both current and historical.” Also, I want to give a huge thanks to ShipSash for sharing his photo with us.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 21, 2021",Northrop Grumman Shows Off Shipping Container-Launched Anti-Radiation Missile Concept,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Association of the United States Army conference and expo is underway in Washington DC and our own Joe Trevithick was making the rounds around the show floor and spotted a very interesting concept from Northrop Grumman. It takes the increasingly popular containerized weapons trend and mixes it with the company’s newest anti-radiation missile designs, the AARGM, which is the advanced AGM-88E version of the long-proven High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), and the longer-range AARGM-ER with its sleeker form factor. You can read all about that missile here . In essence, such a system could place enemy threat emitters at risk in a persistent manner anywhere within the range of launcher’s missiles. And that containerized launcher could be located on a road or at sea, as well as in semi-fixed positions. These missiles can be fired in a lock-on after launch manner, flying out to a certain area where an enemy emitter is active before locking on and making their terminal attacks. Being networked, they can even be retasked in flight. Electronic surveillance aircraft, including fighters equipped with advanced electronic support measures suites and operating deep behind enemy lines, could detect electronic threats and call up these surface-based missiles remotely on demand to suppress and/or destroy those threats. This not only drastically expands magazine depth for tactical aircraft when it comes to countering SAM sites and other hostile air-defense nodes, but it also adds a high level of unpredictability to counter-air defense operations. AGM-88E in testing. , USN These missiles aren’t just anti-radiation missiles anymore, really. They are uniquely capable of prosecuting time sensitive and fleeing targets from standoff ranges—even those that may have stopped emitting electromagnetic energy, or never even emitted any all. The AGM-88E can be told to strike a target at a particular GPS coordinate and its active radar seeker can even track and refine its attack path on a target that begins to move away from that area. This is especially deadly for road-mobile anti-aircraft systems, but it can also be so for other target types, as well. So yes, you get an incredibly capable anti-radiation missile that can even blast emitters that stop broadcasting with a high degree of certainty, but you also get a missile that can destroy smaller time-sensitive targets, including ships and vehicles on the move within a certain geographical area. Oh, and it can do all that while careening towards its target at over Mach two. https://youtube.com/watch?v=16EimRYN3uw If anything else, this concept is another reminder of how the very understanding of the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) missions are evolving in unique and creative ways. This goes along with the sentiments of one of the most famous Wild Weasel and fighter pilots of our time, Dan Hampton. In an interview from April of 2017 with The War Zone, Hampton stated: “There are ways in and around those systems and I will go back to one of my life-long premises—anything that kills a SAM or part of a SAM can be a Wild Weasel. So it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s me in a tactical airframe. It might be special forces teams on the ground blowing up radars. It might be naval warships standing offshore if they’re within range of their guns and just blasting the hell out of them.” AARGM-ER mock-up mounted inside and F-35’s weapons bay. , Orbital ATK But really, this idea isn’t entirely new. Israel, a country that has pioneered many SEAD/DEAD concepts, adapted the AGM-78 Standard air-launched anti-radiation missile to be fired from the ground via a specialized M809 truck-mounted box launcher system. This system, deployed in the 1980s, was called ‘Keres’ (Hook) with missile itself being called ‘Egrof Segoal’ (Purple Punch). The AGM-78 was itself a retooled SM-1 Standard ship-launched surface-to-air missile—talk about coming full circle. Although the AGM-78 packed a big warhead—215lbs—that system wasn’t even as remotely as capable, as versatile, or as long-reaching as the AGM-88E and its forthcoming sister missile, the AARGM-ER. Keres anti-radiation missile launcher., Bukvoed/wikicommons An even cruder Israeli ground-based anti-radiation missile system predates Keres. The ‘Kilshon’ was basically an AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile that launched from a rail mounted atop an M4A1 Sherman tank. This system served throughout the 1970s following the Yom Kippur War and was eventually replaced by Keres. Eventually, Harpy suicide drones and their successors replaced Keres and the land-based anti-radiation missile concept in IDF service, but in some ways, it is still alive today. In this day and age, Israeli ground-launched cruise missiles get fed coordinates of active enemy radar systems and are fired at those sites on short order. These cruise missiles, such as the ground-launched Delilah , lack the speed of their anti-radiation predecessors. Now, Israel also has an evolved series of guided artillery rockets that are very fast, but not as long-ranged, and they don’t possess the ability to chase down active emitters or moving targets. Yet what makes this concept most exciting is its modularity and deployability. It can be strapped to the deck of a ship, carted around by a semi or flatbed truck, or get airlifted into a remote firebase. It could even potentially be hidden aboard a vessel masquerading as a civilian transport, ready to provide fast-reacting suppression of enemy air defenses capabilities in support of an incoming aerial assault. Because it uses a standard ISO container, under very certain circumstances the system could even potentially be snuck into enemy territory, or into a less hostile country that shares a border with it, and be used by surprise to kick-down the enemy’s air defenses ahead of or during an air operation—all without even putting an aircraft at risk. Using this system during a ground operation in contested territory could help significantly with providing protection for Army helicopters and other lower-flying assets from pop-up radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery and road-mobile SAM systems. The containerized weapon system concept began to emerge about a decade ago and has steadily become an increasingly attractive and versatile deployment concept for both higher-end and lower-end combat capabilities. Russia, in particular, has embraced the idea and is now designing entire ships around it. The U.S. seems to be following suit, albeit slowly. We will keep an eye out to see if or how this concept evolves, but regardless, it really does underline just how capable and flexible the next generation of anti-radiation missiles really are.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 31, 2019",One Of These Big Cannon Toting Armored Vehicles May Replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Dynamics has revealed the latest iteration of its Griffin armored vehicle demonstrator , which now packs a 50mm automatic cannon, that the company hopes might turn into a contender for the U.S. Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle program. That over-arching project could result in one or more designs to replace multiple types of armored vehicles, including the Bradley Fighting Vehicle , and competitors are already lining up to offer their own pitches, all of which have super-sized main guns. ‘Griffin III’ was a star attraction at the annual Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) meeting and exhibition in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 8, 2018. The Michigan-headquartered firm had first shown the original Griffin demonstrator at the same event two years earlier . The official request for proposals for the NGCV program is set to come out before the end of 2018 and companies will then have around six months to finalize their offer. “Many of our NATO allies have very capable tanks,” Secretary of the Army Mark Esper had said back in January 2018 . “As I think about a next-generation combat vehicle, we should look at our allies, and look at their designs, and look at how they’ve built combat vehicles and combat systems, and think about adopting some of those.” At the core of the Griffin’s design is the same chassis in the Ajax armored vehicle , which General Dynamics U.K. is selling to the United Kingdom. That vehicle, in turn, was a development of an earlier fighting vehicle design known as the Austrian Spanish Cooperation Development, or ASCOD . The Griffin III demonstrator., Joseph Trevithick The nearly 40 ton Griffin III features a remotely-operated turret the U.S. Army’s own Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) developed, which is armed with a 50mm cannon from Orbital ATK, now part of Northrop Grumman. This weapon is substantially larger than the 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. In addition, the gun comes with an auto-loading mechanism that allows the operator to select specific rounds and various ammunition types for engaging various targets, including infantry and unarmored vehicles in the open, light armored vehicles, and opponents situated inside small structures. The crew can aim the cannon up to a maximum elevation of around 85 degrees, which, combined with proximity-fuzed rounds, give it a secondary capability to engage small, low-flying unmanned aircraft and helicopters. In comparison to 25mm on left, that’s what a 50mm shell would look like #AUSA2018 @ShephardNews pic.twitter.com/Z82Z3FRi4W — Scott Gourley (@ScottGourley1) October 8, 2018 The Army has also developed the turret with modularity in mind, which could allow the service to install smaller guns in a portion of the fleet depending on the intended role. Not surprisingly, it can already accommodate the 30mm XM813 cannon found on the service’s up-gunned Stryker Dragoon wheeled armored vehicles. The increasing move to weapons in the 40mm and 50mm classes is the result of trends among both the United States’ partners, especially in Europe, as well as among potential major power competitors, especially Russia. For years now, the Russians have been experimenting with multi-role, large caliber cannons in turrets that can fit on a wide array of armored vehicles. These include a 57mm type the Kremlin has explored fitting onto the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle , a derivative of that design focused on short-range air defense known as the Derivatsiya-PVO , the T-15 heavy infantry fighting vehicle, and other future designs . https://youtube.com/watch?v=-d_7XNA8IKc It is possible that this trend could extend to the Stryker and other armored vehicles. ARDEC has already supported the development of the Cockerill 3030 turret, which could accept a weapon up to 40mm, for the Stryker, as well. The unmanned nature of the Griffin’s main turret means that the vehicle may eventually only need a crew of two, maximizing internal space for other functions, as well. NGCV has an optionally-manned component, as well, so future versions of the vehicle might be able to operate without anyone inside. But with the Army most immediately focused on replacing the Bradley, General Dynamics says its initial plan is to use the room in the hull to allow the vehicle to function as an infantry fighting vehicle and carry six fully-armed troops, who would exit through a rear door. The Griffin III demonstrator also featured a remote weapon station with a .50 caliber machine gun on top of the main turret, along with a separate sensor turret, which would likely contain electro-optical, infrared, and thermal cameras. The main turret has its own forward-looking sensor suite for target engagement. There was a multi-canister launcher for some type of small unmanned aircraft or loitering munitions, such as AeroVironment Switchblade , on top of the turret, as well. A Stryker wheeled fighting vehicle with the Cockerill 3030 turret., Joseph Trevithick It was also covered in self-defense features, including the Iron Fist active protection system to knock down incoming anti-tank guided missiles and other shoulder-fired infantry anti-tank weapons, as well as smoke grenade launchers to obscure the vehicle during a firefight. Perhaps most interestingly, the Griffin III demonstrator had Tacticam appliqué armor package from Armorworks that helps reduce its infrared signature and provides a disruptive camouflage coating that breaks up the vehicle’s hard edges. General Dynamics no doubt hopes its offer will be particularly attractive to the Army given the vehicle’s common chassis and hull with the Griffin II, which the company has submitted as a contender for the separate Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. This earlier demonstrator features a turret based on that of the M1 Abrams tank armed with a 105mm gun. The commonality in designs also raises the possibility that the Army may eventually decide to blend MPF, which is focused on developing an air-transportable light tank of sorts to support airborne and light infantry forces, into the larger NGCV program. Similarly, American defense contractor SAIC and Singapore’s ST Kinetics have offered a 105mm gun-armed derivative of the latter company’s Next Generation Armored Fighting Vehicle, or NGAFV . That design uses a Cockerill 3105 turret , which can already accept large caliber automatic cannons, as well, making it potentially adaptable to the NGCV’s requirements. Other contenders in the upcoming NGCV competition, many of which also brought their prospective vehicles to the AUSA event, might look to adapt their vehicles to meet the needs of the MPF program, as well. A model of SAIC and ST Kinetic’s Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle., Joseph Trevithick The most significant of these possibility competitors is the newly announced partnership between U.S. company Raytheon and Germany’s Rheinmetall. The two will be offering a version of the latter’s Lynx KF41 armored fighting vehicle, which first emerged at the Eurosatory arms show in Paris earlier in 2018. The Lynx has made of the same basic features as the Griffin III, but a greater weight of around 44 tons. One of its most important features is the ability to attach two modular pods to either side of the turret that could hold anti-tank guided missiles, launchers for small drones or loitering munitions, additional sensors, or other equipment. The vehicle’s Lance turret can be either manned or unmanned, but can only accommodate an automatic cannon up to 35mm at present. Rheinmetall’s KF41 Lynx, which it will submit to the Army’s NGCV program in partnership with Raytheon., Joseph Trevithick BAE Systems also displayed the CV90 Mk IV , which again has many features in common with the Griffin III, including the use of the Iron First active protection system. It will also have an augmented reality vision system for the crew to give them improved situational awareness even while safely situated inside with all the hatches closed, which would severely limit the view in most traditional armored vehicles. This is also among the lightest of the possible NGCV options so far at 37 tons. This newest iteration of the Swedish-designed vehicle now features a pop-up launcher for anti-tank guided missiles on the right side of the main turret. The turret itself is modular in design and could accommodate automatic cannons between 30mm and 50mm, or even a 105mm main gun, again making it also a potential option of the MPF program. BAE’s CV90 Mk IV., Joseph Trevithick The Army still has a long ways to go on the NGCV program. The present plan is to evaluate a host of possible options and then pick two firms to go head to head in a final competition starting at the end of 2019. What seems increasingly clear from the Griffin III, and the other potential contenders, is that the Army wants a vehicle with a substantial increase in firepower and is making good on Secretary Esper’s pledge to consider foreign designs to attain that goal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 8, 2019",These Pods Could Let Drones Carry Throngs of Small Smart Bombs And It’s Just The Start,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is considering the Hatchet miniature munition, a tiny precision glide bomb , as a possible future armament option for its MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones together with dispenser pods that could let a single one of the unmanned aircraft carry dozens of them at a time. At the same time, the manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, is proposing larger systems that would enable MQ-9 Reapers in service with the U.S. Air Force to carry hundreds of the weapons on a single mission. Orbital ATK first unveiled Hatchet , which weighs approximately eight pounds and has a three-pound warhead, in 2012. Northrop Grumman finished its acquisition of the Virginia-headquartered defense and space systems firm, in June 2018, subsequently renaming it as their Innovation Systems division. The Army’s interest in Hatchet stems primarily from a desire to increase the number of total targets a single MQ-1C can engage over the course of one sortie, a Northrop Grumman representative explained to The War Zone at the annual Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) meeting and exhibition in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 8, 2018. On a mission that might last 36 hours or more , depending on the exact Gray Eagle variant and loadout, crews may decide not to strike targets of opportunity early on for fear of not having ordnance in more critical situations, such as a call to provide close air support for friendly troops ground. At present, the MQ-1C’s can carry a maximum of four AGM-114 Hellfire laser-guided missiles on four separate underwing pylons. Northrop Grumman is working on a 125-pound class dispenser that would remain attached to the drone and would be able to carry 12 Hatchets at a time on a single pylon. A model showing Northrop Grumman’s 12-Hatchet carraige system as it would appear under the wing of an MQ-1C next to a standard Hellfire missile., Joseph Trevithick The tiny glide bombs are still in development, but Northrop Grumman plans to offer them with a variety of guidance options, including a GPS/INS system by itself, as well as that coupled with a laser or imaging infrared seeker. The weapon may even come with a semi-active millimeter wave radar capability in the future. This mix of options would give Hatchet the ability to strike in poor weather and against moving targets, as well as be able to automatically detect and engage those targets. In the dual-mode configurations, the GPS/INS guidance system steers the weapon to the general target area before the second seeker takes over. A single 12-weapon dispenser could carry a mix of types that would give a single MQ-1C more flexibility to engage those targets regardless of the environmental and other factors, as well. Clouds, smoke, and other obscurants can impair the ability for laser designators to mark a target, which could limit the ability of a drone carrying only Hellfires to engage the enemy. One of the most immediate target sets for Hatchet would be targeted strikes against particular terrorists or small groups of militants in the open or traveling in light vehicles . The small size of the warhead would also give Gray Eagle crews a better option when conducting those strikes in dense, urban areas or when the targets might otherwise be close to innocent civilians or their homes. A mock-up of the Hatchet miniature munition., Joseph Trevithick But improved fragmentation warhead technology, also known as “ alternative warheads ,” which the U.S. military has been working on as a substitute for cluster munitions , will reportedly give Hatchet, or at least certain variants, enhanced wide-area effects against more conventional, unarmored targets in the open, as well. It will only take six of them to saturate an area the size of a football field with a hail of shrapnel, according to the manufacturer. Whatever the exact target set, a single MQ-1C carrying four dispensers for a total of 48 Hatchets would be able to quickly engage multiple targets across a broad area. The MQ-9s, which can carry much larger stores, could see an even bigger boost in capability with Hatchet. Northrop Grumman is working on a larger, 500-pound class pod for those drones, each one of which will be able to carry 54 of the miniature munitions. Again, this unit would remain attached to the aircraft and a rotary launcher inside would dispense the glide bombs through a port in the bottom. Another model showing Northrop Grumman’s 54-Hatchet dispenser pod as it would appear under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper next to a GBU-12/B Paveway II laser-guided bomb., Joseph Trevithick A single Reaper could conceivably carry as many as 216 of these weapons at a time, dramatically increasing its magazine depth and giving it the ability to continuing striking at targets throughout long-duration missions. With so many munitions on a single pylon, it could also allow for more flexibility in load outs, allowing both the Reapers and the Gray Eagles to carry underwing sensor and electronic warfare systems , as appropriate, but without necessarily sacrificing the total number of targets they would be able to strike in a single mission. The Hatchet dispensers could be an attractive option for other aircraft, as well. We at The War Zone have already discussed in detail the benefits the system could offer to stealthy aircraft, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which have limited space and significant dimensional constraints inside their internal weapons bays . But the dispensers should be compatible with any aircraft or helicopter that can carry similar 125-pound or 500-pound class munitions, as well. Northrop Grumman designed the 12-bomb system to fit any pylon that can accept a Hellfire launch rail for example. This could make it a particularly good option for fixed-wing light attack aircraft loitering over a particular part of the battlefield for extended periods of time. An MQ-9 carrying an AgilePod modular sensor pod under one wing., USAF The 500-pound class system could exponentially increase the number of individual targets a larger tactical aircraft, such as an F-15E Strike Eagle , or even a bomber would be able to engage, too. A B-52 bomber just carrying nine of these pods under its wings would have nearly 490 Hatchets to dispense, with the potential of creating seamless effects over an area equivalent to more than 80 football fields . The munition’s precision guidance means this wouldn’t need to be a linear carpet bombing run , either, with the plane’s crew able to saturate enemy positions at specific points along a general flight path, while still avoiding areas where collateral damage and civilian casualties are an issue. If the pod works with an internal, rotary launcher, like those found on B-52s, as well as B-1s or B-2s , those bombers might be able to launch thousands of Hatchets in a single sortie, with each hitting a precision target or working to clear a certain defined geographical area. This would enable them to decimate hundreds of individual exposed targets at a particular site and on a single pass, such as a sprawling air base , and still have the capacity to carry a smaller number of larger weapons to destroy hardened structures. In other words, a single bomber could decimate a target set that would have many aircraft in the past, all with extreme precision and the ability to leave critical infrastructure intact. Currently, the closest operation capability to this is the B-2’s ability to carry 80 500lb JDAMs, and those are still huge bombs with large blast radii compared to a weapon like Hatchet. A larger 1,000- or 2,000-pound class dispenser would only further increase the number of Hatchets these aircraft could carry, too. It’s not clear when the Army might make a final decision on what miniature munitions it will add to the arsenal of its MQ-1Cs. Other competitors might include Textron’s Fury and Raytheon’s Pyros , both of which are also multi-mode glide bombs. These firms have proposed more conventional multiple ejector racks for their weapons rather than high-capacity dispensers. Three of Textron’s Fury miniature glide bombs on a more traditional triple ejector rack., Joseph Trevithick The service is formally working in that direction, though, and has funding for the project in the 2019 Fiscal Year budget. The Air Force and Special Operations Command are not as far along in deciding how to expand the MQ-9’s armament, according to Northrop Grumman’s representative at the AUSA expo. Depending on what route the Army takes, we may not have to wait long before we start seeing Gray Eagle drones armed with dozens of miniature precision-guided bombs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 16, 2018",Here Are Some Of The Most Interesting Items On Display At The Army’s Huge Arms Expo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Buoyed by funding from two successively larger defense budgets, the U.S. Army has steadily shifted its primary focus from reversing the most pressing effects of sequestration to a major modernization effort across the service in order to be ready for a possible major conflict with a near-peer opponent, such as Russia or China. This includes plans for numerous big-ticket purchases, including new armored vehicles , rotary-wing aircraft , artillery weapons , air defense systems , infantry weapons , and more. This change in focus was particularly pronounced on the showroom floor of the annual Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) meeting and exhibition in Washington, D.C., which began on Oct. 8, 2018. The event’s theme this year, which the Army selected and approved , is “Ready Today, More Lethal Tomorrow.” “War is very unforgiving for those unprepared and unfortunately, war is not going away from the human experience,” Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley said in a keynote speech on Oct. 9, 2018. “Maybe it will, but not likely in our lifetimes.” We at The War Zone have already brought you some specific reporting from the event, including a look at some of the possible contenders for the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program, an especially interesting concept for surface-launched anti-radiation missiles, and the service’s plans to expand the ability of its MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones to engage the enemy during long-duration missions. Here are some of the other highlights we saw. As already noted, various vehicles vying for the NGCV were among the stars of the show and were also some of the biggest vehicles actually on site. It’s physically difficult to get anything much bigger, such as an actual main battle tank, into a convention center in downtown D.C. and many firms brought models of their armor offerings. Leonardo DRS, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Italian defense contractor, Leonardo had models on display of an M1A2 Abrams tank and a Stryker wheeled armored vehicle with variants of the Trophy active protection system . Israeli firms Rafael and Elta developed Trophy and the European company is now handling the contract to integrate this system onto the Army’s Abrams and potentially other vehicles in the service’s inventory. A model of an M1A2 Abrams tank with the Trophy active protection system., Joseph Trevithick A model of Stryker with a lighter weight version of Trophy known as the Vehicle Protection System (VPS). This vehicle also features explosive reactive armor and remote weapon system with what appears to be either a 30mm or 40mm cannon , a co-axial 7.62mm M240 machine gun, and FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missile launcher., Joseph Trevithick Leonardo DRS has also secured an Army contract to build prototypes of a possible new Initial Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) vehicle. The service’s short-range air defense capabilities, or lack thereof , was a major issue item in 2017 and the development of a new mobile system that can engage low-flying aircraft, helicopters, and small drones has become a priority. The firm’s offering is a Stryker-based system with radars and other sensors to spot and track incoming targets and then engage them with a turreted weapon system on top. The vehicle has a lightweight 30mm cannon, four-round FIM-92 Stinger short-range surface-to-air missile launcher, and separate two-tube launcher for larger missiles, such as the millimeter wave radar-guided AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire . A model of Leonardo’s IM-SHORAD prototype., Joseph Trevithick While the Army is looking to move quickly to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family as part of the NGCV program, that process will still take years to come to fruition and the older vehicles will remain in service for at least some time to come. The Bradley’s chassis also forms the basis of the Army’s forthcoming Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV), which will replace lighter tracked armored vehicles based on the dated M113 armored personnel carrier . As such, there is still a potential market for upgrades for Bradleys and Bradley derivatives. That customer base might grow if the United States expands foreign sales of the surplus vehicles as it replaces them, too. There was a model on display of a Bradley with a Samson 30 remotely operated turret from Israel’s Rafael, which is armed with 30mm cannon and a pop-up launcher for two SPIKE-series guided anti-tank missiles. The notional vehicle also had the Trophy VPS and explosive reactive armor. A model of an upgraded Bradley with a new Samson turret from Israeli firm Rafael, the Trophy VPS, and explosive reactive armor., Joseph Trevithick South Korea’s Hanwha Defense brought models of their AS21 Redback infantry fighting vehicle, as well as an 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle, likely derived from the company’s Black Fox design. The AS21 is very visually similar to Germany’s KF41 Lynx , but is based on the existing K21 infantry fighting vehicle chassis. As with the Lynx, the AS21’s main turret has a large caliber automatic cannon along with an array of sensors and self-defense equipment, including active protection systems and smoke grenade launchers . It also appears to have a pop-up anti-tank guided missile launcher at the rear of the turret. South Korea plans to adopt the Redback itself and has submitted it to Phase 3 of Australia’s Land 400 armored vehicle competition. It could be a contender for the Army’s NGCV program, but Hanwha would need to either partner with a U.S. defense contractor or propose it through a U.S.-based subsidiary. The 8×8 wheeled design also has a turret with a large automatic cannon, along with modular pods on either side for a wide array of what appear to be anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles. This would give the vehicle the ability to perform various roles depending on its configuration, but with most of the same logistical and maintenance requirements. A model of the AS21 Redback., Joseph Trevithick Hanwha’s 8×8 vehicle concept with a modular turret., Joseph Trevithick Singapore’s ST Kinetics, which has paired up with American defense contractor SAIC on a bid for the Army’s Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program, also displayed a model of their Bronco 3 articulated amphibious personnel and cargo carrier. The Army is looking to replace a small fleet of very similar Small Unit Support Vehicles (SUSV) as part of the Joint All Weather All Terrain Support Vehicle ( JAASV ) program it is running with the U.S. Marine Corps. The Bronco 3 is one of a number of more modern options that are available now. A model of ST Kinetics’ Bronco 3., Joseph Trevithick Even as the Army prepares for larger scale conflicts, it still understands the need for light vehicles to provide airborne, light infantry, and other specialized units with added mobility during operations. There were a number of variants of Oskhosh’s Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) on display with various armament and other equipment installed, as well as smaller designs, such as Polaris’ Dagor. The latter type is one of the possible contenders for an Army contract to supply Ground Mobility Vehicles, similar in concept to those already in service with U.S. special operations forces, for conventional units. A JLTV with a remote weapon station with both a .50 caliber machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile., Joseph Trevithick A JLTV equipped with a lightweight variant of the Iron Fist active protection system., Joseph Trevithick A heavily armed Dagor sporting a remote weapon station with .50 caliber and 7.62mm machine guns and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile., Joseph Trevithick The Army plans for its NGCV’s to be optionally manned and is also looking at integrating optionally manned or unmanned ground vehicles within infantry units. These could include driverless cargo carriers to reduce the burden on individual soldiers or armed types with electro-optical and infrared cameras and other sensors to increase the firepower and situational awareness of small units. There is growing interest in UGVs outside the United States, too, particularly in Europe, and not surprisingly, various types were on display at AUSA. Polaris’ MRZR X, an optionally manned version of their popular MRZR militarized all-terrain vehicle., Joseph Trevithick The tracked Titan, a product of a partnership between QinetiQ North American and Milrem, is a modular unmanned vehicle with a semi-autonomous functionality that can act as small transport or an armed scout. In this case, it has a remote weapon station with .50 caliber machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank guided missile., Joseph Trevithick HDT Global’s wheeled Hunter WOLF, or Wheeled Offload Logistics Follower, another semi-autonomous multiple purpose UGV, which in this case also features a remote weapon station with a .50 caliber machine gun. , Joseph Trevithick QinetiQ North America’s Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System ( MAARS ), an early armed UGV that it first delivered to the U.S. military in 2008. This version has a single 7.62mm M240 machine gun and four single-shot 40mm M203 grenade launchers ., Joseph Trevithick The Army isn’t just interested in all-new armored and other ground vehicles, though. It is also pushing ahead with plans for a major transformation of its aviation elements as part of the Future Vertical Lift program . The initial phase of this project is centered on a development of a new medium-lift transport aircraft. An armed gunship derivative of the winning design may follow. The major competitors are Bell, with its V-280 Valor tilt-rotor, and a partnership between Boeing and Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, which has submitted the SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter. The V-280 is undergoing initial flight testing already, while the SB>1 should make its first flight before the end of 2018 . The smaller firm Karem Aircraft is still hoping to compete, as well, with another tilt-rotor design and had a booth at the AUSA expo. A model depicting an armed variant of the V-280 Valor with retractable AGM-114 Hellfire missile launchers and side-firing launch tubes. Bell is also looking to potentially pitch this aircraft to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps for maritime use and those could represent sonobuoy launchers for an anti-submarine warfare mission., Joseph Trevithick A model of the SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter., Joseph Trevithick A model of Karem Aircraft’s tilt-rotor design., Joseph Trevithick Artillery has been another major focus for the Army, which is now looking to develop howitzers with extended range , new guided artillery rockets and surface-to-surface missiles , and acquire potentially game-changing capabilities, such as ground-based electromagnetic railguns and hypervelocity superguns . One of the most interesting concepts to come out of this push so far has been an interest in 155mm artillery shells with air-breathing ramjet engines, which could give otherwise conventional howitzers extreme range. Norway’s Nammo, which is also working on more conventional extended-range ammunition, had unveiled a new design for such a round earlier in the year. Boeing revealed its own at AUSA, as well. South Korea’s Poongsan, which had previously announced plans to develop this type of ammunition in 2016 and was also at the expo, does not appear to be working on a ramjet shell at present.

This combines the proven GBU-39/B GPS-guided 250-pound-class bomb with a modified rocket motor from a GMLRS artillery rocket. The M270 MLRS tracked launcher and the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) wheeled launcher could both fire this system and gain increased stand-off range., Joseph Trevithick An artist’s conception of General Atomics’ ground-based railgun artillery system , which includes the weapon, in the center, along with two additional vehicles carrying the necessary power supply for the weapon., Joseph Trevithick Some of the foreign vendors at AUSA also had artillery concepts that might not necessarily be of interest to the Army itself, but could certainly find customers elsewhere. German’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann had a model of their Boxer wheeled armored vehicle with the company’s Armored Gun Module . This is a relatively small and light turret with a 155mm howitzer inside, which you can read about in more detail here . South Korea’s Hanwha also had on display a 130mm guided artillery rocket system for naval applications, A model of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann’s Boxer armored vehicle with the Armored Gun Module artillery turret., Joseph Trevithick Hanwha’s naval 130mm guided artillery rocket launcher., Joseph Trevithick While examples of traditional air defenses and technologies to counter the growing threat of small drones were less pronounced at the 2018 AUSA gathering as compared to the year before, they were still represented in good numbers. In addition to the aforementioned IM-SHORAD program, the Army is moving ahead with its more obtusely titled Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2 – Intercept, or IFPC Inc 2-I . This program includes requirements for a common Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) that can fire various surface-to-air missiles and hit-to-kill interceptors to shoot down incoming artillery shells and rockets, mortar bombs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and land-attack cruise missiles. The Army is looking to acquire a new missile for this system as part of the related Extended Mission Area Missile (EMAM), but has also expressed an interest in low-cost options to make it more cost effective to be shooting down relatively cheap artillery rounds and drones. A trio of Raytheon missiles, with the AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range infrared-seeking air-to-air missile in the middle, which is already an option for the Army’s MML. To the left is the Sky Hunter, a derivative of the Tamir interceptor the Israeli Iron Dome counter-rockets, artillery, and mortars system. To the right is the Low Cost Active Seeker (LCAS), which is billed as a cheaper alternative to missiles such as the AIM-9X for shooting down more limited threats., Joseph Trevithick On display for the first time, this is Raytheon’s derivative of the Coyote small, expandable drone that it has sold to the US Army as a weapon to counter swarms of small unmanned aircraft, which you can read about in more detail here ., Joseph Trevithick Israel Aerospace Industries has also teamed up with Raytheon to offer a version of their Stunner hit-to-kill interceptor, called SkyCeptor , as a low-cost alternative to the latest examples of the Patriot surface-to-air missile that will work with the same launch systems. Especially in the last two years, Patriot has proven to be an especially capable weapon against a variety of targets, including short-range ballistic missiles and drones. However, it also presents an expensive option for shooting down many of those systems, especially small unmanned aircraft., Joseph Trevithick While the Army has its sights set on modernizing some of its largest pieces of equipment, it is also intent on making individual soldiers more lethal . The service is in the midst of programs that could see the replacement of all the major weapons in the infantry squad, including the M4 carbine and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon , as well as adding additional firepower in the form of the M3E1 Carl Gustaf shoulder-fired recoilless rifle and other infantry anti-tank weapons. Raytheon and Saab are working together to develop this laser-guided round for the Carl Gustaf. It features a dual charge warhead to better defeat explosive reactive armor and other added defenses on armored vehicles, as well as breach through hard cover, such as the wall of a house, to strike at enemy forces. The muntion will also feature a “fire from enclosure” capability making it safe to use even in confined spaces, such as firing through a window or doorway., Joseph Trevithick Norway’s Nammo has already developed a special “fire from enclosure” (FFE) variant of the venerable M72 shoulder-fired rocket launcher. The top projectile in this picture is the anti-structure munition FFE round, while the one in the middle is the anti-armor type. The bottom round is a standard anti-structure type. The FFE M72 versions , which you can read about more here, use a completely different propulsion method more akin to a recoilless rifle, meaning that they don’t have the rocket motor and are therefore shorter in overall length., Joseph Trevithick When it comes to individual infantry weapons, the Army recently announced separate requirements for Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) to replace the M4 and M249. This is an outgrowth of the earlier Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle Program (NGSAR), that focused primarily on developing a SAW replacement. Both NGSW weapons will be chambered in a new Army-developed 6.8mm cartridge called the XM1186, which will offer better ballistics and terminal effects over the existing 5.56x45mm cartridge . Sig Sauer unveiled a new version of its popular MCX series of rifles, which are derived from the AR-15/M16 pattern, at AUSA as an NGSW contender to replace the M4. To help meet the ammunition weight requirements, the Swiss-headquartered gunmaker built ammunition to the Army’s specifications using a hybrid case that is only partially brass and has either a steel or aluminum bottom portion. The company also unveiled a belt-fed machine gun in the same caliber as a possible M249 replacement., Joseph Trevithick Sig Sauer also had their Suppressed Upper Reciever Group (SURG) on display, which is another member of the MCX family. The company developed this system for US Special Operations Command, which had a requirement for a new upper receiver that would work with existing AR-15/M16 pattern lower receivers and feature a sound suppressor, but have a significantly reduced infrared signature, among other features. Sound suppressors quickly get hot during sustained firing, which could make special operators more vulnerable to opponents with infrared optics or thermal vision systems., Joseph Trevithick US Special Operations Command is also evaluating the MCX Rattler, an ultra-compact assault rifle chambered in the .300 Blackout cartridge, which you can read about more here ., Joseph Trevithick The Army may also be interested in Sig Sauer’s 9mm MPX submachine gun, which is derived from the MCX family of rifles. The service recently began shopping for a new, ultra-compact 9mm submachine gun to equip personnel assigned to personal security details., Joseph Trevithick Sig Sauer is also the company producing the Army’s new M17 and M18 pistols . At AUSA, they had one of four heavily customized versions – each with their own name, Silence, Respect, Dignity, or Perseverance – that the Army’s honor guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetary will carry. “Silence” was the pistol on display and you can read more about the significance of its various features in the official press release here ., Joseph Trevithick This example of Heckler and Koch’s HK416 rifle , another derivative of the AR-15/M16 pattern, at firearm accessory maker Magpul’s booth has one of the company’s adjustable stocks, a handguard with the firm’s proprietary “M-Lok” accessory mounting system, and a 60-round drum magazine. The US Marine Corps is presently evaluating the drum for their M27 Infantry Automatic Rifles , a version of the HK416, and the Army might be interested in it, as well., Joseph Trevithick Defense contractor SAI, while supplies the US military with ammunition feed chutes of various types, had a version of what is commonly known as the “ Predator Backpack ” on display. A reference to the 1987 action classic , this system contains a 7.62mm ammunition magazine in the backpack that can feed weapons, such as the M240 machine gun seen here. , Joseph Trevithick These are just some of the highlights of what was on display at the 2018 AUSA event, which had more than 700 vendors spread out across exhibit halls on two separate floors of the Washington Convention Center. With the Army eager to acquire more modern equipment and explore emerging technologies, it’s likely that many defense contractors are continuing to work on systems to meet the services requirements that we have yet to see.

The category four Hurricane Michael, the likes of which the likes of which the Florida panhandle has not seen in modern times, made landfall with its eye passing directly over Tyndall Air Force Base. The installation, which sits on the coast near Panama City, is not only the home of F-22 Raptor pilot training, but it also supports many other facets of training and weapons development, including acting as the launch, recovery, and control site for the Air Force’s Full-Scale Aerial Target program , which is now based around the QF-16. Suffice it to say, there is a lot of highly important, sensitive and expensive gear located there, as well as capabilities that are critical to the USAF’s long-term readiness. Even for structures built to withstand hurricane force winds, taking a direct hit from a storm that is packing sustained wind speeds of 150mph is a whole different story. There is also storm surge and torrential rain to contend with. Tyndall AFB sits roughly a dozen feet above sea level, and there are lower areas as well. Panama City is taking an incredible wallop from this storm, with video of roofs being ripped off buildings and structures being demolished playing on repeat on national news stations. Tyndall may be right in the storm’s eye, but many other military installations, both big and small, also call the affected area where the storm is charging inland home, most notably Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field. All of these bases have very well planned storm evacuation plans, which include flying any aircraft that can take to the air to safer locales far from the storm’s projected path. In Tyndall Air Force Base’s case, its F-22, T-38, and QF-16 jets went to Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 7, 2018",U.S. And Belgium Nab Chinese Spy Accused Of Stealing GE Jet Engine Tech And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In an apparent first-of-its-kind operation, or at least the first to be successful against the Chinese government, U.S. authorities have secured the extradition of a senior member of that country’s top civilian intelligence agency from Belgium after coaxing him there in the first place. Yanjun Xu stands accused of orchestrating the theft of trade secrets, potentially including details on U.S. military-related systems, from American aerospace companies including GE Aviation . The news comes as President Donald Trump and his administration have become increasingly critical of various Chinese activities targeting the United States, including its long-standing economic and military espionage operations. Belgian authorities arrested Xu on April 1, 2018, and the U.S. Department of Justice announced his extradition to the United States on Oct. 10, 2018. The intelligence officer, the deputy division head of the Jiangsu Province office of the Ministry of State Security (MSS), reportedly first began attempting to infiltrate into the American aviation and aerospace sectors in December 2013. “This case is not an isolated incident.  It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense,” Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Demers said in a statement . “We cannot tolerate a nation’s stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.” Xu, using the aliases Qu Hui and Zhang Hui, is said to have lured experts to China under the pretenses of delivering presentations to university students and often passed himself off as a member of the Jiangsu Science and Technology Promotion Association. He would try to convince them to bring sensitive documents with them and then turn them over to him. GE Aviation’s Boeing 747 testbed aircraft with one of the company’s new GE9X engines . Yanjun Xu allegedly sought to acquire details about the company’s jet engine developments., GE Aviation The nature of his capture suggests that he would then seek to expand the relationship and secure additional information. He arrived in Belgium in March 2018, to meet with an engineer from GE Aviation, but was instead detained by authorities in that country. The unnamed engineer had kept up contacts with Xu and met with him in China between May and June 2017. GE Aviation had become aware of this security breach and shared that information with the FBI, which helped set the stage for the European sting. The apparent goal of the Chinese effort to steal secrets from GE Aviation had to do with the desire to acquire details on advanced jet turbine engine technology. China has historically struggled to build efficient and reliable jet engines, which have hampered its civil and military aviation programs , especially with regards to large airliners and cargo aircraft . In 2011 , GE actually established a joint venture with a Chinese firm that involved the sharing of engine and other aviation-related technical data. The American company saw it as a path to increase engine sales to the country, a lucrative, but potentially risky market that it continues to work within. In 2017, it signed new deals with Chinese firms worth approximately $3.5 billion that included new engine sales. The performance of China’s Y-20 large airlifter has been significantly limited by the need to use Russia D-30KP-2 jet engines due to delays in the development of the domestic WS-20 high-bypass turbofan engine., Alert5 via Wikimedia The Department of Justice did not name any other company swept up in the alleged affair, but Assistant Attorney General Demers’ reference to “firepower” suggests that defense contractors were also, not surprisingly, targets. The MSS is also implicated in the theft of information about a top-secret U.S. military anti-ship missile program called Sea Dragon earlier in 2018. That was reportedly the result of a cyber attack rather than the more traditional espionage Xu allegedly took part in, though. In August 2018, the FBI had also detained Chinese national Xiaoqing Zheng for stealing thousands of sensitive files from GE’s power division regarding turbines for powerplants, but it’s not clear if this is related to Xu’s operation. Zheng reportedly planned to smuggle the information back to China to support his own business venture. Xu’s case is reportedly linked to the arrest of Ji Chaoqun , another Chinese national who was living in Chicago, in September 2018, according to The Washington Post . The U.S. government says that Ji helped pass information on potential recruitment targets for economic espionage to the MSS. It is not clear yet whether or not Ji was working directly with Xu or any member of his network. “If not the first, this is an exceptionally rare achievement – that you’re able to catch an espionage operative and have them extradited to the United States,” John Carlin, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney General for National Security, told The Post . “It significantly raises the stakes for China and is a part of the deterrence program that some people thought would never be possible.” An early prototype of China’s FC-31/J-31 stealth fighter. Its external visual similarities to Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter have led many to wonder if its design might be the product of Chinese theft of information related to the American aircraft., AP It is certainly an important victory for the United States, which has openly criticized China’s efforts to steal important economic and military information for years , often exploiting Americans to do so. Just in June 2018, the FBI arrested Ron Rockwell Hansen , a former Defense Intelligence Agency case officer, for delivering classified and sensitive materials to Chinese intelligence agents in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars over the span of multiple years. In spite of those regular allegations, it has proven difficult to halt Chinese espionage activities in the physical realm, as well as in cyberspace . Xu’s arrest and extradition also follow a new surge in terse rhetoric between American and Chinese officials, including from Trump and Vice President Pence. In the last year, relations between the two countries have gone from cool to frigid amid renewed disputes over the heavily contested South China Sea , an escalating trade war , a simmering row over U.S. ties with Taiwan , and now accusations that China is waging a more concerted influence operation to leverage criticism of the Trump Administration. “Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States,” Vice President Pence said in a speech on Oct. 4, 2018. “Worst of all, Chinese security agencies have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology – including cutting-edge military blueprints. And using that stolen technology, the Chinese Communist Party is turning plowshares into swords on a massive scale.” US Vice President Mike Pence speaks at a political rally on Oct. 3, 2018., Jesse Tinsley/The Spokesman-Review via AP The U.S. government’s charges against Xu also come as other vulnerabilities and potential become glaringly obvious. On Oct. 9, 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) sounded the alarm that the U.S. military as a whole could be worryingly exposed to cyber attacks and did not have a good grasp on the full extent of the present risks it faces. The Congressional watchdog’s report had no recommendations, in no small part because it was clear that there was not enough information on the extent of the problems that would need fixing. The U.S. military is more connected than ever, including with defense contractors and other third parties, which only expands the number of potential vectors for a cyber attack . “Vulnerabilities that DOD [the Department of Defense] is aware of likely represent a fraction of total vulnerabilities due to testing limitations,” GAO’s investigators reported . “For example, not all programs have been tested and tests do not reflect the full range of threats.” A graphic from the GAO’s recently released report on U.S. military cybersecurity showing just some of the potential vectors for an attack against a fictitious weapon system., GAO There are also increasing concerns about the security and surety of the physical supply chains supporting the U.S. military and the U.S. defense industry, both of which rely directly and indirectly on raw materials and manufacturing resources located in China. Though all of the parties involved have repeatedly denied its most basic details, a recent story from Bloomberg Businessweek alleged the Chinese government had manipulated computer parts at the factory to insert malicious components that could give it access to servers around the world. Even if that report turns out to be false, it no doubt describes techniques China’s intelligence services would be interested in trying to employ if at all possible. It certainly would be well in line with what else is publicly understood about their attempts to vacuum up important information from their competitors and potential opponents. “U.S. aerospace companies invest decades of time and billions of dollars in research. This is the American way,” Assistant Attorney General Demers said in his statement regarding Xu’s extradition. “We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow.” The ability to put the Chinese intelligence officer on trial in the United States will definitely show authorities in Beijing that the United States is serious about cracking down on its spying operations. It remains to be seen whether or not the U.S. government will be able to produce additional victories of this scale that will truly put the pressure on China to consider changing course after years of its own successes.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin and American astronaut Nick Hague had what was likely one of the wildest rides in the history of mankind when their Soyuz-FG rocket malfunctioned catastrophically just minutes after blasting off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Reports state that the rocket’s second stage booster failed as the two arched their way towards low-earth orbit insertion. Their final destination was the International Space Station. Thankfully, both crewmen survived the ordeal and made radio contact with controllers after landing safely back on terra-firma. Search and rescue teams were rushing to the capsule at the time of writing. Here is video of the harrowing ordeal: https://youtube.com/watch?v=VnSoFxIYWSg From what I know about the Soyuz system, it is highly automated and an abort sequence can happen automatically or on command by the ground control team or the crew. There are three abort profiles and it seems like this was the most extreme of them all. Called a ‘ballistic descent,’ it is executed quite late into the rocket’s ascent, after the first stage has separated. Once again, this is based on my limited understanding of the system. Hopefully, we will get clarification on exactly how the abort sequence went down soon. Cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin and American astronaut Nick Hague on the way to their Soyuz rocket that will take them up to the ISS to join Expedition 57., AP Historically, the Soyuz abort system has worked successfully during other phases of launch—most famously while the rocket was still on the pad (also see video here ): MS-10 lifts off on its way to the ISS. The crew would be back on the ground just minutes later. , AP Today’s space drama is strangely coincidental as the highly anticipated Niel Armstrong bio-pic First Man opens in theaters Friday. You can’t beat this chance marketing, especially since it has a happy ending. Regardless, both men are lucky to be alive and surely have one hell of a story to tell. This event is also a testament to Russian engineers who designed that abort system and the abort procedures, as well as those who serviced the system before the launch. It worked in what seemed like the extreme end of the envelope, which is quite an accomplishment. You can bet that Vodka bottles with bows attached will be heading their way. MS-10 was the 139th manned Soyuz flight, four more than the Space Shuttle. The Soyuz family of rockets have been launched over 1,700 times since its introduction into service in the mid 1960s. It is by far the most flown space rocket type in history. We will update this post later in the morning when more information comes available. UPDATE: 3:42am PDT— Confirmation! Both crewmen are in good shape and are about to be transported away from the landing site, which is supposedly about 15 miles from Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. This location is roughly 250 miles northwest of the launch site. Update: 10:15am PDT— Here are some images and video of the Soyuz MS-10 crew safely back on the ground. It’s amazing just how good a condition they appear to be in.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2018","U.S. Military, Foreign Operators Ground Their F-35s To Look For Faulty Fuel Tubes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy have all stopped flying their F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , as have international operators , in order to inspect and potentially replace faulty fuel tubes common to all three variants of the aircraft, a process that should thankfully only last one or two days. Investigators looking into the cause or causes of a Marine F-35B crash in September 2018 uncovered the issue, which comes amid a Pentagon-mandated effort to boost the Joint Strike Fighter’s availability rates and raises serious questions about increased reliance on a single family of combat jets. The Pentagon’s central F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) announced the grounding on Oct. 11, 2018. The inciting incident occurred on Sept. 28, 2018, when an F-35B from Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron Five Zero One (VMFAT-501) crashed at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina. The pilot of that aircraft was able to safely eject, but the stealth fighter was a total loss. “The U.S. services and international partners have temporarily suspended F-35 flight operations while the enterprise conducts a fleet-wide inspection of a fuel tube within the engine on all F-35 aircraft,” the JPO said in a statement. “If suspect fuel tubes are installed, the part will be removed and replaced. If known good fuel tubes are already installed, then those aircraft will be returned to flight status. Inspections are expected to be completed within the next 24 to 48 hours.” The investigation into the September 2018 crash is still ongoing and it is not clear whether or not the fuel tube issue was the only factor in that mishap. In April 2018, another F-35B made an emergency landing at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina after suffering a major fuel leak, according to Marine Corps Times . A pair of F-35Bs from VMFAT-501., Lockheed Martin It is not clear how widespread and mandatory the pause actually is, though. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said it had stopped some flight activities in response to the JPO’s findings, but that the flight trials of its F-35B aircraft on the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth would continue. Israel, which has operational F-35s and has used them in combat , however, said that it would implement a pause to inspect its aircraft. The Italian Air Force, which has less than 10 jets, has already finished the inspections, according to Foreign Policy . “This is engine-by-engine, aircraft-by-aircraft,” an unnamed source told Military.com in relation to the F-35B fuel tube issue. “[It is] not a grounding where all aircraft need to sit out to for a select period of time.” Regardless, this is not the first time portion of or the entire F-35 fleet has ended up grounded due to technical issues and doing so is not an uncommon decision depending on the severity of the issue. It’s not a rare occurrence for combat aircraft in general , either. Still, a fleet-wide stop in operations is still a significant development for an aircraft that is in use, at least at some level, across three major U.S. military services and nine foreign countries. Lockheed Martin has delivered more than 320 Joint Strike Fighters, the vast majority of which have gone to the United States, and could ultimately build thousands of the jets. It does come as the Air Force, Marines, and Navy are to trying to meet the new goal of having 80 percent of their F-35s available for operations in the 2019 Fiscal Year, which began on Oct. 1, 2018. On Sept. 27, 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis issued a memo demanding the services meet that benchmark for the Joint Strike Fighter, as well as the F-16 Viper , F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , and F-22 Raptor . With regards to the F-35, low availability rates are a product of a wide array of issues, including software problems , mechanical defects , and difficulty in getting broken jets repaired in a timely manner , all of which the Pentagon has often struggled to address . These challenges are exacerbated by a process known as “concurrency,” that has left the U.S. military with hundreds of the stealth fighters that are not up to the latest standards and may be too costly to update at all. The JPO hopes that its broad upgrade plan, known as Continuous Capability Development and Delivery, or C2D2, yet another concurrent process, will get approved by the end of October 2018 . The F-35 program has hit a number of important milestones in 2018 , as well. Most notably, the Marines flew their first-ever combat missions with F-35Bs over Afghanistan in September 2018. But beyond underscoring that the Air Force, Marines, and Navy still have a ways to go before reaching full operational capability with their respective F-35 variants, this latest grounding highlights potentially serious issues that might occur when they do. For the Air Force and the Marines, in particular, the goal is for the Joint Strike Fighter to become by far the dominant fixed-wing tactical jet platform in those services. As such, the size and scope of the F-35 program raises the worrying possibility that the discovery of a more serious fleet-wide issue that demands a prolonged grounding to solve could dramatically slow operations or even bring them to a halt entirely. As a result, American tactical jet air power capability would be largely gutted. That the services have operated a more a diverse array of combat jets in the past has meant that other types could pick up the slack when groundings occur. The force mix the Marine Corps is pushing for, in particular, does not involve other combat jets of any kind, with F-35 variants eventually replacing both the AV8 Harrier jump jet and F/A-18 Hornet fleets. This already means the service will have no choice but to employ the expensive to operate stealth fighters in the future irrespective of the potential threats and nature of the enemy targets . The alternative in a more extreme scenario would be to continue conducting operations, but with the added risk of losing aircraft to known technical problems, and check for faults in the course of routine maintenance. That, in turn, could sap morale and make pilots and their unit commanders more risk-averse, potentially degrading operational effectiveness. A US Air Force F-35A undergoes maintenance on its fuel system at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in 2016., USAF The War Zone was the first to report that the Air Force had made a similar decision to resumed B-1 flight operations before it had inspected all of the aircraft to see if they contained the faulty component related to the aircraft’s ejector seat after a dangerous in-flight emergency . The Air Force considered it an acceptable risk in order to continue important combat sorties in Iraq, Syria , and Afghanistan , as well as conduct routine training missions. “Combat is an inherently risky business, but the Air Force works hard to minimize the risks its Airmen face,” an Air Force Global Strike Command spokesperson told us via Email regarding the decision to get the B-1s flying again. “Ensuring our aircrew can fly, train and stay proficient is important to minimizing risk in combat. The Air Force strives to mitigate risks to the aircrew while allowing them to continue vital training.” Unfortunately, the question in the future might be less about what the acceptable level of risks is, but rather whether there are any alternatives to continuing to fly F-35s during a major crisis, even if a serious technical problem emerges.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 15, 2018",F-22 Raptor Came To A Rest On Its Side After Making Emergency Landing In Alaska,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain very scarce at this time, but what we do know is that an F-22 flying from Elmendorf Air Force Base and assigned to the 3rd Wing based there made an emergency landing that resulted in the jet coming to a rest on its side, with what appears to be one wing touching the ground. The pilot was able to exit the aircraft safely and the mishap is currently under investigation. It is yet another in a recent spate of F-22 landing mishaps, one that occurred at NAS Fallon and one at Tyndall AFB , that have left two other aircraft sidelined for extensive repairs. We were the first outlet to confirm both of those incidents last Spring. Indications of a mishap were first reported by the always lively Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook page. We still don’t know what exactly the extent of the damage to the jet is or what caused the pilot to make an emergency landing. The F-22’s special radar-evading skin, composite construction materials, and unique airframe structures can make the aircraft very expensive to fix. Considering there are already two F-22s that are in need of extensive structural repairs, this one may have to get in line. After inquiring with Elmendorf AFB public affairs about the incident, they released this statement to us: An F-22 Raptor assigned to JBER’s 3rd Wing made an emergency landing on JBER’s active runway at approximately 1 p.m. local time today. The pilot was able to egress the aircraft safely. The incident is under investigation, more details may be released as they become available. Considering there are only about 187 Raptors in the USAF’s inventory, of which only about 125 are combat coded at any given time, the loss or even the sidelining of a single airframe can have a big impact. Case in point, the USAF spent 25,000 man-hours of labor just to get a perfectly straight F-22 back in the air and updated after spending six years in storage: In addition, we still don’t know how many F-22s, if any, were damaged after Hurricane Michael slammed directly into Tyndall AFB in Florida. It is possible that the USAF could suddenly have to deal with a number of additional Raptors that have been structurally damaged in some way. Let’s hope that’s not the case. We will update this story as more information comes available. UPDATE: 1:35pm PDT— I just received an update from Elmendorf. A landing gear malfunction cause this mishap. JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska – Initial reports indicate that yesterday’s F-22 Raptor emergency landing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was the result of a landing gear malfunction. The pilot was able to exit the aircraft safely. The incident remains under investigation, more details may be released as they become available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019","USAF, Army, and Navy Join Forces To Field America’s First Operational Hypersonic Weapon","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s recent burst of investment into hypersonic technology has created an often confusing morass of different programs spread across the individual services . Now, amid fears that Russia and China are sprinting ahead with similar developments, the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy are pooling their efforts on a common unpowered boost-glide vehicle design that could help give each one of them an operational hypersonic weapon in the near-term. Aviation Week detailed the Pentagon’s latest efforts to combine the Air Force’s Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW), the Army’s Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW), and the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) programs into a single effort in a story on Oct. 11, 2018. The goal of this tri-service plan is to be able to field a complete weapon, capable of flying more than six times the speed of sound, by 2021. News that this was all in the works had already begun begun trickling out earlier in 2018. “It’s embracing a not-invented-here” attitude, Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, who was previously the head of the Pentagon’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office , told journalists in September 2018. The idea is about “just taking the fastest path to the goal line with the technology that exists.” Since the Navy faces the most challenges in developing a weapon that a ballistic missile submarine will be able to fire , it is in charge of developing the boost-glide vehicle itself, according to Aviation Week . On Oct. 1, 2018, the service awarded a contract worth more than $13 million to the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Massachusetts to support that work. A rendering of the AHW hypersonic boost-glide vehicle., US Army The vehicle itself is a conical design made of a composite of metals and other materials, including carbon fiber, which is derived from the one the Army had been developing for the AHW program. This, in turn, was based on a concept that Sandia National Laboratories had worked on between 1979 and 1985 known as the Sandia Winged Energetic Reentry Vehicle Experiment (SWERVE). Given this experience, Sandia will produce the actual prototypes and the Army will be responsible for flight testing them, sources told Aviation Week . Each of the three services involved in the program will use their own boosters for ground-, air-, and submarine-launched applications. Without any power of its own, a hypersonic boost glide vehicle requires some other means of getting it up to the appropriate altitude and speed, which has traditionally involved the use of ballistic missiles . A rocket booster carrying an Army’s AHW hypersonic boost-glide vehicle blasts off during the first successful flight test of the system in 2011., US Army There remain few details about the exact size and capabilities of the new boost-glide vehicle. SWERVE was approximately 100 inches long and could reach a peak of Mach 12 before gliding along at a sustained Mach 8 for a full minute. The Army’s goal for AHW was also a sustained speed of around eight times the speed of sound that would allow the weapon to travel around 3,700 miles in just 35 minutes. The Pentagon had initially treated AHW as a less risky, more mature backup to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) more ambitious Force Application and Launch from Continental United States program, or FALCON . That project used half-cone boost-glide vehicle designs known as Hypersonic Test Vehicles (HTV) that held the promise of being faster, more maneuverable, and more accurate than those derived from SWERVE. These are important considerations for hypersonic vehicles, which by definition fly faster than Mach 5, and derive most of their benefits from that extreme speed and the ability to maneuver at those speeds. We at The War Zone have written in depth about the game-changing nature of these weapons, which open up the possibility of short- or no-notice strikes against time-sensitive and other critical targets, even at extreme ranges. That they can maneuver within the atmosphere along a less predictable flight path makes them even harder to spot and defend against compared to more traditional long-range weapons, such as ballistic missiles. An Army briefing slide describing the AHW program as of April 2012., US Army But while the Army’s boost-glide vehicle might have been less agile and potentially slower, it also worked, while DARPA’s program struggled . The AHW program had its first test launch in 2011 and continued on even after the booster exploded during a second test attempt in 2014. In addition, since 2005, the Army has spent more than $1 billion on the development of an actual weaponized version of the vehicle known as the Alternate Reentry System , which will inform the design of the future tri-service design. What has apparently changed the calculus is the rapid development of comparable hypersonic boost-glide vehicles in Russia and China . The Russians plan to declare their nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, Avangard , operational in 2019. These threats have pushed AHW to the forefront of the Pentagon’s hypersonic priorities since it is most likely to result in viable, if imperfect weapon system in the near future, according to Aviation Week . This has also prompted DARPA to begin a separate program, called Glide Breaker , to develop a means to counter incoming hypersonic threats. Developing a common boost-glide vehicle to help speed up the process of fielding an actual weapon system makes good sense for the U.S. military as it spreads the developmental burdens around the services. It also allows them to best leverage the existing and extensive corpus of work on hypersonic weapons. The tri-service nature of the project could also help insulate it from budget cuts in the future. “We each have pieces of programs,” Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said at a forum The Washington Post hosted in May 2018. “The Army’s warhead had worked much better than the Air Force’s….So we’re going to take the Army warhead, put it on an Air Force booster, launch it off of a B-52 , while the Army is developing on the ground and the Navy wants to put it on the deck of a ship.” It could also help inform other future hypersonic weapon developments, which haven’t slowed despite this effort to develop a common boost-glide vehicle. DARPA is still working on the successor to FALCON, known as the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. This is supposed to lead into an Air Force-run effort called the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW , which is pronounced “arrow.” There is talk of possible ground- and ship-launched versions of TBG, as well. There is also a whole separate group of powered, air-breathing hypersonic systems in development. Initially, it appeared that HCSW, pronounced “hacksaw,” would be an air-launched design with a high-speed ramjet or scramjet engine that would be a follow on from DARPA’s Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC). Now we know this is actually the name of the Air Force weapon using the Army’s boost-glide vehicle. A US Air Force briefing slide from 2017 describing the High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW) program, which encompasses the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) and Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) projects., USAF But the Air Force is pursuing a follow-on the HAWC, so we can confirm that at least one air-breathing hypersonic weapon system is still to come. DARPA is already hard at work on a turbine-based combined-cycle propulsion arrangement, or TBCC, as part of the Advanced Full-Range Engine (AFRE) program. This engine is a sort of hybrid of a traditional jet turbine and a ramjet or scramjet, allowing it to accelerate from a standing start to hypersonic speeds and then slow back down. This would increase the flexibility of any powered hypersonic system. The AFRE program could lead to engines to power future expendable air- and surface-launched weapons, as well as reusable platforms for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions and long-range time-sensitive strikes . These are likely only some of the hypersonic programs the U.S. military is working on at present. But while it certainly won’t be the last hypersonic weapon the United States fields, it appears that an unpowered boost-glide vehicle derived from a design dating back to the 1980s will be the one that enters mass production and widespread service first.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 25, 2019",Rogoway’s Reviews: First Man Is A Stunningly Raw Tale Of Rockets And Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Director Damien Chazelle’s First Man is gorgeous, the acting is fantastic, and the sound editing is sure to bring an Oscar if Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy don’t as well. But those heading to the theater, and preferably an IMAX screen, looking for a romp through the heavens, will be disappointed, but hopefully delightfully so. First Man isn’t primarily about space. It’s about a person who ended up there. It’s a stripped down, raw story that serves as a reminder that not all heroes are full of one-liners, love the limelight, or are without heavy imperfection and deep emotional scars. Let’s get to what many of you are wondering most about this film first—the action and its level of realism. This is a unique film in that it largely omits the technology out of flight sequences, but instead, it dials up the drama and suspense to the absolute max. On that level alone, many of the scenes are a cinematic triumph—you feel claustrophobic ‘in’ the capsules and are uncomfortably faced with the seemingly narrow margins for success of key maneuvers, but there is also something lost in the simplicity of it all. Universal Pictures Up until the Apollo 11 crescendo in the third act, the action scenes feel somewhat dreamlike more than grounded in reality. Instrumentation and the complexities of a craft’s human interfaces fade away and grand visuals and a focus on the human element of the operation take center stage. This movie plays very much like American Sniper in regards to how the complexity of the tasks and situations are presented. Really, if you asked me who directed the film without knowing in advance, I would say with high certainty that it was Clint Eastwood—which is definitely not a bad thing. And although the details are in shallow supply, the production quality is extremely high and downright visceral to an unnerving degree. In other ways, the movie may take realism, or at least a gritty and drab take on it, a bit too far. For instance, the spacecraft interiors appear like they were shot in actual historic spacecraft that are in museums today. They look heavily weathered and patinaed by the passing of time, to the point that it was a bit distracting. Once again, raw was the goal here and the set design may be accurate to today but it is not accurate to the time when these craft were actually used. The cockpits of the capsules before they were flown did not really look those of beaten-down F-4 Phantoms that had flown hundreds of missions over Vietnam. This is a small thing, but it did really stand out to me. The real capsules were definitely cramped and cluttered, but they were not worn-down and gritty like the movie portrayed them. This was the most cutting-edge tech of the era and NASA took pride in their vehicles. , NASA I am happy to report that First Man does use copious amounts of practical effects to achieve its unique and immersive feel. Green screens were replaced with real projections and the conveyance of motion was achieved via elaborate mechanic means instead of over-dramatic acting and post-processing magic. These investments do pay off in big ways when it comes to fully realizing the unique texture of the film. Once again, the sound editing is amazing in this film, especially in IMAX with Atmos or a similar audio system, but it’s also very unrealistic. The aircraft and space vehicles always sound like they are about to tear themselves apart during pretty much any activity. In fact, they sound more like a bridge that is about to fall than a spacecraft being blasted into space. Once again, maximum drama was the objective here, and it definitely works on that level. The movie changes in some regards once you get to Apollo 11 and Armstrong’s history-making trip to the moon. A higher order or realism seems to have been put into play and the bone-jarring chaotic tones from earlier actions sequences are toned down so the historical narrative can shine through. And what a triumph this third act is. The total racket that the director used as a fulcrum to evoke emotion from the audience up until this point is replaced by numbing silence. In fact, the lack of audio—the creative use of negative acoustic space—in particular, becomes the star of the show. The lunar module and moonwalking scenes are fantastic, but I did find the omission of the flag planting scene to be really strange. You can’t help but question why it wasn’t shown when the flag appears on the lunar surface as a background set dressing. There was a lot of ridiculous controversy about this directorial choice prior to the movie’s opening, but by three-quarters of the way through the film’s runtime, it’s not hard to figure out why the choice was made if you try, even if it really didn’t work out as planned. Universal Pictures This movie isn’t really about America’s race to the moon. That is the canvas in which the story is painted, but the picture that is painted on that canvas is a deeply personal one. It is about a quiet and highly talented man who became a hero for the right reason—he was the right person for the job. And his incredible abilities, whether it be in the cockpit as a pilot or on a piece of graph paper as an engineer, were offset by a somewhat socially awkward, or at least highly reserved and measured demeanor. This facet of Neil Armstrong created challenges in his marriage and as a father and it was exasperated by the fact that he was dealing with the loss of his young daughter to cancer in emotional solitude. Anyone who tells you this film was some major flag-waving idealized bonanza in American exceptionalism must have viewed it through a very warped prism. Those themes are highly muted during its entire runtime. Apparently, the omission of the flag planting scene—regardless of how that choice panned out—was to underline the very true fact that Neil Armstrong was not just an American hero, he was a hero of the planet. But even that was an external projection and title placed on him by society. By the end of the movie, you realize that he was such a unique hero because fanfare and celebrity really didn’t seem to even compute with him. It was an abstract idea that a man who lives by the certainty of numbers just wasn’t interested in embracing. The real Niel Armstrong., NASA Like any similar film, creative license was clearly present, but it was not overwhelming. The areas of the film that really put it to work didn’t change much of historically and it did help tie the plot together in a more meaningful package and emotional package. One thing that may bother some viewers is the lack of a more thorough depiction of all the hard daily work and problem solving that got Neil and his crew to the moon, but once again, this isn’t a story about spaceflight primarily, it is one about a person who flew into space. Overall, don’t expect this to be a prequel to Apollo 13 because it is far from it when it comes to storytelling perspective . Tangentially, this movie also served as a reminder of just how much our impression of human spaceflight is changing. The unique thing about America’s space program is that only those who worked the hardest and had the highest intellect and ability were able to get the privilege of leaving the planet. It was the one thing in America that just couldn’t be bought no matter how much money you had. Today, that is all changing and space is being turned into a tourist attraction for the very wealthy , at least for the foreseeable future. I don’t want to argue the merits of commercial spaceflight and space tourism, it’s just interesting to note how this once almost sacred opportunity didn’t have anything to do with who your mom and dad were or how much money you made, it was about finding the very best among us because mitigation of risk is all that really mattered. All said, First Man is a powerfully different and moving take on the space race, but more than that, it is an examination of literally the very best man America had at the time to make the dream of stepping on another heavenly body a reality. And even the directorial choices discussed above that I personally may have not made, I give huge credit for because they were bold and quite frankly, they were risky. And they really did end up working when you look at the movie as an entire entity, not just as a series of components. In the end, the human journey is what soars in First Man. While one would think that watching the first human put their foot on the moon would be the film’s most powerful moment, what comes in the last scene of the movie—an event of the complete opposite magnitude—was really its most poignant moment. That alone is an incredible achievement in filmmaking. Rogoway’s review rating: 8G out of 9G Tyler Rogoway/Author First Man is in theaters now.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 20, 2019",Soyuz Rocket Failure Could Leave International Space Station In Risky Unmanned Mode,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The failure of a Russian Soyuz-FG rocket , which had been carrying fresh astronauts to the International Space Station, or ISS, has raised concerns that the orbital facility might have to go unmanned for a period. This increases the risks to the station, which may suffer damage or another crisis that personnel cannot manage from the ground, and will likely delay planned upgrades and work on associated commercial space projects, as well. The incident occurred on Oct. 11, 2018 , during an otherwise routine launch from the Russian-operated Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russia’s space agency Roscosmos says it doesn’t know the exact reason for the failure, the first ever for the improved Soyuz-FG since its first flight in 2001, but that the rocket’s second stage broke up after the first stage separated and dropped away. Russian cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and American astronaut Nick Hague survived thanks to built-in automated failsafes that sent their Soyuz-MS capsule flying from the doomed booster and sailing safely down to earth. “A deviation from the standard trajectory occurred and apparently the lower part of the second stage disintegrated. The rocket stopped its normal flight and after that the automatic system did its work,” Sergei Krikalyov, Roscosmos’ Executive Director for Manned Flights, said on Oct. 12, 2018 . “This could have been caused by the failure of the system of the normal separation, which should have been activated. We will analyze the causes in detail.” This is not to say that Ovchinin and Hague were never in danger. Their capsule entered especially steep, “ballistic descent,” which involves higher speeds and strain on the spacecraft and its occupants than in a normal re-entry. The remains of the Ovchinin and Hague’s Soyuz-MS capsule after the failed launch on Oct. 11, 2018., Russian Ministry of Defense via AP In this situation, “you end up coming in steeper, you get more forces on your body, but it’s survivable,” former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who was at one time the commander on the ISS, told CBC News . “It’s not what you’d want to do, but it’s [Soyuz] a good, tough reliable system.” You can watch the full interview below, in which Hadfield explains in more detail what the experience might have been like for Ovchinin and Hague and offers additional insight into the potential impacts of the failed launch. But while Ovchinin and Hague are thankfully safe, their failure to reach the ISS could still have serious ramifications. Russia Krikalyov said he expected the results of the probe into the accident would be available by Oct. 20, 2018, but there’s no guarantee that the investigation will immediately clear the way for further launches using the Soyuz-FG. All future launches are suspended indefinitely at present. In the meantime, the principal operators of the ISS, Russia’s Roscomos and America’s NASA, have to decide what the crew on board the station now should do. Those individuals can remain in orbit, but not indefinitely. The Soyuz-MS capsule that brought them there has a very well defined time frame that it can survive in space and still be safe to use. As such, the existing personnel at the orbital facility will have to come back down to Earth in December 2018 or January 2019, or risk getting stranded. The Soyuz-FG rocket carrying Ovchinin and Hague blasts off from Baikonur on Oct. 11, 2018. It would fail within minutes., Alexey Filippov/Sputnik  via AP “The Soyuz does indeed have a lifetime,” Kenny Todd, NASA’s mission operations integration manager for the ISS, said in a press conference on Oct. 12, 2018. “There’s a little bit of margin on the other side of that, but not a whole lot of margin. …probably early January we would start to call it sort of the end of life in that particular Soyuz.” Leaving the ISS without a crew is a definite option. After another Soyuz failure in 2011, the station was faced with the same predicament , but thankfully another Russian rocket launched just in time to avert a crisis. “Theoretically, the ISS can be left without a crew. An unmanned mode is stipulated,” Roscosmos’ Krikalyov explained on Oct. 12, 2018 . “We will do everything possible to prevent this because the station was created for manned flights. The procedure to deactivate the station is prescribed but it is undesirable and we will try to avoid it.” A Soyuz-MS spacecraft docked with the ISS in 2016., NASA The procedure the Russian official is talking about involves shutting down or reducing the operation of life support, environmental and other systems on the station. Personnel on the ground would monitor the station remotely and issue commands as necessary to move it out of the way of space debris and other hazards. This could potentially result in the loss of research, since the experiments may be perishable or otherwise time-sensitive. There would also be no one on board in case something catastrophic does happen, which could put the station as a whole at risk. Just in August 2018, there was a pressure leak that would not necessarily have been apparent immediately to controllers on the ground, who would have had no way of identifying the exact location and source of the issue or repairing it anyway. The investigation into that mishap is still ongoing. There’s also the matter of work at and on the station coming to a halt. In addition to the scientific research that goes on there, there had also been plans for a series of spacewalks in October and November 2018 to upgrade the station’s power system and conduct an inspection regarding the pressure leak. Nick Hague was set to be one of those spacewalkers and his absence could limit the ability of the existing crew to perform those tasks. NASA astronaut Robert L. Curbeam, Jr., at left, and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Christer Fuglesang, conduct a spacewalk during the construction of additional segments of the ISS in 2006., NASA An unmanned scenario would also almost certainly prohibit test flights of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon . These two spacecraft are part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program , which is seeking an American substitute for the Soyuz system for the first time since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Delays in the development of these capsules could pose its own problems since the U.S. government’s contract with Russia to help get its astronauts to the ISS comes up in April 2019 and severely strained relations between the two countries make it unclear if they will continue to cooperate in this fashion. Renewing the deal with the Kremlin may be unavoidable if the United States wants to continue regular missions to the ISS. Boeing and SpaceX have suffered delays in the development of their respective crafts, which have pushed back plans for inaugural flights to the station until the first half of 2019 . NASA is worried that schedule might still be optimistic. An artist’s conception of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft., Boeing “We have not seen the [Commercial Crew] program make decisions detrimental to safety,” Patricia Sanders, chair of NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP), since in her opening remarks at a meeting on Oct. 11, 2018, that came just hours after the rocket failure in Kazakhstan. “But current projected schedules for uncrewed and crewed test flights for both providers have considerable risk and do not appear achievable.” All of this comes as the ISS enters its twilight period and its future is beginning to become uncertain. Launched in 1998, it was only supposed to remain in orbit until 2020. In 2015, NASA extended Boeing’s contract to for various services related to the station and included a requirement to upgrade structural components so that they would last until 2028 . A rendering of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon., SpaceX At that point, the station may have taken on a very different character. Russia only plans to stay involved with the ISS through 2024 and had previously declared it would not contribute to U.S. plans to extend the station’s lifespan . This latter decision was in retaliation for American economic sanctions and other responses to the Kremlin’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and subsequent intervention to support an armed separatist movement in the eastern part of that country in 2014. Since then, though, the ISS has remained one of the few remaining examples of close and public cooperation between the United States and Russia. Russia does have plans for its own new space station, tentatively known as the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex, or by its Russian acronym OPSEK . The Russians have also looked into detaching their portions of the ISS and flying them off to join that facility, but said it had no plans to actually do so as of 2017 . An annotated graphic showing the Russian portions of the ISS, which the Kremlin has suggested in the past that it could split off to form the core of a new space station., Penyulap/Craigboy/Leebrandoncremer via Wikimedia For its part, the United States only has plans to fund its portion of the station into 2025 , too. After that it could potentially rent it to private interests . Firms interested in ISS for various purposes, including research and space tourism , could always seek to further extend the life of the orbital facility. For now, though the most pressing concern remains how to get Ovchinin and Hague to the ISS as soon as is possible and get the crew that’s there now home safely, and do so without leaving the station in a risky unmanned configuration for any period of time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 15, 2018",China Says H-20 Stealth Bomber Makes ‘Great Progress’ Stirring Talk Of A First Flight Soon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After years of reports and rumors , Chinese state media has officially declared that the country’s new stealth bomber, the Hong-20 or H-20 , has made “great progress” and now another report has suggested this might imply that the aircraft will soon be ready for its first flight. The public reveal of the plane, whether it’s official or unofficial, would be the latest in a string of advanced aviation and other significant military developments to emerge from China in 2018 and comes as the country is taking an increasingly assertive stance against its rivals, chiefly the United States. State-run China Central Television described the “Hong-20” as a “new long-distance strategic bomber” and used the H-20 name in a broadcast in August 2018, the first time an official outlet has used the official moniker, according to the Global Times newspaper .  The Chinese government had disclosed it was working on this type of aircraft in 2015 , but did not give it an official designation at that time. The H-20 designation subsequently emerged in the press. The Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC), part of the larger state-operated Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), has reportedly been working on the stealthy design, often described as a rough analog to the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 , since the early 2000s . “Usually the development of equipment and weaponry of the People’s Liberation Army is highly confidential,” military expert and Chinese television personality Song Zhongping, told Global Times , for a story that outlet published on Oct. 9, 2018. “The trial flight will come soon.” Global Times is an offshoot of the People’s Daily , the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. It has both Chinese- and English-language editions and is available in the United States in print. This image, purportedly from a China Central Television broadcast, showing an H-20 prototype is one of many that does not appear to be real., via Asia Times It is worth noting that Song does not officially speak for the Chinese government and his views are his own. Global Times also has a history of sensational reports, including a warning about the potential of an all-out war between the United States and China over the contested South China Sea in 2017. However, Song has strong credentials as a graduate of the People’s Liberation Army’s Second Artillery Engineering University, serving as a lecturer there from 1995 to 2003, and then going on to be the editor of the “Military Digest” for the Second Academy of China Aerospace from 2011 to 2016. Now known simply as the Rocket Force , China long referred to its nuclear ballistic missile units as the Second Artillery Corps. In May 2018, AVIC also cryptically teased the possibility of an H-20 reveal in a flashy, CGI-heavy video to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of XAC in 1958. What appeared to be a clip at the end showed flying wing-shaped aircraft under a sheet, which was clearly meant to invoke the imagery Northrop Grumman used to tease the U.S. Air Force’s future B-21 stealth bomber during an advertisement it aired during Superbowl XLIX in 2015. A side-by-side comparison of Northrop Grumman’s 2015 advertisement, at top, and the clip from the AVIC video, at bottom., Northrop Grumman/AVIC via China Defense Online There is little hard data about the H-20, but the information that is available says that it will reportedly be a stealthy flying wing that can carry at least 10 tons of weaponry out to an unrefueled range of approximately 5,000 miles. This would be a significant improvement in basic capability over the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s (PLAAF) existing H-6 series of bombers, which are derived from the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger . By going straight from that aircraft to the new stealth bomber, China will skip multiple generations of bomber concepts that have come in the interim. Carrying a full-load of CJ-10K air-launched cruise missiles, which can carry a conventional or nuclear warhead, the aircraft could give China an entirely new long-range strategic capability to deter potential opponents. A new version of the CJ-10 with a reduced radar signature may also be in the works. With the H-20, the country would have its own so-called “ nuclear triad ,” consisting of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles , submarine-launched ballistic missiles , and the long-range nuclear-capable bombers. “A medium-range bomber can’t essentially fix the PLA air force’s shortcomings in terms of strategic strike and strategic deterrence,” China Daily , another official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, had reported in 2015 , citing Chinese defense technology magazine Aerospace Knowledge . “Thus the air force does need an intercontinental strategic bomber capable of penetrating an enemy’s air defenses.” With a range of 5,000 miles, the bombers could also be critical tools for defending China’s territorial claims in the Pacific Region, especially in the South China Sea , in the opening phases of a crisis. The Chinese government has already been taking a more hard-line stance to assert its control over the South China Sea, with one of its warships sailing dangerously close to an American Arleigh Burke -class destroyer near Gaven Reefs in September 2018 . A Chinese H-6K bomber., Japan MoD The H-20 would be a more general threat to the United States in the Pacific region, too, as it would give the PLAAF another means of challenging American naval surface task forces, such as carrier battle groups , and key air and naval bases on land, including Guam . The U.S. military is already increasingly preparing for a situation in which its established facilities might end up destroyed or otherwise unavailable and recently had B-2 bombers practice operating from remote Wake Island for the first time ever. If nothing else, if the H-20 finally does emerge and appears to be quite advanced, it could send shockwaves throughout the U.S. military and the American defense industry, which would move to develop new systems and tactics, techniques, and procedures to counter the aircraft. Depending on its exact features, it may also once again raise concerns about the extent of Chinese efforts to steal critical technical information about some of the United States’ most advanced weapons. The stealthy H-20 could be useful for possible operations against regional opponents, such as India . The aircraft could penetrate through hostile air defenses to neutralize high priority targets, such as airfields and command and control facilities during a large-scale conventional conflict. They could also simply neutralize air defense nodes in order to clear a path for follow-on strikes by less well-protected aircraft, including China’s H-6s. The PLAAF is likely to continue operating both bombers for the foreseeable future, much in the same way the United States expects to retain the versatile B-52 even as it begins flying the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber in the future. The older H-6s will still be able to perform important roles in lower risk environments and be able to serve as launch platforms for new, longer-range weapons that will help keep them further away from enemy threats, including air-launched ballistic missiles . An annotated satellite image of China’s man-made outpost in Gaven Reefs., DOD Gaven Reefs is home to one of numerous Chinese man-made military outposts in the region, as well. China has steadily increased the defenses at these facilities, to include long-range surface-to-air missiles and shore-based anti-ship missiles, which would present further obstacles for its opponents during any future conflict. In May 2018, the PLAAF also deployed H-6 bombers to an airfield on Woody Island for the first time ever , showing its ability to operate large aircraft from that site and further demonstrating the ability of these bases to provide significant air support for Chinese forces in the area. “Despite such reckless harassment, the United States Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows and our national interests demand,” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech following the Gaven Reefs incident on Oct. 4, 2018. “We will not be intimidated. We will not stand down.” Revealing the H-20 now, or otherwise allowing images or video of it to emerge, would be well in line with other government developments that are clearly, at least in part, intended to dissuade countries such as the United States from interfering in areas such as the South China Sea. Most notably, in January 2018, images appeared online showing what China later confirmed was an experimental naval railgun , another potentially game-changing development. Those images were not official, but the Chinese government clearly deliberately allowed the ship to be in a place where it knew bystanders would see it and then likely share the images on social media, if they were not more directly responsible for the “leaks” themselves. There have since been more official and quasi-official revelations about Chinese work on advanced manned and unmanned aircraft , hypersonic weapons , and anti-satellite systems , among others. The U.S. and Chinese governments are already in the midst of a spike in tensions over a host of issues, as well. Beyond the South China Sea, these disputes include military assistance to Taiwan , a bitter trade war , and China’s apparent attempts to sway public perception in the United States against President Donald Trump and his administration through the media. With all this in mind, it is also possible that the Chinese government has allowed official media to highlight the H-20 to further emphasize its growing military capabilities, regardless of the actual progress of the development of the aircraft. “Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States,” Pence added in his speech . “As we rebuild our military, we will continue to assert American interests across the Indo-Pacific.” If China has indeed been working on the H-20 for close to two decades, it is very possible that they are close to having a flying prototype . Given the current state of its relationship with the United States, it would hardly be the worst time to show it off.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 15, 2018",China Reportedly Plans To Unveil H-20 Stealth Bomber At Air Force Anniversary Parade In 2019,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than a week after Chinese state media said the H-20 stealth bomber program was making “great progress,” there are now reports that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, or PLAAF, might be planning to publicly reveal the plane during celebrations the mark the 70th anniversary of its founding in 2019. It has also emerged that the PLAAF showed off a logo featuring the silhouette of a flying wing-style aircraft at a recent official gala promoting plans to establish a “first-class strategic bomber division,” which may also be a nod to the up-coming H-20. Defence Blog was among the first to spot the stories regarding the H-20’s possible participation in a PLAAF anniversary parade that appeared on Oct. 15, 2018 . It’s not clear when that event might actually occur, but the official founding date for the service is November 11. A China Central Television broadcast in August 2018 had been the first to officially use the bomber’s nomenclature and the presenter reaffirmed that the plane was a “new long-distance strategic bomber,” which many took as an indication that the design was increasingly mature . On Oct. 11, 2018, the PLAAF’s own website published a story regarding a morale-boosting gathering at an unspecified bomber unit assigned to the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command. On the backdrop of the main stage of the event was a logo featuring the outline of what appeared to be a tailless flying wing aircraft with winglets. Details about the H-20’s exact design and capabilities remain limited, but experts have widely described it as a flying wing type that is broadly similar to the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Since the silhouette does not clearly reflect any existing PLAAF aircraft, bombers or otherwise , it is possible that it could be a reference to the future stealth bomber. An official photograph from the PLAAF gala showing the logo with the flying wing aircraft silhouette., PLAAF It is important to note that PLAAF’s own report on the gala did not make any reference to the H-20. The other state-media reports did not include any official, on the record statements from Chinese government officials. Global Times , a newspaper that operates under the auspices People’s Daily , the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, carried what appears to be the sole English-language report on the PLAAF gathering. That story also appeared to claim to have received a statement from Northrop Grumman that the B-2’s design omitted features such as winglets to maximize its stealth capabilities. It’s true that any flying wing aircraft without them would have less of a radar signature, but it seems highly unlikely that the American defense contractor would have given the Chinese state-run media outlet any such detail on or off the record. The exact phrasing in the story might be a translation error. There is the immediate potential for the news of the H-20s developments may have gotten confused in some way with China’s apparent recent fielding of the H-6J , the latest in the H-6 family, which is a modernized maritime patrol and strike platform. Based on the modernized H-6K , this aircraft will likely have many of the same features, including the necessary range to operate throughout the immensely strategic South China Sea and the ability carry up to six YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship missiles at a time. However, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) operates the J models , making it harder to see how this news would get conflated with reports about the PLAAF’s future H-20. Regardless, the PLAAF gala did occur and did feature the logo in question. The graphical design could reflect the service’s plans for the H-20, or the development of advanced aviation capabilities in general , without necessarily being an accurate depiction of the aircraft’s actual design. Numerous fan art designs have depicted speculative flying wing designs with winglets , which could have influenced whoever crafted the official artwork. This would not be the first time imagery of advanced aircraft designs from popular culture appears to have influenced official military unit insignia . Winglets, or other vertical surfaces, were also a feature on many American flying wing stealth aircraft design concepts, including the original Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) proposals from what was then just Northrop. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics also explored similar ATB concepts. Though they might make the design less stealthy, they do help with yaw control, which can be difficult in flying wing aircraft that do not have the benefit of a traditional tail and rudder. One fanart rendering of the H-20 showing a design with winglets., Chinese Internet The logo’s appearance, along with the rumors of the H-20’s up-coming public debut in 2019, is also just the latest in a string of semi-official public references to the new bomber since May 2018. That month, the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) teased the reveal of the aircraft in a professionally-done video presentation marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC). This firm is responsible for developing China’s existing H-6-series of bombers, which are derived from the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger , and is reportedly working on the H-20. Experts believe that the H-20’s development first started in the late 1990s or early 2000s and could actually be in service by around 2025. With this time frame in mind, a first flight in the next year would be well in line with known development schedules. The B-2 first flew in 1989 and reached initial operational capability in 1997. It’s also worth noting that the PLAAF first revealed the H-6K at a parade marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2015. McDonnell Douglas ATB concept art from the 1980s showing a flying wing stealth bomber aircraft with vertical winglets., McDonnell Douglas Of course, it is also entirely possible that the Chinese government is allowing this speculation about the H-20 to run in state media outlets simply as a way of posturing against the United States. U.S.-China relations are at their coldest point in recent memory over a host of intersecting disputes . In September 2018, the heightened tensions led to a first-of-its-kind incident in theSouth China Sea in which a PLAN destroyer sailed dangerously close to the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class USS Decatur in an attempt to force the American ship to leave the area. With a speculated unrefueled range of up to 5,000 miles and the ability to carry at least 10 tons of weapons, including nuclear-capable land-attack and conventional anti-ship cruise missiles, the H-20, if it were to become a reality soon, could represent an entirely new and credible threat to U.S. interests throughout the Pacific region. It would also enable the PLAAF to more seriously threaten major U.S. military assets, including carrier battle groups and key bases, such as those on Guam , during a crisis. All of this could easily put the United States, as well as its defense industry, on the defensive, as it seeks to develop countermeasures to the new Chinese capability. Still, actually showing off the H-20 would have a far more pronounced impact on these fronts. China similarly sent waves through international defense communities when it unveiled an experimental naval railgun on a test ship in January 2018. So, while it still remains to be seen whether these reports and rumors will actually lead to the H-20 emerging in public in the coming year, the Chinese do appear to be increasingly setting the stage for a big reveal. Unless relations with the United States take a dramatic turn in the near future, there’s unlikely to be a better time for them to bring the H-20 out into the light.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 18, 2018",Army’s New Huge Barrel Packing 155mm Howitzer Doubles Range To 40 Miles In Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Driven by concerns about its artillery units getting outranged in large-scale conflicts against “great power” opponents, such as Russia and China , the U.S. Army has been steadily pushing to extend the range of its self-propelled and towed 155mm howitzers . The service has already doubled the range of those weapons to 40 miles using advanced rocket-assisted ammunition, but is now looking to find ways for them to hit targets up to 80 miles away. U.S. Army Colonel John Rafferty, the director of the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross-Functional Team (CFT), part of the Army’s new Futures Command, explained the new range goal to reporters on Oct. 10, 2018, at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) annual exhibition in Washington, D.C. When the service first created the LRPF CFT to coordinate all advanced artillery developments in 2017, the plan was to increase the range of 155mm howitzers to more than 60 miles . “I think there are a couple of technologies out there that allow us to get to 120-130 [km; approximately 75 to 80 miles],” Rafferty said on Oct. 10, 2018. “I think that’s entirely doable.” The 155mm howitzer related efforts are all grouped together into a program known as Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ECRA), which has been ongoing since 2016. The project’s most visible product so far has been the XM907 howitzer cannon. This new barrel is longer and more robust to handle more powerful ammunition and propelling charges. It is hundreds of pounds heavier and six feet longer than the barrels in use today on the Army’s M777 towed howitzers and M109A6 and A7 self-propelled types. An M777ER towed howitzer with the XM907 cannon sits in front of an M777 with the original, shorter barrel., US Army “We just doubled the range of our artillery at Yuma Proving Ground,” U.S. Army General John Murray, the head of Futures Command, said in separate remarks at the AUSA gathering regarding the XM907. During the test, a howitzer with the new barrel was able to hit a target approximately 40 miles away. Murray did not say what ammunition soldiers used during this experiment, but it seems most likely that round in question was one of the new XM1113 rocket-assisted shells coupled with the XM654 “supercharge” propellant, both of which are other development efforts within the ERCA program. Norwegian defense contractor Nammo is building the rounds for the Army and also says they have a maximum range of around 40 miles. The video below shows various tests of the XM907 cannon on modified M109 self-propelled howitzer testbeds, including what appears to be one firing a rocket-boosted XM1113 shell beginning at 0:18 in the runtime. This is definitely an impressive achievement, giving the guns equivalent range to the 227mm guided artillery rockets that the Army relies on now to hit targets at those distances. However, it’s still half of the new goal of hitting enemies 80 miles away. Part of the answer about how the Army plans to double the range of its 155mm howitzers again may involve lengthening their barrels even more. The XM907 is already significantly longer than the tubes on the service’s existing howitzers, but there have been indications that there might be plans to extend it up to another three feet. There’s only so long you can make it before you run into problems, though. The longer the barrel is, the more it is liable to bend when troops fire the gun, especially with extended range ammunition using powerful propellant charges. It may also flex more during transit, especially in off-road conditions. This can all reduce the barrel life or force engineers to make it more robust, adding additional weight. The other option is to develop other types of specialized extended range ammunition. Unfortunately, the laws of physics will eventually start to limit what the Army can do with a more traditional 155mm shell. The XM1113, together with the XM654 supercharge, already seems to be getting to the limit of what might be possible with conventional rounds. Colonel Rafferty, the head of the LRPF CFT, explained at AUSA that the Army was looking into whether it might be acceptable to trade payload for extra range in certain cases . A shell with a smaller unitary explosive charge or fewer cluster munitions would theoretically be lighter and able to fly further, but the question is then whether it would have sufficient destructive power to take out the intended targets. Nammo’s full-range of extended-range 155mm ammunition, including the high-explosive type at left, which the US Army has designated the XM1113. The remaining types are, from left to right, red phosphorus smoke, practice, and illumination., Joseph Trevithick With this in mind, the Army is working on two more novel ammunition types. These are air-breathing ramjet-powered shells and hypervelocity projectiles . At present, Boeing and Nammo appear to be the only two companies working on ramjet-powered types, a concept you can read about in more detail here . Nammo has said that its version will have a maximum range of around 60 miles, but it might be possible to boost that by using things such as the XM654 supercharge. A mockup of Boeing’s ramjet-powered 155mm artillery shell., Joseph Trevithick Representatives from South Korean defense contractor Poongsan at the 2018 AUSA exposition had no information on a similar concept that the firm had unveiled in 2016 . South Africa’s Denel also developed a ramjet shell called ProRam in the mid-2000s, but that program appears to have gotten shelved indefinitely. The Pentagon’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) is actually the one leading the development of the hypervelocity option, also known as the Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System (HGWS), in cooperation with U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The concept is based around firing the Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) the Navy developed for its electromagnetic railgun out of traditional guns. Though these weapons wouldn’t be able to get it going at speeds of above Mach 5, a top speed of even Mach 3 would push the projectile to far greater distances than a traditional shell. The SCO successfully test fired the HVP from various, unspecified conventional guns in the 2016 fiscal year and planned to test just how lethal the projectile might be this year, according to Pentagon budget documents . We don’t know what the results of those live-fire experiments were or if they even occurred. A breakdown of the potential uses for the common Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP), including in Army and Marine Corps 155mm howitzers., USN Unfortunately, both ramjet-powered shells and the hypervelocity options are complex and expensive. In 2016, the SCO said its goal was to get the unit cost of the HVP down to only $35,000 . As of 2018, the price point was still around $86,000 per shot . Ramjet-powered ammunition could be exponentially cheaper than that, but still pricier than standard 155mm shells. Of course, the benefits of a round that can hit targets up to 80 miles away would change the cost calculus significantly. While the individual shells may cost more, a single battery of howitzers at one firebase would suddenly be able to do what would’ve taken multiple bases in the past. This saves on the costs of needing to deploy, support, and protect all of the necessary personnel and assets. The responsiveness of ground-based artillery units is typically better than air support, as well. Combined with the extreme range, it could reduce the demand for expensive to operate combat aircraft that cost more per hour to fly than a single shell would cost. The added range would also give Army artillery units greater capabilities, including against time-sensitive targets, while still allowing them to potentially stay safely out of range of an opponent’s own howitzers and rocket artillery. The service often cites Russia’s 2S33 Msta-SM2 self-propelled 152mm howitzer, which has a maximum range of 25 miles, as one of the core threats the ECRA program is working to counter. The 80-mile range now on the table would allow American troops to outrange even some Russian , as well as Chinese , heavy rocket artillery systems . The longest range rockets available for Russia’s 280mm BM-30 Smerch rocket launcher, one of which is seen here, can only hit targets around 56 miles away., Vitaly Kuzmin The new guns and ammunition are also just one layer of the Army’s broader artillery plans , which seeks to dramatically increase the range of its rocket artillery systems, as well as procure all-new weapons, including ground-based railguns and longer-range surface-to-surface missiles . This will only further expand the Army’s ability to deliver timely and flexible fire support and strike targets at extreme ranges. It could be particularly useful in expeditionary or distributed warfare scenarios, such as in the Pacific region, where it may be difficult to rapidly position large amounts of existing artillery weapons in places where they can provide adequate coverage. As such, the final products of the ECRA program could be appealing to the US Marine Corps, which also has 155mm howitzers that would benefit from upgrades and new ammunition, as well. The super-long-range howitzers look set to be the first of these capabilities to actually reach troops and will provide a significant boost in capability even if they can only engage targets at distances between 40 and 60 miles. If the Army can succeed in pushing the maximum range of its 155mm howitzers out to 80 miles, they could end up with an even more game-changing weapon in their arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",UAE Contracted An American Hit Squad to Kill Political Figures And More in Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The founder of a U.S.-based private military company, as well as a former employee of the firm, say the United Arab Emirates hired the group to supply what amounted to a death squad to assassinate members of a Yemeni Islamist political party. The details point to a worrisome gray area in an already convoluted conflict in Yemen , which calls into question whether all the members of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the country are working toward the same goals. It also highlights the steady privatization of military and para-military activities that could have far-reaching ramification beyond this particular theater of operations. BuzzFeed News revealed the existence of Delaware-based Spear Operations Group, LLC’s operations in Yemen in an exposé it published on Oct. 16, 2018. Between at least 2015 and 2016, the small company, which employed former U.S. special operators and ex-members of foreign militaries, killed multiple members of the political party Al Islah in Yemen under the direction of Emirati authorities. A mercenary-run assassination program “There was a targeted assassination program in Yemen,” Abraham Golan, the head of Spear Operations Group, told BuzzFeed on the record. “I was running it. We did it. It was sanctioned by the UAE within the coalition.” Golan, a Hungarian-Israeli who now lives outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is an enigmatic figure who appears well known in military and intelligence circles, but whose actual credentials are unclear. He did take part in the operations in Yemen himself and clearly has some level of military training, according to BuzzFeed ’s sources . “[He’s] prone to exaggeration,” an unnamed former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, told BuzzFeed . “[But] for crazy shit he’s the kind of guy you hire.” It’s equally unclear how he came to be at a lunch meeting at a military base in the UAE’s second most populous city, Abu Dhabi, in 2015. It was there that he, along with former U.S. Navy SEAL Isaac Gilmore, laid out terms to meet the Emirati requirement for a highly-skilled team of operatives to hunt down and kill a number of then unspecified individuals in Yemen. DoD The two parties agreed that Spear Operations Group’s team as a whole would receive $1.5 million per month in salary and monetary bonuses for successfully “neutralizing” their targets. More importantly, the individuals would get ranks within the UAE military, appropriate uniforms, and even dog tags, to officially mark “the difference between a mercenary and a military man,” according to Golan . Back in the United States, the private military company worked to recruit former special operations, including U.S. Army Green Berets and SEALs. Some of Special Operations Group’s employees were reportedly former members of the top tier Naval Special Warfare Development Group, better known as SEAL Team Six, and the Central Intelligence Agency’s Special Activities Division. “It was very specific that we were targeting [people],” Gilmore explained to BuzzFeed . “It was still gray enough that a lot of guys were like, ‘Ah, I’m good.’” US Army Special Forces soldiers prepare to clear a room during a training exercise., US Army Into Yemen Facing difficulties in finding individuals willing to join his mission, Golan initially hired a number of former French Foreign Legionnaires. Before the end of 2015, the assembled team finally flew on a chartered jet to the UAE, after which an Emirati military aircraft took them to the country’s secretive military base in Assab, Eritrea. That site acts as a staging area for UAE forces operating in Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea. On their way to Eritrea, a uniformed Eritrean officer reportedly handed them their hit list, consisting of 23 index cards with the names, photographs, and very basic details about the individuals in question. It remains unclear who all of these individuals were, though they appeared to be a mix of members of Al Islah, terrorists linked to groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ), and others with no obvious reason for receiving a death warrant. A UAE C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft. One of these is seen in the background in a picture of Golan and his team in Yemen that BuzzFeed obtained., Boeing Saudi Arabia and the UAE both describe Al Islah as a terrorist group because of its connection to the Muslim Brotherhood , an Islamist political movement with affiliates in certain countries that do have ties to militant organizations . The Yemeni group operates a legitimate member of Yemen’s political system, though, and one of its members, Tawakel Karman , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011. Spear Operations Group’s first strike came on Dec. 29, 2015, when they attempted and failed to kill Anssaf Ali Mayo, Al Islah’s top official in the port city of Aden. Golan still considers that operation a success since it drove Mayo underground for months afterward. After that, there were a string of between 25 and 30 more assassinations of Al Islah’s members, but it is unclear how many Spear Operations Group were responsible for. Though Golan and Gilmore never reference any other groups, whether the UAE might have been employing other teams to perform similar operations never comes up in their published interviews. This capture from a video that BuzzFeed obtained shows smoke rising from Anssaf Ali Mayo’s office in Aden after a bomb that U.S. mercenaries placed there to try and kill him exploded on Dec. 29, 2015. A UAE drone apparently monitored the entire operation., via BuzzFeed A legal gray area The most immediate issues here, of course, are accountability and legality. Golan and Gilmore both said they believed that the individuals they hunted down were legitimate targets, but admitted they had no way of knowing whether they actually were or if they were just people who had done something to upset authorities in the Emirates. Spear Operations Group also turned down some marks that it felt were not legitimate. “There were guys that were basically doing what you said,” another former CIA official told BuzzFeed after initially treating the information the outlet had obtained with skepticism and going to confirm it with their own sources. “What vetting procedures are there to make sure the guy you just smoked is really a bad guy?” The possibility that Spear Operations Group was simply assassinating the UAE’s political opponents in Yemen is reinforced by the fact that Saudi Arabia had itself reconciled with Al Islah as of February 2016 . Riyadh saw them as a useful ally in fighting their primary opponents, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels . Houthi militiamen in Yemen in 2017., Hani Al-Ansi/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images But even if it was ostensibly murder-for-hire, it’s not clear whether or not Spear Operations Group would necessarily be in violation of any U.S. laws. The U.S. State Department told BuzzFeed News that it had not approved the group to send personnel overseas to conduct armed operations of any kind, but if Golan and his team were acting as representatives of the UAE military, this might not have been necessary. The United States has relatively loose restrictions on citizens and permanent residents serving in foreign militaries, as well. The UAE, which has just around a million actual citizens itself, relies heavily on foreign personnel to fill the ranks of its military in both leadership and rank-and-file positions . The man who met with Golan and Gilmore in 2015, Mohammed Dahlan , is actually a Palestinian who now serves as a top adviser to Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. This is hardly the first time the Emiratis have stood accused of leveraging that system to deploy what are by any layman’s definition mercenaries to fight on its behalf, or that of its proxies, elsewhere in the world, either. In 2017, there were reports that U.S. nationals linked to infamous American businessman Erik Prince were flying UAE-supplied armed crop duster aircraft in Libya in support of strongman Khalifa Haftar and his forces. Unclear objectives Spear Operations Group’s activities also call into question whether the Saudis and the Emiratis are even on the same page about how to prosecute the conflict in Yemen. The UAE has worked hard to conduct to, ostensibly separate campaigns in the country, one against the Houthis as part of the Saudi-led coalition and another, against AQAP, in cooperation with the United States . Targeting a group that had allied itself with the coalition would appear to reflect a third line of effort focused entirely on the UAE’s own interests. In December 2017, two senior Al Islah officials traveled to Riyadh to meet with Saudi Arabia’s ascendent Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, largely seen as the man actually running the country , and Mohammed bin Zayed. This may have been part of an effort on the part of the Saudis to end the UAE’s campaign against the Yemeni political group. Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, second from the left, and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, to his right, meet with members of Yemen’s Al Islah in December 2017. , Saudi Press Agency The Saudi Arabian-led fight against the Houthis has already been a controversial debacle that has caused an unprecedented humanitarian disaster to emerge in Yemen. That the two principal actors in the coalition might not even agree on the overall objectives of the operation, which has led to thousands of civilian deaths , forced even more to flee their homes , and has the small nation struggling with famine and disease , is, to put it mildly, a troubling possibility. The potential ramifications of Spear Operations Group’s activities extend well beyond Yemen, too. If the UAE has employed such groups in Yemen, what’s to say they haven’t done so elsewhere? The use of nebulous private military and other pseudo-para-military organizations is already expanding around the world, giving less-than-democratic governments a novel means to carve out proxy wars within proxy wars and better avoid being drawn into an open conflict with their opponents. It also seems difficult to imagine that the U.S. Intelligence Community was completely unaware of what Spear Operations Group was doing in Yemen, given the responses from BuzzFeed’s sources and how deeply and controversially the United States is involved in Yemen itself. This gives the assassinations at least a hint of tacit U.S. government approval. A US Air Force KC-135 tanker refuels a UAE F-16E Desert Falcon multi-role combat jet during operations against ISIS in Iraq in 2016. The United States also provides aerial refueling, as well as other support, to the Saudi-led coalition operating in Yemen., USAF “If I could do it over again we would have been less risk-averse,” Gilmore told BuzzFeed News. “We could have done some amazing things – although we also could have done some amazing things and all ended up in jail.” It’s unclear whether these revelations will lead to new regulations in the United States or internationally over what private military companies can and cannot do. At the moment, though, the U.S. government denying any responsibility for Spear Operations Group’s actions and official silence from the UAE on the matter, suggest that the mechanism might be working as intended and providing sufficient cover for everyone involved, even tangentially. This would only seem to incentivize future groups to take more risks and take on missions of debatable legality, which might point to a significant change in how nation-states, and maybe even non-state actors, conduct armed conflicts, or other campaigns of violence, in the immediate future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details about the mishap are still limited, but a Su-27UB Flanker combat jet from Ukraine’s Air Force has crashed in that country, killing its Ukrainian pilot, as well as reportedly a member of the U.S. Air National Guard. The jet had been flying a training sortie as part of Exercise Clear Sky 2018 , which began on Oct. 8, 2018. The accident occurred at around 5:00 PM local time on Oct. 16, 2018, near the village of Ulaniv, which is situated approximately 185 miles southwest of the Ukranian capital Kiev. Ukraine’s military immediately launched a search and rescue operation that unfortunately found that there were no survivors of the crash. “We regret to inform that, according to a report by the search and rescue team, the bodies of two pilots were found,” the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on social media on Oct. 16, 2018. “One is a Ukrainian air force pilot, and the second is a U.S. Air National Guard pilot.” Neither the Ukrainian nor the U.S. military has identified the American aviator in question or their unit. Confusingly, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has already taken down its post that stated the nationalities of the two individuals onboard the Flanker, raising the possibility that the initial report may have been in error. Hmm. So the Ukraine General Staff has removed the original post that included nationalities of pilots in Su-27 crash. https://t.co/nWSfNoY5pt — Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) October 16, 2018 However, members of the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing have brought some of their F-15C Eagle fighter jets to join in Exercise Clear Sky 2018, the unit’s first-ever deployment to Ukraine. California’s National Guard is heavily involved in training and other activities with Ukraine’s military broadly through the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program . If it’s true that a pilot from the U.S. Air National Guard was in the Su-27 at the time of the crash, it is important to note that it is not uncommon for members of foreign air forces to get a chance to conduct familiarization flights in each others aircraft during multi-national exercises. American military aviators would be particularly interested in riding in a Flanker, a family of fighters that is in widespread service around the world and that the U.S. military could easily find itself facing in any potential large-scale conflict against near-peer opponents, such as Russia or China . https://youtube.com/watch?v=LCdVTp9BQ7k Though we don’t yet know the exact reason why the U.S. pilot was flying in the Flanker, Approximately 950 personnel from Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States are taking part in the drills. The stated objective is to improve cooperation between NATO air arms and Ukraine’s air force. “This is the largest exercise in the last four years. It involves more than 50 aircrafts from eight NATO member-states and our planes – of the Ukrainian Air Forces,” Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko said on Oct. 11, 2018. “The purpose of the exercises is to increase the level of interoperability of our combat aircrafts with the air forces of the United States and other member states of the [NATO] Alliance.” The official logo for Clear Sky 2018., Ukraine MoD Update: 1:20pm EST— U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), the top Air Force command in the region, has confirmed that a U.S. service member was involved in the incident, but has no made an official announcement as to their status. USAFE also said that mishap is already under investigation. Update: 10/17/2018— Sadly, the Air Force has now confirmed that a pilot from the 144th Fighter Wing did die in the crash. The sortie was “a single-aircraft familiarization flight,” according to an updated press release . “This is a sad day for the United States and Ukraine,” U.S. Air Force Major General Clay Garrison, the head of the California Air National Guard, who is also acting the exercise director for Clear Sky 2018, said in a statement. “Our deepest condolences go out to the family, friends and fellow Airmen of both the U.S. Airman and Ukrainian aviator who were killed in the incident.” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick Air Air Forces Fighters Flankers Su-27 Ukrainian Air Force"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 29, 2019",Russia Rages At Pentagon Plans To Build U.S. Made Derivatives of Soviet-Era Small Arms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has supplied hundreds of thousands of Soviet-style assault rifles and machine guns to allies and partners over the years and acquired some of its own for special operations and other training purposes, but it has had to largely source those weapons from friendly third-party countries that still make them. Worried about the reliability of this supply chain, U.S. Special Operations Command has hired contractors to build derivatives of certain guns in the United States, a move that has now incited the ire of Russia. In 2017, Special Operations Command (SOCOM) put out a contract notice through the U.S. government’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program calling on private companies to submit proposals to build analogs to the 7.62x54mm PKM light machine gun and the 12.7x108mm NSV heavy machine gun . Dillon Aero , Knight’s Armament Company , and McNally Industries all subsequently received deals to conduct research studies into the feasibility of building these guns, according to Military Times . “If someone wants to carry out this work legally … they should approach [Russia’s state arms exporter] Rosoboronexport and discuss it,” Russian state-run conglomerate Rostec , which oversees various defense firms, including gun maker Kalashnikov Concern , said in a statement on Oct. 10, 2018. “Otherwise, this would amount to the illegal copying of Russian innovations or theft, simply speaking.” “Several countries hold licenses for manufacturing Russian machine guns of this model, but the US is not among them,” Viktor Bondarev, a member of Russia’s Duma, the country’s top legislative body, and Chairman of the Russian Federation Council’s Committee on Defense and Security, told state-run media outlet TASS separately that same day . “If U.S. intentions evolve into real actions, if they start making concrete steps in an effort to use our technologies without permission, if they start re-engineering and manufacturing our heavy machine guns on the US territory, then we should react decisively and promptly.” A member of Iraq’s security forces fires a PK-style machine gun during training overseen by members of the US-led coalition., US Army The remarks from Rostec and Bondarev highlight one of the core reasons why SOCOM is pursuing this project in the first place. Since 2014, the U.S. government has imposed a raft of sanctions on various arms of the Russia government, including Rosoboronexport , over the Kremlin’s actions in Ukraine and Syria , meddling in the U.S. electoral process , and more . This has made it all but impossible to source weapons like the PKM and NSV from Russia directly. This has already had far-reaching impacts on U.S. military assistance programs, most notably leading to an American-backed decision to replace the Afghan Air Force’s Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters with U.S.-built UH-60 Black Hawks . A Romanian Gendarmerie, at right, trains a member of Afghanistan’s Uniformed Police to fire an NSV machine gun., NATO Defense contractors situated within certain NATO members, such as Bulgaria, as well as in other ostensibly friendly countries, such as Ukraine, do still produce versions or derivatives of Soviet-era guns, providing alternative sources. They might not have the capacity to meet American demands or do so quickly, though. At the same time, guns such as the PKM and NSV remain extremely popular around the world and in demand, including among U.S. allies and partners. In addition, the U.S. military has its own demands for these types of machine guns in order to train personnel who will act as advisors and mentors for foreign forces. There may also be a need to equip units that will be operating in close cooperation with those forces with similar weapons or to have them on hand to issue to personnel engaged in covert or clandestine operations . Members of Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command shoot Kalashnikov AKM-style rifles during a training exercise., USMC Having a steady supply chain for the weapons based entirely in the United States would simplify the logistics of the situation immensely. It would also help ensure uniformity in the weapons the U.S. military is acquiring for its allies or for its own use. The Soviet-style assault rifles and machine guns the U.S. government has sourced from countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the past may be functionally identical, but do not necessarily have 100 percent commonality in parts. “Foreign made weapons lack interchangeability and standardization which hinders field and depot level part replacement,” SOCOM said in its 2017 contracting announcement . “Developing a domestic production capability for foreign like weapons addresses these issues while being cost effective as well as strengthens the nations [sic; nation’s] military-industrial complex, ensures a reliable and secure supply chain, and reduces acquisition lead times.” As for Russia’s claims of potential intellectual property theft and plans to try and block the U.S. military program, it’s not clear if they will have any legitimate claims to the American designs. The SOCOM plan specifically calls for guns that “resemble” PKMs and NSVs, but are not necessarily direct copies thereof. A Pecheneg-SP light machine gun, one of Russia’s most modern versions of the PK-family., Vitaly Kuzmin If the guns use the same types of ammunition, which are widely available, and feature the same basic control arrangement, it would be relatively easy for foreign forces to transition from their Soviet designs. It would also mitigate the logistical and maintenance burdens of switching to an entirely new type of weapon. Even if the new machine guns were to incorporate parts from the PKM and NSV designs, it’s not clear if this would present a legal impediment to their production. Private companies focused on the civilian market in the United States build components for various Soviet-era rifles , shotguns , and machine guns and do not appear to pay licensing fees or royalties to Rostec in order to do so. It wouldn’t be the first time a U.S. company has made a derivative of a Soviet-style military weapon system and sold it commercially without issue, either. American firm AirTronic USA is building its own take on the iconic RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade and has sold examples to the U.S. military and Ukraine , among others. A US Army soldier prepared to a fire an AirTronic PSRL-1, an American-made derivative of the Soviet RPG-7., US Army If the contractors can build PKM- and NSV-like guns that meet SOCOM’s requirements, it’s very possible that the concept could extend to other Soviet-era weapons, as well. Entirely American-made derivatives of Kalashnikov AKM-style assault rifles already exist. One of these is Kalashnikov USA, which has possible ties to the Russian firm of the same name and is presently under investigation for possible sanctions violations . As such, it’s entirely possible the Kremlin’s posturing actually reflects a concern that U.S. companies making Soviet-style guns, or improved derivatives thereof, could challenge traditionally Russian-held markets abroad, even outside of established U.S. military assistance programs. The companies that are involved in the SOCOM program are well established and have good track records for creating quality products. Knights Armament is world renowned for producing high-quality small arms specifically. It could also edge out the Russians from the lucrative commercial market in the United States itself, since gun makers generally make civilian-legal versions of their military designs to sell to private citizens. In April 2018, Rosoboronexport outright accused the United States of using sanctions simply to try and drive it from the international arms market. “This is unfair competition in its purest form,” a Rosoboronexport spokeswoman told Reuters . We don’t know what SOCOM’s projected timeline is for moving its existing program from Phase I, where it is now, through to Phases II and III, the latter of which is the establishment of a full production line to build the guns. But unless U.S.-Russia relations improve quickly, we may start seeing American allies, and even some U.S. troops, wielding American-made derivatives of Soviet machine guns in the coming years.

Seth ‘Jethro’ Nehring Was USAF F-15 Pilot Who Died In Su-27 Crash In Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has identified its pilot who died when a Ukranian Air Force Su-27UB Flanker he was riding in crashed on Oct. 16, 2018 . The mishap occurred during a familiarization flight as part of Exercise Clear Sky 2018. A Ukrainian pilot was also killed in the incident. It’s customary for USAF units exchange flights with local fighter pilots they are training with during major exercises overseas and especially if the other side has aircraft that are threat representative. Statements from both U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), which is responsible for all Air Force operations in Europe, and the Office of California Governor Edmund Brown , identified the American aviator as U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Seth “Jethro” Nehring, a 44-year old F-15 Eagle pilot from Fresno, California who was assigned to the California Air National Guard’s 194th Fighter Squadron, part of the 144th Fighter Wing. The U.S. and Ukrainian governments are continuing to investigate the incident. “This is a sad day for the United States and Ukraine,” Major General Clay Garrison, the head of the California Air National Guard and the top officer in charge of Clear Sky 2018, said in a USAFE press release . “Our deepest condolences go out to the family, friends and fellow Airmen of both the U.S. Airman and Ukrainian aviator who were killed in the incident.” “On behalf of all Californians, Governor Brown and First Lady Anne Gust Brown honor California Air National Guard Lt. Col. Seth ‘Jethro’ Nehring, who bravely gave his life in service to our state and nation,” the release from Governor Brown’s office read . “The Governor and First Lady extend their deepest condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time.” A Ukranian Su-27UB like the one Lieutenant Colonel Seth “Jethro” Nehring was flying in at the time of the crash., Oleg Belyakov via Wikimedia Clear Sky 2018 has otherwise been an immensely significant event for the pilots from the 144th Fighter Wing, who are among the approximately 950 personnel from nine countries, including the United States, who are taking part in the exercise. It is the first time ever that the unit has brought its F-15C Eagles to Ukraine and is the first time the Air Force has deployed this kind of aircraft to the country since 1998, according to Military.com . Our deepest condolences to Jethro’s family and friends. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 5pm PDT— We are now getting additional information on the Jethro. A post on the 144th Fighter Wing’s Facebook page reads: It’s with a heavy heart we share the news that we lost a member of our team yesterday. Lt. Col. Seth “Jethro” Nehring, assigned to the 194th Fighter Squadron, was killed yesterday in an SU-27 plane crash in Ukraine. Jethro was deployed to Ukraine for the Clear Sky 2018 exercise. He was serving as the Operations Officer in the Joint Operations Center, meaning he was the liaison between the exercise director, Maj. Gen. Garrison and all flying operations. He was handpicked for this position due to his operational experience and long history with our unit. Jethro has been a member of the 144th family for over 20 years. He began his career here as an enlisted crew chief before being selected for a pilot slot and flew the F-16 Viper for over 15 years and converted to the F-15 Eagle. A loss of any kind is always difficult and our thoughts and prayers go out to Jethro’s family and friends. God speed Jethro! We also have some information on the Ukrainian pilot. Apparently , he was Colonel Petrenko Ivan Nikolaevich, deputy commander for aviation, the chief of air force air command Eastern Air forces of Ukraine. The report notes he was a fully qualified combat pilot and instructor. So it was a high-ranking commander who was the primary pilot in command of the Flanker.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 16, 2019",USAF Frantically Stole Parts From One RC-135 To Get Another Airborne To Spy On A Missile Launch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that the U.S. Air Force’s aging, but vital RC-135 spy planes have been breaking down at an increasingly a worrisome rate for years now, often forcing the cancellation of important missions. Now, information from a declassified official unit history provides an especially clear example of how these problems can have cascading impacts on operational readiness and put the U.S. military’s ability to gather critical intelligence at risk when it matters most. In 2016, one of the Air Force’s three RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft suffered an unspecified maintenance issue while deployed to RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom. This would have rendered it unable to perform its scheduled mission, which was to collect information on the launch of an unknown ballistic missile system. The Cobra Ball aircraft have specialized equipment to track these types of weapons and gather telemetry and other electronic intelligence data, as well as visual imagery on them and their test flight operations. “The required part would not have arrived at RAF Mildenhall before the predicted missile launch window,” the 2016 history for the 25th Air Force, the Air Force’s top intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance unit, explained. “If the new part could be found by cannibalizing another RC-135 or KC-135 air refueling aircraft, then the mission could proceed.” We at The War Zone obtained this document via the Freedom of Information Act. Censors redacted the exact date of the incident, the target of the RC-135S’ mission, and what intelligence the crew was ultimately able to collect. One of the Air Force’s three RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft., USAF What we do know is that the Cobra Ball was able to fly its mission, in the end, thanks to some quick thinking on the part of U.S. Air Force Technical Sergeant Michael Smith, a liaison from the 25th Air Force’s Logistics Division. He was the one who the history credits with suggesting that maintenance crews take the necessary parts from another C-135-based aircraft to get the RC-135S flying again. In the end, Air Force officials agreed to have personnel strip the required components out of an RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signals intelligence aircraft that was also at Mildenhall at the time. We don’t know whether or not maintenance personnel swapped the parts back after the RC-135S returned to base. The internal history does make it clear that the 25th Air Force was very proud of how its airmen handled this incident. The specific section is titled “625 OC [Operations Center] Saves RC-13SS Cobra Ball Mission.” The entry from the 25th Air Force history for 2016 covering the RC-135S mission in question., USAF via FOIA But, while it clearly allowed the Air Force to gather significant information on a rocket or missile launch, the entire incident highlights the challenges and tough decisions that the sorry state of the RC-135 fleet imposes on the service. In 2016 alone, the 55th Wing as a whole had to abort more than 500 missions due to maintenance issues, according to an investigative series the Omaha World Herald published in June 2018. This unit oversees the Cobra Balls and Rivet Joints, as well as the RC-135U Combat Sent electronic intelligence platforms, OC-135B Open Skies surveillance aircraft, and WC-135W Constant Phoenix nuclear intelligence planes. The RC-135V/W that sacrificed its mission readiness to so the RC-135S could fly its sortie had been scheduled to perform a flight of its own that day. That got pushed back 24 hours as a result of the need to get the Cobra Ball airborne. There’s no way of telling what intelligence the Rivet Joint might have missed by not flying its scheduled mission. Operating from bases in Europe, these aircraft typically monitor Russia’s heavily militarized Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea and other parts of NATO’s eastern flank . RC-135V/Ws deployed to Mildenhall often fly further on to Naval Support Activity Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete, where they fly important missions in the Black Sea , monitoring Russia’s activities in and around Ukraine’s Crimea region, and the Eastern Mediterranean, often operating off the coast of Syria . A Rivet Joint flying from Greece helped gather information on air defenses in Syria ahead of a U.S.-led cruise missile barrage against Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure in April 2018. These missions are often critical and time sensitive . The scramble to get the RC-135S up in the air in 2016 was itself driven by new intelligence that indicated the target’s launch time had gotten pushed up. The low availability rates within the small RC-135 fleet make it hard to ensure the jets are ready to respond to these kinds of changes on short notice to begin with. It’s also important to note that while cannibalization is rife across the U.S. military’s aviation communities that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily a sustainable practice. The potential pitfalls are magnified when dealing with low density, high-value assets such as the RC-135S aircraft. The plan worked in 2016, but the Air Force simply can’t rely on there always being another aircraft on hand to strip of necessary parts. Even if there is, there is no guarantee that maintenance personnel will be able to have a broken plane ready exactly when it’s needed. Air Force ground crew personnel inspect one of the engines on an RC-135S Cobra Ball., USAF Collection demands, especially when it comes to rocket and missile launches, are only likely to have increased since 2016, as well. Even when they’re all working fine, the three Cobra Balls have to contend with the U.S. governments desire to monitor an increasing number of Russian , Chinese , North Korean , and Iranian ballistic missile developments and contend with the growing proliferation of such systems elsewhere. In the past, Cobra Balls have even flown missions to monitor American allies and partners, such as India, Israel, and Pakistan, as they conducted their own missile launches. It’s not clear when the state of the RC-135 fleet, in part or as a whole, might improve, but Air Force has been under increasing pressure from Congress to take action to rectify low availability rates and other readiness issues across the service. A spate of serious and often fatal aircraft accidents in 2018 has also been driving demands from legislators and the general public for the service to do some critical introspection into how it operates. Lawmakers did include more than $600 million specifically to support the 55th Wing’s C-135-based aircraft in the most recent defense budget for the 2019 Fiscal year, as well. At the same time, the Air Force also has no firm plan about how it would go about actually replacing the RC-135s. The service expects to keep the planes flying through at least 2050. In the meantime, the 55th Wing may well have to continue swapping parts between RC-135s to at least try to ensure they meet the highest priority collection requirements.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 5, 2019","U.S. General Narrowly Escapes Brazen Taliban Attack, But It’s Still A Huge Blow To War Effort","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The top American officer in charge of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan and all U.S. military forces in the country has narrowly escaped what the Taliban has claimed as an insider attack in the southern province of Kandahar . The shooter did manage to kill the province’s governor and its top police official, as well as the head of the National Directorate of Security intelligence agency in the region, underscoring that the insurgents remain highly capable of launching high profile para-military operations and terrorist attacks . The attack in the palace in the province’s capital city of the same name came on Oct. 18, 2018, as U.S. Army General Scott Miller, head of the NATO-run Resolute Support Mission and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, was meeting with Governor Zalmay Wesa, National Police General Abdul Raziq, and the province National Directorate of Security (NDS) chief, identified only as General Mominera. A number of initial reports that General Miller was wounded appear to be incorrect. The shooter, allegedly one of Wesa’s bodyguards, did leave three other unidentified U.S. personnel – one member of the military, one U.S. government civilian, and one contractor – with non-life threatening injuries before Afghan or coalition security forces fatally wounded him. “At Kandahar palace today: Afghan-on-Afghan incident, as initial reports indicate,” according to a post from the Resolute Support Mission’s official Twitter account, which seemed to downplay the severity of the situation. “3 Americans wounded. Gen. Miller uninjured, attacker reportedly dead.” Despite this mundane description, it’s hard to emphasize just how devastating the attack’s outcome, as well as the fact that it occurred in the first place, is for Kandahar specifically and for Afghanistan and the conflict there as a whole. If nothing else, it is another demonstration that, despite the coalition’s pronouncements to the contrary, the Taliban remain highly capable of targeting even some of the most senior Afghan and foreign officials at times and places of their choosing. Even though General Miller thankfully escaped unharmed, that he was ever in danger is immensely embarrassing for the coalition, which continues to insist the Taliban are losing ground and are looking to sue for peace. Analysis by independent experts indicates that the insurgents effectively control more than 60 percent of the country and contest Afghan government control in even more areas. “The other attacks that you referred to are done in more remote areas. And what we see is in the majority of those cases, those attacks fail,” now-retired U.S. Army General John Nicholson, who General Miller replaced as head of U.S. and coalition operations in Afghanistan in August 2018, declared to reporters in his final press briefing that month. “Where those attacks are successful in seizing a district center, typically the district centers are retaken. There have been a few that have fallen to the Taliban this year.” U.S. Army General Scott Miller, at left, the top commander of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan, and his predecessor, now-retired U.S. Army General John Nicholson., NATO The reality of the situation, which the Taliban drove home with this latest insider attack, contrasts starkly with Nicholson’s assessment. It will almost certainly have a negative impact on morale among coalition and Afghan personnel and may force officials from the Resolute Support Mission to reconsider how and when they meet with their Afghan counterparts. Two U.S. troops have already died in insider attacks in 2018. Beyond the psychological victory of successfully infiltrating into the inner circle of senior officials, unfortunately, the gunmen produced tangible results for the Taliban. In one fell swoop, the insurgents have effectively wiped out the Afghan government’s senior leadership in Kandahar. The loss of General Abdul Raziq, who became chief of the National Police in Kandahar as a whole in May 2011 , is likely to be especially pronounced. Shortly after taking up the post, he launched a massive crackdown in cooperation with the NDS and employing special police units that had received training from U.S. private military companies. He himself had previously worked with U.S. special operations forces in the country. General Abdul Raziq reviews Afghan policemen in 2012., NATO By all accounts , in the years that followed, he had positioned himself as the real government power broker in the southern Afghan province that the Taliban cite as their spiritual birthplace and as an unkillable opponent. The insurgents feared and despised Raziq, who himself is the subject of numerous allegations of drug trafficking, corruption, torture, extrajudicial killings, and more dating back to at least 2006 . It’s not clear whether or not Raziq’s death, or that of General Mominera, leads to a change in Afghan government tactics or general attitude. But the killings could very well have an impact on critical networks of spies and informants the two men had established in the province, giving the Taliban more freedom to operate and launch future attacks. In addition, whoever succeeds Raziq may not have his reportedly extensive connections to senior tribal leaders and other influential actors in Kandahar, which he fostered over the years and have also been important in challenging the insurgent group’s influence in the region. All told, the attack is a major blow to the Afghan government and the U.S.-backed coalition and comes at a particularly sensitive time. Political crises and controversies over the electoral process, including voter rolls and registrations, had already forced the delay of planned parliamentary elections from July 7 to Oct. 20, 2018. These polls have been in the works since 2015 . Afghan troops train in Kandahar in July 2018., US Army Security issues were also a factor in the delays, as the Taliban have successfully mounted attacks on major province capitals in 2018, most recently briefly having control of the seats of power in Ghazni . Afghan forces were only able to drive out the attackers after a withering display of American air and artillery strikes . Reports also indicate that the Afghan military and police units continue to suffer unsustainable losses. In September 2018, the casualty rate for the Afghan national security forces as a whole had reportedly spiked to nearly 60 every day . On Oct. 13, 2018, the Taliban also said it had met with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Qatar for a new round of talks on how to end the conflict in Afghanistan. The U.S. government refused to confirm or deny the meeting, but has lauded the insurgents’ recent openness to negotiations and cited that as a sign the group is feeling the pressure of a resurgent American military campaign under U.S. President Donald Trump. Critics have contended that the Taliban appear to actually be increasingly negotiating from a position of strength and are still adamant that any final deal ends in the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. Neutering the Afghan government’s leadership in Kandahar, and almost killing the top foreign military officer in the country in the process, only seems to reinforce this viewpoint and seems to make it clear that insurgents are emboldened rather than on the run.

On Oct. 15, 2018, Japan’s Mainichi Shimbun newspaper , citing unnamed sources, said the country’s Ministry of Defense had crafted the hypersonic weapon plan with an eye toward having the initial system in service no later than 2026. The second type would hopefully arrive in 2028. The Japanese government first officially revealed it was working on what it calls the Hyper-Velocity Gliding Projectile (HVGP), in an annual defense white paper that came out in August 2018. Hypersonic speed is defined as anything above Mach 5. Boost-glide vehicles , one of the most common hypersonic weapon designs, are unpowered and require some sort of booster to get them to the appropriate speed and altitude, after which they glide back down to earth. Ballistic missiles, or derivatives thereof, have traditionally served as the launch platform for these systems. The initial Japanese design will by a conical boost-glide vehicle with small fins to adjust course, according to the Mainichi Shimbun . The follow-on hypersonic weapon will use a flatter “talon-shaped” warhead. The Ministry of Defense budgeted more than $40 million in the 2018 Fiscal Year for hypersonic weapon development and has requested more than $120 million to continue that work in the upcoming 2019 fiscal cycle. This two-tier approach makes good sense and is almost identical to the plan the U.S. military has put in place for its own hypersonic boost-glide vehicle development strategy. Still, there is no indication that the Japanese and American efforts are tied together in any way. The basic concept of the conical design is well understood at this point and has been the subject of tests and experiments since the 1980s . This makes it a relatively low-risk option that could help reduce the overall time to develop, test, and field the complete weapon. This type of boost-glide vehicle, however, generally has a limited overall glide time, which can lead to a reduced range. The HVGP program is seeking weapons that can strike targets between around 185 and 310 miles away, but it’s unclear if the two ranges reflect the potential differences in capabilities between the two types of hypersonic warheads. The brief mention of the HVGP program in the Japanese Ministry of Defense’s August 2018 white paper only shows the “talon-shaped” hypersonic boost-glide vehicle design., Japan MoD The conical design is also typically less maneuverable and less accurate than more advanced shapes also in development around the world. These are major issues for hypersonic weapons, the benefits of which are more pronounced if they are more agile and precise, as we at The War Zone have explored in detail in the past. The ability of hypersonic weapons to rapidly change course and follow unpredictable flight paths makes it difficult for opponents to detect and defend against them. As a result, they offer the capability to engage time-sensitive and other critical targets at long ranges with little to no notice. A rendering of the conical hypersonic boost-glide vehicle at the core of the US Army’s Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW). Japan is reportedly working on a similar design for its first operational hypersonic weapon., US Army So, getting even a less than ideal system into service in the near-term would allow the Japanese to begin realizing the benefits of having operational hypersonic weapons and could help support the development of the follow-on system. For instance, it’s very likely that any improved boost-glide vehicle would use the same booster or a version thereof. The HVGP program’s primary stated objective is the development of a weapon “for the defense of remote islands, which can glide at high velocity and attack a target in order to enable island-to-island firing,” according to the Ministry of Defense’s white paper. “Remote islands” here is a reference to a hotly disputed group of islands that the Japanese refer to as Senkaku and the Chinese refer to as Diaoyu. The Senkakus lie more than 260 miles southwest of Okinawa , which itself is more than 300 miles away from the Japanese Home Islands. The area is much closer to the Chinese mainland and Chinese warships and military aircraft routinely conduct patrols in the area to challenge Japan’s claims. A Japanese government map showing the Senkakus in relation to Okinawa. At the top left is the Chinese mainland and at the bottom left is Taiwan., Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hypersonic weapons situated in Okinawa, or on other Japanese-owned islands closer to the Senkakus, could offer Tokyo a new means of deterring China. The boost-glide vehicles would present a highly responsive and flexible threat to Chinese forces during any actual conflict, especially depending on what assets the Japanese might’ve been able to move into the area before the outbreak of hostilities. This could force Beijing to rethink taking any more concrete action to assert its own territorial claims in the region. A weapon system with a maximum range of 310 miles wouldn’t be able to reach other regional threats, such as North Korea, from the Japanese Home Islands, but it might be possible for Japan to adapt any hypersonic weapon it develops into a sea-launched version that could put those targets within striking distance. A larger booster could also increase the overall range of the system. This could help reduce Japan’s reliance on allies to conduct the actual strikes in the event of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula or the appearance of an imminent threat  to Japanese interests elsewhere in the region. Japan has often been right in the path of North Korean ballistic missile tests and has largely lacked any credible means to strike at those weapons before launch or retaliate afterward on its own. The Japanese Ministry of Defense is also developing stand-off, air-launched, land-attack cruise missiles that would give it more capability in this regard. A Japanese F-2 combat jet carrying a still-in-development XASM-3 supersonic anti-ship cruise missile., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries But hypersonic weapons that can strike well beyond Japan’s territorial boundaries would also be as clear an indication as any of a shift away from the purely “defensive” nature of its military, as enshrined in Article Nine of the country’s constitution. Since Japan does not presently have ballistic missiles to use as boosters for hypersonic vehicles, the HGVP program could also to the development of those systems, which could have an “offensive” character, as well. In 2016, there were unconfirmed reports that the Japanese were working on a ballistic missile development program to defend the Senkakus, which could be related to the hypersonic project. In May 2017, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he wanted to complete an exhaustive review the law by 2020 in order to ensure that it still reflected the geopolitical state of East Asia and Japan’s place in the world as a whole. The push has raised the ire of China and both North and South Korea , all of which suffered greatly under Japanese occupation during World War II and are all steadfastly opposed to any attempts by the country to re-militarize for operations outside its borders. Still, Abe and his government may find support for both transforming Article Nine and the development of advanced weapon systems such as a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle from the United States and President Donald Trump in particular. Trump and Abe have forged a close public bond , especially over Japan’s plans to purchase American-made arms. “To deal with the difficult security situations, it is important for us  to continue to introduce sophisticated equipment, including American equipment, so that Japan’s defense capability can be strengthened,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga explained to reporters, paraphrasing what he said Abe had told Trump, during a press conference on Sept. 26, 2018. No matter how the HGVP program proceeds and what other weapon developments efforts it might feed into in the future, it seems clear that Japan is determined to develop its own hypersonic weapon capability and could have a working weapon within the next 8 years.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 16, 2018","US, South Korea Cancel Another Big Combat Exercise As Ties Between Seoul and Pyongyang Grow","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. and South Korea have agreed to scrap a major air warfare exercise in order to help promote ongoing diplomatic efforts with North Korea. The decision seems to primarily reflect the progress authorities in Seoul have had in expanding ties with their counterparts in Pyongyang, but raises questions about how much of an impact canceling future drills might have on the ability of the United States and South Korea to respond to any future crises on the Peninsula. The Pentagon announced the suspension of the latest iteration of the annual Vigilant Ace exercise , which typically occurs in the winter. Vigilant Ace 2018, which began on Dec. 4, 2017, involved hundreds of U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy and South Korean Air Force aircraft, including American F-22A Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter stealth fighters, flying from eight different bases in South Korea. This year’s gathering was slated to involve more than 12,000 personnel from both countries. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and South Korea Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong Doo canceled the exercise “to give the diplomatic process every opportunity to continue,” Pentagon Press Secretary Dana White said in a statement . “Both ministers are committed to modifying training exercises to ensure the readiness of our forces. They pledged to maintain close coordination and evaluate future exercises.” This isn’t the first large-scale exercise the U.S. and South Korean militaries have agreed to cancel this year. Following his historic summit with North Korean premier Kim Jong Un in June 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump directed a halt to the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian drill, ostensibly as a goodwill gesture to help still ongoing negotiations over the state of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. US Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter jets prepare to take off during Vigilant Ace 2018 in December 2017., USAF “We will work very closely, as I’ve said, with the Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo], and what he needs done, we will certainly do to reinforce his efforts, but at this time there is no discussion of further suspensions,” Mattis told reporters on Aug. 28, 2018. There are “no plans, at this time, to suspend any more exercises” and the Pentagon had “done no planning for suspending” future drills, he added. The next day, Trump took to Twitter, speaking in the third person, to make clear that the possibility of canceling more military exercises remained on the table. The President specifically cited the cost of the drills, which he had previously used to, in part, justify the suspension of Ulchi Freedom Guardian. “Nonetheless, the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one, and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U.S.-South Korea war games,” Trump wrote in a series of posts on the social media site on Aug. 29, 2018. “Besides, the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea, and Japan, if he so chooses.” The decision to halt major exercises such as Vigilant Ace is a significant choice, though. The official goal of the last iteration of the drill in 2017 was “to deter, and if necessary defeat, a rapidly evolving threat” on the Korean Peninsula, a not-so-veiled reference to North Korea. Though the U.S. and South Korean militaries offered no specifics, the training missions could have covered practicing to conduct limited strikes in the North against to target portions of that country’s nuclear weapons infrastructure or ballistic missile capabilities , or to neutralize its leadership as part of a so-called “ decapitation strike .” The exercise also offered an opportunity for both countries to practice working together in general, skills that would be critical in responding to imminent North Korean threats on short notice during a crisis. As such, halting Vigilant Ace is a significant victory for the North Koreans, who have criticized it and other major drills for decades , accusing the United States and South Korea of conducting dry runs for an invasion . In May 2018, Kim Jong Un had threatened not to attend the summit with Trump in Singapore over another air warfare drill called Max Thunder . Ultimately, that exercise went ahead as planned and Kim met with Trump. A South Korean F-15K Slam Eagle taxies past a row of South Korean F-4E Phantoms during Max Thunder 2017., USMC Still, canceling the exercise is yet another indication of how serious South Korea is in attempting to establish more normal government-to-government relations with the North, reduce military tensions, and expand social and economic ties. In September 2018, the two Koreas agreed to create an extended buffer zone along the inter-Korean border where no maneuver or live-fire drills could occur. They also agreed to pull back various forces permanently stationed along the Demilitarized Zone and have begun removing mines and fixed fortifications in the divided border village of Panmunjom , which serves as a key meeting place for North and South Korean officials, and at a separate hilltop site that may contain the remains of as many as 300 South Korean, French and U.S. soldiers who died during the Korean War. All of this has served to build trust between the two Koreas who are now looking to reopen various rail and road connections to facilitate more regular trade and travel. North Korean premier Kim Jong Un, second from the left, holds hands with South Korean President Moon Jae In atop Mount Paektu near the Chinese border in September 2018. It is the highest point on the Korean Peninsula and an extremely significant landmark for all Koreans., Kyodo via AP But canceling the exercises is also something of a gamble, since, despite what Trump claimed in August 2018, the U.S. and South Korean militaries wouldn’t be able to “instantly” reboot the canceled exercises. These large-scale drills take months to plan and require intricate scheduling so as not to disrupt the other training and operational requirements for dozens of units. Coordinating the activities of 12,000 individuals and their aircraft, as well as the task of bringing in additional planes and personnel from outside the country, is a major undertaking on its own and one that holds a training value in of itself. The U.S. Air Force and Navy have recently begun sounding the alarm that massive movements of personnel and assets are unlikely to go unchallenged in the future and could lead to serious difficulties for American forces in the opening phases of a large-scale conflict. Secretary of Defense Mattis has downplayed the issue , saying that lower level training occurs constantly. Without major exercises such as Vigilant Ace, there is no opportunity to see how all the pieces may or may not actually work together in practice , though. “That’s a key exercise to maintain continuity and to continue to practice our interoperability,” U.S. Army General Robert Abrams, head of U.S. Forces Korea, who would act as the top military commander on the Peninsula during a conflict, said at his confirmation hearing on Sept. 25, 2018. “So there was a slight degradation [in readiness].” US Army General Robert Abrams, now head of US Forces Korea, at his confirmation hearing on Sept. 25, 2018., Alex Edelman/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP As we at The War Zone have noted in the past , there’s no guarantee that the United States and South Korea might agree on what sort of North Korean actions, or lack thereof, would prompt a decision to restart exercises or the refusal to suspend more drills in the future. The U.S. government is, at least publicly, primarily committed to getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missile programs. Kim, however, has shown no indication he would be willing to “ denuclearize ” in any way – a term the United States and North Korea disagree on the definition of, to begin with – absent major concessions, such as a final peace settlement to formally end the Korean War and the lifting of sanctions. That could subsequently prompt calls from Pyongyang for the departure of all U.S. forces from South Korea. For its part, South Korea has appeared increasingly willing to accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state and engage with it in other ways to seek to open the Hermit Kingdom to the world. The theory here would be that ending the North’s status as an international pariah would encourage reforms and liberalization of the country’s government and society in the long term. In the meantime, canceling more exercises could help convince North Korea to continue negotiating, but as more drills get suspended, it may get even harder for the U.S. or South Korean threaten to restart them in the future, or at least do so quickly, if talks break down. This can only increasingly call into question the long-standing motto of U.S. and South Korean forces on the Peninsula, that they are ‘ready to fight tonight,’ as doing so requires regular large-scale training.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 20, 2019",Let’s Discuss The Murder Of Jamal Khashoggi And Its Geopolitical And Strategic Ramifications,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For most stories that have the potential for this large of a geopolitical and strategic impact, I have a take ready to go pretty quick. In this rare case, I have been at a loss for words. The reports surrounding the mysterious murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi have been especially bizarre, with claims of recordings of torture and direct orders from the very top of Saudi Royal apparatus popping up everywhere, but without any real evidence to support them. On top of that, accusations that the Trump administration is straight-up protecting Saudi Arabian interests have also blurred the facts—or the lack thereof—surrounding the case. The entire thing is nearly as bizarre as it is tragic and it is just the type of event that can send old alliances crashing to the ground. So, yeah, it’s time we talk about it. The top rungs of the Saudi Royal Court are notoriously insular. They preside over an incredibly rich police state of sorts that demands allegiance from its largely bought-off population. For decades, even though The Kingdom has been a close ally of the United States, it has eschewed anything but traditional American values and the deeper you dig the darker that cold harsh reality becomes. But ordering a state-sanctioned hit on a journalist that lives in the U.S., a murder that was to go down within the walls of Saudi Arabia’s own consulate in a foreign land—a NATO ally of the U.S. no less—sounds absurd even for the Saudis. What on earth beneficial could come of such a harebrained scheme? What game tree concludes in a positive outcome? I can’t see any. And clearly, if the Saudis really want someone to disappear, there are far less suspicious or complex ways of going about it. After being bombarded with all types of takes on the incident, some of which were absurdly far-fetched and seemingly partisan motivated, I tweeted what I thought most likely happened after the doors of Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul closed on that terrible day—that it was likely the result of a devious plot that did not aim to murder Khashoggi, at least not there, but one that was inexcusable nonetheless. And that plan went very wrong, leading to the death of the Khashoggi in the consulate. This would help explain some of the known events that day, including two separate teams arriving from Saudi Arabia, one to handle the aftermath of the unplanned circumstances. You can see my tweet dated October 11th, 2018 below: After much diplomatic paddy-cake and even more rumors, Saudi Arabia has now come out claiming this is more or less what happened—Khashoggi died in a struggle at the consulate and that whatever they had intended to do to him, it did not include murder. This could be a total lie and I could be flat-out wrong as well, but this is where we stand at this time. Although President Trump’s seemingly timid statements on the matter have raised a lot of commotion— there is a long relationship between Trump’s family and the Saudis—I do full-heartedly agree with the President on his sentiment that we need to know all the facts first before major actions should be taken. People may hate the fact that United States has close diplomatic and military ties with Saudi Arabia for a whole variety of valid reasons—those range from the brutal war in Yemen to the country’s long past of proliferating extremist Wahhabism teachings—but the fact is that they are a critical security partner and the strongest Arab power. They are also a major counter-balancing component when it comes to Iran and they are key when it comes to stabilizing world oil prices. And yes, they are huge customers of America’s weapons industry . All of this could and should be reevaluated depending on the findings of the Khashoggi investigation, but a knee-jerk reaction could needlessly send an already unstable but strategically critical region into chaos. You can be certain that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, better known as MBS, who has proven more than capable at ruthlessly consolidating power, and his increasingly absent father King Salman will attempt to blame members of the Saudi security apparatus and even lesser royals for this mess in an attempt to keep their rule over The Kingdom untarnished. In other words, no matter who is really responsible, expect plenty of fall guys to be publically punished over Khashoggi’s death in an attempt to satisfy the enraged world community. But the big question is, if this does indeed turn out to be the cause of the orders from the highest echelons of the royal family, even possibly from MBS himself, how does the United States react? MBS has largely assumed control over the day-to-day operations of the Saudi government. , AP The U.S. military ending all support for the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen could be one move that may kill two birds with one stone. First off, it really does take something away from the Saudis. The U.S. has provided essential refueling, search and rescue, intelligence and other support functionality for Saudis’ adventure in Yemen, which has drawn intense ire from the international community for its seemingly chronic inability to keep innocent civilians out of the crosshairs. Some would argue that the U.S. should have pulled its support long ago anyway. Even Defense Secretary Mattis has stated that the Pentagon’s backing of the Saudi-led coalition’s operations in Yemen is not unconditional and there is increasing descent in Congress over support for America’s involvement in the conflict as whole. Pulling out of the conflict in Yemen as a punitive move against Saudi Arabia would leave the ball in the Saudis’ court as to how their relationship with the U.S. would proceed. If they want to cancel their weapons orders, that’s up to them. If they want to react with their own retaliatory measures, which could include leveraging their ability to impact global oil prices, that’s their call too. But it would be a meaningful move that would both penalize Saudi Arabia’s ruling elite for the Khashoggi murder while also leaving the door open for continued diplomatic and military relations, as well as trade. A very interesting interview with Khashoggi from last year that is worth a watch: Some will argue that dropping America’s military support in Yemen would be a step way too far and that it would only help Iranian interests in the region. Others would say it is not enough and that the U.S. should put hard sanctions on Saudi Arabia and all but cut-off ties diplomatically with the oil-rich kingdom. The tough part about this is that killing a journalist because he didn’t cow-tow to The Kingdom’s talking points is an affront on the very heart of freedom. But at the same time, creating a massive vacuum of uncertainty in a region already on the brink to avenge that journalist’s death could do much more harm than good. So with all that said, I want to turn this over to our readers. What do you think happened to Jamal Khashoggi and what do you think America’s response should be if it turns out MBS and his goons killed this man in cold blood? Where does the line of avenging our values intersect with the strategic and security interests of our country? Let us know in the discussion section below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Canada Chooses BAE-Lockheed Proposal To Build Frigates Based On U.K.’s Type 26 Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada has chosen a BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin-led team as the “preferred bidder” for a potential contract worth more than $45 billion to build new frigates for the Royal Canadian Navy. The two major defense contractors had pitched a proposal centered on BAE’s Type 26 Global Combat Ship design, which it is already building for the United Kingdom and Australia. On Oct. 19, 2018, Public Services and Procurement Canada ( PSPC ), the Canadian government’s internal services and administration arm, and Irving Shipbuilding , a Canadian firm that would actually build the ships, announced the decision in separate statements. BAE and Lockheed are now set to negotiate the specific terms of the deal, which would cover the construction of 15 frigates and associated equipment and services. “The Canadian Surface Combatant project is the largest, most complex procurement ever undertaken by the Government of Canada,” PSPC said in its statement . “These ships will form the backbone of our Royal Canadian Navy and will be Canada’s major surface component of maritime combat power for decades to come.” BAE and Lockheed beat out two other offers, one from U.S.-headquartered Alion Science and Technology , through its subsidiary Alion Canada, and another from a team with Spanish shipbuilder Navantia at its head. Alion had proposed a design based on the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën -class frigate, also known as the Luchtverdedigings-en Commandofregat (LCF), or Air Defense and Command Frigate. Navanita offered a ship derived from the Spanish Navy’s Cristóbal Colón , the last of the Álvaro de Bazán -class frigates, which featured significant differences from its earlier sister ships. An artist’s conception of one of the UK Royal Navy’s Type 26 frigates, which will serve as the basis for Canada’s ships., BAE Systems The Type 26s that BAE is building for the U.K. Royal Navy, also known as the City -class, and the modified versions it will deliver to the Royal Australian Navy, are multi-purpose ships, which you can read about in more detail in a past profile I wrote on the design here . The new ships are supposed to eventually supplant the existing 12 Halifax -class frigates , which the Royal Canadian Navy received in the 1990s and are the service’s only major surface combatants today. The Canadian Surface Combatant program to replace those vessels first formally appeared in the Canadian National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy in 2008. The primary armament on the British vessels are 24 vertical launch system (VLS) cells for European consortium MBDA’s Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missile and another 24 Mk 41 (VLS) cells. These latter systems can accommodate various types of weapons, including quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) or single Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) cruise missiles, among others. A similar arrangement on Canada’s Type 26s could offer a significant boost in capability over the Halifaxs , which at present are able to carry 16 ESSMs and eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles . The Royal Navy’s examples will also have a five-inch main gun, which is significantly more capable than the 57mm automatic cannon on Canada’s existing frigates. A look at the basic features on the Type 26s for the Royal Navy, some of which will carry over the Canadian ships., BAE Systems The existing Type 26 designs also have U.S.-made Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) for close-in defense against incoming missiles and swarms of small boats, as well as various smaller automatic cannons and machine guns for self-defense. The ships have fixed and towed sonar arrays for anti-submarine work, but rely largely on a helicopter – in Canada’s case, this would be a Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone – flying from a flight deck at the stern to track and attack those opponents with torpedoes. The flight deck could accommodate unmanned, vertical takeoff and landing capable aircraft in the future, as well. Most importantly, the new frigates will feature an improved sensor suite, including a more modern advanced air- and sea-search radar, compared to the Halifaxs . BAE is supplying its own Artisan 3D radar for the U.K.’s ships, but it’s too early to tell if the Canadians would choose this option. The Type 26 design uses a combined diesel-electric or gas, or CODLOG , propulsion configuration, which combines diesel engines and gas turbines into a single power-producing system. This improves power management and efficiency, as well as help reducing maintenance and logistical costs, all of which are important for modern multi-purpose ships with increasingly power-hungry systems. The Canadian government expects to formally award the contract to buy the Type 26s in 2019 and that production of the ships will begin in the early 2020s. There is no projected date so far for when the Royal Canadian Navy might receive the first example. The Halifax -class frigate HMCS Vancouver leaves the US Navy base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii after the end of the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 exercise., USN “We have notional time frames allocated,” Andre Fillion, who oversees contracting for military items for the PSPC, told The Canadian Press . “And should everything go according to plan, we’re looking at winter 2019 for the award of the contract. If it doesn’t go according to plan, then we go to Plan B – and obviously, that would take longer.” The contract award is hardly a done deal, though. In 2011, Canada declined an offer to join the Type 26 program after protests from Canadian shipbuilding unions, which said the plan would put domestic shipyards at a disadvantage. The BAE and Lockheed’s plan to use Irving Shipbuilding was clearly an attempt to assuage these concerns. It’s still not clear how many changes BAE and Lockheed will have to make to the existing Type 26 design in order to meet Canadian requirements, which could add cost and delay the final delivery of the first ship. For example, the Royal Australian Navy’s variants, called the Hunter -class , will use the same basic hullform, but will have different sensors and other equipment from their Royal Navy counterparts that have required changes in the design of the main mast. An artist’s conception of a future Royal Australian Navy Hunter -class frigate., Australian DOD There are also reports that Canadian officials are preparing for a fight with Lockheed over intellectual property rights, which the American defense contractor has become increasingly protective of with other high-end products, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Canada would want to secure as many rights to the ship’s systems as possible so as to have the option of hiring other companies, potentially at lower costs, to repair, upgrade and maintain various portions of the ships in the future. Canada had initially demanded the bidders be prepared to turn over ownership of the entire ship design from the start, but subsequently decided to negotiate that point as part of the formal contracting process. The Canadians have also made it clear that they reserve the right to reject BAE and Lockheed’s final offer and move on to negotiate with whichever firm came in second in the bidding, which they have not identified. The capacity of Irving to build the frigates is also in question, with the shipyard itself warning that it could have to lay off a significant number of employees if there contracting process gets delayed . This, in turn, could further slow down the delivery schedule since it would take time to rehire those workers and familiarize them with the Type 26 design. At present, the firm is building Harry DeWolf -class ice-capable Arctic offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Canadian Navy, but it expects that program to wrap up in either 2021 or 2022. The future HMCS Harry Dewolf under construction in May 2018., WayeMason via Wikimedia Pat Finn, a retired Royal Canadian Navy rear admiral who is now in charge of the Canadian Department of National Defense’s material branch, told CBC News that he didn’t expect construction of the Type 26s to start until at least 2022. There are concerns that this start date could slip into 2023, according to the CBC report. The longer the entire process takes, the more trouble it could mean for the Royal Canadian Navy. The last of the Halifaxs finished their modernization as part of major refit program this year, but this is only supposed to keep them operational into 2030. As noted, Canada has no other major surface combatants, having retired the last of four Iroquois -class destroyers in 2015 without an immediate replacement. “The former naval officer in me is very excited,” the Department of National Defense’s Finn said. “I’ve been around this for a long time.” Hopefully, the Royal Canadian Navy will be able to avoid any more serious delays in getting its newest ships and revitalizing its surface capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 13, 2018",U.S. To Offer Surplus Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigates To Ukraine: Reports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to reports out of Ukraine , the U.S. is looking to offer the country an unknown number of currently mothballed Oliver Hazard Perry frigates in an attempt to help Kiev bolster its presence in the Black Sea and possibly around the entrance to the increasingly contested Sea of Azov. If Ukraine agrees to receive the ships, the transfer would occur through the Excess Defense Property program which commonly funnels surplus U.S. military gear to foreign allies. Although the ships may come free of charge, there will be a cost to bring them up to whatever standard Ukraine and the U.S. have in mind. Before the U.S. Navy controversially passed over returning the retired Perry class frigates it still had to active service, it figured they could be brought back to an operational state to serve in rudimentary interdiction and basic sea control roles at a relatively low cost . Meanwhile, other navies around the globe have spent far more money successfully upgrading their second-hand Perry class frigates with enlarged hangar bays, updated sensors and combat systems, refreshed mechanics, and vertical launch missile systems. If Ukraine were to go this route, the revamped frigates would be the most advanced and capable assets in their fleet. Currently, a single 25-year-old Krivak III class frigate, the Hetman Sahaydachniy (U130), represents the Ukraine Navy’s heaviest hitting ship. That vessel displaces 3,500 tons, while a Perry -class frigate displaces 4,200 tons, for a comparison. It’s also worth noting that no less than 17 ships were left behind when Russia annexed Crimea. It’s not clear what the condition of those vessels are today, but Ukraine is only interested in getting them back if they come along with its territory. Hetman Sahaydachniy (U130)., Ukraine MoD But regardless, as Russia becomes more belligerent in regional waters, Ukraine will need more vessels larger than the patrol boats it is producing indigenously today and the aging but hardy Perry class design could give them a much-needed boost in this regard. As of September of 2017, there were ten Perry class frigates set aside for foreign sales and four more— some of the youngest of the Perry class production—set aside for sinking drills. One of these ships, the ex- USS McClusky (FFG-41) has already gone down. Of the ten available for export, seven are said to be in the best condition. So a number of these ships could end up in Ukrainian hands—an act that Russia wouldn’t be pleased with. Russia enjoys a massive naval advantage over Ukraine, with its increasingly capable Black Sea Fleet being stationed primarily in Sevastopol, located on the southern end of the Crimean Peninsula—a body of land that Russia illegally seized back in early 2014. The U.S. has had a near-constant naval presence in the Black Sea since that action, but that presence usually consists of one or maybe two surface combatants. Beyond operational demands elsewhere, the Montreux Convention limits how many vessels the U.S. Navy can deploy to the Black Sea at any given time and for how long. This is likely another reason for giving Ukraine Perry class frigates—they are a resident country on the Black Sea and are not subject to those limitations. USS Rodney M. Davis (FFG-60), USN Russia has turned the nearly land-locked body of water into a super anti-ship engagement zone with layers upon layers of sea, air, undersea, and land-based anti-ship capabilities reaching out nearly to Turkey’s shore. So any ship, no matter how heavily armed, is under great threat while operating in the area. The possible move to equip Ukraine with surplus American frigates comes as the U.S. has deployed F-15C/D Eagles to Ukrainian territory for the first time in decades and as the Trump administration approved the sale of large lots of Javelin anti-tank guided missiles as well as other offensive capabilities to Kiev. More advanced systems, possibly including Patriot surface-to-air missiles could be next. The news also comes as Russia has been asserting itself far more aggressively in the waters off Ukraine, delaying hundreds of shipping vessels from reaching Ukraine and declaring the Sea of Azov, a shallow body of water that sits between Russia, Crimea and Ukraine and is connected at the southern end by the Kerch Strait, off-limits to international naval exercises. Russia has also been jamming and otherwise tampering with GPS signals over the region for some time as well. There are growing fears that Russia will execute a sudden amphibious assault on Ukraine’s port facilities on the Sea of Azov, namely in and around the city of Mariupol, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko stating the following at a military ceremony in Kiev last Sunday: “We are getting ready to repel Russian aggression from sea in the Sea of Azov area. Powder should be kept ready.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=fjReCc22o4U Not far from the shadow war raging in Eastern Ukraine , Ukrainian forces are actively training to repel such an attack from the sea, but when you consider just how much blunt military force Russia could unleash along their own borders, such a fight would be unthinkably bloody, to say the least. Grabbing Ukraine’s coastal territory on the Sea of Azov would connect Russia and its rebel proxy fighters in eastern Ukraine with Crimea and it would give Moscow full control of body of water. Although these surplus ships aren’t likely to be able to save Mariupol from a Russian large amphibious assault, they can give Ukraine far more capability than they have today when it comes to controlling their own territorial waters and monitoring the waters farther out into the Black Sea. We’ll report back when more details about the terms of the deal and what configuration Ukraine may want—or at least can afford—to receive the vessels in. That’s if they can afford to upgrade, man and operate the ships at all in the first place.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 14, 2017",Navy Wants New ‘Seawolf-Like’ Attack Submarines To Challenge Russian And Chinese Threats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy appears to be leaning toward developing a new, advanced fast attack submarine that focuses more on hunting maritime threats above and below the waves than on stand-off strikes against targets ashore. The decision would reflect growing concerns about Russian and Chinese submarine activity, but could come at a steep price of more than $5 billion per sub. USNI News was one of the first to spot that the Congressional Budget Office explored the Navy’s shifting priorities in its analysis of the service’s latest shipbuilding plan for the 2019 through 2048 Fiscal Years, which it released on Oct. 18, 2018 . Purchases of the Virginia -class attack submarine are supposed to end in 2033, after which the Navy expects to begin buying new boats to succeed that design at a rate of two every year through 2048. This would result in a fleet of 30 of the new subs, presently referred to simply as SSN(X). “Specifically, the Navy indicates that the next-generation attack submarine should be faster, stealthier, and able to carry more torpedoes than the Virginia class – similar to the Seawolf class submarine,” CBO’s analysts wrote in their review. “CBO therefore assumed that the SSN(X) would be a Seawolf -sized SSN, which displaces about 9,100 tons when submerged, and would have an all-new design in keeping with the Navy’s description of it as a ‘fast, lethal, next-generation attack submarine.’” The Seawolf -class submarine USS Connecticut ., USN In 1983, General Dynamics Electric Boat began designing the Seawolf -class for the Navy as a successor to the Los Angeles -class attack submarine. Significantly more advanced, the Seawolfs were also much costlier to build. Their unit cost of more than $3 billion – closer to $5 billion in 2018 dollars – made them the most expensive attack submarine ever designed and the second most expensive submarine of any kind, ever, at the time. With the apparent need for the boats gone after the end of the Cold War, the United States canceled the program in 1995 and ultimately purchased just three of the 29 examples it had originally planned to buy. The Seawolf -class submarines have since been assigned a number of secretive special duties that make good use of their enhanced performance and deep-diving capabilities, which make them particularly well suited to operations under the ice in the increasingly strategic Arctic region. The last example, the USS Jimmy Carter , also received significant modifications to operate as a spy submarine . A graph showing the planned shift in the Navy’s attack submarine fleets between 2018 and 2048, which also shows the older Los Angeles -class boats out of service by around 2033 and the Seawolfs heading into retirement by 2038., CBO The Navy subsequently moved on to the Virginia -class, a smaller, less expensive, multi-mission design with 12 vertical launch system cells for firing Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and features allowing them to more readily work in littoral environments to collect intelligence and insert and extract special operations forces. Starting with the Block V Virginias , the submarines will also gain the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which adds four large diameter tubes for additional Tomahawks, other long-range weapons , or unmanned undersea vehicles . The Navy had originally described SSN(X) as an evolution of the late model Virginia -class boats with the VPM. Now, the plan appears to be to return to a design better suited for conducting missions against enemy surface ships and submarines that has the capacity to carry more torpedoes, according to CBO. A 2013 briefing slide explaining the VPM modifications to the Block V Virginia -class submarines., USN Based on information the office received from the Navy and its own analysis, the new submarines will have space for 25 additional weapons in the torpedo room compared to the existing Virginia-class, for a total of 62 weapons, and could leave out the VPM entirely. CBO’s review noted that this could allow for additional torpedoes or Tomahawks, but it could also allow the submarines to carry torpedo tube-launched anti-ship missiles . This is a long-dormant capability the Navy recently demonstrated for the first time in years during the 2018 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercise off Hawaii. The SSN(X) will almost certainly have other improvements in terms of its ability to avoid detection and perform important secondary missions, such as intelligence collection and network connectivity , and still have the ability to conduct strikes against surface and land targets using some form of VLS array, such as the ones found on Block III and IV Virginia -class boats. There is a possibility any remaining VLS cells could launch supersonic or hypersonic weapons in the future, which could be important as improving defenses on opposing ships will only make it harder for submarines to get close enough to engage a ship with a torpedo as time goes on. A submarine with a revised bow design able to hold more torpedoes could also point to a design with more torpedo tubes in total. The Virginias only have four torpedo tubes, while the Seawolfs have eight. Concerns about increased Russian and Chinese submarine activity seem to be the primary drivers behind the Navy’s renewed desire for a Seawolf -like boat and raises the question of whether it has turned out to be a short-sighted decision to cancel that program in the first place. President Donald Trump and his administration have focused heavily on “great power competition” and the potential for large-scale conflicts against near-peer adversaries in the latest official National Security and Defense Strategies . “I think Russian submarines today are perhaps some of the most silent and lethal in the world, with the exception of our own – I think we still in the United States Navy hold the edge,” U.S. Navy Admiral James Foggo, who presently serves as the head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and NATO’s Allied Joint Force Command Naples, said in an official podcast on Sept. 30, 2018. “We know that Russian submarines are in the Atlantic, testing our defenses, confirming our command of the seas and preparing a very complex underwater battlespace to try to give them an edge in any future conflict. And we need to deny them that edge.” There have been reports that Russian submarine activity in the Atlantic has increased to levels not seen since the end of the Cold War. Foggo himself has described this new reality as the “ Fourth Battle of the Atlantic ,” a reference to anti-submarine campaigns, or preparedness for those types of operations, during the First and Second World Wars and the Cold War. Russia’s Yasen -class nuclear-powered attack submarine Severodvinsk. , Russian MoD We at The War Zone , among others , have called into question just how large Russia’s increase in submarine operations is overall and whether this has come at the expense of its ability to operate elsewhere . However, the Kremlin maintains and is expanding its array of novel undersea capabilities, including deep sea-capable special mission submarines able to interfere with information-carrying cables along the seabed, emplacing sensors of its own at the bottom of the ocean, or otherwise collecting intelligence. Even a limited number of Russian submarines could lay mines , hold targets ashore at risk , or otherwise present a threat in strategic bottlenecks, such as the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea , or in important maritime shipping lanes in the Atlantic during an actual crisis. Russia also claims to be working on nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed long-range torpedoes and unmanned undersea vehicles. By their nature, subs can be difficult to track and monitor, allowing for individual boats to have an outsized impact on an opponent’s operations and potentially drawing valuable resources away from other missions in order to conduct sub-hunting activities . China, eager to move beyond being a regional power, is also stepping up its submarine activity . Though Chinese submarine activity in the Atlantic may be limited, that they’re operating there at all reflects a significant shift in how the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) operates and a new challenge to America’s long-standing naval supremacy along its eastern seaboard. Regardless, China’s submarine fleets are growing and will continue to present a significantly more pronounced threat throughout the Pacific , and potentially elsewhere , as the PLAN continues to transition into a force with global reach. A new advanced American attack submarine could definitely help in countering these challenges, but it’s also unlikely to come cheap. By the Navy’s own estimates, the SSN(X) unit cost will be approximately $3.1 billion, which would be cheaper than the price point for the Seawolfs when adjusted for inflation. However, CBO is warning that this cost estimate may no longer be valid, since the Navy based it on the premise of buying a submarine design derived largely from the existing Virginia -class. If the service’s requirements demand more extensive modifications or a clean-sheet design, this could significantly raise the cost of the program, with the average cost per sub possibly coming out to around $5.5 billion – closer to what a new Seawolf would cost today. It could also increase the strain on already over-worked shipyards to actually build the boats. “The large difference between the Navy’s and CBO’s estimates under the 2019 plan suggests widely different assumptions about the submarine’s size, capabilities, and design,” the CBO noted in its review. “As a result, its final capabilities and costs are highly uncertain.” A Chinese Type 091 nuclear-powered attack submarine. , Qiao Tianfu/Color China Photo/AP Even if the shipbuilding plan proceeds without any problems, the Navy’s goal of a 66-submarine fleet, with a mix of high and very high-end designs that will be expensive to operate and maintain , may not necessarily be able to provide the coverage necessary to respond to potential threats, especially from China. The PLAN has nearly 80 submarines, including a variety of smaller diesel-electric types. These include a growing number of boats with advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology that can give them performance closer to nuclear-powered submarines both in terms of quiet operation and the ability to remain underwater for extended periods of time. The United States may eventually have to consider buying new, lower-cost diesel-electric types itself for more regional missions in order to free up larger nuclear-powered boats for longer-range patrols. SSN(X) is only one part of the Navy’s growing plans to revitalize its anti-submarine warfare capabilities. This push also includes unmanned surface and undersea vessels , surface ships and maritime patrol aircraft with new weapons and sensors , and improved communications systems and data links to quickly share this information between assets at sea and in the air. There are also plans for increased cooperation with NATO allies and other U.S. partners on anti-submarine warfare capabilities will be able to work together more seamlessly in a multi-national setting. “We have to continue to put a capital effort into the development of our technologies and antisubmarine warfare,” Admiral Foggo told reporters on Oct. 5, 2018 briefing . “This is not just submarines, it’s maritime patrol aircraft, it’s sensors of all types, and it’s the surface Navy with their multifunction towed arrays, and the training and the professionalism that goes along with it, for us to have the knowledge and the awareness of where the adversaries operate.” But while they’re just one part of this equation, a new attack submarine more focused on traditional underwater missions definitely seems to be a core part of the Navy’s present plans to counter increasing Russian and Chinese undersea activities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 9, 2019",U.S. Carrier Enters Arctic Circle For The First Time in 28 Years As New Cold War Heats Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The American nuclear-powered supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman sailed into the Norwegian Sea on Friday, a move that marks the first time a U.S. Navy carrier has been in the Arctic Circle since USS America participated in a NATO exercised dubbed North Star back in September of 1991. USS Harry S. Truman is accompanied by her escorts that make up Carrier Strike Group Eight (CSG-8). The flotilla is in the area to practice in the notoriously unforgiving maritime environment before participating in exercise Trident Juncture, the largest NATO exercise in decades. Harry S. Truman’s Commanding Officer, Captain Nick Dienna, said the following about the carrier’s mission in a recent Navy press release : “We are unbelievably excited to be operating in the Norwegian Sea… It has been over three decades since carrier aviation has been tested by this environment, and, despite the arduous weather and sea conditions, these men and women are demonstrating this ship can bring a full-spectrum of capabilities to bear anywhere in the world.” The Norwegian Sea is well known for large swells, stiff winds, very low temperatures, and sudden changes in weather that all make for a big challenge to any naval vessel, but especially to an aircraft carrier that has to conduct around-the-clock flight operations. Photo shot on October 22nd, 2018 aboard the USS Harry S. Truman . Take a look at those seas!, USN Although Carrier Strike Group Eight will get invaluable training in an area the Navy’s surface fleet hasn’t had a huge interest in for many years, Trident Juncture is the real attraction. The exercise, which includes assets from a whopping 30 countries, will take place in the North Atlantic and the tense Baltic Sea regions. Airspace around and over Norway, Finland, Sweden, and even Iceland will be used for aerial portions of the exercise. The best way to wrap your head around just how massive this set of drills are is to let the numbers speak for themselves. 50,000 participants—14,000 of which are American—65 vessels, 10,000 land vehicles, and 150 aircraft will be the very real pieces on NATO commanders’ massive wargaming board. Carrier Strike Group Eight’s head honcho, Rear Admiral Gene Black, described the incredible scope and importance of this big gathering of allied combat forces: “Trident Juncture represents the best of NATO—a coalition of allies and partners working toward the shared interests of lasting peace and economic prosperity in the European region… This exercise is also a fantastic opportunity to learn from our Allies on their home turf… The combined and bilateral operations we have conducted in the region over the last several months embody the U.S.’s commitment to our NATO allies and partners… Together, our maritime partnership creates a global network of navies capable of uniting against any potential threat.” ‘Any potential threat’ is an overtly diplomatic statement from the Admiral. This, and the recent reactivation of the Navy’s dormant 2nd Fleet, are all about checking Russia and its expanded, and in some ways downright troubling , naval and other military operations in the region . The exact area that The Harry S. Truman is operating is one of a handful of prime locales that a Carrier Strike Group would rush to if tensions were to boil over with Moscow. Northern Europe and the North Atlantic region, in particular, are rife with Russian naval capabilities as Russia’s most powerful naval force, its North Sea Fleet, is based in the Barents Sea well within the Arctic Circle. It is this harsh area of the globe where the Russian Navy literally feels the most at home. To the east, in the Baltic Sea, Russia’s Baltic Fleet, which is made up of smaller and more nimble submarines and surface combatants that are especially adept at littoral warfare, is based out of St. Petersburg , but also has capabilities forward based to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad . The greatest threat to a carrier operating in this area comes from Russian nuclear and diesel-electric attack submarines which can lay in wait or actively hunt for America’s most valuable capital ships. Russian submarine activity, in particular, has drastically expanded in the region since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. USN The thing is that operating on a near combat footing in the potentially very hostile and environmentally challenging area that the Arctic Circle represents is something of an atrophied skill set for America’s carrier forces. With that and all the rest in mind, CSG-8’s arrival there really is a more significant event than the sum of its parts. You may be thinking to yourself that this all sounds very Cold War-esque, doesn’t it? You aren’t mistaken. It is becoming clearer with each passing day that a new Cold War is upon us, one that now has the very real possibility of sprouting another nuclear arms race. Nobody knows exactly how Russia will take such a large NATO presence at their front door, but NATO has invited Russian observers to the drills in an attempt to preempt a potential escalation of tensions. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated the following to reporters on October 2nd, 2018: “All members of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, including Russia, have been invited to send observers… This is one of our biggest exercises in many years… The scenario is fictitious but realistic… It will simulate NATO’s collective response to an armed attack against one ally. And it will exercise our ability to reinforce our troops from Europe and across the Atlantic… The exercise is defensive. And it is transparent.” The Truman’s deck is a Super Hornet’s nest as she sails into the North Atlantic. , USN It’s doubtful Russia will see it that way regardless of the assurances. In fact, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters the following on the same day as the NATO Secretary’s statements: “The escalation of NATO’s military and political activity in the Arctic region, namely, in the immediate vicinity of Russia on the territory of northern Norway, hasn’t gone unnoticed… In violation of all time-tested traditions of good neighborliness and against the policy of the Norwegian government established way back in the Cold War period on self-restraint, [which says] ‘not to provide bases on Norwegian territory for armed forces of foreign powers unless Norway is under attack or under threat of attack,’ Oslo set the course for unprecedented militarization of its northern latitudes. In a series of recent unfriendly steps taken by Norway there is the agreement to double the existent contingency of US Marine Corps from 330 to 770 people, to extend their rotating, that is, virtually permanent, presence by five years, to expand their placement in the north. [They also agreed] to hold the most large-scale military drills in the history of Russia near the Russian border at the end of October – NATO Trident Juncture 2018, with the participation of more than 40 thousand people from over 30 countries…” We have to state that such irresponsible actions will inevitably destabilize the military and political situation in the north, increase tensions and undermine the fabric of Russian-Norwegian relations… All these NATO preparations cannot be ignored, and the Russian Federation will take the necessary tit-for-tat measures to ensure its own security…” Reckless saber-rattling in this previously calm region can have far-reaching consequences, and not through any fault of ours.” We will keep you update as to further developments once Trident Juncture 2018 kicks off.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing’s KC-46 Pegasus tanker has traveled along a surprisingly rocky developmental road . Over budget and behind schedule, with multiple promised delivery dates come and gone, the latest just this month , exactly when the first jets would be delivered to the USAF’s McConnell AFB has been, for lack of a better term, up in the air. Now it appears that Boeing has executed a test flight mission that is sure to increase confidence in the new aerial refueling and transport plane, flying from Edwards AFB in Southern California to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, and on to Yokota Air Base located on the outskirts of Toyko. In other words, this was an end-to-end trip across the Pacific. To my knowledge, this is by far the farthest a KC-46 has yet to venture. In fact, I don’t think that one has even left North America before. Of course, Japan is not just a major ally of the United States and home to thousands of American servicemen and hundreds of the Pentagon’s aircraft, but the country’s Ministry of Defense is also a KC-46 customer. Japan finalized an order for a single example earlier this year, making them the first export customer for the type. Japan already operates a handful of KC-767s which are similar to the KC-46 in that they too are based on the 767 airframe, but the KC-767 is a far less customized variant of the 767 than the KC-46A. With that in mind, this trip will likely kill two birds with one stone, acting as a landmark trans-Pacific flight for the KC-46 in general, while also being the first time Japan gets to see their new plane on their own soil. The big question still remains—when will the KC-46A actually be delivered to the USAF? Speculation has been running rampant within the aerospace reporting community, but a contract announcement today for event services—porta-poddies, trash services and the like—at McConnell AFB on November 16th, 2018 has pointed to the real likelihood that the long-awaited date is not too far off in the future. As we noted earlier, after previous delays, Boeing had ardently promised that the first KC-46s would be delivered to the USAF this month, but even as the aircraft was receiving its final FAA certifications, major technological deficiencies with the aircraft remained unresolved. Then, on September 17th, it was discovered that additional deficiencies had been identified, all but sinking the chances that the tanker would be in the USAF’s hands by about this time. Boeing It is possible that the USAF could just overlook these issues and accept the aircraft anyways with a guarantee from Boeing that the issues will get fixed, but we don’t know if this is now the case or not. Still, flying the KC-46 across the Pacific is sure to inspire trust in the aircraft and bring some much needed good press for the beleaguered program.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An EA-18G Growler crew’s choice to trace a giant penis in the skies over Northwest Washington State made worldwide news and become the foundation for many a meme nearly a year ago . It also got them in seriously hot water. Now it looks as if the pilot of a Navy T-34C Turbo Mentor trainer—a plane usually used for bombing range spotting and clearing duties these days—seems to have erected their own ‘sky dick’ over Southern California’s Salton Sea. But this time around the crafty pilot simply flew a track that could be traced by flight-tracking software and didn’t use an aircraft’s contrail to trace the airborne boner visually for all to see. Our friend @Aircraftspots on Twitter was the first to spot the less than modest flightpath: Soon after I opined on the display of yet another windborne wiener, Defense News reporter Valerie Insinna was quick to note its near perfect positioning: The flight’s callsign is also a bit eyebrow-raising—SHUTR91. It normally wouldn’t be at all, but considering the aircraft’s pornographic path, it sure fits the general theme. Once again, if you were on the ground you would have had no idea that this was being done, so it’s very unlikely to draw anywhere near the outrage as the prior episode, but the Navy may find the practice of tracing giant cocks from the cockpit still a bit too blue. We’ll stay on top—or should I say we will follow the story and report back if there is a response from the Pentagon. UPDATE: 3:05pm PDT— A USMC spokesperson confirms that the aircraft belonged to a Marine unit. Considering the callsign, the fact that it came from 3rd MAW and that it was a T-34, it is very likely that the aircraft belonged to VFAT-101 out of MCAS Miramar.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 26, 2019",What Pulling Out Of The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Means And What Comes Next,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Barring a dramatic shift in present U.S. government attitudes on the matter, it appears that President Donald Trump and his administration are about to unilaterally pull the United States out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, commonly known as the INF . U.S. authorities have long accused Russia of violating the deal , but eliminating the agreement altogether could have serious and far-reaching ramifications. There’s little guarantee that the United States will see clear benefits from the plan, which could quickly prompt a destabilizing arms race and create another serious point of contention between the U.S. government and its allies, especially in Europe . Trump publicly announced his administration’s intent to withdraw from the INF during a political rally in Elko, Nevada, on Oct. 20, 2018 . Reports indicating that the treaty was on its last legs had first emerged on Oct. 19, 2018 . National Security Adviser John Bolton , who has long opposed the deal and other arms control agreements , appears to be the biggest proponent of the plan, which the U.S. government has yet to formally announce. “Russia has violated the agreement. They have been violating it for many years,” Trump told supporters at the gathering in Elko . “And we’re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and go out and do weapons and we’re not allowed to.” On Oct. 22, 2018, Bolton touched down in Moscow for a visit where many expected he would inform his Russian counterparts about the United States’ decision to leave the INF. It’s unclear whether Trump’s announcement was planned or not and whether that might have upset his administration’s plan for terminating U.S. participation in the treaty. Russian television aired a candid conversation between Bolton and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as a brief press conference, ahead of a meeting between the two men on Oct. 23, 2018. Trump’s National Security Advisor confirmed the administration’s plan to withdraw from the INF, but said that the U.S. government had not yet submitted the formal withdrawal notice . “As far as I can remember, the U.S. seal depicts an eagle on one side holding 13 arrows, and on the other side an olive branch with 13 olives. … Here’s the question: Did your eagle already eat all the olives and only the arrows are left?” Putin asked Bolton on camera. “Hopefully, I’ll have some answers for you. But I didn’t bring any more olives,” Bolton responded. “That’s what I thought,” Putin retorted. Bolton reportedly laughed at this. President Donald Trump arrives in Elko, Nevada for the rally on Oct. 20, 2018., Pat Sutphin/The Times-News via AP What is the INF? Despite its name, the INF , which entered into force in 1988, bans the possession of any ground-launched conventional or nuclear-capable missile of any type that can hit targets between 310 and 3,420 miles away. It does not prohibit air- or sea-launched weapons in that range bracket and does not ban land-based research and development of missiles that fall within its prescribed limits. The treaty was unprecedented in many ways, doing away with an entire category of weapons. The Soviets and the United States agreed to scrap eight different types of missiles in total and to allow for a decade’s worth of on-site inspections to verify compliance. US Army Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles, one of the systems that the INF banned., DOD The U.S. military did away with its Pershing Ia short-range ballistic missiles and Pershing II medium-range ballistic missiles, as well as the BGM-109G Gryphon ground-launched version of the Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile. The Soviets dismantled their SS-4 , -5 , -12 , -20 , and -23 short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The road-mobile SS-20 was a particular focus of the INF, as the United States felt its range and multiple warheads combined with its ability to rapidly reposition itself before launch made it a particularly destabilizing threat. It also ended public development of the SSC-X-4 , a ground-launched nuclear-capable cruise missile. The Russians did continue work on a sea-launched version of this weapon. The Kalibr sea-launched cruise missile is derived from that design, which in turn may have served as the basis for another missile known as the SSC-8.

The U.S. says that Russia is in violation of the deal through the deployment of a banned nuclear-capable land-based cruise missile known variously by U.S. government nomenclature as SSC-8, the Russian designation 9M729, and the NATO codename ‘Screwdriver.’ Russia has denied that this weapon system even exists, but it does have ground-based Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile and Iskander-K cruise missiles, which have stated ranges right at the edge of the INF limits. In turn, Russia has accused the United States of failing to uphold the deal through the establishment of the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense site in Romania . The U.S. is working on building another such facility in Poland . The U.S. government has dismissed these claims, saying that the Mk41 vertical launch system launchers the Aegis Ashore uses are not compatible with any missile other than the SM-3 interceptor and that the sites do not have the associated fire control and targeting systems required to launch an INF-banned weapon. It’s worth noting, that on American destroyers and cruisers, a version of the Mk 41 system does deploy the BGM-109 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile. Bolton and other critics of the INF argue that if Russia is in violation of the treaty and has no intention of returning to compliance, that the U.S. military is at a distinct disadvantage by continuing to abide by the agreement. In addition, the United States already has to contend with other countries, most notably China , which do not have follow the deal’s terms at all. “We have no ground-based capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence, and rightfully so, to the treaty that we sign onto, the INF treaty,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, then head of U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2018 . “Over 90 percent of China’s ground-based missiles would violate the treaty,” he had told the House Armed Services Committee the month before . Harris, who is now U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, has developed a close relationship with Trump. An Iskander transporter-erector-launcher on display showing the two types of weapons it can accommodate, a ground-launched cruise missile, at left, and a quasi-ballistic missile, at right., Russian MoD These are valid arguments in principle. If Russia is in violation of the INF, there have to be penalties of some sort, or else the point of having the deal at all is moot. At the same time, the U.S. military following the terms of the INF has indeed left it without any weapons in this category. Weapons with limited utility The real question, however, is whether or not the absence of those weapons puts the United States at as much a strategic disadvantage as Bolton and other critics of the INF would suggest. As noted, the treaty has not limited the development of air- and sea-based missile systems within the prescribed range and also does not prohibit land-based systems with ranges greater than 3,420 miles, leaving the U.S. military with other conventional and nuclear deterrent options . “There are no military requirements we cannot currently satisfy due to our compliance with the INF Treaty,” U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told members of the House Armed Services Committee in 2017 . “While there is a military requirement to prosecute targets at ranges covered by the INF Treaty, those fires do not have to be ground-based.” Selva did say that INF-banned systems would improve the “flexibility and the scale of our intermediate-range strike capabilities,” but did not note whether or not a weapon system in breach of the treaty was the only way to provide that capability. The U.S. military has significant air-launched conventional and nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles with conventional warheads that have similar ranges to systems the treaty banned, but are compliant with the agreement. In terms of nuclear deterrent capability, there are also ground-launched and submarine-launched nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, as well as stockpiles of nuclear gravity bombs . At present, the United States is developing a new nuclear-capable air-launched cruise missile , modified sea-launched nuclear-armed ballistic missiles with “ low-yield warheads ,” and is investigating the potential of fielding a nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile . The latter two weapons are understood to be aimed at countering Russian INF-violating systems. The U.S. military is also pushing ahead rapidly with air-, sea-, and ground-based hypersonic weapons , all of which will offer prompt strike options on short notice against time-sensitive and highly defenses targets, potentially including Russian SSC-8 batteries. The U.S. Army is also developing its own plans to field a new quasi-ballistic missile that has a range that is right below the low end of the INF’s range restrictions, as well as railguns and superguns with extended range capabilites that the treaty doesn’t cover at all. Even if the U.S. government has determined that this layered array of options would not provide sufficient deterrents against Russia’s employment of its INF-breaching missiles, or to Chinese or other foreign systems not subject to the treaty , a comparable U.S. system might not be a realistic answer. By their very definition, the land-based systems the deal covers are “intermediate range” in nature, which would require them to be forward deployed in the same general region as their intended targets. The United States has limited options when it comes to using its own national territory for this purpose and there is no guarantee that the United States would be able to secure approval from allies and partners to deploy nuclear-capable intermediate-range weapons onto their soil , or in the case of many European countries re-deploy these types of missiles, which would immediately make them a target during any potential conflict and could prompt domestic protests. This would apply equally to U.S. allies both in Europe and in the Pacific region. A slide from a US Army briefing in March 2018 showing the ranges of various existing and notional US Army ground-based weapons, including a possible INF-breaking missile system, and comparable Russian systems., US Army Far-reaching effects Though often described as a bilateral deal between the United States and Russia, the INF isn’t just about those two countries. The Soviet Union, not Russia, signed the INF, and Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine all continue to honor it despite now being independent countries. So, eliminating the deal could touch off a major arms race, especially in Ukraine , which is already under significant threat from Russian INF-compliant missiles . The deal has also provided an umbrella of security for smaller NATO members and other American partners in Europe, many of whom might feel the need to develop their own weapon systems or countermeasures or who might simply resent the United States making a unilateral decision. The Trump Administration had reportedly issued an ultimatum of sorts to other members of NATO about the need to come to a consensus about how to approach Russian violations of the INF in December 2017. Russia needs to “get its house in order,” U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said after Trump’s pronouncement in Nevada, adding that his country stood behind the U.S. government’s decision. However, the United States’ apparent decision “raises difficult questions for us and Europe,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said . U.S. relations with Germany have been particularly strained under the Trump Administration. Japan, another important American ally, has expressed hope that the INF can be saved. UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson., Steve Parsons/PA Wire via AP With all this in mind, the U.S. pulling out of the INF treaty would appear to have, at best, uncertain strategic and deterrent benefits, while running the very real risk of creating unnecessary tensions with allies and touching off destabilizing developments in Europe and elsewhere. Russia has already been working in many ways to weaken the international order and challenge long-standing norms, looking to restrict or otherwise challenge the terms of other important arms control regimens. At the same time, it has engaged in a broad and carefully coordinated campaign to spread misinformation and disinformation about its opponents, spreading conspiracy theories and blaming its critics for the exact malign activities it stands accused of engaging in. The Kremlin could seize on the U.S. government pulling out of the INF as an opportunity to try and further drive a wedge between the United States and its European allies and partners or at least try and fuel public discontent about the decision to withdraw from the treaty. On top of that, the Russians could easily finally reveal the SSC-8 as a “new” system developed in response to threats from the United States, giving them an opportunity to try and seize the moral high ground with the public deployment of the weapon system that was at issue to begin with. There is already evidence that the Kremlin is moving in that direction in response to the U.S. government’s apparent INF decision. “The breaking of the INF Treaty’s provisions forces Russia to take measures on ensuring its own security,” Dmitri Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s top spokesperson, said on Oct. 22, 2018 . “If this system [a U.S. missile that doesn’t adhere to the INF] is developed, steps from other countries, and in this case of Russia, on restoring balance in this sphere are needed.” Deputy Chief of the Presidential Executive Office and Presidential Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP What happens now? All this being said, it’s not clear how the United States, or anyone else, can save the INF. Trump and Bolton’s comments, though still not accompanied by the necessary formalities yet, are so definitive as to make it hard to see how the U.S. government can halt the process now or that anyone would want to. If critics argue that remaining party to the deal is farcical if the Kremlin refuses to comply with its terms, then reversing course now could make the U.S. government seem particularly impotent. The Russians themselves are frustrated by the limits imposed by the INF, especially in regards to China, which shares a massive border with Russia that has been the subject of violent territorial disputes in the past. There is evidence that the development of the SSC-8 was, at least in part, a response to more regional threats, rather than as purely a means to challenge the United States and its allies. “Nearly all of our neighbors are developing these kinds of weapons systems,” Putin said in 2013 . The Soviet Union’s decision to conclude the treaty in the first place was “debatable at best,” he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP So, there is a good argument to be made that the treaty constrains the Kremlin a lot more than it does the U.S. government, which has the resources to explore alternative weapons. Maintaining the INF, even in its broken form, could provide a bulwark to return to in the future and limits what the Kremlin can do out in the open. With that in mind, one option that the United States still has for goading the Russians back into compliance would be to find a way to declassify hard evidence of the SSC-8’s existence. So far, the U.S. government has declined to publicly provide significant information on the missile, saying doing so would risk exposing its sources and methods and harm its potential to gather strategic intelligence in the future. Forcing the issue out into the open could change the nature of the public debate and make clear the extent of Russia’s violations of the INF. Above all else, it could keep Russia from declaring that it is only now deploying the missiles in response to the U.S. unilateral withdrawal from the treaty. The United States could strongly reiterate its own compliance by inviting neutral, third-party weapons inspectors to verify that the Aegis Ashore launchers cannot fire banned missiles. A very low-quality scan of an image of the mobile launcher for the Soviet SSC-X-4 ground-launched cruise missile, which may have evolved into the SSC-8, as well as the missile itself in the inset. The United States might consider releasing something similar, if available, to demonstrate the existence of the INF-violating system., DOD Pulling out of the INF could have cascading effects on other treaties, as well. The U.S. and Russia will have to begin negotiating whether to extend the New Strategic Arms Control Treaty, or New START , which sets limits on various strategic nuclear weapons. That deal, which you can read about in more detail here and here , is set to expire in 2021 unless the two parties can agree on extending it, a possibility that seems increasingly questionable. The full extent of the impact of the end of the INF probably won’t be apparent for some time. But since the U.S. government has been preparing for the potential collapse of the treaty over Russia’s violations since at least 2013 , it might not take long for it to begin implementing any of its own contingency plans once the Trump Administration formally withdraws from the deal.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 21, 2018",Belgium Decides To Join The F-35 Club Over Competing Offers For European Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Belgium has picked Lockheed Martin’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter as the winner of a competition to replace the country’s fleet of aging F-16 Viper fighter jets . The Belgians said that the price of the jets heavily influenced their decision, but the need for the aircraft to be able to carry American nuclear weapons may have also been a factor. Regardless, it is an important victory for the Joint Strike Fighter program and a major blow to the competing Eurofighter Typhoon . Belgian Defense Minister Steven Vandeput formally announced the choice during a press conference on Oct. 25, 2018. The Belga News Network in Belgium had previously reported the F-35 had won the competition on Oct. 22, 2018, but the country’s authorities and Lockheed Martin both declined to confirm the details at that time. The Belgian Air Component, the country’s air force, is now set to eventually receive 34 stealthy F-35As to replace around 50 F-16s with deliveries starting in 2023. “We have landed! This government is investing heavily in defense,” Vandeput wrote in a Flemish-language post on Twitter . “With the purchase of F-35A fighter planes … we ensure your safety and that of our military.” The Belgian defense minister subsequently told reporters that the F-35A offer best met the seven criteria the country had laid out, but only identified one, cost. Belgium’s fighter jet replacement program was valued at around $4.14 billion, according to publicly available estimates . Vandeput said that Lockheed Martin’s offer was around $684.5 million less than what his government had budgeted, but did not confirm the total figure. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF In September 2018, the Pentagon signed a deal with Lockheed Martin for 141 more F-35s of all three variants for the U.S. military and foreign partners to the Joint Strike Fighter Program, which saw the F-35A’s unit price fall below $90 million for the first time. At this price point, the Belgian’s would have been able to purchase the 34 of the stealthy fighters for a total cost that was indeed less than the $4.14 billion estimate, even with the inclusion of additional funds for ancillary equipment and support services. The unit price for the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon is generally reported to be more than $100 million . Belgium’s decision finally brings an end to the winding tale of its Air Combat Capability Successor Program, which officially began in 2014 and originally called for a purchase of 40 aircraft. In 2017, Boeing and Saab had withdrawn their offers for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Gripen E respectively. A pair of German Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons., Bundeswehr Boeing complained that the competition was not “a truly level playing field ” and Saab reportedly feared that the Belgian government’s demands for significant support for the aircraft after purchase would violate Swedish neutrality. France’s Dassault had considered making a bid, but ultimately did not, though it did make an informal offer to purchase Rafale fighter jets . The Belgians also rejected proposals to continue upgrading the F-16s instead of buying a new type of aircraft at all. Belgium’s selection of the F-35 does offer multiple benefits beyond the matter of up-front cost. Most obviously, the stealthy jets will offer a significant boost in air combat capability over the country’s F-16s, which it purchased in the 1980s and upgraded to the F-16AM/BM Block 20 MLU standard in the early 2000s. A Belgian F-16AM on a combat mission over Afghanistan in 2013., USAF In addition, the United States and at least six other NATO members are or plan to be flying F-35 variants in the future. In turn, Lockheed Martin has worked with many of them to establish various depot-level maintenance and assembly facilities in Europe. The American defense giant has also indicated that it has offered significant industrial cooperation opportunities to the Belgians, which could further offset the F-35s purchase and sustainment costs. When the Belgian Air Component begins receiving its jets in 2023, it will be able to take advantage of this established and growing support infrastructure, which in turn could result in cost savings on sustaining the aircraft. This is an important consideration, because, while the F-35A’s unit cost may be less than that of the Eurofighter Typhoon, stealth jets, in general, are maintenance intensive and demanding on logistics chains to keep them flying. A Norweigan Air Force F-35A., USAF Belgium’s decision was also likely influenced in part by the need for an aircraft that would support its NATO nuclear weapon sharing requirements . The United States reportedly has between 10 and 20 B61 nuclear gravity bombs at the Belgian Air Component’s base at Kleine Brogel. During a crisis, the U.S. military could release these weapons to the Belgians, who would then conduct the strikes. Belgium’s F-16s are certified to employ the B61, which includes the addition the necessary equipment to arm the weapons in flight. The U.S. Air Force plans to give its F-35As the capability to carry these bombs in the future. There are no plans to certify the Typhoon at present, however. This has already posed a problem for Germany , which is looking to replace its Cold War-era Panavia Tornado combat jets that it presently uses to fulfill its nuclear weapon sharing obligations. This likely was also part of the problem for Saab when it proposed its Gripen E and would’ve presented a hurdle for Dassault’s Rafale, as well. B61 nuclear gravity bombs or training shapes ., DOD For Lockheed Martin, securing the 13th customer for the F-35 is a clear win, especially as the company has lost out to Boeing in competitions for three major U.S. military aviation contracts this year. It also comes at a time when sales to Turkey, a major participant in the Joint Strike Fighter program, are in doubt due to an ongoing dispute centered on the Turkish government’s decision to purchase the Russian S-400 surface to air missile system. On Oct. 24, 2018, Defense News reported that Italy planned to make major cuts to its defense budget in 2019, which could slow that country’s purchase of F-35s , as well. It is similarly a serious loss for the European consortium behind Eurofighter, which includes Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The Typhoon has struggled to secure additional foreign sales since it first began to enter service in European in the early 2000s. In 2016, Kuwait did approve the purchase of 28 Typhoons and the next year Qatar also finalized a deal to purchase 24 of the jets, though. In March 2018, Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of intent to purchase 48 more Eurofighters to add to its existing fleet, but that deal might be in question now given worldwide outcry over the Kingdom’s murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Still, Britain’s BAE Systems had been in charge of offering Typhoon for the Belgian competition and could stand to lose the most after losing out on the deal. In October 2017, BAE cut around 1,400 jobs , more than half of which were from portions of the company related to the Typhoon. Slow sales of the fighter jets, combined with a slowing British economy overall , were cited as among the key factors in that decision. It remains to be seen what exact impact the loss of the potential sale to Belgium will have on the future of the Typhoon, or BAE’s aviation divisions, in the near term. But after years of delays and controversies , with the Belgian deal in hand, the future of the Joint Strike Fighter program only seems brighter.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 31, 2018","B-2 That Made Emergency Landing In Colorado Had Engine Out, Couldn’t Talk To Tower: Audio","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the wee hours of the morning, around 3:20am local time, a B-2A Spirit flying high over Colorado on a training flight from its home base at Whiteman AFB in Missouri declared an in-flight emergency. The aircraft would have to land immediately and the closest airport was in Colorado Springs. Hours after safely touching down, the bat-winged bomber—the most expensive aircraft ever made—was photographed sitting alone on the apron at Peterson AFB, which is colocated with the civilian airport. It was a strange sight indeed, especially considering these aircraft traditionally only fly out of four highly secure air bases on anything that comes close to resembling a regular basis . What brought the B-2 crew’s mission to a sudden halt remained a mystery throughout the day, but now we know at least one major cause. Audio recorded of Colorado Springs Airport tower from the time of the incident has emerged on Facebook. In it, the controller states that the jet has lost its #4 engine. In addition, the crew could not communicate with the tower directly, which could be a sign of additional complications. In the end, the most advanced aircraft ever put into production ended up getting cleared to land via a visual signal from the tower’s handheld light gun. Here is a direct link to the Facebook posting in case it doesn’t show up automatically below: Engine failures do happen, but with certain airframes, flying on just three of four engines can involve elevated risk. Flying wings in particular, due to their lack of vertical tails and large rudders to counter-act asymmetric thrust, can be uniquely vulnerable to the impacts engine loss. This is especially true when two engines are lost on the same side at the same time. Aircraft handling characteristics and safe operating envelope margins can narrow dramatically under these types of conditions and we really don’t know what the B-2’s limits are in regards to them. Multiple sources also report that at least one of the pilots was administered oxygen by the emergency response crews after the jet was safely on the ramp. It is not clear if this was due to the stressful situation or because of larger systems issues experienced during the incident. Smoke in the cockpit could also be a reason for administering oxygen after landing, but we just don’t know the exact circumstances around this part of the event. Geoffrey Marr Geoffrey Marr Photos taken of the B-2 on the ramp in Colorado show the aircraft’s auxiliary air inlet doors open on the left side and closed on the right. This is unusual. We don’t know if the right-side inlet doors were stuck closed during landing—they are open during terminal phases of flight—or if the left side failed to close upon shutting down. Regardless, thankfully everyone was safe and a very low-density, high-value asset also came out unscathed. The incident comes nearly six months after a B-1B made an emergency landing at Midland International Air and Space Port in Midland, Texas after experiencing a severe engine fire. The crew had decided to eject from the stricken plane, but the ejection sequence failed for the first crewmen that was to be shot out of the cockpit. The crew then decided to make an emergency landing as they wouldn’t leave their stuck comrade in the aircraft to die after they ejected. Everyone survived the incident but issues with the ejection systems on some of the B-1s remain unmitigated . We will report back when we discover more details surrounding the B-2’s emergency diversion to Colorado Springs. Update: 11am PDT— It’s worth mentioning that the fact the tower could not see the aircraft as it was on final approach and couldn’t track it farther out may point to the possibility that its lighting system was offline as well as its transponder.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 19, 2018",Navy Rushes To Get Littoral Combat Ships Anti-Ship Missiles They Desperately Need (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is hoping to have the first of its Littoral Combat Ships armed with its new Naval Strike Missile months ahead of schedule. This would mean USS Detroit would have the added firepower available during her upcoming deployment in 2019. Still, there are other challenges to getting these ships ready for actual missions and there are still questions about their ability to operate in even a mid-level threat environment , with or without the added missiles. A Raytheon executive provided the update on the Navy’s acquisition of the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) in an interview with Defense News on the sidelines of the Euronaval exposition in Paris, France, which began on Oct. 23, 2018. The Massachusetts headquartered defense contractor, in cooperation with Norwegian firm Kongsberg, won the service’s competition to provide an Over-The-Horizon Weapon System (OHWS) for both the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) and its future frigates in May 2018. “In that initial over-the-horizon award for LCS, the installation timeline was on a two-year delivery cycle,” Octavio Babuca, in charge of business development for the NSM, told Defense News . “But we are now working with the Navy to support an accelerated timeline to the deploying to littoral combat ships. That is mid-to-late 2019 time window.” The Freedom -class LCS Detroit is slated to be the first ship to receive the new missiles. At present, the plan is to install two four-round deck-mounted launchers on the ship’s bow in front of the main superstructure. A similar arrangement will be available for the Independence -class types. Earlier proposals for both classes had included the possibility of adding two retractable six-round launchers on the top of the ship’s superstructure. Raytheon concept art showing the planned bow-mounted launchers for the NSM on both Independence -class LCSs, at left, and Freedom -class variants, at right., Raytheon The NSMs will be a welcome addition to the LCSs, which remain woefully under-armed. The main onboard weapons on both classes at present are a 57mm rapid-fire gun and a launcher able to fire RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). The ships can accommodate armed MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters and unarmed MQ-8B drones to provide additional firepower and situational awareness. Since July 2018, Detroit has also served as the testbed for the Surface-to-Surface Missile Module (SSMM), a part of the planned add-on Surface Warfare (SUW) mission package, which gives the ship the ability to fire AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles. This system, however, is again primarily for close-in defense against swarms of small boats or similar threats . All told, both Freedom – and Independence -class ships in their present configuration lack the ability to operate in anything but lower threat environments. The Freedom -class LCS USS Detroit ., USN The NSMs would give the ships a real, over-the-horizon strike capability that they desperately need. The missiles, which you can read about in more detail here , also have a limited secondary land-attack capability. This will allow LCSs to engage both hostile ships and targets ashore without having to carry two separate types of weapons. It’s a capability that’s been a long time coming, as well. In 2014, the Navy actually test fired NSMs for the flight deck on the stern of the Independence -class USS Coronado . That same ship served as a testbed for a proposed RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile installation two years later. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UuMU-lc8DZw Unfortunately, the Navy still faces hurdles in getting truly useful combat capability out of the ships. Maintenance issues , manning and readiness problems , and the decision to relegate the first four examples to training and research and development roles exclusively, combined to force the service to give up any hope of deploying any of the dozen LCSs its has on an operational mission in 2018. There had been plans to send two Independence -class ships to Singapore and one Freedom -class LCS to Bahrain. The latter deployment would have seen the LCS’s debut in the Middle East, where littoral threats abound . The stated logic of the program from the very beginning was to offer the ability forward deploy the vessels for regional missions to help reduce the strain on larger surface combatants and help free them up for other, higher priority operations. “We are on track with the 2016 [chief of naval operations] review of the LCS … and I think we will see the first deployments next year and then happening continuously after that,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Richard Brown, in charge of Naval Surface Force Pacific, told Defense News in August 2018. “I will have the ships through their maintenance, and the blue crews and gold crews through their basic phase to support deployments next year. So, that’s really exciting – something we’ve been driving towards for a long time.” The Independence -class USS Coronado after recieving launchers for the RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile as a part of a test., USN Any difficulties in accelerating the schedule of adding the NSMs onto Detroit , which originally wasn’t supposed to occur until sometime in 2020, could prompt the Navy to either scrub her deployment or send her out with the same limited arsenal as before. There’s also no clear timeline for when any of the other 10 LCSs will receive the missiles, which means other Freedom or Independence class ships could be headed out on sorties in their existing configurations with limited combat capabilities. Even with the added weaponry, it’s not clear how useful the LCS would be in an even mid-level threat environment and whether they could conduct operations under those conditions independent of a larger surface task force. The LCSs lack any sort of robust organic area air defense capability and have limited close-in defenses, relying primarily on the lone RAM launcher to provide a defense against air- and surface-launched anti-ship missiles. Freedom -class and Independence -class ships both also have electronic support measures systems and launchers for anti-missile decoys to help spot potential threats and defeat them, as well. The video below shows the Danish firm Term’s C-Guard decoy system, which is found on Freedom-class LCS variants. “Survivability testing and preliminary analyses on both LCS variants continue to demonstrate that neither LCS variant is survivable in high intensity combat,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation noted in its review of the program’s activities in 2017 . “As designed, the LCS lacks redundancy and the vertical and longitudinal separation of vital equipment found in other combatants. These features are required to reduce the likelihood that a single hit will result in loss of propulsion, combat capability, and the ability to control damage and restore system operation.” All of this has left the Navy itself often doubting what jobs the LCSs are actually suited for after all this time. In April 2018, the Pentagon said it was looking into the possibility of using the ships to support counter-narcotics operations in Latin American, a low-risk mission set that does not require stand-off weapons such as the NSMs. There have also been persistent problems with the plans for modular mission modules, such as the aforementioned SSMM, which were supposed to allow the ships to rapidly transition from one mission set to another, as necessary. Now, the Navy has decided to effectively permanently install certain modules on individual ships, eliminating this flexibility. An official infographic that shows, at left, the added capabilities that are supposed to come along with the long-awaited surface warfare , mine countermeasures , and anti-submarine warfare mission modules., USN The Navy’s requirements for the forthcoming FFG(X) frigates include the ability to fire NSMs, as well as a surface-to-air missile capability, added sensors, and more, which you can read about in depth here . The survivability and shipbuilding standards are also higher for these future ships, which will further improve their combat capability over the LCS. Especially notable, Lockheed Martin, which builds the Freedom -class LCS, is pitching a derivative of that ship for the FFG(X) program. However, at Euronaval, the American defense contractor revealed plans to entirely revise the propulsion system to give the ship added speed and power generation capacity, as well as add in redundancy to address survivability issues such as those the Pentagon has raised with regards to both LCS variants. These demands are specifically to address the perpetual shortcomings of the LCS design, which the service still plans to buy more than 30 of in the coming years. Congress has actually increased the total planned purchases to 35, despite the ever increasingly clear limitations of both LCS designs. Stuck with the LCSs it already has, and with dozens more on the way, it’s not wrong for the Navy to want to give the ships added firepower to improve their potential utility in actual combat. Unfortunately, even with the addition of the NSMs, it’s still unclear how close the ships are to meeting any of the service’s often wildly ambitious expectations for the ships even a decade after USS Freedom ‘s commissioning. Update: 10/26/2018— After we published this piece, Lockheed Martin, who manufactures the Freedom -class LCS variant, reached out to us with the following statement: Regarding the mission set required for the LCS, it is designed for three core missions – mine countermeasures, surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare (replacing three ships – MCM, PC, FFG-7), and the features and capabilities are in place today for these mission sets.  Starting with LCS 5 (LCS Block Buy Ships), Lockheed Martin updated the ship design incorporating structural improvements for survivability and extended service life. We are also continuing to evolve and add new capabilities. For example, we are updating the COMBATSS-21 combat management system derived from Aegis Baseline 9 for currently fielded ships and future ones.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 3, 2020",Boeing Is Developing A New High-Speed Apache Gunship With A Pusher Prop On Its Tail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has revealed that it is testing a compound helicopter derivative of its AH-64E Apache Guardian that would be faster, have longer range, and be more fuel efficient than existing gunships. The announcement comes as the Army is exploring the possibility of a new attack and reconnaissance rotorcraft and amid reports that the service may need to dramatically upgrade its existing Apaches to keep them capable and relevant until the armed versions of whatever design wins the Future Vertical Lift competition reach full operational capability. Jane’s 360 was among the first to report the details about the new helicopter development, which Boeing is presently calling the AH-64E Block 2 Compound. The gunship will feature an enlarged main wing, revised engine exhaust arrangement, large vertical tail fin, and a rear-mounted pusher propeller. The design may also feature a new, rigid rotor system , which is a standard feature on other compound helicopter designs. Boeing estimates that the revised configuration will give the helicopter 50 percent more speed and range and allow it to be 24 percent more fuel efficient during flight, according to Jane’s . The current AH-64E has a top speed in level flight of more than 170 miles per hour and has a range of around 300 miles. The Chicago-headquartered planemaker says it has already built a one third scale model of the helicopter, which is presently undergoing wind tunnel tests at the company’s facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Those experiments are supposed to wrap up in January 2019. The new development may reuse aspects of an earlier “Advanced Apache” that Boeing first detailed in 2014 , which came to be known as either AH-64X or AH-64F. This version would have also been a compound type featuring improved engines, larger wings, retractable landing gear, and a tail rotor that could articulate 90 degrees in order to provide forward thrust during level flight. In 2016, the Army had said it was not interested in this concept . A chart from a 2014 Boeing presentation showing an artist’s conception of the then proposed compound Apache design., Boeing The most obvious prospective customer for this new Apache derivative would be the U.S. Army, which operates around 235 AH-64E Guardians and more than 500 older AH-64D Longbows. The service is also in the process of both buying more Apache Guardians and upgrading the systems on board those helicopters to make them deadlier over land and water, which you can read about in more detail here . In June 2018, the service announced plans to select two competing rotorcraft designs for a fly-off, a program known as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype ( FARA CP ), which could potentially lead to purchases of more than 500 aircraft to perform a range of “armed reconnaissance, light attack, and security” tasks. The Apache already owns what the Army refers to as “ attack-reconnaissance ” mission set, having taken on increased scout and reconnaissance roles after the retirement of the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopter. A standard US Army AH-64E Apache Guardian., US Army The Army has specified few solid requirements for what it is looking for in terms of performance for the new attack and reconnaissance rotorcraft, but has said that it wants them to have a top speed of around 230 miles per hour . If the AH-64E Block 2 Compound does get a 50 percent boost in top speed over the standard Apache Guardian, it could be traveling at more than 250 miles per hour. An Apache-derived platform would present a lower-risk option when compared to newer, clean-sheet designs such as the Sikorsky S-97 Raider . The compound AH-64 would also have at least some commonality with the Army’s existing Apaches, which would allow the service to make use of existing maintenance and logistics pipelines to some degree, and could make Boeing’s offering even more attractive. This is especially true when it comes to receiving funding from Congress. At the same time, the Army is looking ahead to acquiring an entire new slate of helicopters to replace all of its existing fleets, including the AH-64s, as part of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. For that competition, Boeing has paired with Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, to offer the SB>1 Defiant compound coaxial transport helicopter, along with an as yet unnamed gunship derivative, for the FVL-Medium portion of that program. Those helicopters are supposed to begin arriving by the end of the 2020s. However, the Army is reportedly increasingly of the view that it will need a significantly upgraded Apache to ensure the helicopters are still combat-capable in higher risk environments by the time they reach the end of their service lives. At present, the service hopes to keep the gunships flying through the middle of the century . “Even using the most aggressive plan they have to replace that fleet [the AH-64s] with something of the Future Vertical Lift family, there will have to be another evolution of some sort to keep the aircraft sustainable, ready and relevant to support the warfighter out to that time frame,” Shane Openshaw, Boeing’s top Apache program official, told Rotor & Wing International magazine on Oct. 24, 2018. “If you look at what kind of capabilities were incorporated as the Apache evolved from an A to a D and the D to an E, we’re going to be thinking along the same lines,” he added. The compound design shows that Boeing is also pursuing far more ambitious concepts that might appeal to the Army as general replacements for at least a portion of its Apaches, too. It wouldn’t be the first time the service has explored the possibility of adopting a compound helicopter gunship, either. Famously, or infamously, in the 1960s and 1970s, the Army evaluated Lockheed’s AH-56A Cheyenne , a then-state-of-the-art design that was fast, maneuverable, and heavily armed with a mix of automatic cannons, machine guns and grenade launchers, unguided rockets, and the still relatively new TOW guided anti-tank missile .  A combination of mishaps, technical problems, and political machinations, all help conspire to kill the program in 1972. The Army did almost immediately initiate a new attack helicopter development program, which eventually led to the introduction of the AH-64A in 1986. In the interim, the service settled on a succession of AH-1 Cobra gunship variants, which were less advanced, but were also less complicated and cheaper to operate and maintain than the AH-56A would have been. In the mid-2000s, the Army also took over testing of a compound derivative of the UH-60 Black Hawk, the Piasecki Aircraft X-49A SpeedHawk , from the U.S. Navy. The AVX Aircraft Company also pitched a compound version of the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior to the Army before it canceled plans for a replacement scout helicopter altogether. AVX is now offering its own compound designs for the FVL program. If Boeing can sell the Army on a compound version of the Apache, it could put the gunship version of the SB>1 Defiant in an awkward position, offering a more cost-effective helicopter with some of its capabilities that would be available sooner, or even in service already. Depending on how extensive the upgrades are, it might be possible to offer the compound features as an upgrade to existing AH-64s, as well. If it is possible to convert older AH-64s into compound versions of the Apache, it could offer an attractive way for any of the 15 other operators of the helicopter worldwide to improve their own capabilities. With more than 1,000 Apaches in service around the world, it could be ga lucrative opportunity for Boeing, too. The improved capabilities the compound design offers could still be a major selling point on their own for any country looking to be new attack helicopters, whether or not they already operate AH-64s. Boeing hopes that the Block 2 Compound derivative will only cost 20 percent more than a new AH-64E. As of 2018 , the Army is paying around $33.6 million each for new Apache Guardian it buys, so the new compound version could have a final price tag of a little more than $40 million. An AH-64E Apache Guardian bound for the Indian Air Force, one of the newest operators of the type., Boeing India “We have at least 10 more in the pipeline now,” Boeing’s Openshaw told Rotor & Wing on Oct. 24, 2018, referring to the possible number of new foreign Apache customers. “Some are window shoppers. Some are getting serious. They’re justifying the requirement to those who hold the purse strings, those who make decisions to support their respective departments of defense.” Regardless of who ultimately expresses an interest in buying this compound version of the Apache, we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on how this potentially impressive design continues to evolve. For the Army, it might lead the way for the service to finally adopt a compound attack helicopter more than four decades after the cancellation of the Cheyenne and it could disrupt two major aircraft tenders on the horizon.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 21, 2020","Navy’s Next Gen Jammer Is Three Pods, Not One, And Competition For One Of Them Just Heated Up","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has awarded two separate contracts to L3 and Northrop Grumman, each worth more than $35 million, to continue developing prototypes of the Next Generation Jammer-Low Band jamming pod, or NGJ-LB, for the service’s EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. The deals came after a top U.S. government watchdog quietly rejected protests from Raytheon, which is already building the separate Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band pod, or NGJ-MB, against the service’s decision to select these firms. From everything we’ve seen so far, the competition surrounding the over-arching Next Generation Jammer program, which is set to eventually include three different types of pods, is already hot and looks set to only become more so as time goes on. In August 2018 , it had emerged that the Navy had picked L3 and a separate team consisting of Northrop Grumman and the Harris Corporation to continue with a technology demonstration ahead of choosing a single team to build the NGJ-LB. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) rejected Raytheon’s subsequent protests on Oct. 22, 2018, which cleared the way for the formal contracts on Oct. 25, 2018. The service also rejected another offer from an industry team consisting of Lockheed Martin and Cobham , but neither of those companies filed a complaint. “We’ve been down-selected on Next-Generation Jammer Low Band,” Kathy Warden, President, Chief Operating Officer and CEO Elect of Northrop Grumman, had proudly reiterated in a conference call with reporters to discuss the companies third-quarter earnings on Oct. 24, 2018. The plan as it stands now is to have both L3 and Northrop Grumman and Harris supply prototype pods for testing at the Navy’s Facility for Antenna and Radar cross section Measurement, or FARM , at Patuxent River in Maryland. An F/A-18E Super Hornet will act as the surrogate aircraft through a series of tests, carrying the pods on the aircraft’s centerline, or number six, station. Based on the results of this evaluation, the service plans to pick a single design for further development. A Navy briefing slide outlining plans for the low-, mid-, and high-band pods., USN The low-band jammer will be an extremely important addition to the EA-18G’s capability set. These aircraft, which have been operational in the Navy service since 2009 and joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 2017, have been using upgraded versions of the AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods, also known as the Tactical Jamming System (TJS), which Northrop Grumman developed first for the EA-6B Prowler dating back to a half a century ago. Since then, the AN/ALQ-99 has proven to be a capable system, with two separate variants to jam high- and low-band signals including radars and communications nodes. The pods feed into a central processing system installed inside the aircraft, which has the ability to classify and direction-find threat emitters, giving the complete system a secondary signals intelligence capability. The EA-18Gs often carry the low-band version of the pod on the centerline position. You can tell the difference between the two because the low-band version has somewhat of an hourglass shape cross-section while the high-band pods are more rectangular shaped. An RAAF briefing slide showing the interior layout of the two types of AN/ALQ-99 pod., RAAF Unfortunately, these aging pods have also had persistent reliability issues , including in their low-band functionality . In 1998, the Navy hired Northrop Grumman to update the AN/ALQ-99s, as well as the Prowler’s other systems, as part of the massive Improved Capability III (ICAP III) upgrade program. On Oct. 17, 2018, Northrop Grumman received a separate contract worth more than $697 million to continue upgrading and other support for the existing AN/ALQ-99s. Still, the Navy had put off developing a true replacement for the ALQ-99 TJS for years, finding the system sufficient for supporting the kind of operations the United States has been engaged in primarily since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. During sorties in Afghanistan and Iraq, EA-6Bs and EA-18Gs have notably used their pods to prevent militants from remotely detonating improvised explosive devices . A graphic showing various systems on the EA-18G Growler and a typical mission loadout, including the three AN/ALQ-99 pods., RAAF Prowlers also took part in the opening stages of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and Growlers flew near Libya during the NATO-led intervention there in 2011, providing essential electronic attack and suppression of enemy air defenses capabilities. More recently, in April 2018, a Marine EA-6B helped clear the way for Air Force B-1 bombers to fire Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range ( JASSM-ER ) cruise missiles at chemical weapons facilities in Syria. But there is an increasing need for a more capable system now that the U.S. military is focusing more on preparing to fight potential high-end conflicts against near-peer opponents, such as Russia or China. Both of those countries have invested significant resources into the development of improved sensors to support their increasingly complex integrated air defense networks and extensive electronic warfare systems , themselves. A Chinese JY-27A low-frequency radar, which that county claims may be able to detect stealthy aircraft., Imaginechina via AP Australia is also in line to receive the various Next Generation Jammer pods and any future EA-18G customers would likely buy the different systems along with the aircraft. The more reliable “NGJ-LB will address AEA [Airborne Electronic Attack] capability and sufficiency gaps against enemy threats operating in the lower frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum,” the Navy’s budget request for the system for the 2019 Fiscal Year explained . “NGJ-LB will provide the ability to effectively engage enemy threats from increased stand-off distances, employ increased capacity (number of jamming assignments) against enemy targets, and support agile employment by operators.” The NGJ-LB will likely feature a core jamming system that uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology over previous directional antennas, which will give Growlers greater flexibility and power to engage numerous hostile emitters at one time and do so more precisely at longer ranges. Raytheon’s NGJ-MB pod, which is further along in development, also uses an AESA-based system to provide similarly improved capabilities against threats in the mid-band spectrum. An exploded view of the components inside Raytheon’s NGJ-MB pod., USN The added precision the AESA-based system offers means the jammer is less likely to scramble friendly emitters near the target area. The range factor will also be especially important given that the EA-18Gs are non-stealthy platforms that would incur increasingly greater risks the deeper they would have to fly towards or into hostile airspace in order to be effective at supporting other air combat aircraft. The low-band pod will also be ideally suited to jamming longer-range, lower-frequency radars, which may be able to detect stealthy aircraft. This is also part of the reason why the Navy sees the EA-18Gs as an essential companion to its F-35C Joint Strike Fighters. The Navy expects the Growlers to primarily perform so-called “Modified Escort Jamming,” which involves the aircraft flying safely outside of the known range of enemy surface-to-air missiles. However, the range of these threats and the radars and other sensors that are associated with them are only increasing, which requires the increased range of the Next Generation Jammers. A graphical representation of how the EA-18G will fit in with other electronic attack capabilities, including the AESA radars on board the F-22A Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter stealth fighters, the electronic warfare suite on the EC-130H Compass Call jamming plane, and the capabilities offered by the Miniature Air Launched Decoy-Jammer ( MALD-J ). The Air Force plans to replace with the EC-130Hs in the coming years with a new jamming platform ., GAO So Growlers can blind or confuse low-frequency radars from standoff ranges as the F-35s approach, then the F-35’s own tactical electronic warfare suite can deal with any higher-frequency threats that may get a glimpse of them close up, including jamming fire control radars that operate at higher frequencies. Of course, their stealthy shape and coatings are optimized to drastically degrade the effectiveness of those systems as well. The Growlers will also provide support to the service’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets using a different set of combined tactics and in lower threat environments. It’s also worth noting that Growlers will work in concert with other new systems that can distribute the electronic warfare fight over a greater area. These potentially include jammer packing loitering air-launched drones and most importantly, Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD). The Navy has taken the reigns of that program with their MALD-X, which mixes the capabilities of MALD-J, which carries an onboard jammer, with new possibilities for the modular missile-like system. You can read all about MALD-X here . MALD-X, USN The Navy also wants the final Next Generation Jammer pod configurations to have an “open” modular architecture both when it comes to the physical systems inside and the software running them. This will help the service rapidly develop updated systems to respond to emerging threats in the future and quickly slot them into the existing shell. These additional capabilities could include giving the system a means to launch remote cyber attacks on hostile air defense networks , spoof the signature of the Growler or other friendly aircraft, conduct more advanced signals intelligence missions, or even destroy enemy emitters with a high-powered burst of microwave energy . AESA arrays also have a latent, but downright incredible communications capability that is just now being more deeply explored by the services. As noted, the NGB-LB will only be one part of a three-part system, which could ultimately see EA-18Gs carrying low-, mid-, and high-band jamming pods potentially from three separate contractors all at once. This will give a single aircraft improved flexibility to respond to multiple threats across different bands at once and allow the crew to quickly shift tactics in case hostile radars and other emitters try to modulate their signals to try to avoid being jammed. An overview of the Growler’s electronic warfare capabilities., USN The Navy has been pursuing this incremental approach with an eye toward being able to relatively rapidly field each system in succession since the mid-2000s, initially referring to the three systems as Next Generation Jammer Increments 1, 2, and 3. However, developmental hurdles are already threatening to delay the deployment of NGJ-MB, which may have influenced the service’s decision to go with another contractor for the low-band system. Though the Navy had a reasonable assessment of the maturity of the technology required for the pod and the jamming system therein, “the performance expectations of the NGJ Mid-Band system pushed the limits of power generation and jamming capability while constraining the materials and components to stricter size and weight requirements than the previous systems,” a report that the Department of Defense’s Office of the Inspector General released in March 2018 explained. In short, fitting everything inside a suitably aerodynamic pod that meshes well with the design of the EA-18G had proven complicated despite a good understanding of the various factors at play. One of Raytheon’s prototype NGJ-MB pods underneath a Calspan Gulfstream business jet during testing., Calspan For one, Raytheon’s mid-band jamming pod, also known as the AN/ALQ-249(V)1, has a complex system involving two pairs of doors that open up while the system is active to allow air to drive the built-in ram air turbine in order to provide the necessary power. The older AN/ALQ-99s have a small propeller at the front for this purpose, which is simpler in its basic concept, but also produces added drag. Of course, when the doors on Raytheon’s pod are open, they’re also producing extra drag. The design also renders much of the center section of the pod unusable for jammers or related systems, which pushes the AESA antennas to the front and the back. This could limit the ability of the system to engage emitters situated on either side of the aircraft at long-ranges. The heavier and larger the pods are and the more they impact both the maneuverability and range of the Growlers carrying them. This could prove to be problematic since there are no plans as of yet to give the EA-18Gs conformal fuel tanks or more powerful engines . The system’s size and general configuration also has to be set up in a way that doesn’t interfere with any other electronics on the aircraft. The AN/ALQ-99s themselves required significant modifications to prevent the jammers from degrading the functionality of the plane’s own AESA radar and other systems, according to a 2010 GAO report . Jamie Hunter via USN During the 2017 Fiscal Year, the Navy uncovered “deficiencies in modeling, assumptions, and methodologies used in the design of the pod structure,” the service’s budget request for the 2019 Fiscal Year noted . “These deficiencies are driving a redesign of the pod structure, but subsystem design, development, manufacturing, integration, and test are continuing independent of the pod structure redesign effort.” These issues have pushed development of the NGJ-MB into 2020 at least. The Navy’s original plan had been for the pods to reach initial operational capability that year and it’s not clear whether or not that will happen. In July 2018, U.S. Navy Captain Michael Orr, the service’s Program Manager for the overarching Airborne Electronic Attack program, told Breaking Defense that the “Next Generation Jammer” would be operational by 2022, but it’s not clear if he was talking about the mid- or low-band system. The Next Generation Jammer program timeline as it existed in 2013., GAO The Navy had wanted to have the low-band system ready by 2022, but it’s not clear how much its schedule is tethered to the development of the mid-band pod, if at all. The still notional high-band system could come as early as 2024. But what is clear is that the Navy is looking to push ahead as fast as it can to acquire the various Next Generation Jammer pods in order to give its EA-18Gs a major boost in capability they already been waiting on for some time. The introduction of competition across the various pods that make up the entire system should only help this effort and it could be an especially big break for Northrop Grumman, which can also leverage its past experience with supporting the AN/ALQ-99 system as a whole. If they end up besting L3 and producing the low-band Next Generation Pod, it will keep the firm at the forefront of the Navy’s electronic warfare portfolio decades to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 2, 2022",Army’s Newest Airborne Unit Gets Second-Hand But Air Droppable USMC LAV-25 Armored Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time in more than two decades, the U.S. Army’s storied 82nd Airborne Division has its own unit equipped with light armored vehicles. The paratroopers acquired a small number of LAV-25A2 wheeled armored vehicles from the U.S. Marine Corps to help provide additional firepower as they continue to wait for the results of the Mobile Protected Firepower program , or MPF. In the works for more than a year, the 82nd stood up Company A, 4th Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment within the division’s 1st Brigade Combat Team at a ceremony at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on Oct. 26, 2018 . The 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles reportedly still wore their Marine Corps markings at the time of the activation ceremony. “We now have the capability to counter light armored threats on the battlefield with something more than missile systems,” U.S. Army Captain Aram Hatfield, Company A’s commander, told the service’s own reporters on Oct. 26, 2018. “There’s nothing in the division right now with that amount of firepower and speed.” In 1997, the 82nd inactivated 3rd Battalion, 73rd Armor Regiment, which operated the M551 Sheridan , an air-droppable light tank. Since then, the units within the division have relied entirely on a mix of Humvees with TOW anti-tank guided missiles and man-portable Javelin anti-tank missiles to provide their own defense against armored threats. The 8×8 LAV-25 , which is based on the Swiss MOWAG Piranha , has been in Marine Corps service since 1983. In the mid-2000s, that service introduced the A2 variant, which features improved armor, an updated suspension, a new infrared sight for the vehicle’s gunner, and a revised automatic fire suppression system. The vehicle’s main gun is a turreted 25mm M242 Bushmaster cannon, the same weapon found on the Army’s Bradley Fighting Vehicles . There is also a coaxial 7.62mm M240 machine gun in the turret and another one mounted on top. Though the Marines use the vehicle primarily for scout and reconnaissance functions, it can operate like small armored personnel carrier. In addition to its three-person crew, it can carry six fully equipped troops. US Marine Corps LAV-25A2s., USMC “This gives us the advantage to suppress the enemy as they come up with vehicles that are larger than ours by providing a support by fire element,” U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Steven Dobbins, head of the 3rd Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, also said at the activation ceremony. This unit, another assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, has mostly Humvees and other light vehicles and expects to operate closely together with the new LAV-25A2 company. As the U.S. military as a whole continues to realign itself to be prepared for possible major conflicts with “great power” competitors, such as Russia and China, the Army has seen a renaissance in interest in its traditional land warfare capabilities . Adding armored vehicles back into the 82nd, which stands ready to perform what is known as the Global Response Force (GRF) mission and has elements on constant alert for rapid deployment anywhere in the world within hours, is well in line with this shift in priorities away from lower risk conflicts. “This is a big deal!” Hatfield said. “This is a capability the Army had gotten rid of and now we’re starting to bring it back.” It’s been a circuitous path for the 82nd to get the LAV-25s, though. The most immediate question is why the division chose these vehicles over a variant of the Army’s own Stryker series , which is derived from MOWAG’s more modern Piranha III design.  The service has also been beefing up its Strykers with new 30mm cannons and mounted Javelin anti-tank missiles, too. The latest iteration of the Stryker with the new 30mm cannon-equipped turret., Joseph Trevithick The problem, unfortunately, is that the Strykers were too heavy to airdrop, to begin with, and have only become more so as they have gained new features and capabilities. The 82nd will also be able to fit more of the smaller, lighter LAV-25s into U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III airlifters for operations where there is a suitable landing zone. It’s these features that have led the division, as well as the Army as a whole, to flirt multiple times with adopting the LAV-25 since the 1980s. The service was originally a partner with the Marines on the program, planning to purchase its own variant, known as the XM1047. But the Army eventually dropped the idea, which eventually led to the introduction of the Stryker. An XM1047 prototype., GM via WarWheels.net When the Army began moving to retire the Sheridan in the 1990s, it briefly acquired a company’s worth of LAV-25s for the 82nd to evaluate. The division was also looking at acquiring the XM8 Buford light tank as a replacement for the M551s. In 2014, the concept resurfaced yet again, in a RAND report , which noted that the Army had already conducted significant high- and low-altitude airdrop evaluations of older LAV-25 versions. In late 2016, members of the 82nd finally began training on the vehicles ahead of finally creating an actual unit with the light armored vehicles. Members of the 82nd Airborne Division’s Company B, 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment unpack a LAV-25A2 after an airdrop test in 2018., US Army It’s not a perfect solution, of course. Though airdrop capable, the LAV-25 is still relatively lightly armored and its 25mm main gun also lacks the punch to defeat increasingly thicker skinned opponents . It may be possible for the Army to add additional firepower onto the vehicles, either in the form of mounted anti-tank missiles or a larger main gun. General Motors, the original licensed manufacturer in the United States, did offer an add-on TOW launcher for the original LAV-25. The Marines also have a variant with a completely different TOW-equipped turret. A remote weapon station that integrates Javelin, such as the one the Army is beginning to deploy on its Strykers , might be another option.

GM said that the vehicles in this configuration still remained compatible with the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) airdrop method., GM via WarWheels.net All of this will add weight and bulk, though, which could defeat the purpose of the 82nd acquiring the lighter LAV-25s in the first place. It is not clear whether the division plans to stand up one company for each of its four brigade combat teams. The division is also supposed to eventually receive a new light tank from the Army’s MPF competition , but that program has run into similar difficulties when it comes to trying to blend the operational requirements within the weight limits, which you can read about in more detail here . Most importantly, the MPF design no longer has to be air-droppable, which also helps explain why the Army decided to acquire the LAV-25s for airborne operations. “I would like these guys to be experts on these vehicles and experts on the doctrine that we are going to develop,” Hatfield added. “The vast majority of them have never been on an armored vehicle before.” However, the 82nd’s armored capabilities evolve from here on out, the LAV-25s will help provide a solid foundation and one that’s been more than 20 years in the making.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 19, 2020",Army Chopper Pilots Fly With Digital Co-Pilot That Could Revolutionize Flight As We Know It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army pilots have flown in an experimental, optionally-manned Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, albeit in an indirect fashion. The flight test was part of a U.S. military program seeking to add-in a semi-autonomous “co-pilot” that can reduce the workload on aviators, improve their mission performance, and offer new failsafes in case of an emergency. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in cooperation with the Army’s Aviation Development Directorate and Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, conducted this experiment under the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System ( ALIAS ) program on Oct. 17, 2018 . The flight, which took place at Fort Eustis, Virginia, gave the Army personnel an opportunity to evaluate the semi-autonomous system on board the modified S-76B, also known as the Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft (SARA). Sikorsky’s test pilots had previously been the only ones to fly the helicopter since testing began in 2013 . “The reason this type of technology is important, is to reduce workload, the piloting workload and let the mission crews concentrate on what they’re really there to do, which is to either execute the MEDEVAC [medical evacuation], the close air support mission, or whatever they’re there to do,” Dave Braden, the Program Manager for the U.S. Marine Corps’ portion of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, which also has a stake in ALIAS, said of the latest test. “Rather than concentrate on moving controls, they can concentrate on what really needs to be done.” The SARA test bed had what Sikorsky calls its Matrix Technology , which provides autonomous functionality for both hardware and software, tapping into existing mechanical and electronic control systems. With this additional equipment installed, the helicopter will perform set mission plans that aviators can program using a small hand-held tablet. Those same individuals can quickly modify the route or other parameters on the fly during flight, as well. Sikorsky’s modifications leave the helicopter’s main systems intact, though, in case, for whatever reason, the pilots need to take direct control of the aircraft. During the October 2018 flight, the modified S-76B demonstrated its ability to take off and land autonomously and using a set of cameras, along with a laser imaging system, to fly to a designated area while avoiding known and unknown obstacles. The helicopter also has the ability to use its onboard sensors to determine safe landing zones automatically and to fly at low altitudes. DARPA formally began Phase 1 of the ALIAS effort in 2014, with Sikorsky and Aurora Flight Sciences , now part of Boeing, developing their respective autonomous ‘co-pilots.’ In Phase 2, the two firms conducted initial demonstrations of those systems on both fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. Aurora’s system involved putting a physical robot in the cockpit of a Diamond DA-42 light fixed-wing aircraft to perform various semi-autonomous functions. In January 2017, DARPA picked Sikorsky alone to continue to Phase 3 and work on maturing their system into something that might evolve into an operational capability not only for the Army, but for the U.S. military as a whole. The potential benefits of the system could be immense. The Connecticut-based aviation firm has also demonstrated its Matrix technology on a Cessna C-208 Caravan . “The capability that ALIAS provides to the crew member is really like a co-pilot,” Dr. Graham Drozeski, the program manager for the project at DARPA, explained. “It can fly routes, it can plan routes, it can execute emergency procedures, and it will do all that perfectly.” Essentially, pilots will be able to readily take their hands off the flight controls in order to operate other mission equipment, such as sensors, during a sortie. This, in turn, will help lessen fatigue, especially during long-duration missions, and reduce the likelihood of mistakes that aviators might otherwise make when they have to multi-task between monitoring various systems and also flying an aircraft. In addition, if something happens to the aircraft, or if they’re incapacitated for any reason, such as hypoxia or wounds from anti-aircraft fire, ALIAS will be able to instantly react. Linked into the aircraft’s onboard diagnostics system, it may potentially be able to identify the issue and respond with the best course of action faster than the human operators. This would have a disruptive impact on the science of what is known as crew resource management , which started as a way to improve communication between members of an aircraft’s crew and shorten the time necessary to troubleshoot problems during an emergency. “We’re demonstrating a certifiable autonomy solution that is going to drastically change the way pilots fly,” Mark Ward, Sikorsky’s Chief Pilot said in an official press release. “We’re confident that MATRIX Technology will allow pilots to focus on their missions. This technology will ultimately decrease instances of the number one cause of helicopter crashes: Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).” Building on these basic capabilities, Sikorsky’s semi-autonomous flight system has the potential to grow in scope over time, as well, quickly offering the human pilots optimal suggestions. This could include functions such as providing routes to fly to a destination that are both safe and avoid as many known threats and natural hazards as possible. Connected to additional sensors or fire control systems, it might be able to present the best vectors for an attack or rapidly identify targets. There are already requirements for autonomous operation and pilot-optional flight in the joint-service Future Vertical Lift program and the Army’s nearer-term Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype ( FARA CP ) project, among other present U.S. military aviation efforts . Sikorsky’s S-97 Raider, seen below, is a contender for the Future Vertical Lift-Light portion of the overarching FVL program. It may eventually be able to make many of these decisions all on its own or based on a set of parameters the crew defines beforehand. It also leaves open the possibility that ALIAS might fully take the place of one or more crew members entirely, allowing for entirely unmanned flight. This, in turn, could further reduce the strain on aviators by allowing pilotless aircraft to take on a host of missions themselves as necessary. If an ALIAS-equipped aircraft can perform various missions, even just simple tasks, such as low-risk resupply missions or just ferrying it from one location to another, U.S. military units would be able to allocate more of their pilots to more demand operational needs. ALIAS’ ability to allow aviation units to do more with less actual personnel would be invaluable in an era of worrisome and chronic shortages of aviators . The U.S. Army and Marine Corps have both become increasingly interested in autonomous resupply aircraft for exactly these reasons. The Marines notably deployed a pair of pilot-optional Kaman K-MAX helicopters, designated CQ-24A, to support their operations in Afghanistan between 2011 and 2014. Lockheed Martin provided the missions systems that allowed the K-MAX to operate semi-autonomously and lessons learned from that has filtered into the Matrix Technologies project, as well. If the Matrix technology is as readily adaptable to any platform as DARPA hopes, it may be easy to integrate this functionality across U.S. military aviation communities with a minimum of effort. The final goal in Phase 3 of the ALIAS program is to install the equipment on an Army UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter and link it together with all of that helicopter’s flight control and mission systems, demonstrating how easy it is or isn’t to add the semi-autonomous functionality to in-service aircraft types. “We’ve chosen the Black Hawk as the platform we want to demonstrate full integration of ALIAS-type capabilities in it,” Drozeski said. “Not just wiggling the sticks, but all the circuit breakers and switches and radios in the aircraft – we want to integrate all of those.” Sikorsky says it is working on putting its Matrix technology into a company UH-60A testbed by the end of 2018. The modified Army Black Hawk is set to perform at least two demonstration flights in 2019. Sikorsky’s UH-60A test bed, at top, and the Matrix-equipped S-76B., Sikorsky If ALIAS works in a military context, this would mean that it would be equally useful for civilian commercial aviation applications. Airliners, in particular, have already become increasingly automated over the years. However, there is both a continued need for human pilots in many circumstances and this presents the same set of risks from physical fatigue or mental exhaustion that are present in military aviation communities. Right now, Sikorsky is looking at integrating the semi-autonomous functionality into one of their increasingly popular S-92 helicopters. DARPA expects the work on ALIAS to continue into 2020, which could see demonstrations of improved capabilities or the ability to use the system on more varied platforms.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 7, 2018",Russia’s Dry Dock Accident Could Have Far Larger Repercussions Than A Damaged Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A day after Russia’s massive PD-50 drydock suddenly sank underneath the country’s only aircraft carrier , the Admiral Kuznetsov , as it was receiving a long-awaited overhaul in frigid Murmansk, just how big a deal this may end up being for the Russian Navy is becoming clearer. The dry dock, which is the largest of its kind in Russian hands, appears to have sunk at first on a steep incline before it disappeared totally beneath the water’s surface. Russian officials are now saying that it could be many months before it is raised from the seabed 160 feet below and that doing so would be a very tedious and delicate operation. That’s if they decide to salvage it at all. Regardless, PD-50 services all types of vessels that make up Russia’s most powerful fleet, including its largest submarines. So leaving it out of action for years, or even losing it altogether, would be a major hit for the Northern Fleet and the Russian Navy’s overall readiness. The incident supposedly occurred as the result of an electrical interruption during a refloating operation for the Admiral Kuznetsov . The hulking floating apparatus’ pumps were stuck on, rapidly filling its ballast tanks. Some 60 people had to escape from the sinking dry dock, many of which ended up in the water. In total, some 70 people were evacuated from the port facility. As it stands now, four people were injured in the process and one remains missing—a senior mechanic. It’s worth noting that the near-freezing waters near Kola Bay would give someone just a matter of minutes to get to a dry place before succumbing to hypothermia. The 82nd Shipbuilding Plant and the PD-50 are situated between Murmansk and Severomorsk., Google Earth It seems that the accident may not have been a fluke and a criminal investigation into possible safety violations that at least contributed to the mishap is currently underway. A lawsuit also looks all but certain as well, Barents Observer reports : “It is Rosneft that owns the floating dry dock after it in 2015 acquired the Shipyard No 82 in Roslyakovo. The oil company intends to turn the yard into a base for its offshore Arctic oil operations. The United Shipbuilding Corporation now says that it intends to sue Rosneft and that the oilmen will have to cover costs related to the repair of the damaged ship.” Although shipyard officials quickly claimed that the carrier was unharmed in the incident and that its refit schedule is left unchanged, other official sources have since said that the ship received a 15 foot by 12 foot gash in its hull near the waterline and that the crane that crashed on its deck potentially did significant damage to exposed mechanical systems. As we mentioned in our previous piece , the fact that there are conflicting reports, one of which seems ridiculously premature, isn’t surprising as Russia has a track record of downplaying or not even admitting obvious naval shipyard accidents. This image shows just one side of the heavily listing dry dock still above water: The Kuznetsov is floating, albeit with a crane laying across its deck, and we really don’t know exactly the extent of the damage. If there are flooded mechanical spaces, the ship could require extensive and very costly repairs. Maybe most concerning is the fact that there may be nowhere to even make those repairs as PD-50 was the only Russian dry dock that we know of that could handle the country’s lone aircraft carrier. This tweet shows the crane laying across the Kuznetsov’s deck, also a side note, check out the late model Cadillac. Seems like an interesting vehicle to have up there in the Arctic Circle and in a naval shipyard of all places: Speaking of accidents, PD-50 has been involved in a number of them in the past, including an especially harrowing incident back in 2011 when the Yekaterinburg (K-84), a nuclear ballistic missile submarine caught fire while drydocked in PD-50. The sub was loaded with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and torpedoes. Crews flooded PD-50 twice to put out the inferno that went on for an entire day. You can read all about the incident and see remarkable pictures taken during it on this Russian website . Regardless of the Kuznetsov’s current state, it’s pretty clear that the fate of the ship is tied directly to the operability of the PD-50 dry dock and has been for many years. Some commenters have mentioned that the dry dock originally came from Sweden during the 1980s, and considering the poor state of Russian large shipbuilding capabilities and sanctions, it is unlikely one could be sourced from Sweden this time around or built indigenously. Regardless, even if it was possible, doing so would take years. This video clip looks promising at first, that is until you realize you are looking at the smaller dry dock that works as a utility area at the port, with PD-50 now totally submerged deep below the surface of the water: The fact is that many others ships also depend on PD-50 as well, including the Northern Fleet’s potent submarine cadre, which includes everything from smaller diesel-electric attack submarines to hulking ballistic missile carrying ‘boomers.’ According to satellite images, Russia’s submarines seem to have used the facility more than any other vessels. A cursory look of the sprawling constellation of naval installations in the region turns up no other dry dock that seems adept at hosting the largest of Russia’s submarines, with all being in the sub-450 foot size range. And even if there was one, the capacity loss of such an important asset, one that can be seen servicing multiple vessels at one time due to its huge size, is a major blow for the Russian Navy and its fledgling modernization efforts. There is a large floating dry dock in Novorossiysk on the Black Sea that carries the designation PD-190. It measures about 75 feet shorter than PD-50 at around 1,000 feet and its internal bay is about 60 feet narrower, at roughly 175 feet wide. It isn’t clear if this dry dock has the ability to accommodate Kuznetsov, the beam difference is quite large, especially considering Kuznetsov’s big flight deck overhangs , but it would be able to accommodate Russia’s largest submarines. Actually doing so would mean a long towed journey through the Bosphorus Strait, across the Mediterranean, into the Atlantic Ocean, and up into the Barents Sea. It would also mean the loss of large ship dry dock capability on the Black Sea. Another smaller floating dry dock, measuring approximately 815 feet long with a bay width of about 125 feet, stays very busy servicing Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea. Keep in mind that Russia has never built an aircraft carrier itself and doesn’t have elaborate facilities to service them. Those ships were built in Soviet Ukraine. Google Earth While this dry dock may satisfy some of Russia’s most pressing operational concerns that came as a result of the sinking of PD-50—like keeping their boomers maintained—if it can’t accommodate Kuznetsov , the future of the carrier will have to be deeply in doubt. And even if Russia decides to transfer the dock to the Northern Fleet, it will take time to do so and it’s not clear where it would even go once it arrives. Any way you slice it, a gap in maintenance for the Northern Fleet’s most power vessels is likely to occur for the months to come. Finally, I think it’s worth mentioning that there is a real possibility that Russia could at least insinuate that some sort of cyber attack or sabotage was partially to blame for this event. Doing so would deflect responsibility for yet another in a long stream of embarrassing incidents involving the Admiral Kuznetsov . If high-up Russian officials are willing to allege a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft took control of terrorist drones that attacked Moscow’s airbase in Syria, then accusing the U.S. of cyber meddling seems like very low-hanging fruit. The potential fallout from the loss of this unique dry dock, and from the fact that the Russian Navy still relies heavily on what clearly are weak points of potential failure, is a big pill to swallow for the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defense.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 30, 2018",Huge Floating Dry Dock Holding Russia’s Only Aircraft Carrier Has Accidentally Sunk (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain limited and are likely to change, but what we do know is that one of the world’s largest floating dry docks, known as PD-50, has sunk while Russia’s aircraft carrier Amiral Kuznetsov was aboard. According to reports, the dry dock began to sink suddenly, collapsing cranes onto the carrier’s deck and sending shipyard workers scrambling for their lives. The dry dock is located at 82nd Repair Shipyard in the village of Roslyakovo. The shipyard there primarily supports Russia’s Northern Fleet based out of nearby Severomorsk. We don’t know exactly how many people were hurt or killed in the incident, but apparently, there were casualties. PD-50 seen in its usual position., Google Maps Conflicting reports as to how this happened are circulating, but there still isn’t a detailed official statement from of the Russian Ministry of Defense. The one we do have via Russian media outlets simply says “the vessel suffered no damage after the incident at the 82nd shipbuilding plant.” It’s worth noting that Russia has a track record of not admitting the scope of shipyard accidents. Admiral Kuznetsov is currently undergoing a much-needed complex overhaul after years of deferring the project. Although the scope of the work has been narrowed , it is still a highly invasive operation. Even the ship’s notorious boilers have been pulled and new ones are being installed (see below). The aircraft carrier is tentatively scheduled to return to the fleet in 2021, but judging by other deep overhauls of large and complex Soviet-era fighting ships, it could end up taking significantly longer. If parts of the carrier’s hull were open during the sudden flood, repairing the ship could be extremely expensive and time-consuming. These accidents are not unique to Russia. A sudden flooding event occurred last July at the NASSCO shipyards in San Diego. Luckily nobody was injured or killed in that incident. We will update this post as more information comes available. Update: 4:00am PST— The official story , at least as it sits now, is that the pump system that controls the dry dock’s buoyancy suddenly lost power causing its ballast tanks to flood with water far past the intended point. As the dry dock quickly submerged, cranes came crashing down onto the Kuznetsov’s deck (see below). Supposedly all this happened during a refloating operation for the carrier. The most recent reports state that “two victims remain in hospitals, two received outpatient care, another person went missing.” As for the carrier’s condition, officials from the shipyard claim the Kuznetsov is undamaged and that her refit schedule will not be affected. At the same time, Russian outlets are now reporting that a five-meter gash was made in the hull of the ship around the waterline and that the deck was supposedly opened up with intricate machinery exposed when the crane fell on it. So once again, take all this with a tall shot of vodka as it seems very early for anyone to make the claim that everything will proceed as normal. The fate of the dry dock—the only one of Russian origin that can accommodate the aircraft carrier—also remains unknown. If it was badly damaged, that alone could spell major trouble for the Kuznetsov’s future. Update: 4:00pm PST— We have posted a new post with new information and analysis on this event.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2018",American Hypersonic Weapons Could Shower Their Targets In Deadly Fragments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military as a whole is pushing ahead as fast as I can to field hypersonic weapons , with it recently emerging that the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy were cooperating on the development of a single boost-glide vehicle design. But while there’s been much discussion about hypersonic vehicle shapes , as well as the means of accelerating them to five times the speed of sound or more, there’s been less public attention given to what sorts of warheads they might actually carry. Earlier in 2018, Northrop Grumman demonstrated a 50-pound design that it says could work particularly well with this new class of weapons. In March 2018, the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor showed off the warhead at a testing facility belonging to Energetic Materials and & Products, Inc. (EMPI) in Burnet, Texas to unnamed prospective customers working on unspecified hypersonic weapons, which Jane’s 360 was first to report. A second test of the warhead, which uses Northrop Grumman’s Lethality Enhanced Ordnance (LEO) technology, occurred testing firm NTS’ site in Camden, Arkansas in August 2018. “LEO is a fairly generic technology: PBXN-110 explosive fill and fragmentation layer,” Pat Nolan, the Vice President and General Manager of Northrop Grumman’s Missile Products division, told Jane’s earlier in October 2018. “It’s how we array those fragments that determines the desired effects.” Northrop Grumman says it can scale the size and arrangement of the fragments, coupled with air-bursting fuzes, to be as lethal as possible against specific target sets, including exposed personnel, light and medium vehicles, parked aircraft, radar dishes, and more. The company uses extensive computer modeling to determine the most optimal configuration depending on the requirements. Orbital ATK, which Northrop Grumman purchased in June 2018, began testing what it originally called Alternative Warhead (AW) technology in 2013 for the U.S. Army. At the time, that service’s primary focus was the development of a substitute warhead for the 227mm Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ( GMLRS ) artillery rocket. That weapon had previously come with a cluster munitions warhead full of more than 400 small submunitions. In 2008, President George W. Bush’s Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had instituted a plan to begin removing this and other types of cluster munitions from U.S. military inventory and develop more reliable alternatives that were less likely to leave unexploded ordnance scattered around the battlefield, which presented risks to friendly troops and innocent bystanders alike. In 2017, President Donald Trump’s administration reversed this policy , but the Army and other services are still developing the substitute weapons. “Northrop Grumman has conducted more than a dozen demonstrations of our LEO technology that has proven it is a safer alternative, which is policy compliant, and delivers the same or better results on target,” Nolan said in a separate statement to The War Zone . “Currently, we are working across all three services [Air Force, Army, and Navy] to transition this new warhead improvement to a variety of missile and bomb platforms.” GLMRS rockets with the LEO warhead are in production, along with 60mm mortar bombs using the same technology, both for the Army. There have also been tests of 155mm artillery shells using the same combination of explosive and fragmentation liner. Northrop Grumman plans to use this technology in the warhead for its Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM-ER) for the Navy, which you can read about more here and here , and its Hatchet miniature glide bomb , too. A 2015 US Army briefing slide describing the features of the “Alternative Warhead” for the 227mm GMLRS artillery rocket., US Army Now, Northrop Grumman believes that LEO warheads could offer an ideal option for hypersonic weapons, which present unique challenges due to the intense stresses that come along with a missile or other vehicle flying at speeds of Mach 5 or greater. By their nature, these fast-flying weapons have the ability to simply be kinetic threats, using the sheer force of their impact to cause immense damage. But that capability may not necessarily be useful against targets dispersed even in a relatively small area. Adding in an explosive, fragmenting warhead would help a single hypersonic weapon engage multiple targets of different types in a prescribed area all at once, improving the system’s overall flexibility. Depending on the arrangement of the fragments, the added momentum from the hypersonic speed of the weapon may offer improved destructive effects, as well. “Early LEO designs focused on light target requirements, future LEO designs will require the ability to defeat medium to medium-heavy targets. Preliminary results indicate that the new warhead will defeat medium to medium-heavy targets while maintaining the original performance,” Northrop Grumman explained to Jane’s . “LEO also provides penetration survivability against buildings for greater warfighter flexibility and predictable patterns for low collateral damage mission capabilities, providing a safer alternative to some legacy munitions, which can cause unintended harm to civilians and infrastructure.” A warhead using Northrop Grumman’s LEO technology explodes during a test., Northrop Grumman The scalable nature of the LEO concept, both in terms of overall size and effects, means the company has been able to readily develop new warhead designs to fit within the space and weight constraints of future weapons. Using the aforementioned modeling techniques, Northrop Grumman told Jane’s it was able to craft a warhead design in just two months to meet the requirements to fit inside an unknown hypersonic weapon. We don’t know what actual hypersonic weapons that might be set to receive these fragmenting warheads. Since Northrop Grumman’s demonstration in March 2018, Lockheed Martin has won the Air Force’s competitions to develop the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) and Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), both of which are air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. That same firm was already the prime contractor working on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) and Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) programs. On top of that, the Air Force, Army, and Navy are working together on a common hypersonic boost glide vehicle design that will equip their HCSW, ground-launched Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), and the submarine Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons respectively. Though there is likely to be significant overlap, the three services may have unique target sets they plan to use these hypersonic weapons against, which could make a multi-purpose warhead especially attractive in this case. Regardless, the U.S. military is eager to get its first hypersonic weapons in service as soon as possible. Using a proven and adaptable warhead technology, such as Northrop Grumman’s LEO, can only help speed up the developmental process.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 11, 2018","USMC Wants Truck-Mounted Plasma Weapon To Temporarily Blind, Deafen, And Even Yell At People","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is pushing ahead with research and development into laser-induced-plasma less-than-lethal weapons that can temporarily blind and deafen individuals, produce painful burning sensations on their skin through clothing, and even blast out verbal warnings and commands at them from hundreds of yards away. Now, the service is interested to know if the same system can also function as a secure communications device or a sensor to warn friendly forces to incoming missiles or other projectiles and be compact enough to fit on a small truck. On Oct. 24, 2018, the Marines closed their call for proposals for such a system as part of what is formally known as the Scalable Compact Ultra-short Pulse Laser Systems ( SCULPS ) program. In March 2018, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD), the Pentagon’s top less-than-lethal weapon program office, which the Marine Corps leads, demonstrated a similar experimental Non-Lethal Laser Induced Plasma Effects ( NL LIPE ) system at the Directed Energy to DC Exhibition in Washington, D.C. “Past efforts to develop USPL [Ultra-Short Pulse Laser] weapon systems that generate scalable laser induced plasma effects (LIPE) have shown some promise, but these efforts were not able to achieve the desired effects at the required range,” the notice on the U.S. government’s Small Business Innovation Research program website explained . “The developed system was cumbersome and not feasible to be integrated on a small tactical vehicle.” At a range of nearly 100 feet, the NL LIPE system was able to create flashes of light as bright as two million candela, thousands of times brighter than a typical household light bulb, according to the contracting announcement. At that same distance, it could generate blasts of disorienting sound up to 147 decibels, which is around as loud as a gun going off or a jet engine running, and produce “a sufficient level of thermal discomfort on human skin.” The video below shows tests of earlier Non-Lethal Laser Induced Plasma Effects (NL LIPE) systems. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0eJzcPz8ujo Experiments have proved in principle that laser-induced-plasma might be able to create verbal announcements, as well. Unfortunately, the prototypes failed to actually issue intelligible commands at the desired range of almost 330 feet. Laser-induced-plasma systems work by using a short-pulse laser that shoots out bursts of fast-moving amplified light. This produces the plasma, an electrified gas field that has properties that are distinct from matter in the typical gas, liquid, and solid states. When you hit that plasma with a second small laser you can generate light, sound, and heat. In theory, if you can tweak the frequencies of the light, you can make the lasers pump out specific wavelengths of noise and potentially mimic human speech. Under the SCULPS program, the Marines and the JNLWD are looking for assistance in improving on these previous experiments and getting closer to a viable less-than-lethal weapon system. At the Directed Energy to DC Exhibition, David Law, head of the JNLWD’s technology division, told multiple outlets that the goal was to have a practical prototype ready within five years. Law was named as the main point of contact for SCULPS. The Marine Corps’ new requirements are for a system that can produce between six and eight million candela of light and blasts of noise at 165 decibels or more out to ranges of nearly 110 yards. The service also wants it to be able to generate the burning sensation even through typical clothing rather than just on exposed skin. The Marines still want to be able to issue short verbal commands, such as “get out,” at distances between 110 and 1,110 yards, too. The complete system, including any equipment necessary to keep the lasers and their power sources cool, has to be small enough to fit inside a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or a Humvee . A Marine Corps Joint Light Tactical Vehicle., USMC The SCULPS notice also specifically calls for looking into whether the less-than-lethal weapons can function in other roles. The two additional capabilities the announcement specifically identified  were secure communications and “incoming object detection.” Back in March 2018, we at The War Zone had already raised the possibility that the NL LIPE prototype might have a secondary use as a long-range covert communications tool. The ability to send verbal instructions to personnel at a specific location without a radio could be immensely valuable in a day and age where potential near-peer opponents, such as Russia and China, and smaller nation-states are developing and fielding robust communication jamming and other electronic warfare capabilities . Laser-based communication by itself is already well understood and is in use, especially in space-based applications . As such, the system might be able to act as a communication node even if the more complex “talking plasma” functionality doesn’t work out in the end. It’s less clear how the bursts of plasma could help spot incoming projectiles. It is possible that they could act in the same fashion as a small radar, with the full system recording the light or sound waves bouncing off objects in the distance and displaying their relative position to personnel on a handheld device or a screen mounted inside a vehicle. The potential benefits of a laser-induced-plasma system are clear and even just in a less-than-lethal capacity it could replace a number of different weapons that the U.S. military uses today. These include including temporarily blinding laser “dazzlers” , acoustic hailing devices , and high-powered microwave “ pain rays .” The plasma-based systems also offer the ability to focus the beam on a very small space, even just a single individual, reducing the impact on friendly personnel or other bystanders. Existing systems have much broader areas of effect. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mcsdtyVra1w The potential for the system to perform other missions only makes the technology more attractive both to the U.S. military and law enforcement groups. The Marine Corps’ contracting notice indicates that the third and final phase would explore installing working prototypes onto various types of vehicles, watercraft, and even unmanned aircraft. A drone carrying one of these laser-induced-plasma weapons could be particularly effective as a psychological warfare tool, something else we at The War Zone have noted before. The ability to project disconcerting or disorienting sounds and flashes of light, or even bizarre messages out of thin air, could demoralize or distract hostile forces, or even specific targets, such as leaders of terrorist groups. They might even think they’re going crazy. Depending on how powerful the output of the lasers are, they may also be able to produce actual physical damage to enemy equipment, especially optics on vehicles, aircraft, and missiles, or cause injuries among enemy personnel. The Small Business Innovation Research program notice makes it clear that this technology is still more experimental than practical, so more roles may become apparent as time goes on. There are still hurdles that the Marines will need to overcome. Lasers, by their nature, have a tendency to become defuse over extended ranges and lose power and focus in the process. Any laser-based directed energy weapon is still going to need a straight line-of-sight to the target, too. Less-than-lethal directed energy weapons have long been a lightning rod for controversy , as well. Though there is no conclusive evidence of these risks, there is a running concern that fluctuations in power in order to achieve non-lethal effects at extended distances could inadvertently cause harmful impacts at closer ranges for anyone unfortunate enough to pass in front of the beam of energy. But the potential benefits and varied capabilities that a single SCULPS system might be able to provide are clearly significant enough for the Marines to keep pushing ahead with the project.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-2 Spirit was first unveiled to the public on November 22nd, 1988. Three decades later, it still captures imaginations and rightfully so. Its striking low-observable flying wing design looks as otherworldly now as it did in the late 1980s and it still contains many secrets even after all these years. Considering how similar the upcoming B-21 Raider design appears to be to its forebearer, it’s amazing just how much Northrop got right when designing the world’s first stealth bomber in an era when the cellular phone was still in its infancy. Now, the plane’s maker, Northrop Grumman, has released a number of short but intimate videos to celebrate their stealth bomber legacy as they look forward to bringing its successor to life. The video series, titled Crafting History , is extremely well produced and offers unique insights into the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program from those who made the B-2 possible. Best of all, each episode’s short run-times is absolutely packed with new footage and images of the B-2 dating back to its genesis. So on this, the spookiest day of the year, celebrate America’s scariest flying machine—one that’s literally named after a ghost—by watching the six installments below. It’s hard to imagine a USAF without a B-2 in its inventory, but that will be the reality by the early 2030s according to the flying force’s new bomber roadmap . If the B-21’s development continues along smoothly , the type will enter service in the middle of the next decade and it will replace the B-2s first before also displacing the B-1B fleet. Although the B-2’s very tentative out of service date is still nearly a decade and a half away, the aircraft will still be so sensitive in nature that finding a place for them to rest, or even how to destroy them outright, remains an unsolved problem . The stealthy F-117 Nighthawk fleet that came before the B-2 still suffers from a similar issue today, even after it was officially retired a decade ago, albeit a handful of the jets are still flying today . Even with all the program’s challenges and high cost, the B-2s have proven to be America’s top silver bullet weapon and a national treasure. With just 20 Spirits in existence, the USAF’s ability to make repeated, long-range, high-volume attacks on even the most defended and fortified targets will increase drastically once the far more numerous and capable B-21 Raider fleet becomes a reality. In some ways, the B-2 can be looked at as an operational prototype of sorts, with the B-21 offering Northrop Grumman the opportunity to make the stealth flying-wing bomber concept all that it can be by leveraging modern materials science, existing high-tech components, and most of all, three decades of operational experience with the B-2. With this in mind, the B-21 is unlikely to disappoint, at least in terms of combat capability. With that in mind, the B-21 would not be possible without the dedication of all the people that played a hand in its forbearer’s genesis and helped give birth to the stealth bomber era. Author’s note: In all the footage and images presented in the videos, two moments stand out to me as highly interesting. First is this one showing the B-2 taxiing. The long structure atop the jet’s center ‘hump’ is puzzling. It looks way too long and seems to be the wrong shape to be the aircraft’s refueling receptacle . Youtube Screencap Second is this image of the mockup of a cockpit. The panel layout is vaguely similar to the one that made it into the B-2 but the B-2 has a two-crew side-by-side cockpit. Was this for a technology demonstrator that predated the actual B-2 itself? Maybe the single station was going to be mirrored for the actual aircraft but there are other oddities. For instance, the panel is smaller, lacking the two lower side-by-side cathode ray multi-function displays. It also has a ‘canopy severance’ handle. The B-2 doesn’t have a canopy but it does have hatches that its ejection seats fire through. A central windscreen support structure also seems to indicate that this is a single seat cockpit concept, or at least a tandem one.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 1, 2018",NATO Unfazed By Russia Plans To Fire Missiles Near Its Massive Exercise Off Norway (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia, irked by the largest NATO-led exercise in decades occurring in and around Norway, has announced plans for its own drills, to include missile launches, in areas overlapping with where the Western alliance is training. NATO officials have downplayed the provocation, acknowledging the Kremlin’s right to use international waters, but have called on the Russians to ��behave in a professional way” to avoid any incidents or accidents. On Oct. 30, 2018, the Main Air Traffic Management Center of Russia issued a Notice to Airmen, or NOTAM, alerting civilian aircraft to ‘rocket test firings’ between Nov. 6 and Nov. 9, 2018, in an area of the Barents Sea north of Norway. This came a day after a similar notice emerged covering a zone further south in the Norwegian Sea and lasting from Nov. 1 to Nov. 3, 2018. Both areas are in international waters, but share space NATO had designated for its sprawling exercise, known as Trident Juncture , the live-fire portion of which runs through Nov. 7, 2018. As of yet, there has been no official word from the Russian Ministry of Defense on the nature of its planned drills in either of these areas. On Oct. 31, 2018, the Kremlin did acknowledge a separate aerial training mission involving two Tu-160 Blackjack bombers flying over the Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea. There are plans for a pair of Tu-95 Bear bombers to fly across a similar route, as well. On Oct. 23, 2018, observers did spot two Russian Steregushchiy -class corvettes , along with an ocean-going tug and an oiler, leaving the Russian Navy’s main Baltic Sea base and heading into the North Atlantic. The first-in-class frigate Admiral Gorshkov , which only entered Russian service in July 2018, appears to be heading to join them , as is equally the new Ivan Gren landing ship. Gorskhov can carry P-800 Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles and Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles, while the Steregushchiy class carries Kh-35 anti-ship missiles . Both types of ships can also carry various surface-to-air missiles and feature additional weapon systems, including large-caliber guns, automatic cannons, and torpedoes. See the mapped areas Russia has set aside for its live-fire drills in the tweets below: This uptick in activity is clearly meant to demonstrate Russia’s displeasure with Trident Juncture, which has the official objective of demonstrating the alliance’s ability to cooperate and defend one of its members from a “fictional” high-end adversary that is an obvious stand-in for Russia. More than 50,000 personnel, 65 ships, 250 aircraft, thousands of ground vehicles from more than 30 countries have converged on Norway and the surrounding area for the drill. “Despite the pretty awkward attempts by representatives of the Alliance and its member states to present this military activity as defensive, it is obvious that this show of force is clearly of an anti-Russian nature,” the Russian Foreign Ministry had said in a statement at the start of the drill on Oct. 25, 2018. “We cannot ignore the fact that certain elements of the Trident Juncture 2018 will be carried out at objects located just 200 kilometers [approximately 124 miles] away from the Russian border.” The Russian Steregushchiy -class corvette Soobrazitelnyy , which, along with its sister ship Stoikiy , is headed into the North Atlantic., Radziun via Wikimedia The Kremlin isn’t happy that non-NATO members Sweden and Finland are taking part, either. Both countries have been moving closer to the western alliance in response to Russia’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy, especially its illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and continuing support for separatists fighting that country’s government. In recent years, Russian officials have threatened both countries should they formally join the military bloc. “The NATO side, of course, expands its anti-Russian information campaign in order to justify such dubious and provocative actions,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry had said in its statement the day Trident Juncture started. “It has a negative effect on the security of all the neighboring countries, it leads to deterioration of the military and political situation, and it certainly does not comply with the effort made toward creating new confidence-building measures in the Baltic Sea Region.” But if Russia’s actions were meant to at least aggravate NATO or disrupt their plans, the bloc has been largely dismissive of any such concerns. The alliance said that the Kremlin alerted them in advance that they planned to conduct their own exercises. NATO officials had also briefed their Russian counterparts on various details about Trident Juncture to improve transparency and reduce the likelihood of any sort of dangerous misunderstanding. Russia also received an invitation to send observers to watch the drills directly. “There is nothing dramatic about this. We have noted it and will follow the Russian maneuvers,” Norwegian Defense Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen told reporters on Oct. 29, 2018. “To let oneself be irritated by it would be a way of escalating things. They follow the rules and get to train as they wish,” he added the next day. A French Tiger attack helicopter flies ahead of Dutch landing craft during a simulated amphibious operation as part of Trident Juncture 2018., NATO “I expect Russia to behave in a professional way. It will not change the plans of our exercise,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement on Oct. 30, 2018. “We will, of course, monitor closely what Russia does. But they operate in international waters and they have notified us in the normal way.” “I have no issue with that as long as it doesn’t interfere with what we do,” U.S. Navy Admiral James Foggo, who is head of both U.S. Naval Forces Europe and NATO’s Commander Allied Joint Force Command, and is the senior officer in charge of Trident Juncture, had said after Russia initially alerted the alliance of its plans on Oct. 26, 2018. He said he expected the Russians to be “professional” in their training activities. In the past, Russia has conducted far more provocative activities near NATO training exercises and other routine activities, including Russian aircraft flying dangerously close to the alliance’s ships and aircraft , without providing any prior notification. Of course, there is still the possibility for such altercations to occur during Trident Juncture. The Kremlin’s ships firing missiles or other weapons potentially in close proximity to vessels or assets taking part in the excise without direct coordination does present clear risks. Though Trident Juncture will continue as planned, the Russian maneuvers will be at least somewhat of a nuisance, potentially closing off entire areas for days at a time to NATO ships and aircraft. The top boundary of the area where Russia says it will fire missiles in the Norwegian Sea is off the coast from where NATO held a demonstration for media and VIPs on Oct. 30, 2018. It’s not clear how much any of this will necessarily matter, at least publicly, though. “This is not war, there is not an imperative that I do something right now today,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Brad  Skillman, the commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 2, said after the landing ship dock USS Gunston Hall suffered an accident on its way to Trident Juncture, forcing it to return to port in Iceland on Oct. 22, 2018. “Well, what happens if you have high winds or heavy seas that day? You have to decide whether you want to pick up and move it to another day or you just want to cancel it.” This same logic would almost certainly apply to Russia’s overlapping drills. The presence of the Russians ships may even turn out to be a positive factor for NATO forces in the end, since they will have an opportunity to more closely observe and gather intelligence about the Kremlin’s capabilities and standard operating procedures. Russian submarines , highly capable intelligence collecting assets in their own right, are almost certainly in the area, as well, providing additional potential real-world targets for an exercise focused heavily on anti-submarine warfare . In addition, the relatively limited duration of the Russian exercises, at least when it comes to their plans to fire missiles off the coast of Norway, indicates that the Kremlin doesn’t have the interest or lacks the capacity – or both – to directly challenge NATO on the high seas throughout the course of Trident Juncture. After the live-fire portion of the alliance’s exercise ends on Nov. 7, participates will move on a command post drill that runs through Nov. 23, 2018. The Kremlin also has access to more indirect means of trying to disrupt the exercise that would present a far lower likelihood of sparking an actual incident and might even be hard to link to the Russian government directly. During its own massive drills along its western borders in September 2017, Russia jammed wireless and GPS networks in Scandinavia and the Baltic region. A Russian R-330Zh Zhitel truck-mounted electronic warfare system that has the capability to jam cellular satellite communications., Vitaly Kuzmin NATO also believes the Russians were behind a series of cyber attacks to steal private information from personnel and potentially harass them on and offline. In recent years, the Kremlin has become expert in weaponizing information and disinformation , spreading unfounded conspiracy theories and dubious accusations against its opponents to deflect and distract from its own actions. A false news story about a U.S. military vehicle running over a boy in Lithuania during an exercise in June 2018 appears linked to this information warfare campaign. None of this is to say that the dueling exercises couldn’t produce a more serious confrontation in the Barents Sea or the Norwegian Sea. A war of words between Russia and NATO over Trident Juncture has certainly been building since before the exercise even started. On top of that, U.S.-Russia relations have taken a recent dip again over the U.S. government’s plan to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The United States accuses Russia of violating that deal and fielding destabilizing ground-based nuclear-capable long-range cruise missiles, an issue you can read about in more detail here. “NATO’s military activities near our borders have reached the highest level since the Cold War times,” Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Oct. 31, 2018 , echoing a common refrain from NATO, and the United States in particular , about aggressive Russian activities . Trident Juncture is “simulating offensive military action,” he added. At present, the possibility of an actual incident between Russia and NATO seems remote, especially with the notice the alliance has received in advance and otherwise benign environment off the coast of Norway. Still, we will definitely be keeping a close eye on how things continue to evolve. Update: 6:20pm EST— Hans Kristensen, the Director of the Federation of American Scientists’ Nuclear Information Project has Tweeted out that a Norweign Ministry of Defense official has indicated to him that the Russians clearly mean for the area covered by the southern NOTAM to be a provocation. “They didn’t even do that during [the] Cold War,” the unnamed individual stressed. Update: 7:50pm EST— Russia has reportedly begun its exercises off the coast of southern Norway. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 22, 2019",USAF Had Faulty Data About Whether Hangars Full of F-22s Could Survive Hurricane Michael,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force continues to be coy about the extent of the damage to the approximately 17 F-22A Raptor stealth fighters that remained at Tyndall Air Force Base as it suffered a direct hit from Hurricane Michael . But the service has now revealed that the data it had about which hangars were sufficiently hardened against the force of the storm’s winds appears to have been inaccurate, which could have ramifications both for the work of reconstructing Tyndall and for other bases in hurricane- and typhoon-prone areas. Aviation Week got the new information in an interview with U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command (ACC), on the sidelines of the Airlift/Tanker Association Conference on Oct. 27, 2018. Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10, 2018, with the eye of the storm passing right over Tyndall, rendering the base virtually unusable and uninhabitable. The majority of the F-22s at the base relocated to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to escape the storm, but not all of the Raptors could make it out in time. “All the F-22s will be fine,” Holmes stressed to Aviation Week , without giving a more detailed assessment of the damage to the aircraft. But “the hangars that had a design life to take the highest winds turned out to receive some of the most damage.” As Hurricane Michael passed overhead, Tyndall’s own weather monitoring facilities registered wind gusts up to nearly 130 miles per hour. Holmes said that, based on other data, the actual peak speed was closer to 172 miles per hour. Under the Saffir–Simpson scale, a Category 5 Hurricane is any such storm with sustained winds at or above 157 miles per hour. Some of the F-22s that remained at Tyndall after Hurricane Michael out in the open after the storm., USAF To provide some perspective, Hurricane Andrew , which flattened what was then Homestead Air Force Base in Florida in 1992, had winds reaching up to 175 miles per hour. 1980’s Hurricane Allen holds the record for peak wind speeds of any tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean, with gusts around 190 miles per hour. We don’t know what wind speeds the hangars at Tyndall were supposed to be able to survive. At present, the U.S. military primarily uses formulas set out in the 2015 International Building Code (IBC), a publication of the International Code Council, to determine what “wind loads” it should design its buildings to have in order to resist storm damage. Tyndall’s Hangar 2, one of the base’s larger hangars, in 2012., USAF Hangar 2 in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in October 2018., USAF The building in question date to before the issue of the latest IBC and the service may have built them to a different standard, as well. Tyndall’s Hangar 1 and 2 predate the latest building codes, but did receive major upgrades in the early 2010s. We also don’t know how the Air Force classified the hangars in terms of risk. The 2015 IBC has four risk categories, with the most extreme covering “aviation control towers, air traffic control centers and emergency hangars” and “buildings and other structures having critical national defense functions.” If the hangars were in this highest risk category, the IBC calls for structural features to resist three-second gusts of up to 120 miles per hour only, well below the force of Michael’s winds. This calls into question whether the hangars at Tyndall would ever have been able to fully weather the storm if the Air Force had followed the IBC’s requirements. A map showing wind speed requirements for buildings in the United States as laid out in the 2015 International Building Code., International Code Council Whatever the case, “it turned out none of that [data] was very accurate,” General Holmes admitted to Aviation Week . “Some little flat ones that were rated to collapse at 75 knots [wind 86 miles per hour] made it through the hurricane with no problems.” A team of specialists is now looking into how and why the data about the hangars’ structural integrity was wrong, which appears to have led authorities at Tyndall to put F-22s, as well as other aircraft, in even greater danger inadvertently. This could have impacts beyond the base if the Air Force finds that its methods for assessing the storm-proof nature of buildings have been flawed on a broad scale. Another group is examining Air Force procedures for using weather forecasts to plan for base evacuations. However, as The War Zone ’s own Tyler Rogoway has examined in detail , it would have been all but impossible for the service to have moved all of the Raptors out of Michael’s way. “We’ll certainly gather lessons from that,” Holmes noted. “And then you have to figure out ways to pay for the lessons that you gather.” F-22s parked closely together inside a hangar at Tyndall after Hurricane Michael passed right over the base., USAF The General is definitely not wrong about the latter part. In its latest budget request for the 2019 Fiscal Year, the Air Force asked for more than $39 million to buy just one six-bay hangar for F-35A Joint Strike Fighters that will eventually be situated at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom.  That project’s description doesn’t call for any additional hardening against extreme weather. Buying better hangars may be a preferable alternative to having to spend large sums to repair damaged high-end assets, such as the F-22s. The Raptor’s stealthy design, especially the special radar-absorbing treatment for its external skin, along with the aircraft no longer being in production , already make it costly to operate and maintain. After one F-22 suffered a belly landing at Tyndall in 2012, it took the Air Force six years and $35 million to get it flying again. The pictures the Air Force has released so far indicate that at least some of the Raptors that rode out the Hurricane may have escaped with relatively minimal damage. The cost of even minor repairs could easily add up, though. So, while Holmes has made clear that the Air Force plans to return all of the damaged aircraft to operational status, it’s not clear what the bill for that will be in the end or exactly what condition the planes will be in at the end of the day. In August 2018, the service finished just rehabilitating and upgrading another F-22 that had been sitting, undamaged in storage for five years at a cost of $25 million. An airman cleans off an F-22 at Tyndall after Hurricane Michael. Small holes are visible in the aircraft’s tail., USAF Depending on how extensive the necessary repairs might be, it could turn out to be more cost-effective to cannibalize some of the Raptors for in-demand parts to help improve the availability of the rest of the fleet to meet the Air Force’s operational needs. Many of the F-22s at Tyndall are older types and primarily used for training. to begin with. Demand for combat-capable stealth fighters, in general, is only likely to increase as the Pentagon shift’s its main focus to preparing for high-end conflicts against potential “great power” adversaries, such as Russia and China. In the meantime, the Air Force is focused on getting Tyndall back up and running to some degree, with the goal being for the base start to resume basic operations on Jan. 1, 2019 . The facility’s ultimate future remains in question. After Hurricane Andrew, the service declined to rebuild all the destroyed structures at Homestead and eventually transformed it into an Air Reserve Base . In addition, in July 2018, the Government Accountability Office issued a scathing report about Air Force F-22 operations, as a whole. Among other things, the watchdog recommended consolidating the already relatively small number of Raptors into fewer units to reduce sustainment costs. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has also demanded the Air Force improve the availability rates for the stealth fighters from less than 50 percent to at least 80 percent by the end of 2019 . “We can’t fly aircraft out of Tyndall at the moment,” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said during a visit to the base on Oct. 25, 2018. “But by Thanksgiving, we will have F-22s in the skies over the Panhandle.” But the Air Force will need to find a way to do build at least one hangar at Tyndall that can proveably survive major hurricanes in the future or continue to risk playing something of a Russian Roulette with jets that have to remain behind during severe storms. The state of the base’s facilities is already steadily turning into something of a political nightmare for the service, especially with regards to the fate of the F-22s. With the added concern about whether the Air Force knows what kind of weather its hangars can survive, along with potential plans to consolidate the F-22 force overall, the real question may be how long the Raptors will continue to call Florida home.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2018",Rumors of Covert Russian Ops Swirl After Finland’s Police Raid Bond-Esque Private Island,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For more than a month, a mystery of sorts that sounds ripped straight out of a Hollywood spy thriller has been brewing in Finland. Officially, Finnish authorities are investigating a Russian real estate company over money laundering, but a lack of information about the case has led to widespread speculation that the firm was actually buying up land and setting up covert facilities to support Russia’s spies during peacetime and special operations forces during a potential crisis. On Sept. 22, 2018, Finland’s Keskusrikospoliisi (KRP), or National Bureau of Investigation, similar in certain functions to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, led a raid on the private island of Sakkiluoto, also known as Sackilot, which Russian businessman Pavel Melnikov owns through his Finnish-based company Airiston Helmi. Local police, Finnish border guard, Finland’s national customs agency, and the Finnish Defense Forces all took part in the massive operation, which also targeted 16 other sites linked to Melnikov and his associates. In total, more than 400 personnel took part in the operation, including 100 from the KRP alone. Helicopters and a Dornier Do-228 surveillance plane watched overhead and authorities put a no-fly-zone into place over the Turku Archipelago where Sakkiluoto is situated. “I thought: ‘Wow! That is certainly unusual,’” Leo Gastgivar, a retiree who lives on a neighboring island to Sakkiluoto and witnessed the raid there, told The New York Times for a story that outlet published on Oct. 31, 2018. “Nobody ever visits that place.” But the assault on Sakkiluoto, which armed, fatigue-clad police tactical units in small boats carried out, is just one of the unusual things about the entire situation. Since Melnikov purchased the island, workers have built a total of nine docks, a helipad, barracks-like housing, security cameras, and motion detectors, all without any apparent specific purpose. A satellite image of Sakkiluoto/Sackilot island, festooned with docks, from 2015. The helipad is on its eastern shore. , Google Earth At the end of the day, Finnish authorities arrested just two unnamed individuals , a Russian – not Melnikov, who is reportedly back in St. Petersburg – and an unnamed Estonian of Russian extraction. The KRP also said they seized cash in various currencies, including $3.5 million worth of Euros. They also recovered computers and flash drives containing a reported 100 terabytes of data, according to The Times , which noted that this was equivalent to 50 times the print collection of the U.S. Library of Congress. Finnish national authorities gave no advance notice of the operation to Patrik Nygren, the mayor of Parainen, which acts as the archipelago’s administrative hub. Finnish media reported , citing an unnamed military source, that both the Finnish Defense Forces and the Suojelupoliisi (SUPO), or the Finnish Security Intelligence Service, one of Finland’s top counter-intelligence arms, had been monitoring Airiston Helmi’s activities for some time. In 2016, the country’s state broadcaster, Yle , reported that Russians making large real estate purchases in Finland had raised suspicions within the Finnish government and suggested that the Kremlin could be engaged in a “ hybrid warfare ” campaign. The Finnish Border Guard’s Do-228 surveillance aircraft, which supported the raids on Sakkiluoto and other islands in the Turku Archipelago in September 2018., MKFI via Wikimedia Airiston Helmi, and its supposed owner Melnikov, are equally enigmatic and sound like something intended for a James Bond movie. In publicly available corporate filings he has listed his citizenship as Russian, Latvian, and Maltese, the last of which sells citizenship. He reportedly also has legal residency in Hungary and passports from three unnamed Caribbean nations. Melnikov is no longer listed as the head of the company, with an unnamed Italian businessman running the operation. The Times says that individual told them he had only taken the post “as a favor to a businessman he knows from Russia.” The company itself is formally owned by a series of shell companies based in popular tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands. Oh, and did we mention that Airiston Helmi has never publicly turned a profit since its founding in 2007, despite millions of Euros in investment capital and a spending spree on property and equipment that includes not only Sakkiluoto and its facilities, but a pair of surplus Finnish Navy watercraft? The company owns a former workboat, which features a front-loading ramp like a landing craft and is presently configured as a floating sauna, and another small launch. The M/S Hessu , a former Finnish Navy workboat. Airiston Helmi owns another boat of this class that has reportedly been turned into a floating sauna., MKFI via Wikimedia “There are no commercial grounds for acquiring land, but the roads are strategically important and their military significance is considerable,” Tom Packalen, a member of Finland’s parliament and a former police officer wrote in a blog post on the website of the Finnish newspaper Uusi Soumi on Sept. 24, 2018. “If Airiston Helmi is a truly commercial company, it’s run by really bad business people or it’s money laundering, which led police to lead a massive operation on the site.” Herein lies the crux of the present public debate. It is entirely possible that Melnikov and partners have been using Airiston Helmi to launder money. It’s also possible that the Russian and his firm are a front for the Russian government in some way and are perhaps covering for various intelligence and paramilitary activities in Finland. The Turku Archipelago, in particular, is highly strategic, containing major ports that are as physically separated from Russian territory, and therefore the threat of attack. These facilities are critical to Finland’s peacetime economy and would be of critical military value in a crisis. The city of Naantali, which is on the Finnish mainland at one end of the archipelago, is also home to one of the country’s two major oil refineries, which has a daily output of 50,000 barrels of processed fuel. All of this would be of significant interest to Russia’s intelligence services and would be ideal targets to disrupt Finland’s economy or hamper its response to a military confrontation. Finland, along with its neighbor Sweden, has long sought to chart a neutral course in regional geopolitics. This has become increasingly more difficult given its desire for closer ties with the West, which has drawn fierce criticism from the Kremlin. After Russia’s illegal seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and the Kremlin’s subsequent support for separatists fighting the central government in Kiev, the Finnish government became even more concerned about what might happen if it found itself embroiled in a serious political crisis with the Russians. In July 2018, Russian special operations forces executed a mock airborne raid on facilities on Gogland Island, which is Russian territory, further to the east in the Gulf of Finland. The drill had all the hallmarks of the Kremlin’s lightning takeover of Crimea. Many observers interpreted this as a signal to NATO- and non-NATO countries, especially in the Baltic region and in Scandinavia, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki. It is actions like this that have pushed Finland further toward the West and has prompted the country’s government to suggest it could be interested in joining NATO , drawing even stronger rebukes from Russia. Finland is presently taking part in the Alliance’s Exercise Trident Juncture in and around Norway, which is the largest NATO-led drill in decades. It’s also why Russia might want an insurance policy of sorts already in place in the form of nebulous non-state actors such as Melnikov. Putin is widely understood to use a network debatably legal connections , including through powerful Russian oligarchs , to support clandestine or malign activities abroad . The facilities on Sakkiluoto could give the Kremlin a physical lily pad from which to stage various intelligence and para-military operations inside Finland, which the Russians have become increasingly willing to launch in order to advance various national interests . In principle, the island would be an ideal place to covertly insert personnel, especially via small submarines . Just this year, agents from Russia’s GRU, the country’s main military intelligence agency, attempted to assassinate former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, who now lives in the United Kingdom, with a nerve agent, killing an innocent bystander in the process. More recently, the Kremlin’s operatives sought to hack into the computer networks at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at The Hague in The Netherlands, which is helping investigate the Skripal case. All that being said, though, there’s still no firm evidence yet that the raids on properties linked to Airiston Helmi had to do with anything but money laundering as the KRP has insisted. Finnish authorities have been tight-lipped about the investigation. Finland’s geography means that the Finnish Defense Forces often aid police operations with transportation and logistics support. SUPO is part of the Ministry of the Interior and often works with the KRP, as well. So the involvement of these organizations does not automatically point to something more sinister. “It should also be remembered that money laundering is in itself a lucrative business, and there are a numerous reasons for people to want somewhere to stay for a night or two without having to sign a hotel ledger,” Robin Haggblom, a Finnish military observer who writes a blog under the name Corporal Frisk , wrote on Sept. 23, 2018. “On the other hand, the Russian cleptocracy [sic; kleptocracy] makes the dividing lines between crooks, spies, and businessmen somewhat blurred, and even if Airiston Helmi would prove to be a non-political criminal enterprise (it should be noted that no-one is convicted of anything as of yet), it isn’t beyond the realms of imagination for the GRU to call in a favour every now and then.” We’ll definitely be keeping a close eye out for any new information about this mysterious situation in the Turku Archipelago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2018",Catalina Island’s Famous Cliffside Airport To Get Rebuilt In Marine Training Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military as a whole is becoming increasingly worried about its ability, or lack thereof , to rapidly deploy large forces into a theater of operations under the threat of attack from a near-peer opponent during potential high-end conflicts. Whether or not American troops have the capacity and know-how to either quickly repair damaged airfields or build new ones entirely is among the most pressing concerns. Starting at the end of 2018, a group of Marines will get important real-world experience that could help inform future concepts of operation as they work to rebuild a remote civilian runway on an island off the coast of California. Beginning on Dec. 9, 2018, the Catalina Airport , which is situated on top of a peak on Santa Catalina Island , will close its runway for a major overhaul. Marine Wing Support Squadron Three Seven Three ( MWSS-373 ) will subsequently lead a force of approximately 100 Marines from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) who will support the project. The non-profit Catalina Island Conservancy, which now owns the airport, expects the $5 million upgrade project to finish up by April 2019 . “The repair of the Conservancy’s Airport in the Sky runway project offers an incredible training opportunity to the Marines,” U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Duncan Buchanan, a spokesperson for the I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which controls the 3rd MAW, said in a statement on Oct. 30, 2018. “This challenging project allows Marines to gain valuable experience in repairing damaged runways, and increases our capabilities and readiness to tackle a range of military operations across the globe. It also ensures that the community benefits from a fully operational airport for daily provisions as well as to aid in any potential recovery efforts after natural disasters.” The Marines are working with the Catalina Island Conservancy through the Department of Defense’s Innovate Readiness Training (IRT) program, which helps coordinate training opportunities that support U.S. communities and promote positive civil-military interactions. The non-profit describes the arrangement as a “win-win partnership … to repair the runway, which is aged and beyond its useful life.” Marines from MWSS-373 repair battle damage to Al Taqaddum Air Base in Iraq in 2016., USMC The Wrigley family of chewing gum fame originally built the airstrip on Catalina Island, which sits less than 50 miles south of Los Angeles in the Pacific Ocean, opening it in 1941 as the Buffalo Springs Airport. In 1942, the U.S. Army Air Forces took control of the site in order to support U.S. military activities during World War II. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the progenitor of today’s Central Intelligence Agency, also used the island as a training site. Civilian commercial operations resumed in the 1950s and the Catalina Island Conservancy bought the airport in 1972, continuing to operate it as a public facility open to private aircraft and charter flights. Situated at the highest point on the island, at an elevation of more than 1,600 feet, it has since gained the nickname “the Airport in the Sky” and a reputation for being a challenging place for pilots to land. Some have even likened it to a mountainside aircraft carrier. Even the roads leading up to it from the populated areas below are especially steep . The runway drops off steeply at both ends, making it difficult for pilots to see the opposite side when landing and taking off and making the margin for pilot error all but non-existent. The airport’s location and altitude mean that aircraft often have to battle downdrafts and turbulence as they come in to land. Heavy rainfall reportedly routinely disturbs the runways asphalt surface, creating potholes, soft spots, and scattering chunks of debris, all of which can pose additional hazards. This is where the Marines will come in. Starting in December 2018, private contractors will strip the existing asphalt. A temporary runway will allow for limited flights to and from the island in the interim. In January 2019, MWSS-373 and the rest of the force will arrive by helicopter and boat to begin laying down a new, concrete runway. The Marines will establish and operate out of an austere tent camp through the duration of the project, as they would during an actual expeditionary military operation. Building a runway under rustic conductions will provide an important training opportunity for the Marines by itself. The challenge of getting the necessary equipment and raw materials to the island and up to the where the airport is located, as well as sustaining the operations there for a period of three months or more, only adds to the value. But this is exactly what Marine Wing Support Squadrons train to do. These units are largely unknown components of all Marine Aircraft Wings that typically provide local defense, communications, medical, mess, and other general ground support to units at their main base of operations. However, they are also prepared to rapidly deploy to assume operations at remote, “ bare base ” airstrips with limited supporting infrastructure. In addition, they are equipped and trained to provide a host of important engineering services, including building roads and runways, landing pads for F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, and helicopters, defensive fortifications, and living quarters. These units would also establish vital power, water, and fuel facilities necessary to support operations at these facilities. These are the exact skill sets that will be on put to the test during the repair of Catalina Airport’s runway. This isn’t the first time the Marines have taken part in an exercise like this, but these sorts of civilian-military partnerships may become more valuable as the U.S. military as a whole shifts its primary focus to preparing for potential conflicts with “great power” adversaries, such as Russia or China. These are also exactly the kind of capabilities the U.S. military needs to hone if it wants to ensure its ability to conduct air operations during a major crisis, as we at The War Zone have explored in depth in the past. Enemy strikes will have very likely rendered established bases and known secondary dispersal sites unusable for at least some period of time in the opening phases of any high-intensity conflict. How useful the exercise on Catalina Island is or isn’t, and what best practices and potential pitfalls the service can glean from rebuilding the runway, will almost certainly be of interest to other U.S .military services, too. The Air Force is especially eager to revitalize its own similar expeditionary air base units and could be interested in growing its own use of similar civil-military partnerships in the future. “Our collaboration with the U.S. Marines is a rare opportunity to maintain the proud history we share on Catalina,” Tony Budrovich, Catalina Island Conservancy’s President and CEO, said in a statement on Oct. 30, 2018. “We invite Island residents and visitors to come to the airport during construction to observe this exceptional military exercise and enjoy the beauty and the open spaces of Catalina’s interior.” The exercise, and future ones just like, may also become an increasingly important foundation for America’s air combat doctrine in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 22, 2019",Here’s The Justification For FEMA Chartering The World’s Largest Jet To Rush Supplies To Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has become an all too common sight in recent years. After storms blasts over islands with deadly force, gleaming white ex-Soviet cargo jets stuffed with everything from fire trucks to food supplies descend out of the heavens like obese angels of mercy. These chartered aircraft, usually belonging to Ukraine’s Antonov Airlines , have served as vital, contracted air bridges in disaster and warzones alike over the last two and a half decades. But FEMA just executed an emergency charter of Antonov’s biggest offering—also the largest airplane to ever take flight, the An-225 Mriya —in an attempt to rush supplies to Guam as Typhoon Mangkhut bears down on the Mariana Islands. The An-225 made one of its longest flights ever yesterday, from Kiev, Ukraine to Oakland, California—just over 6,100 miles and 13 hours flight time—giving bay area residents a big surprise as it roared into Oakland International in the late afternoon on September 9th, 2018. Then today, the sextuple-engine cargo hauler made the five and half hour flight to Hawaii. It will then head to Guam tomorrow. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZeZpXQ9cUBo Typhoon Mangkhut is hitting Guam now, with high winds and heavy rains threatening to cause major damage on the island and its neighbors, some of which are tiny and have little means to organically support extended emergency and storm recovery operations. The An-225 has been chartered by FEMA before. In 2009, it ferried generators to Pago Pago, American Samoa, to assist the island with electrical power restoration., David Gonzalez/FEMA Hawaii is also about to get slapped by Mother Nature. Hurricane Oliva, which is tracking west right towards the Hawaiian Islands, is set to make landfall late Tuesday. Currently, the storm is a category one hurricane. But Hawaii is far better supplied for a major natural disaster than the Mariana Islands. The flight was contracted on behalf of FEMA by Air Partner Inc. under an emergency request. The application , which was posted just two days ago, on September 8th, 2018, states: Antonov Company t/a Antonov Airlines (“Antonov”) hereby applies for an emergency exemption pursuant to 49 U.S.C. §§ 40109(g) and 41703(c) to permit Antonov to operate a single one-way all-cargo charter flight transporting Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) relief supplies from San Francisco, CA (SFO) (or an alternate airfield in California) to Guam (GUM, GUA, or an alternate airfield in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), via Honolulu, HI (HNL), using Antonov’s peerless AN-225 “Mriya” super heavy transport aircraft, on or about September 10-12, 2018. Antonov is making this extraordinary request for the Department’s immediate consideration and approval on Saturday, September 8, 2018, based on a need to address urgent FEMA requirements for vital relief supplies to reach Guam in anticipation of potentially devastating impacts from Tropical Storm Mangkhut, which is predicted to intensify to typhoon strength as it approaches Guam early next week. It then describes what the An-225 will be carrying: Air Partner Inc. (“Air Partner”), acting on behalf of FEMA to arrange the urgent movement of critical relief supplies to Guam, has chartered Antonov to conduct a single AN-225 flight transporting FEMA goods to Guam on an expedited basis. At the time of this filing, the anticipated cargo includes approximately 140,000 kg of Meals Ready-to-Eat (“MRE”), water, and other essential items stored at a FEMA facility at Moffett Field, CA, which will be aggregated and loaded at SFO for shipment to Guam. Additional or alternate cargo might also be loaded, depending on developing FEMA priorities and the availability of supplies in the San Francisco and Honolulu areas. At the controls of the world’s biggest plane., Oleg V. Belyakov – AirTeamImages via Wikicommons The document then goes on to justify why the An-225’s unique capabilities were needed for this unique charter operation: In light of the immediate need and uncertainties associated with emergency response airlift operations, flexibility to use the entire capacity of a single, well-timed flight using the voluminous AN-225 is warranted to maximize the amount and type of relief cargo that can be sent to Guam during a critically narrow timeframe. No U.S. air carrier can offer a comparable solution, and no other airplane in the fleet of Antonov or any other air carrier can match the capacity and flexibility that a single AN-225 flight can offer. Although the cargo on the initial loading list could potentially be accommodated by multiple flights operated by U.S. air carriers, Antonov has been advised that it is being chartered to perform this single AN-225 flight based on an apparent shortage of sufficient U.S. air carrier lift, the immediate availability of the AN-225 (on stand-by at Antonov’s Gostomel, Ukraine (GML) base and ready to depart for SFO on Sunday morning), and FEMA’s need to transport the maximum possible volume of cargo in the shortest amount of time, with the greatest amount of flexibility to account for the various contingencies associated with emergency response and disaster relief activities. The AN-225 is uniquely qualified to perform this flight not only because of the significant capacity of the aircraft, but also in light of its flexibility to load outsized cargo, such as emergency response vehicles, which might turn out to be needed on an urgent basis, not to mention the ability to load and unload the aircraft using the aircraft’s nose door and ramp system — or even the exterior of the fuselage if necessary. In other words, there is absolutely no comparable alternative to the use of Antonov’s AN-225 aircraft. … Grant of this application is in the public interest. Transportation of MREs, drinking water, and potentially other relief supplies to Guam is necessary to support FEMA’s activities in Guam and the neighboring Mariana Islands, which could experience devastating impacts from Typhoon Mangkhut, including flooding, landslides, structural damage, power outages, and threats to human health and safety. Transportation of the cargo by U.S. air carriers is apparently not available and, depending on the volume and type of cargo, not possible, and transportation by ocean freighter would take far too long. It is therefore critical that Antonov be authorized to use its AN-225 aircraft to address the need for delivery of these supplies to Guam as soon as possible. This pretty much lays out the business case for the An-225 and it serves as a stark reminder of why this singular aircraft’s abilities are still highly valued. But one has to wonder about the U.S. military’s role in all this. Were there really no C-17s and C-5s available to help out here? Were they really tasked on more important missions than one as critical as this? It’s entirely possible that they are also doing everything they can to help out. Beyond the interests of local resident’s well being, Guam is home to some of the most highly prized strategic outposts in the Pentagon’s portfolio. So why exactly an An-225 was needed at all, despite commercial charter aircraft’s availability, is an interesting question to ponder. It’s also odd that the aircraft didn’t just land at Moffett Field across the bay where the supplies were stored. All this is happening in the Pacific while in the Atlantic, Hurricane Florence is looking to become an incredibly perilous event for America’s southeastern seaboard, with the Carolinas seemingly directly in its sights. Florence is already a category four storm, packing winds of at least 130 miles an hour and it really doesn’t look like it will weaken. NOAA The storm is set to make landfall on Thursday and major evacuations have been ordered. This includes a large exodus on military hardware from a region packed with sprawling bases. Norfolk alone will see 30 of its resident vessels set to sea to avoid Florence’s onslaught. Aircraft in the region are also migrating to safer locales, but not all ships or aircraft are capable of making the trip. What’s most concerning is that there are two more hurricanes already spinning right behind Florence in something of a conga line of meteorological destruction. NOAA Although Antonov Airlines has already posted a shout out for potential charters in Asia following its Guam mission, it’s possible that the An-225’s ultra heavy lifting capabilities could be in high demand by FEMA in the days to come. Let’s hope that’s not the case, but it’s good to know the mighty Mriya is available if needed.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 26, 2019",China’s Biggest Airshow Offers More Evidence Of Beijing’s Stealth Drone Focus,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though often overshadowed by the country’s other advanced military programs , China has been steadily pushing ahead in its development of stealthy, penetrating unmanned aircraft in recent years. So, it’s not surprising that the Chinese companies are taking the opportunity of the biennial Zhuhai Airshow to show off a previously censored stealthy flying wing design that might eventually find itself aboard a Chinese aircraft carrier and setting the stage for the debut of what could be a new unmanned combat air vehicle, or UCAV . The Chinese government regularly uses Zhuhai , also known as the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition and Airshow China, to formally reveal new aircraft and other military technologies. In 2016, a pair of J-20 stealth fighter jets made their first official public appearance at that year’s iteration of the airshow. The year before, the first J-31/FC-31 light stealth combat jet prototype took center stage . This time around, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) has brought a stealthy flying wing design that has reportedly been in development for more than four years now. The company has placed it within its Tian Ying, or Sky Hawk, series, even though it does not appear to be in any way related to any of the other four known designs in that family. CASIC says that this new drone has made a number of flights since late 2017 and released photos of the design team standing around it in 2018. The firm blurred out the unmanned aircraft itself in those images. CASIC’s newest Tian Ying drone., Chinese Internet “Eighty percent of our drone’s technologies are the newest and most advanced, some of which are leading the global [drone] industry” Ma Hongzhong, the lead designer of the newest Tian Ying said, according to a post from CASIC’ s WeChat social media account in February 2018. At that time, he only mentioned that there had been ground tests of the design, which he did not specifically mention by name. The images we have now from Zhuhai 2018 show a drone that appears somewhat similar in shape to Lockheed Martin’s recently revealed X-44A design . The aircraft may be a bit larger though, with a wingspan around the 35-foot range. Chinese Internet Earlier reports said that the drone was designed for long-range operations, but beyond its apparent stealthy shape, there are no clear distinctive visual features to indicate any particular mission sets. It seems more likely that this Tian Ying, as with the X-44A, is or has served more as a testbed and technology demonstrator, which is something we at The War Zone had suggested was a possible role for this drone in the past. The design could evolve into an actual operational design in the future, though. A closer look at the front of the new CASIC Tian Ying., Chinese Internet What is particularly interesting is that its landing gear appears to be more robust than one might associate with a land-based design and better suited to carrier-borne operations. A model of the future Type 003 carrier, which may be China’s first nuclear-powered type, at the Military Museum of the Chinese People’s Revolution, the official museum of the People’s Liberation Army, shows it carrying a drone very similar in size and shape to the new Tian Ying. China is also reportedly planning to install electromagnetic catapults , similar to those on the U.S. Navy’s Ford -class carriers , on this ship, as well as its predecessor, the Type 002, which will be the country’s first to feature a Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. Operators can more precisely tune the power of these aircraft launching systems, which is important for more readily accommodating the very different launching demands of full-size manned aircraft and drones. The U.S. Navy extensively tested Northrop Grumman’s X-47B aboard its own aircraft carriers using traditional steam-powered catapults , as well, proving this is functionally possible. It’s also worth noting that the service abandoned plans to develop a carrier-based UCAV and instead shifted focus to a tanker drone with a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission. In September 2018, Boeing won the competition to produce these unmanned aircraft, known as the MQ-25A Stingray , but did so with a UCAV-derived design that could still evolve into an armed platform at some point in the future. The Chinese may plan to use Tian Ying, or an aircraft developed from it, in a similar role to validate various capability and basic concepts of operation for carrier-borne low-observable drones. An operational example might work as a tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform akin to the RQ-170 . Such a craft can extend the carrier group’s sensor reach, targeting capabilities, and overall situational awareness for longer periods of time than what manned platforms can provide and with a lower chance of being detected. Elsewhere, another firm, the Chinese Aerospace and Technology Corporation (CASC), plans to debut another flying wing unmanned aircraft, or a mockup or model thereof, at Zhuhai. Pictures of that company’s booth in the exhibition hall had shown another, larger flying wing-shaped aircraft covered cloth mats. There has also been speculation that this might be a model of the H-20 stealth bomber , but this seems unlikely. For one, the object is at the CASC booth, while Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC) is responsible for the H-20’s development. It’s also sitting under a large sign that says “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” in English and Chinese. From what little we can tell of the planform under the mats, it appears to be similar in configuration to something roughly akin to an X-47B, but with more slender outer wings and less of accentuated ‘cranked kite’ configuration. A clearer shot of workers setting up CASC’s still to be unveiled new unmanned aircraft, or a mockup thereof, at Zhuhai., Chinese Internet If this covered aircraft is indeed a full-size mockup or an actual prototype, it could indicate a pre-production or production configuration is near, which is a major development. This drone would definitely be large enough to function as a true stealthy UCAV or a penetrating medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) ISR platform. The general size and configuration appear very similar to Star Systems’ Star Shadow . This company showed off a model of this design publicly at the Singapore Airshow in February 2018. It appeared to be a rework of its earlier SG-1 Star Glory drone, a design that featured a 50-foot wingspan and dates back a number of years. At that same event, CASC revealed a model of its own CH-805 stealth flying wing drone concept, but this has a different planform. Both Star Shadow and this CASC aircraft appear to be the right size to match up with an apparent cranked kite drone mockup that emerged in satellite imagery of the Gaobeidian radar cross-section test facility in 2017. Regardless if this is the same design or not, it’s not surprising that the development of one or more of these similar designs is moving into a more advanced phase. A model of Star Systems’ Star Shadow stealthy drone., Chinese Internet The Chinese may have an eye toward pursuing one or more of these larger drones for carrier-borne operations, as well. “Considerable resources are needed in carrier-based UAV research” and it would be difficult to attempt it without “government support,” was all CASC’s Shi Wen would say on the matter in an interview with state-run newspaper Global Times earlier in 2018. Shi is the chief engineer and designer of the Cai Hong (CH), or Rainbow, drone series, which are mainly non-stealthy designs, but have proven both capable and popular with export customers . In August 2018, CASIC rather than CASC also released a video showing employees at its 302nd Institute design division working in an office surrounded by posters showing a drone similar to the X-47B taking off from a CATOBAR carrier. That had led some to speculate that this would be the planform of the new Tian Ying, which now does not necessarily appear to be the case. CASIC employees from the company’s 302nd Institute work on computers. Posters in the background show a carrier-borne UCAV design., CASIC The Tian Ying and whatever CASC intends to reveal are hardly the only stealth drones China has been working on, either. Since the first of these, the Sharp Sword, emerged in 2013, other designs from the Chengdu Aerospace Industry (CAI) have also become public. Regardless of the actual proposed mission sets and operating environments for any of these flying wing unmanned aircraft, it’s clear that the Chinese government is investing heavily in stealthy drones, including UCAVs. This comes as the United States continues to either publicly move away from that idea, as previously noted was the case with the X-47B , or otherwise focus on these developments almost exclusively in the classified realm . China seems to be increasingly aggressive in the UCAV space in particular and if CASC’s reveal does turn out to be an X-47B knockoff with an eye toward carrier operations down the road, or even just a more mature land base UCAV design, it would be another example of the country seemingly picking up where the United States decided to drop off.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 7, 2018",The Last Of Tyndall’s F-22s Are Leaving The Base And May Never Come Back,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force appears to have caught a much-needed break after Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in October 2018. Despite initial concerns, reports indicate that the handful of remaining F-22A Raptor stealth fighters that rode out the storm at the base will soon fly out to join their companions at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia before heading off to other Raptor operating locations. However, questions still remain about whether or not those jets will ever return permanently to Tyndall. On Nov. 2, 2018, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson told reporters during a conference call that the service had not made any decision yet on whether it would send the more than 50 F-22s that had been stationed at Tyndall before the storm back to the base in the future. Later that same day, the Air Force announced that F-22 units would relocate elsewhere until further notice. The 43rd Fighter Squadron , an F-22 training unit, along with the supporting 372nd Training Squadron, Detachment 4 , will move the bulk of their operations to Eglin Air Force Base, also in Florida. The 2nd Fighter Squadron, which provides adversary support for the 43rd with its T-38 jet trainers, will also move to Eglin. “Academic and simulator facilities at Tyndall will be used to support training requirements, as well as Tyndall’s surviving Low Observable maintenance facilities,” the Air Force statement read . Personnel and F-22s assigned to the operational 95th Fighter Squadron will get dispersed to other operational Raptor squadrons at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. Those of Tyndall’s F-22s that were airworthy before Hurricane Michael had flown to Langley already and that base will continue to serve as an immediate regrouping and staging point for the remaining Raptors now leaving the base. Air Force personnel support operations at Tyndall using a mobile, Humvee-mounted control tower and temporary shelters as an F-22 head out in the background., USAF Various other units that had called Tyndall home will also relocate to other sites temporarily. The Air Force expects the 601st Air Force Operations Center, a critical command and control node for domestic air defense and other homeland support missions, to be back up and running at the base by Jan. 1, 2019. A host of other support elements, including 53rd Air-to-Air Weapons Evaluation Group, which provides various range control and operational test and evaluation support, are still at Tyndall and will remain there during the recovery effort. As of Oct. 31, 2018, “only a couple” of the approximately 17 F-22s that were still at Tyndall when the storm hit were still at the base, according to Air Force Magazine . The Air Force expected the rest of the Raptors to leave “in a matter of days, not weeks,” that report said. The status of multiple QF-16 target drones, T-38s, and Mu-2 training aircraft, which also had to weather the hurricane, remains unclear. Though they’ve received less public attention than the Raptors, the QF-16s are also extremely important for the Air Force’s training and weapons development requirements and we have yet to receive any real update on their fate. The last of the F-22s will head to Langley for a closer inspection to determine the full extent of any damage, but the fact that crews at Tyndall could make them airworthy is a good sign that any issues may be more limited than many initially feared. Hurricane Michael ripped the roof off of Hangar 5, exposing the aircraft within to the elements and subsequently raising concerns about the structural integrity of that building. Others had their doors torn off and holes punched in their walls. An F-22 Ratpor leaves Tyndall on Oct. 22, 2018., USAF But the amount of time it will take to rebuild Tyndall’s infrastructure, 95 percent of which sustained significant damage during the hurricane, will almost certainly impact when and if the F-22s return at all. Air Force engineers already say that a number of structures on the base are unsalvageable and are still assessing others that may turn out to be structurally unsound. Secretary Wilson said it will take years to finish rebuilding the facilities. A similar situation occurred after Hurricane Andrew slammed into Homestead Air Force Base in 1992. Recovery crews subsequently dismantled a number of heavily damaged, non-hardened structures. As the Air Force rebuilt that base, the U.S. military made a decision to drastically reduce operations there and refocus its primary function, eventually redesignating it as an Air Reserve Base less than a month after it reopened in March 1994. Today the base serves primarily as the home of one Air Force Reserve F-16 squadron, a remote alert site for F-15C/Ds from 125th Fighter Wing in Jacksonville, and as a base of operations for a handful of Customs and Border Protection aircraft. Devastation at Homestead Air Force Base after Hurricane Andrew in 1992., USAF Florida authorities are clearly pushing for the base to return to its previous operating level, given that Tyndall is responsible for generating millions of dollars in the local economy and supporting 20,000 jobs in the surrounding community, according to the state’s Republican governor Rick Scott . It remains to be seen whether it will turn out to be cost-effective for the Air Force to do so, especially as the U.S. defense budget contracts once again . In addition, in July 2018, Government Accountability Office report recommended consolidating Raptor units to improve readiness and reduce logistical strains. In effect, the Air Force is already doing this with its decision to sprinkle elements of the 95th Fighter Squadron among other F-22 units at other locations. The service’s press release insists these moves are temporary, but there is a distinct possibility that that could change in the future if the shift in operations proves useful and workable. F-22 operating locations as they existed prior to Hurricane Michael., GAO “I just let them do what they were trained to do, and here we are, three weeks later,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Brian Laidlaw, the 325th Fighter Wing’s commander and the senior officer at Tyndall, told Air Force Magazine of the personnel working to restore the base’s functionality. “I couldn’t be more impressed by how much progress we’ve made, and I could not be more proud watching them do what they are trained to do.” At the same time, Tyndall’s character has already changed as units have and are relocating to continue their work elsewhere. It remains to be seen how many of those elements, including the F-22s, ultimately come back to the base.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Army Tests Low-Recoil 155mm Howitzer Small Enough To Fit On The Back Of A Truck,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has revealed that it has been testing a truck-mounted, low-recoil 155mm howitzer at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. The new weapon would meet the service’s requirements for a lighter weight and mobile option to replace existing howitzers in its Stryker armored vehicle-equipped, light infantry, and airborne units. Defence Blog was one of the first to notice that the 75th Field Artillery Brigade had announced that its troops had fired the first round from the howitzer, nicknamed Brutus, during a recent Maneuver and Fires Integrated Experiment (MFIX) exercise at Fort Sill in a post on the unit’s official Facebook page dated Oct. 26, 2018. These routine drills have long provided an opportunity to evaluate other novel and advanced weapon systems, including ground-based electromagnetic railguns , directed energy weapons for shooting down small unmanned aircraft, and battlefield cyber warfare capabilities . “75th FA [Field Artillery] Brigade, 1LT [1st Lieutenant] Monika Lewandowska served as the Fire Direction Officer for the first ever round fired from the Brutus, an experimental 155mm forward recoiling howitzer mounted on an FMTV [Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck],” the post on Facebook read. “CPTs [Captains] Keith Purdy and Phillip Sutton served as [the] battery commander and battalion FDO [Fire Direction Officer] during the Maneuver and Fires Integration Exercise at Fort Sill.” The post does not offer any details about the howitzer itself, but it is almost certainly Mandus Group’s 155mm Soft Recoil Howitzer , which has been in development since 2011. The company also offers a 105mm system called Hawkeye , which is based on the same basic operating principles and is small and low-recoil enough to fit on the back of a Humvee or a pickup truck. The Army’s experimental truck-mounted forward-recoiling 155mm howitzer, known as Brutus., US Army In a traditional howitzer, crews load the shell and propelling charge into the weapon, fire it, and the barrel and breach assemblies move backward to absorb some of the resulting force. The rest of the recoil force goes into the firing platform, such as a truck or tracked vehicle, or into the ground more directly in the case of towed weapons. This produces significant strain on the entire system and generally precludes many lighter weight vehicles from carrying large howitzers due to the potential impacts on accuracy and dangers of severe wear and tear in a relatively short amount of time. Mandus’ guns use what is known as a “forward-recoiling” or “fire-out-of-battery” operating mechanism. What this means is that when the crew fires the gun, the barrel and breach move forward first. In principle, this momentum helps further cancel out the recoil, making the gun more accurate and otherwise suitable for mounting on lighter vehicles. Digital ballistic targeting computers and precision-guided munitions would only improve the weapon’s accuracy even when fired from a lightweight platform. The video below shows a test of Mandus’ 105mm howitzer, which uses the same basic operating principle as its 155mm type. The truck that the Army mounted “Brutus” on appears to be a modified M1083 five-ton FMTV type with outriggers to help stabilize it when firing. This would make sense since the FMTV series remains the standard tactical truck throughout the Army. This isn’t the first time the Army has looked into forward-recoiling howitzers. During the Cold War, the Army experimented with a gun using this principle, known as the XM204 , which came in 105mm and 155mm variants. The weapons were lightweight and low-recoil enough for the service to even briefly consider a Rube Goldberg-esque contraption to strap two of the howitzers onto a CH-47C Chinook helicopter. A drawing describing an automatic-loading mechanism for a CH-47C-mounted XM204 howitzer so that the helicopter could have fired the weapon in flight., US Army In the end, the complexities associated with the guns led to the XM204’s cancellation and the Army returned to developing more conventional howitzers. In February 2018 , however, the service announced it was once again interested in exploring available options for a new mobile howitzer to replace its existing 105mm and 155mm towed types. A “ground up wheeled howitzer” was one of the concepts identified as being of “particular interest” in the contracting announcement. At that time, we at The War Zone had noted that it seemed unlikely that a 105mm system would necessarily be able to provide the range and destructive capability to adequately replace 155mm howitzers, as well. This had pointed to the need to develop a new 155mm system that would be available in both short- and long-barrel variants and come in a package better suit the demands of different types of Army artillery units. Mandus’ soft-recoil system is ideal for meeting those requirements and the company already offers its 155mm design with two barrel length options. The Army’s experimental “Brutus” uses the shorter type. Depending on just how lightweight the entire system is and how compact it can be made for transit, airdropping these truck-mounted weapons might be possible, which would further expand their flexibility. It could be light enough for a large helicopter, such as a CH-47F or CH-53E or K , to sling load from one destination to the other, too. A Colorado Army National Guard CH-47F Chinook carries an M777 155mm towed howitzer. , CO ARNG Using a relatively standard truck chassis, the vehicle best suited to moving on improved and semi-improved roadways, but the FMTV design does have some off-road capability. This is already the case with truck-towed howitzers now and truck-mounted systems also eliminate the inherent difficulties of towing anything over rough, uneven terrain . There are potential limitations to Mandus’ soft-recoil howitzer concept, though. The outriggers indicate that the 155mm weapon continues to put considerable strain on the FMTV chassis, which could lead to accuracy issues. It’s also not clear whether crews would be able to safely fire the gun in any other position besides straight ahead, which allows the vehicle to help absorb the recoil of firing. This, in turn, could force them to have to take precious time to reposition the vehicle entirely in order to engage targets to either side. We also don’t know whether the forward-recoiling design can accommodate the propellant “supercharges” necessary to send shells out to extended ranges. This might lead to reduced maximum ranges even with the longer barrel variant when compared to traditional howitzers. Still, it’s not surprising that the Army wants to see just what Brutus can do. As the U.S. military has reoriented itself toward preparing for potential high-end conflicts with near-peer adversaries, such as Russia and China, the service has seen a dramatic increase in interest in new and improved ground-based artillery capabilities across the board. An Army M119 105mm towed howitzer, a weapon the Army is hoping to replace, along with its 155mm types, with a new, common lightweight howitzer., US Army Land-based artillery systems are inherently more flexible and faster to respond than combat aircraft, unless the latter are already orbiting overhead. Depending on the situation, mobile artillery units may also be able to more rapidly maneuver or reposition themselves to provide critical fire support. A lightweight truck-mounted howitzer would be particularly valuable capability during distributed operations, such as in the wide expanses of the Pacific Ocean , where ground forces rushing into an area, through airdrops or air landings , may not be able to rely on other units for support for an extended period of time. These same forces would be able to quickly deploy into an area to disrupt an opponent’s plans and deny them a particular vector of attack or quickly redeploy to avoid counterattacks using the added mobility of the self-propelled weapons over traditional towed howizters, as well. The Army’s contracting notice from February 2018 says that the service is interested in acquiring new howitzers sometime in the mid-2020s and that it is looking to avoid an “extended development cycle.” With Mandus’ lightweight 155mm design already in the works for the better part of a decade and with the company’s extensive testing of its 105mm type, this would seem to be a particularly attractive option in meeting the demands of this schedule. It seems almost certain that the U.S. Marine Corps will be interested in this development, as well, given their own desire for more mobile artillery capabilities . Hopefully, we will learn more about Brutus’ performance at the MIFX exercise soon. If the system works as advertised, it could offer a major boost in artillery capabilities for the Army’s lighter, more rapidly deployable forces.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 18, 2021",CIA Put The First Mi-17 Chopper It Flew Into Afghanistan After 9/11 In A Museum You Can’t Visit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The CIA has retired a particularly storied Russian-made Mi-17 Hip and put it in the collection of artifacts in its internal museum, prompting the release of various images and information. The helicopter is the very first one Agency pilots flew into Afghanistan as part of the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. USA Today was first to report that the Mi-17, which features a black “91101” on its tail in reference to 9/11, had arrived at the CIA’s headquarters in northern Virginia on Sept. 26, 2018, which also marks the anniversary of the beginning of the Agency’s effort in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., codenamed Jawbreaker . Pictures show the helicopter was, and may still be, sitting in a parking lot at the CIA campus in Langley. We don’t know if there are any other helicopters or planes in the Museum’s collection, which is not open for public tours and is popularly known as the “best museum you’ll never see.” At the time of writing, we had not received a response from the CIA about whether the Mi-17 was the first complete former Agency aircraft to go on display. “The helicopter isn’t emblematic of 9/11,” CIA Museum Director Robert Byer told USA Today . “It’s emblematic of our response.” 91101 sits in a parking lot at the CIA headquarters in Northern Virginia., CIA After the 9/11 attacks, CIA field officer Gary Schroen put together the Jawbreaker team. His past experience included making some of the first contacts with local “ Mujahedeen ” forces in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and leading an effort to kill or capture Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the 1990s. Similar to those efforts, Jawbreaker’s primary mission would be to make contact with elements of what was then known as the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, a collection of various groups loosely connected by their opposition to the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The CIA personnel would then liaise with those fighters and help pave the way for follow-on American forces. 91101 in Afghanistan., CIA The Jawbreaker team initially deployed to neighboring Uzbekistan and subsequently moved Mi-17s into the region to support their operations. The CIA chose the Russian helicopters for their capabilities in Afghanistan’s so-called “ hot-and-high ” environment, its rugged and relatively simple design, and because the Taliban were operating similar types, making it easier to avoid detection. The helicopter that is now in the CIA Museum carried a black-and-green camouflage scheme similar to those the Taliban was flying at the time, as well as a large white “607” on the side of the fuselage. Crews eventually added the less visible black “91101” on Hip’s tail. Though it has not given specifics, the CIA says it further modified the helicopter to be able to conduct low-level, nighttime insertion, extraction, and resupply operations. Pictures of the Hip from Afghanistan show that it is equipped with what appears to be a nose-mounted weather radar, found on many Mi-17s, and satellite communications antenna, which is far less common for these helicopters. The tail is covered in a variety of other non-standard aerials, too, which are likely associated with high-frequency radios and other communications gear. The application of the 91101 marking on the helicopter’s tail in progress., CIA “There’s not a single officer within the organization at that time who wouldn’t have eagerly taken my place,” Phil Reilly, a senior CIA paramilitary officer who served as Schroen’s deputy during the Jawbreaker mission, told USA Today .  “It was nerve-wracking, I have to be honest, because there were so many unknowns.” When the helicopter left Uzbekistan for Afghanistan the first time on Sept. 26, 2001, there were still concerns the Taliban might try to shoot it down. There were also fears that the Mi-17, which came off the production line in 1991, might not make the trip. A close-up of the 91101 marking., CIA “One of the things that held my attention all the way through was the hydraulic system for the tail rotor leaked,” another Jawbreaker team member, identified only as “Doc,” explained to USA Today . “This is the problem with flying a used helicopter. It’s kind of like wondering if it’s a lemon with a used car.” In one instance, CIA pilots flying the helicopter had to abort a mission after it became apparent the fuel filters had clogged and thankfully made it safely back to base. Fuel supplies, in general, were problematic and in one case pre-positioned stores turned out to be so old that the fuel had coagulated in the drums and was full of harmful debris, forcing CIA personnel to strain it through their socks. A closer look at 91101’s cockpit. The helicopter appears to be inside a hangar here and has its rotors stowed for transport., CIA The CIA’s Mi-17s, including 91101, continued to support the Jawbreaker mission into 2002. Schroen estimates that his team handed out $350,000 in cash on the very first night to North Alliance representatives so that they could be new equipment and cold weather clothing for their forces. The team had a total of $2.5 million to dole out as appropriate during that initial trip. Jawbreaker personnel also began sharing intelligence with Northern Alliance members, especially about there whereabouts of Bin Laden and other senior Al Qaeda members. Using GPS equipment they mapped out the disposition of friendly and hostile forces so that U.S. military combat aircraft, including B-52s , would know where to strike. They also helped U.S. Army Special Forces A-Teams, the first of which arrived in the country on Oct 19, 2001, link up with Northern Alliance Groups. The Jawbreaker personnel, along with additional joint CIA-U.S. military teams , continued to liaise with local forces and American special operators through the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001. A list of the A-Teams, or Operational Detachment Alphas (ODA), from the US Army’s 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) that deployed to Afghanistan in late 2001 and the Northern Alliance faction they were assigned to support., USMC Subsequent reviews of that debacle have concluded that the U.S. military’s decision not to commit more of its own forces to that campaign enabled Bin Laden and other senior Al Qaeda members to slip safely into neighboring Pakistan. Bin Laden would remain there in hiding until American special operators from SEAL Team Six killed him during a raid on his compound in May 2011. The CIA had been part of the interagency effort to find him that led up to that operation. 91101 continued flying in Afghanistan until 2012, according to the CIA. We don’t know whether or not it continued to serve the CIA’s paramilitary elements in other locales after that, but it only arrived at the Agency’s headquarters this year. The exact size of the CIA’s Mi-17 fleet in 2001, or at present, is unknown, too. An official U.S. military picture from March 2002 shows another one of the Agency’s Mi-17s, with the U.S. civil registration code N353MA, in Afghanistan during Operation Anaconda. That aircraft also features a satellite communications antenna on the tail. In December 2001 , Russian authorities arrested contractors working for a company called Maverick Aviation who were reportedly in Siberia attempting to purchase additional Mi-17s on behalf of the Army’s secretive Flight Concepts Division and the CIA. The firm had flown a Boeing 737 kitted out as a luxury aircraft to the city of Petropavlovsk, but two members of the crew did not have valid visas. The 16 passengers reportedly had tourist visas. American personnel unload wounded Northern Alliance fighters from N353MA in March 2002 during Operation Anaconda., DOD That information emerged as part of a subsequent U.S. federal government lawsuit against employees of Maverick over fraud and mismanagement of the deal. The court had instructed the two defendants, who appealed their convictions, that they could not mention the CIA, Afghanistan, or 9/11 in any context during their trial. Mi-17s continue to be a common sight in Afghanistan’s skies , though maybe not for much longer, at least with the Afghan Air Force. The U.S. military is helping the service with a program to replace the Russian-built Hips with American-made UH-60A+ Black Hawks, an entirely separate saga you can read about in more detail here . Unfortunately, 91101 looks set to get hidden away again. We may never get to see her again, that is unless the CIA decides to open its museum up to the public.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",US Troops Train With Tiny German Wiesel ‘Tankettes’ That Fit Inside A CH-53 Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NATO’s massive Trident Juncture exercise is providing an opportunity for the alliance’s member states and European partners to demonstrate their ability to operate together and share best practices on a scale not seen since the end of the Cold War. It’s also highlighting the unique capabilities certain countries have to offer, such as Germany’s tiny helicopter-portable Wiesel ‘tankette.’ On Oct. 27, 2018, just days after the drills formally began in and around Norway, U.S. Marines from the 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO) paired up with German troops and their Wiesels to familiarize themselves with each other’s capabilities. Then on Nov. 1, 2018, CH-53E Super Stallions from Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron Three Six Six (HMH-366) airlifted a battalion of Germany’s troops, along with some of the small tracked armored vehicles, during another specific drill within the larger exercise. Before Trident Juncture had even officially started, U.S. Army CH-47F Chinooks from the 12th Aviation Brigade teamed up with German light mechanized units to prepare for the drills . “Everything is more difficult in the cold, whether it’s waking up in the morning or even something as simple as going from your tent to the shower,” U.S. Marine Corps 1st Lieutenant Kyle Davis, who is overseeing American operations at Orland Airfield at Brekstad, Norway, said in an interview the service published on Nov. 2, 2018. “I think [Lieutenant General Mark Brilakis, the commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Command] said it best, ‘If you can do anything below zero you can do anything anywhere.’” In Norway’s frigid climate, especially outside of areas with established road networks, mobility on the ground can be especially challenging. It can be difficult in general to move traditional unarmored or unarmored vehicles rapidly into remote, rugged environments. The U.S. Marines and Army do both have vehicles intended specifically for operations in snowy and extreme cold weather conditions, but there are only a small number of them and they’re aging and increasingly hard to maintain. Both services are in the process of looking for a replacement . So, it’s perhaps not surprising that the German Wiesel, or Weasel in English, has had a chance to provide American Marines and Army infantry with mobility and light fire support during parts of the drills that have taken them to Norway’s rural backcountry. The German Army, or Heer , first began development of the vehicle in the 1970s to give added firepower to its airborne units. https://youtube.com/watch?v=LOLenPYRZFw Legendary car company Porsche initially led the project and, due to foreign interest in the vehicle, continued work even after the Heer abandoned its plans for the vehicle in 1975. The German Army ultimately returned to the Wiesel and bought its first batch in 1985, becoming the only country to adopt the type. Rheinmetall took over series production and built more than 340 examples before the line went cold in 1993. In 2001, the Heer purchased nearly 180 lengthened Wiesel 2s. A German Army Wiesel 1., Bundeswehr Porsche and Rheinmetall tried to keep things as simple and lightweight as possible, using a standard four-cylinder diesel car engine from Volkswagen . The Wiesels can reach a top speed of over 40 miles per hour and travel around 120 miles on one tank of gas, which is relatively impressive when you consider their diminutive size. To say that the German vehicles are light is an understatement. There are more than a dozen variants in total and the heaviest of them weighs less than five tons. For comparison, the latest examples of up-armored Humvee weigh around six tons. The U.S. military’s new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is even heavier. German Army Wiesels on the street in Belgium during a separate training exercise in 2016, giving a good sense of their size., Bundeswehr The Wiesel is also narrower than either of those vehicles. This means you can cram two of the standard variant inside a CH-53 series helicopter and at least one into a CH-47. Heavy helicopters can carry more slung below their fuselages, too. Even small cargo planes such as the C-160 Transall can carry more than one of the miniature armored vehicles. The Wiesels offer a significant amount of capability for their size. The most common version is a reconnaissance vehicle with a 20mm automatic cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun, more firepower than many American light armored vehicles. Another type packs a TOW anti-tank missile launcher. The Leichtes Flugabwehr System , or Light Air Defense System includes a command post Wiesel 2 variant and another one of the vehicles with a small radar. This last component of the system is known as Ozelot , or Ocelot, and features a launcher containing four FIM-92 Stinger heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles. This is a level of small, mobile, but still somewhat protected short-range air defense capability that few nations have . The Ozelot , a Wiesel 2 variant armed with a Stinger missile launcher., Thomas Hartwig via Wikimedia There’s another group of variants that form a mobile mortar section, including a vehicle with computerized 120mm mortar . There are also more capable command post versions for unit headquarters, along with ambulances and engineering support types, including at least one prototype with a ground penetrating radar to spot improvised explosive devices. There were also plans for a version with a recoilless 30mm automatic cannon and an unmanned ground combat vehicle variant, but those haven’t gone into production. That’s not to say that the vehicles don’t have disadvantages. Their light weight comes at the cost of armor protection and the Wiesels only shield their occupants against shrapnel, rifle, and light machine gun fire at most. They are also vulnerable to mines and roadside bombs. But they definitely offer more mobility than walking and more firepower than dismounted troops can easily bring to bear on their own. They’re no more vulnerable than the specialized light vehicles the U.S. military has procured to allow light and special operations forces to quickly drive on and off helicopters and their tracks offer a big mobility advantage in certain environments. Their small size does mean they present less of a target and can more readily conceal themselves, too. A Wiesel with a ground penetrating radar to spot mines and improvised explosive devices., Bundeswehr For Marine ANGLICO units , charged with operating near to the front lines to call in air strikes and fire support and coordinate with other U.S. and allied forces, having the extra mobility and local protection would be a definite benefit. The ability to rapidly deploy the small armored vehicles into remote areas could provide distinct benefits during raids and other short-duration operations. It’s a unique capability the often cash-strapped German military seems keen to preserve, too. In June 2017 , German contractor Flensburger Fahzeugbau Gesellschaft won a competition to produce upgrade packages for the original Wiesel vehicles. A row of Wiesels during a training exercise in Germany in 2015., US Army These kits will include new, lightweight armor and composite rubber tracks to replace the existing steel ones, along with a host of other product improvements. The goal was to have the first three updated prototypes ready by October 2018, but we don’t know if they got delivered on schedule. The German Army is also looking to replace its aging CH-53G helicopters , with Sikorsky’s CH-53K King Stallion and Boeing’s CH-47F being the major contenders, which could improve its ability to employ the upgraded Wiesels. The hope is definitely that these and other modernization efforts the German military desperately needs will continue as planned. After the Cold War, the country led its armed forces atrophy and has struggled in recent years to reverse that trend . After a relatively minor boost in the defense budget for the 2019 fiscal year, Germany is now on track to add more than $6.5 billion in military spending in the following fiscal cycle. The German government wants to spend in 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense by 2024. NATO has set a standing two percent GDP defense spending target for all of its members, few of which have reached it already . With any luck, if nothing else, we’ll be seeing German troops driving their modernized tankettes out of the back of helicopters for years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2019",China Reveals Short-Range Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile Designed To Dodge Enemy Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China is hardly a stranger to developing medium- and intermediate-range anti-ship ballistic missiles with maneuvering warheads to help exert authority over its broad territorial claims and deny opponents access to wide areas during potential regional conflicts . Now the Chinese have unveiled a new, short-range ballistic missile that could arm shore batteries, its future Type 055 destroyers , and make its way onto the export market as well. The state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) publicly unveiled the new missile, called the CM-401 , at the biennial Zhuhai Airshow , which officially kicked off on Nov. 6, 2018, and also serves as a general arms expo. CASIC had two launch platforms on display at the event, an 8×8 truck-mounted type with two missiles inside self-contained launch canisters and what appeared to be a deck launcher for ships, also with two self-contained missiles. There are few detailed specifics about the weapon and its launchers so far, but observers believe that the missile itself has a maximum diameter of approximately 2.8 feet. This is similar to that of the Russian Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile . The CM-401’s general shape looks similar to Russia’s missile, but it appears to be smaller overall. The diameter estimate is based on the known dimensions of CASIC’s YJ-62/C-602 ground-launched cruise missile and its associated launch platform. The company had put one of these weapon systems on display right behind the CM-401. A mockup of the CM-401 missile in its launcher canister., Chinese Internet Per CASIC’s display, their new missile has a minimum range of around nine miles and a maximum range of just over 180 miles. This puts it firmly in the short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) category, which typically refers to any such weapon with a range of fewer than 620 miles. The U.S. military also uses the term “close-range ballistic missile” (CRBM) to cover weapons with a range of fewer than 186 miles. Graphics associated with the CM-401 suggest it has a “porpoising” or “skip-glide” trajectory that involves the warhead abruptly pulling up at least once as it begins the terminal stage of its flight. This maneuver could extend the range of a ballistic weapon, but has only ever been used to give the warhead a much more irregular flight path and allow it to adjust its course. A Chinese graphic showing a ballistic missile with a skip-glide trajectory associated with the CM-401., Chinese Internet This, in turn, makes it harder for an opponent to try and intercept the warhead. The CM-401’s terminal speed, which CASIC says is between Mach 4 and 6, would also help it break through enemy defenses to reach its target. The launch platform reportedly has the ability to fire its two missiles on different trajectories against either one or two targets at once, again increasing the difficulty for the defender to respond to the incoming threat. This maneuvering capability is also what allows the warhead to engage large, relatively slow-moving targets, such as aircraft carriers and other major surface combatant and logistics ships . A cutaway of the mockup CM-401 missile that CASIC showed off at Zhuhai shows what appears to be a phased array radar in the nose so that the warhead can actively home in on those types of targets during its terminal phase. The CM-401 missile mockup, with a cutaway showing what appears to be a phased array radar in the nose., Chinese Internet CASIC says that the CM-401 has a secondary land attack function that could benefit from its defense-breaking maneuvering capability, as well. This could be particularly beneficial for ship-launched versions, giving the weapon added flexibility over existing, dedicated anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles. The display at Zhuhai suggested the missile could be a future part of the arsenal on board China’s Type 055 destroyers , which are already a modern and capable design that you can read about in more detail here . There is no indication about how many two-missile launchers each ship might carry or whether the vessels might employ an entirely different launch system, such as a vertical launcher. There are also questions given the missile’s size, shape, and skip-glide trajectory about whether the stated maximum range truly reflects the weapon’s actual capabilities. Some observers have indicated that the CM-401, or a variant thereof, might actually be able to reach targets close to 620 miles away, though this seems unlikely given the missile’s size. That doesn’t mean the weapon might not be able to fly further than 180 or so miles, though. The reason China might want to understate its range would have to do with the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), a voluntary arrangement between 35 different countries not to export missiles that can carry a 1,100 pound payload more than 186 miles away. The Chinese government is not a formal party to this agreement, but has said on numerous occasions that it still follows these guidelines as a matter of state policy. China’s first Type 055 destroyer at its launcher ceremony., AP If the specifics are accurate, the CM-401 would be exportable under the MTCR’s limitations. It is also possible that CASIC could make export variants with deliberately reduced range, while providing the longer-range versions to the Chinese military itself. Though it would have a shorter range than ground-launched YJ-62 and YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, the CM-401’s higher terminal speed and ability to dodge enemy defenses would make it a valuable part of Chinese military’s layered anti-ship defenses, particularly in the South China Sea. Situated on any of China’s man-made islands in that region, the anti-ship ballistic missiles would be able to reach targets throughout much of the region. Launchers on the Chinese mainland would also be able to hit opponents in the East China Sea, where China has increasingly found itself at odds with Japan over conflicting territorial claims . From those same positions, the CM-401s would be able to hit targets in the Taiwan Strait and on the other side of the island , further putting the Taiwanese Navy’s limited surface combatants at risk. Very few countries have any sort of maritime ballistic missile defense capability at all. Arming Type 055 destroyers, or other ships, with the CM-401s would only expand the Chinese military’s ability to bring their capabilities to bear in a conflict. It would open up entirely new potential vectors for attack and allow China to simply fire the weapons outside the often narrow coverage area of an opponent’s anti-missile defenses , to begin with. If it turns out that the missiles do have a range of more than 600 miles, land- and sea-based examples would present an even more serious threat in every one of these scenarios. Ship-launched variants with greater range would also present a challenge for China’s opponents in the Pacific region broadly and possibly beyond as time goes on. The development of air-launched ballistic missiles is also becoming increasingly widespread, with China itself reportedly developing an aerial version of the anti-ship variant of the DF-21 with a version of the H-6 bomber as the launch platform. Russia has adapted the Iskander-M into an air-launched anti-ship capable weapon that modified MiG-31 Foxhound interceptors can carry, as well. The CM-401 might prove to be a good starting place for a similar aerial missile. Chinese DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missiles on more common road-mobile transporter-erector-launchers., Imaginechina via AP There are a number of foreign customers that could be interested in an MTCR-compliant variant, too. The most obvious is China’s long-time ally Pakistan, which faces a standing numerical disadvantage in ships against its most likely regional opponent, India. The Indian Navy is hoping to get its second aircraft carrier by 2023 and is planning to build a third some time afterward. Pakistani land-based CM-401s could force those ships to operate further offshore during a crisis and Pakistan’s ships armed with these missiles could present a new type of threat to India’s capital ships. Another possible export customer might be Saudi Arabia, which has bought Chinese DF-3 ballistic missiles in the past and has reportedly at least looked into buying more modern DF-21s in recent years. The cramped confines of the Persian Gulf mean would make the CM-401 a formidable weapon against ships and targets on land in any potential skirmish with Iran. The CM-401 may reflect a larger growth in interest in this type of capability both within the Chinese military and among its foreign partners. The state-owned Chinese Aerospace and Technology Corporation (CASC) also brought an anti-ship missile, the A/MGG-20B, derived from its DF-12/M20 short-range ballistic missile to Zhuhai, though there are few details about its exact capabilities. Guangdong Hongda Mining Company also brought a model of its HD-1 ramjet-powered high-supersonic anti-ship cruise missile to the airshow. The company claimed that it had test-fired the weapon, which they dubbed a “carrier killer” and uses a booster to get to the necessary for optimal operation of its solid-fueled integral rocket ramjet motor, for the first time in October 2018 . The HD-1 appears to be primarily aimed at competing with the Russo-Indian BrahMos on the export market, but it could also present an alternative to the lower supersonic YJ-12 series . There are no independently verifiable details on which to judge Guangdong Hongda’s claims that their missile is more capable and cheaper than the BrahMos. All told, China looks to be aggressively exploring its options to expand its shore- and sea-based anti-ship missile capabilities as its military works to reinforce its various territorial claims spread out across the Pacific Ocean, otherwise assert its regional authority, and even take on an increasingly global role. The Chinese government is also clearly keen to find ways to make these weapons accessible to their allies and partners abroad.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",China Reveals Prototype Configuration Of Jam Resistant And Counter-Stealth ‘Quantum Radar’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China claims to have revealed a prototype of an advanced quantum radar that is resistant to jamming and may be able to detect stealth aircraft . The system’s operation is rooted in proven science and could be game-changing, but the Chinese still face significant development challenges in turning it into an operational capability. The state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) brought a mockup of their quantum radar , which might have also been only a smaller scale model, to the biennial Zhuhai Airshow, which opened its doors on Nov. 6, 2018, and has a wide array of military technology on display. CETC says that its 14th Research Institute has been working on the system for years and first tested it in 2015. The new type of radar “is expected to solve the traditional bottleneck [of] detection of low observable target detection, survival under electronic warfare conditions, platform load limitations, etc.,” according to a CETC brochure, which a reporter for Aviation Week obtained at Zhuhai. That same journalist attempted to attend a press conference about the system, but was asked to leave after officials informed them it was for Chinese media only. The basic principle behind a quantum radar isn’t overly complex in of itself. A traditional radar emits a beam of electromagnetic energy, which then reflects off objects in the distance, allowing the entire system to register their return signiture and position with varying degrees of specificity. A quantum radar does essentially the same thing, but using photons that are “ entangled ” together after a single beam of light is split in half. One of the two new beams passes through a converter that sends the particles traveling onward at a microwave frequency to bounce off objects like a normal radar. The full system would convert the particles back into the visible frequency as they returned to the radar’s receiver. The second beam doesn’t do much actively, but serves an immensely important purpose. A phenomenon called quantum entanglement means that the pairs of photons that appear at the point a beam of light is split otherwise have a tendency to operate identically regardless of how far they are apart. What this means is that the quantum radar should be able to register the paired photons in both streams and record only the signals it gets back from particles that have a partner. This would make the system more accurate since it would be able to quickly eliminate signals from other sources, such as ground clutter when tracking targets at low altitude or operating in a maritime role. In the video below, a researcher at the Dutch research institute TNO explains the basic principles behind a quantum radar. In principle, this would also give a quantum radar the ability to immediately disregard outside radio frequency “noise,” make it far less vulnerable to traditional jamming, which often involves flooding the receiver with so many signals, or sending out false or misleading signals, that it is impossible to distinguish targets of interest. In the inverse, the photons may not necessarily trigger existing radar warning receivers on hostile aircraft, leaving their crew unaware that someone has detected and is tracking them. On top of these benefits, the quantum radar should be able to identify stealth planes , missiles , and ships . Existing radar absorbent materials are not specifically designed to absorb or defuse these particles. Stealthy shapes might still deflect the photons and cause them to lose energy to some degree, but the system’s ability to isolate only the activities of the entangled photons theoretically means that it should be able to detect even a very weak signal by cutting out all of the background noise. These same basic principles of quantum entanglement, if scientists can truly harness them, may have other military applications, as well. China is also reportedly developing satellites carrying “ ghost imaging ” cameras, which might be able to take pictures of stealth aircraft from space, even at night. You can read more about that proposed system here . An image US Army scientists produced using a ghost imaging camera during a test., US Army A network of quantum radars could provide an important defense against China’s potential opponents, chiefly the United States. The U.S. military is investing significant resources into stealth aircraft, such as the U.S. Air Force’s future B-21 Raider and existing B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and the tri-service F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . The U.S. military is also waking up to the need to improve its electronic warfare capabilities, with various systems, such as the U.S. Navy’s Next Generation Jammer , now in development. CETC claims that it has demonstrated its quantum radar and detected targets out to 60 miles during tests on China’s Northwestern Plateau. The firm has not given any details about the test targets or the exact parameters of the experiment, such what other natural or man-made obstacles might have been present, or images or video showing the full system in operation. These are important factors for judging the true performance of CETC’s prototype. While photons experience quantum entanglement, they also suffer from a related phenomenon known as quantum decoherence . At extended ranges, the link between the particles becomes less pronounced and they may break free entirely, eliminating any potential benefits from recording the movements of the shared streams. A B-2 stealth bomber, one of the aircraft a practical quantum radar might be able to readily detect., USAF At that point, the quantum radar is essentially just a normal radar using a different type of energy beam. Scientists have posited that the process of converting the one stream of photons to a microwave frequency would help prevent decoherence. Still, an operational quantum radar might need to be relatively large and have a significant power source in order to generate a beam of particles that is powerful enough to detect targets at extended distances. We have no way of knowing how large CETC’s experimental prototype actually is. This, in turn, would make them prime targets for an opponent in the opening phases of a conflict. Size and power requirements also present challenges for low-frequency anti-stealth radars that China , Russia , and others have been exploring , as well. Those arrays are large and generally immobile. Their detection capabilities are also limited to identifying the presence of a stealth aircraft in a broad area and under certain conditions. Pairing them with quantum radars could produce a valuable layered sensor network in the future. Linked together, a low-frequency radar would cue the quantum radar to search a specific vector for a more accurate bead on a stealthy target. A Chinese JY-27A low-frequency anti-stealth radar., Imaginechina via AP Despite its obvious optimism about quantum radar, CETC was still careful in how it described the actual state of its prototype, too. The work, so far, has “laid an important theoretical and experimental basis for further research,” the brochure Aviation Week obtained noted. While the benefits of quantum radar are clearly enough for China to continue investing in the concept, but it remains to be seen when, if ever, they’ll be able to move it out of the laboratory and onto the battlefield. The technology is likely still years away from reaching a practical state. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Airborne Sensors Stealth"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",New 3D Audio Will Allow A-10 Pilots To Hear Alerts Come From The Direction Of The Threat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The future of the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft is as uncertain as ever , but the service continues to upgrade portions of the fleet . Now, between 150 and 200 A-10s look set to receive a major cockpit audio update that will help manage radio communications and, similar to surround sound in a movie theater, issue directional auditory warnings that immediately draw the pilot’s attention in a specific direction toward a threat or other area of interest. On Nov. 5, 2018, Air Force Materiel Command announced plans to award a sole-source contract to Danish defense contractor Terma for the purchase of that company’s Aircraft Audio Management System (AAMS). The Air Force had first indicated that it was looking for a three-dimensional audio update for a portion of its A-10s in December 2017 . The stated goal of the Warthog upgrade program is to “to drastically improve the spatial, battlespace, and situational awareness of the A-10C pilots,” according to the original contracting notice. Terma says its system provides those capabilities , as well as helping trim pilot workload, reduce hearing loss and operational fatigue, and improving intelligibility of audio signals and communications to the pilot. Terma’s AAMS couples a stereo headset with a digital audio control system that links into various aircraft systems. It’s become quite popular over the years and is in service with the Danish Air Force on its F-16 Viper fighter jets and with the Royal Air Force, paired with BAE’s Striker II helmet-mounted display, for pilots flying the Eurofighter Typhoon . Other F-16 operators , including the U.S. Air Force , are set to integrate the three-dimensional audio system into their Vipers, as well. An A-10 Warthog., USAF It’s most basic functionality gives pilots the choice to program individual audio sources to sound like they’re coming from one specific direction or another. This means that in a plane with multiple radios, such as the A-10, the system to pipe those feeds in as if the speaker was standing in a specific position relative to the pilot, segregating the individual audio streams and distinctively separating them from other tonal alerts and noise in the cockpit in the process. This makes it easier to identify who the speaker might be based on what radio they’re calling in on and allow the pilot to focus attention on one conversation rather than another. This is a more natural way of communicating just like you might do in real life in a room where multiple people are talking to you from different directions. “Beforehand, years back, all these different sounds were presented to the pilot in one big blob, if you will, and it was very difficult to discriminate one signal from the other.” H.P. Bagger, a Danish Air Force F-16 pilot and the Master Chief of that service’s Fighter Branch, said in a promotional video for the audio system in 2013. “Sometimes you would miss a very important radio call because it was – maybe you were focusing your ears on a warning sign.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=hMPoZFCPhrk That same programmable functionality also means that the AAMS can issue warnings and other alerts to the pilot in such a way that they sound like they’re coming from the appropriate direction. That position remains constant, accurate to within 15 degrees of the specific direction, even if the aviator moves their head. So, for example, instead of a tone going off in the cockpit and a control panel display showing the direction of an incoming missile, the pilot now immediately gets a sense of where the danger is coming from. “One knows the feeling of hearing e.g. a door slam behind and instinctively and immediately knowing the position. If this was heard in a mono headset, one would not have a clue where the door was,” Terma’s website explains . “So, to provide the same level of information in a mono headset, one would need to add a statement like ‘behind you’ and such a statement takes time to speak and to understand. It should be obvious that hearing the actual door slamming is a lot faster to understand.” For the A-10 specifically, the Air Force said it wanted the new audio system to integrate and communicate messages and other information from all of the plane’s existing radios. This includes the AN/ARS-6(V)12 Lightweight Airborne Recovery System (LARS), which the service began installing on active component Warthogs in 2017 . Another A-10 warthog., USAF This radio is specifically set up to provide improved communication with downed pilots , pararescuemen , and joint terminal air controllers on the ground. It is a particularly important upgrade for the A-10 in regards to the combat search and rescue armed escort, or “Sandy” mission set , where the planes would be escorting rotorcraft to and from a crash site and providing close air support throughout that mission. Close air support missions in any scenario are often especially tense, with the pilot trying to juggle information from personnel on the ground who may themselves be frantically trying to communicate key details while defending themselves against hostile forces. Giving Warthog pilots a way to better focus their attention could dramatically improve their ability to provide support where and when friendly forces on the ground need it the most. It may even be possible for the system to help indicate to the pilot where the fighting is going on down below, helping them get in position faster for an attack run. The video below gives a good sense of all the radio chatter and other noise an A-10 pilot has to wade through during an actual close air support mission supporting troops under fire on the ground. The Air Force also wants Terma’s audio equipment on the Warthogs to be able to issue three-dimensional directional alerts based on information from the pilot’s helmet-mounted sight and the aircraft’s Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) and defensive countermeasures systems, including its radar warning receivers. Altogether, the audio upgrade will help shorten the time it takes for an A-10 pilot to react to threats, reduces their workload by allowing them to not have to constantly check various indicators on control panels in the cockpit, and simply ease the general racket of flying in a combat aircraft. In regards to that latter point, the Danish contractor says the more pin-pointed audio lowers the risk of serious hearing loss over time compared to a constant jumble of sounds layered one on top of the other. Though this Air Force contract would be limited to adding this system to the A-10, the equipment would offer benefits for all of the service’s aircraft. Other U.S. military services would undoubtedly be interested in the benefits, as well. The improved directional audio system would be just as beneficial for rotary wing aircraft, including attack and rescue helicopters , as fixed-wing types, too. Boeing has already proposed adding in a similar system into the cockpit of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, as well as foreign customers. Raytheon has also been working on their own three-dimensional audio arrangement since at least 2013. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PPvMC6xe_Eo We don’t know when the Air Force expects to begin taking delivery of the Terma audio systems or how long it will take to install them into the A-10s, but it may not be long before Warthog pilots, and other U.S. military aviators, start hearing radio calls and tonal alerts flying around them from different directions in the cockpit.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 30, 2018",Russia Admits It Doesn’t Have Any Dry Docks That Can Fit Its Lone Carrier After Accident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has officially confirmed that it does not have any facilities that can service its lone carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , after the country’s massive PD-50 floating dry dock sank in October 2018. State-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation, or USC, says that it is looking into alternatives for servicing the flattop, but those substitutes could be months, if not years away from becoming operational. USC chief executive Alexei Rakhmanov provided the new details while talking with reporters on Nov. 7, 2018 . PD-50, one of the largest floating dry docks in the world, sank at the 82nd Shipbuilding Plant at Roslyakovo near Murmansk on Oct. 30, 2018 . At the time, Kuznetsov was on board undergoing a major overhaul and the carrier sustained damage during the incident. “We have alternatives actually for all the ships except for Admiral Kuznetsov ,” Rakhmanov explained . “We hope that the issue of the docking … will be resolved in the near future. We are also preparing several alternatives, about which we will report to the Industry and Trade Ministry.” Russia’s most likely course of action will be to try and refloat and repair any damage to PD-50. The cause of the accident was reportedly an electrical malfunction that left the pumps in the dry dock’s ballast tanks stuck on, causing it to sink rapidly. Kuznetsov sits in PD-50., Christopher Michel via Wikimedia Commons “Instructions have already been given to set up a commission that would carefully look into the causes, calculate damages and outline response measures,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov had told reporters on Oct. 31, 2018 . “This is up to the commission to decide, but the ‘yes,’ answer is more likely than ‘no,’” he added when asked about working to get PD-50 back into operation. The dock may have simply settled softly to the bottom of Kola Bay and have not suffered any major structural damage, but it’s not meant to rest on uneven land and could have come down at an angle. Pictures we have seen of it right before it submerged showed it listing heavily, so this is a real possibility. Any protracted time spent fully underwater will almost certainly lead to major issues with its apparently already problematic electrical and mechanical systems. Russia says it intends to force “the side that will be found guilty of allowing the incident to happen” to pay for any recovery effort, according to TASS . Russia's only aircraft carrier damaged after crane falls on it https://t.co/f328GOBlC4 pic.twitter.com/zc12flXxqx — Reuters U.S. News (@ReutersUS) October 30, 2018 Refloating anything can be an arduous task, to begin with, even before considering the environmental factors at play in Kola Peninsula region. Situated above the arctic circle, but in the path of the Gulf Stream , the average ambient temperatures in the Summer do get to an average of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, but may not ever get above freezing during the winter months. The water temperature is colder in either case. Four shipyard employees suffered hypothermia after escaping the sinking PD-50 during the accident. Together with any high winds or other inclement weather and that the dock may be sitting nearly 100 feet below the surface, divers could find it challenging to perform various tasks and do so for protracted periods of time , dragging out the process of just getting the dry dock back to the surface. Small submersibles or unmanned underwater vehicles could help mitigate these issues, but would only add the array of specialized assets necessary for the recovery operation. An opinion piece in Interfax argued that Russia should not attempt to raise the PD-50. Although most of the PD-50 is at a depth of 30 m, it is apparently close to falling into a pit with a depth of 100 meters. https://t.co/LRXvu1PxBz — Rob Lee (@RALee85) November 2, 2018 What happens after PD-50 comes back up from the bottom of the Kola Bay is unclear, too. Trying to repair it while it afloat, especially if its seriously damaged, could be problematic and there’s no easy way to get it ashore for maintenance. An unnamed defense industry source told TASS that PD-50 could be out of commission for at least six months . Without PD-50, it’s unclear what other alternatives Russia might have for servicing the Kuznetsov . Rakhmanov has now acknowledged that the PD-190 floating dry dock , situated at Novorossiysk on the Black Sea is not a viable substitute as some had suggested could be the case. Russia lacks any fixed shipbuilding or dry dock facilities able to accommodate the carrier, as well. Ukrainian shipyards built the Kuznetsov , as well as all of the Soviet Union’s other flattops. The need for the capacity to repair the carrier nearer to its Northern Fleet homeport in Severomorsk likely helped prompt the Soviets to purchase PD-50 from neutral Sweden in the 1980s, to begin with. There’s no indication that USC has the ability to produce a similarly sized floating dry dock itself. The cool state of the Kremlin’s relations with its Swedish counterparts , along with international sanctions , make it very unlikely that Russia would be able to buy another example from that Scandinavian country or any other member of the European Union. If Russia were able to source a new large floating dry dock from another country, it would still take time to build and deliver it to Murmansk. Russian state oil and gas company Rosneft , which has been operating the 82nd Shipbuilding Plant since 2015 and manages operations at other shipyards across the country, does plan to open a massive dry dock in Russia’s Far East in 2020. This facility at the Zvezda Shipyard in Bolshoy Kamen near Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan will reportedly be nearly 1,600 feet long and more than 370 feet wide. A view of part of the Zvezda Shipyard, including a smaller floating dry dock., Office of the President of Russia Intended to service massive oil and liquid natural gas tankers, it should be able to accommodate the Kuznetsov . But that dry dock is still at least two years away from opening its gates, though, with workers only beginning to pour the first concrete in September 2018. It also sits thousands of miles away from the flattop’s home port, calling into question how readily it would ever be able to support the flattop’s routine operations. Workers at Zvezda have no experience working on an aircraft carrier, either, yet along the Kuznetsov’s unique and dated systems. One final option the Russians might have would be to reach out to the Chinese and seek their assistance in servicing and sustaining the Kuznestov in the future . China purchased Kuznetsov ‘s sister ship, the half-built Varyag , from Ukraine and subsequently completed her and put her into service as the Liaoning . In 2017, that country’s Dailan Shipbuilding Industry launched another Kuznetsov -like clone further demonstrating its understanding and ability to work with the design. Still, the idea of Moscow forking over their only carrier to China for servicing would be embarrassing, to say the least, and doing so wouldn’t support Russia’s crucial shipyard workforce. PLAN Type 002 carrier and #16 'Liaoning' together at Dalian pic.twitter.com/vHZMPpH8kV — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) May 27, 2018 When it comes to Russia’s only aircraft carrier, the real question is whether or not this mishap provides the impetus for the country to finally abandon the often unreliable , dated , sometimes dangerous , and debatably useful ship entirely as well as its air wing. That Kuznetsov ‘s fate is so closely linked to that of PD-50 highlights the continuing difficulties the Russian Navy will face in maintaining the flattop in the long term even if they get the floating dry dock back into service in a timely manner. There are also still serious concerns about how even the temporary loss of PD-50 will impact the Russian Navy’s maintenance schedules for other large ships and submarines, as well. The dry dock provides vital repair capacity for Russia’s Northern Fleet as a whole, especially its large submarines. A ship sails through the part of the Kola Bay where PD-50 sank., Lev Fedoseyev/TASS The loss of PD-50 “creates certain inconveniences. In actual fact, this was one of the largest docks in the world,” USC’s Rakhmanov conceded . “Our enterprises are in operation, [including] the Nerpa [Ship Repair Factory]. After all, we can perform certain docking works in Severodvinsk, not far from Murmansk. We don’t feel any special problems in this regard,” he insisted. However, TASS itself noted that the shipbuilding executive did not mention how many other vessels were already waiting for their turn in PD-50 after Kuznetsov ’s overhaul was complete. That work was originally supposed to finish up in 2021 and it now seems less likely that Russia will be able to keep to that timeline. The time it takes to refloat the dry dock, get it operational again, and finally finish the work on Kuznetsov could easily have a cascading impact and sideline various other ships for extended periods of time. In addition, just because USC has other facilities that are physically capable of servicing most of Russia’s other major ships and submarines in the meantime doesn’t mean those shipyards and dry docks have the schedule capacity to do so. We have already seen how this can play out with the U.S. Navy, which has experienced similar maintenance logjams that have been particularly pronounced in its submarine community, leaving boats pierside for months at a time. The Los Angeles -class attack submarine USS Boise will have been out of commission for the better part of three years by the time it gets back into service in 2019 . Whatever the state of PD-50 is if and when the Russians successfully refloat it, the country’ Northern Fleet looks set to experience a major gap in maintenance capacity in the coming months, if not longer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 5, 2019",Boeing Is Selling Off Its Historic C-17 Production Line Facility In Long Beach,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing is looking to sell the facilities in Long Beach, California where it built the C-17A Globemaster III cargo aircraft. This will bring a more definitive end to the company’s serial production of military aircraft in Southern California and makes it even less likely that it would restart production of the airlifters in response to emerging U.S. Air Force demands . At the same time, that space could be very attractive to up-and-coming space launch firms, such as Virgin Orbit or SpaceX , who might be looking to expand their operations and there have also been proposals for a more dramatic overhaul of the area. The Chicago-headquartered plane maker put the property on the market with the help of real estate brokerage NKF Capital Markets on Nov. 5, 2018 . The nearly four million square foot plot of land adjacent to Long Beach Airport includes the 1.1 million square foot main assembly building where workers built just shy of 280 C-17s for the U.S. Air Force and more than a half dozen foreign customers. So far, there is no public asking price for the property. McDonnell Douglas had developed and first started production of the C-17 at the site in 1991. Boeing bought that firm in 1997, taking over the Globemaster III program and the production facilities in the process. Before that, the Long Beach plant had a storied history stretching back to World War II when the Douglas Aircraft Company received a contract to build late-model Boeing B-17 bombers to support the war effort. Aircraft production at the site continued after the war and the hangars and production lines churned out McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airliners in the 1980s. US Air Force C-17s., USAF Though Boeing still provides C-17 related maintenance and other services in Southern California, the production facilities at Long Beach have been idle since the last Globemaster III left the plant in 2015 . With the U.S. Air Force looking to expand its airlift capability, there had been talk of whether the production line might start up again, but this is a virtual non-starter, as The War Zone ’s own Tyler Rogoway recently explained in depth . Even when the RAND Corporation conducted a detailed analysis in 2012 of what it might cost to reboot C-17 production after a multi-year pause – close to $8 billion to support the production of up to 150 new derivatives with improved fuel efficiency – the think tank assumed that Boeing would build those planes somewhere else rather than Long Beach. As early as 2008, the plane maker had largely decided that it was not cost-effective to keep the Southern California plant open for any purpose after it built the final Globemaster III, according to a separate report from the Government Accountability Office . Concept art from 2010 showing the proposed C-17 Fuel Efficient, or C-17FE, as compared to the original C-17A., Boeing Boeing won’t solicit the first round of official bids on the property until the beginning of December 2018, NKF Capital Markets told the Los Angeles Times . As such, we don’t know who might be interested in taking over the expensive space on offer. Interest from space launch firms that might see immediate value in the large hangars and other workspaces the site already has, is one a distinct possibility. In 2012, Boeing sold off Douglas Park, another portion of the former McDonnell Douglas complex, to real estate developer Sares-Regis Group. Long Beach Airport. The facilities that previously housed the C-17 production line are to the left. A C-17 is actually visible next to the main assembly plant in this satellite image from 2015., Google Earth Virgin Orbit , a division of billionaire Richard Branson’s multi-national Virgin Group business empire, is now headquartered in that office park. This company is developing a capability to launch small satellites into orbit using an air-launched rocket called LauncherOne and a modified Boeing 747 airliner known as Cosmic Girl. Cosmic Girl will carry LauncherOne under its wing using a pylon attached the plane’s existing mounting hard point under port wing, which it has in order to be able to ferry spare engines from one location to another. You can read more about the aircraft and that capability here . On Oct. 24, 2018, Virgin Orbit attached LauncherOne to Cosmic Girl for the first time for a fit check ahead of a planned first launch sometime later in November 2018. This event occurred at Long Beach Airport. With all this in mind, Virgin Orbit might be interested in expanding its footprint near the airport and gaining larger aviation-related facilities that might be well suited to its operations. Branson would certainly have the funds to make a competitive offer to buy the old C-17 production site. But the private space launch sector, including companies focused on more traditional rocket launches and firms looking to develop lower-cost , air-launched options , is growing in response to both private and U.S. government demands . SpaceX , headquartered in nearby Hawthorne California, might be another interested party. There’s always the possibility that a real estate firm or some other corporation might turn the space into an office park. Google purchased the hangar that once held the Howard Hughes’ massive “ Spruce Goose ” flying boat in Los Angeles’ Playa Vista neighborhood and is in the process of turning it into office space , as well. An artist’s conception of how the hangar where Hughes Aircraft built the Spruce Goose might look after becoming “The Hangar,” an office park. , Holliday Fenoglio Fowler The City of Long Beach itself has been looking to acquire the area as part of an urban revitalization project called the “Globemaster Corridor,” according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram . This would see the property become a sort of hybrid commercial-public area complete with parks and other recreational spaces. “We are evaluating options for the future of the site in the best interest of Boeing and the community,” C.J. Nothum, a Boeing spokesperson told the newspaper in June 2018. “There are details at this point we can’t disclose.” It will be interesting to see whether the property will continue to be connected to the aerospace sector or whether it will retain that link in name only. Whatever happens, it seems clear that Boeing has no intention of building C-17s at the plant ever again.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 8, 2018",Badly Damaged Norwegian Frigate Intentionally Ran Aground After Tanker Collision (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We still don’t know many details surrounding what appears to be a particularly desperate incident that occurred near Bergen, Norway overnight, but in this case, a picture is worth a thousand words. The Aegis combat system equipped Norwegian frigate Helge Ingstad had a collision with the oil tanker Sola and suffered significant damage. According to reports and the photo in the embedded tweet below, the damage was so bad that the captain ordered the ship’s crew to run the vessel aground near the entry to a fjord to keep it from sinking. The photo shows the vessel grounded and listing badly with its stern sitting very low in the water and a giant gash running down the starboard side of its hull. Helge Ingstad had been participating in the massive Trident Juncture wargames taking place primarily off the coast of Norway. Some accounts state it the frigate was returning to port when the incident occurred. At this time we have no information as to how many sailors were injured or worse as a result of the accident and we still don’t know the status of the oil tanker aside from the fact that its transponder shows it sitting idle across from where the grounding occurred. The Malta flagged tanker is a monster at roughly 820 feet in length. The 440 foot long Helge Ingstad displaces 5,290 tons and is one of five in the Fridtjof Nansen class that serve with the Royal Norwegian Navy. They are considered the most advanced combat vessels in the service’s inventory and are equipped with an eight-cell Mk41 vertical launch system (VLS) that can hold up to 32 RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs), eight Naval Strike Missiles in their own launchers, four torpedo tubes armed with Stingray torpedoes, a 76mm deck gun, as well as other smaller caliber weapons. An NH-90 helicopter is also commonly embarked. These ships were designed with expansion in mind and have space for multiple types of additional armaments, like another eight cell Mk41 VLS. Regardless of the ship’s combat capabilities, something went horrifically wrong here, but sadly these types of collisions have become all too familiar as of late . Still, the tough decision to ground the vessel—literally something a commanding officer avoids at all costs—may have saved the ship and many of the lives aboard it. We will update this post periodically as new information comes available. Update: 2:20am PST— Seven of the frigate’s 127 person crew are reported injured at this time and everyone has been evacuated over fears of the ship sinking and/or rolling over. The tanker was not seriously damaged and its crew of 23 remains aboard as the investigation gets underway. The accident happened at 4am local time. *Keep in mind, like all details surrounding this incident, these casualty numbers are preliminary and are likely to change over time. Update: 3am PST— There is some sort of fuel leak around the ship, with Johan Marius Ly of the Norwegian Coast Guard stating : “We have been told that there is a leak from the frigate. It should be a helicopter fuel, but the extent of leakage is unknown.” A large local oil terminal that filled the Sola with crude before the incident took place has also shut down , likely as a precautionary measure and to deal with the investigation surrounding the tanker’s actions just prior to the collision. Check out the picture below. The ship may end up being a parts donor, but the move to ground her seems to have been successful at keeping her from heading down to Davy Jones’ locker and the fact that everyone lived, at least according to the info we have now, is great news that supports the skipper’s grounding decision. The weather also seems to have been really calm, which was probably key as well in getting the ship grounded and everyone safely off in one piece. This could have been a far more tragic event.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 8, 2019",We Have Located The Precise Spot Where Norway’s Half Sunken Frigate Lies (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fifteen hours after the Norwegian frigate Helge Ingstad (F313) collided with the Malta-flagged crude oil tanker Sola near Bergen, Norway, we are starting to get new details from the Royal Norwegian Navy and Norwegian Coast Guard regarding the circumstances at the time of the accident. Using images and video from the scene, we have also been able to figure out the exact resting position of the damaged warship and it’s quite intriguing. An official NATO statement says that the ship was executing a navigational exercise alongside Standing NATO Maritime Group One (SNMG1) and that “the group was sailing in and around the Fjords, following their participation in exercise Trident Juncture 2018 which concluded on November 7th. The rest of SNMG1’s ships are positioned nearby at sea in the event that further assistance is required.” Norway’s coast is largely made up of complex littorals that include tight passageways and varying depths. Navigating through such complex terrain is not easy, and especially at night with a group of vessels moving as a pack—if this was indeed the case. After the collision, it became clear that the ship was quickly taking on water. The damage may have limited the ship’s ability to steer, but it still seems as if a grounding attempt was made by its crew. Once the ship was evacuated with just eight onboard receiving minor injuries, tugboats acted fast to push the vessel even closer to a rocky shoal so that it would not slip off the rocks and sink. It is now lying on its side partially submerged. Considering how extensive the damage is to the vessel, with reported impact points below and above the waterline, it’s not clear how a salvage operation will be staged. In addition, bad weather could spell big trouble for the ship now sitting on its side on rocks. Anchoring the ship to the coastline is probably the most immediate objective aside from staving off any sort of fuel spill according to our sources familiar with maritime salvage. But this is not to say that the ship’s condition won’t degrade further if that area of the coast gets rocked by heavy surf and high winds. Conditions, when the incident occurred, were remarkably calm for an area of the world that is accustomed to regular inclement weather and high sea states. The ship’s position could also shift with the tides. There is also the issue of what weapons the ship was carrying at the time of the incident. Its armament includes dozens of Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, Naval Strike Missiles, torpedoes, and 76mm cannon shells and any weapons used by the NH-90 that is usually embarked aboard. The fate of that helicopter is also unknown. 10,000 liters of jet fuel from the frigate has leaked into the water according to Johan Marius Ly of the Norwegian Coast Guard. We still don’t know exactly where the ships collided or what the frigate was doing at the time. Was it at rest or was it underway? Just because it was on a navigation drill with other ships, that doesn’t mean that it was steaming at the instant of the collision. We also don’t know if the tanker, which just took on 625,000 barrels of crude oil  before the crash, was in the right spot, but it could have had trouble spotting the frigate which has a reduced radar signature and didn’t have its transponder on, at least according to vessel tracking aficionados (caution: this fact may change). These factors, as well as darkness, can be exasperated by the littorals around the Norwegian Coast, a complex maritime environment that can challenge radar and lookouts alike. There are also reports that the collision actually happened in or very near the oil terminal and harbor at Sture. The quick arrival of tugboats and emergency vessels may lend some evidence to this being accurate. It’s even possible a tugboat helped the ship run aground initially. After reviewing all the available imagery and videos, we were able to geolocate the ship’s current place of rest. As you can see, it is very near the Sture oil terminal. This would also better explain why the terminal has shut down operations, but we can’t say for certain if the crash happened while either of the ships was just getting underway or approaching the harbor, but it seems likely. Google Earth As for the eight crewmen aboard the Helge Ingstad t hat were reported injured, two went to the hospital, but none have life-threatening injuries, which is pretty amazing considering the damage we see on the vessel. We will continue to update this story as new information comes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 22, 2018",Evacuated Naval Air Station Point Mugu And Key Radar Station Threatened By Blaze (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Now called the Hill Fire, the Southern California blaze broke out at 2pm on Thursday and has so far scorched 10,000 acres as it makes its way toward the Navy’s sprawling air base located along the coast near Camarillo, California. An optional evacuation notice has turned into a mandatory one this evening as the commander that has purview over Naval Air Station Point Magu saw no other choice but to get his people to safety in case the fire, which has been whipped up by high winds, blitzes into the installation. Even more pressing is the status of an important radar telemetry and communications station on nearby Laguna Peak. This facility provides surveillance and support for Point Mugu Range Complex and SOCAL Range Comlex activities and also does critical space tracking work. As of 7pm local time, the tweet below shows the evacuation areas which includes Laguna Peak and butts up nearly against NAS Point Magu: Just an hour later, the commander at the naval air station ordered a full evacuated. Here is the tweet: VLAT tankers were working the area into the early evening but high winds have made the fire very tough to contain in any meaningful way. Laguna Peak, which looks over the air base, seems at great high risk here—that is if it is still intact. As of 8pm, the facility was given high priority and water tenders were moving up the hill to help keep the flames at bay as the water tanks on site were empty. Center For Land Use Interpretation/Google Earth Google Earth As you can see in the satellite image above, just below Laguna Peak is NAS Point Mugu. The road you are seeing bisect the two is Highway 1 (CA1). If the flames jump it and the narrow wetland/inlet, the base could be set on fire. NAS Point Mugu, which is part of Naval Base Ventura County, is really the heart of over-water range operations off the Sothern California coast and serves as a headquarters for a lot of the testing and training that happens around the Channel Islands, in particular. It’s also the home of the West Coast E-2C/D Hawkeye community and Navy Test And Evaluation Squadron 30 ( VX-30 ). The California Air National Guard’s C-130Js also call the installation home and the Navy’s new MQ-4 Tritons drones are housed there as well. The aerial targets group, that launches and recovers target drones, runs their operations out Point Mugu too. Also, the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) also has a long-standing aggressor detachment at the base that you can read all about in this past magazine feature of mine. These are just some of the base’s primary residents, so suffice to say that the installation is very important and valuable to the U.S. Navy. Hopefully, the fire will stay on the inland side of Highway 1 and away from the radar station as well and none of this ends up being an issue, but as of right now the situation looks quite concerning. Update: 10:55am PST— Finally have a good picture, taken an hour ago, of the situation in the vicinity of Point Mugu and Laguna Peak. Look at this: The fire appears to be right next to Laguna Peak and creeping down the northwest side of the mountain towards NAS Point Mugu. The evacuation order is still in place for the naval air station: Hopefully, they can get some tankers in there to lay down some additional slurry to stop the fire’s advance, especially for Laguna Peak. We will update this post as more information comes available. Edit note: changed name from Highway 101 to Highway 1.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 20, 2019",The Army Wants Its Brigades To Be Able To Fight For An Entire Week Without Resupply,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Concerns are growing throughout the U.S. military about the potential difficulties in rapidly deploying large amounts of personnel and equipment into a theater of operations under fire during a major conflict and whether there will be any bases of operation to support them once they get there. Now, the U.S. Army says it is looking for ways to ensure that individual brigade combat teams will have supplies, especially fuel and water, to be able to keep fighting for up to a week without a guaranteed supply chain. U.S. Army Lieutenant General Aundre Piggee, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, publicly announced the goal, and explained some immediate hurdles, at an Association of the U.S. Army-sponsored Institute of Land Warfare breakfast on Nov. 6, 2018 . At present, the service only expects combat brigades, which typically have between 3,000 and 5,000 individuals and hundreds of vehicles and other pieces of major equipment, to be able to sustain independent operations for a maximum of three days. “Our goal [is] to have brigade combat teams sustain themselves for seven days without resupply,” Piggee said . “That is significant. Seven days, that is a challenge.” But it’s a challenge the officer explained as being vital to overcome if the Army expects to conduct potential high-end conflicts against “great power competitors,” such as Russia and China, in the future. The Army’s top logistician echoed recent sentiments from other senior U.S. military officials that American forces have become complacent and overly reliant on well established logistical networks and fixed bases of operations after nearly two decades of low-intensity conflicts in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The video below shows U.S. military personnel inspecting Afghan truck drivers and their trucks, a core element of the American logistics chain in the country, before allowing them to deliver their cargo to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. “We were not used to moving and maintaining equipment because equipment was waiting for us at forward operating bases and contractors did most of our maintenance,” Piggee explained . “We are now training this capability every day.” The Army has already been exploring a host of novel logistical capabilities that could improve the situation in high-risk environments. This includes major investments in unmanned, autonomous ground and air logistical platforms that will help ensure a flow of supplies in high-end conflicts without the same risks to Army truck drivers and aviators. The service is no doubt in close contact with the U.S. Marine Corps, which faces many of the same challenges, and has already employed unmanned resupply helicopters in Afghanistan and is investigating the use of various types sizes of rotary- and fixed-wing drones to make sure there is always a way to get vital resources to personnel on the front lines. U.S. Special Operations Forces have used unmanned paragliders in the past for resupply missions in austere areas, as well. Marines and special operators, in turn, are likely to be very interested in leveraging any new technology and procedures the Army develops in order to improve their own expeditionary capabilities. Army brigades are also increasingly benefitting from deployable 3D-printing capabilities, that allow them to produce some types of spare parts in the field on their own, reducing the need to reach back to larger bases for that type of support. The service’s Rapid Equipping Force (REF) was among the organizations that pioneered these use of these mobile workshops , which can fit inside one or more standard shipping container, to make replacement parts and rapidly prototype new equipment in the field. “We have greatly improved our supply of spare parts across the Army,” according to Lieutenant General Piggee. “We do not need to make repair parts 8,000 miles from soldiers if we can print them on the battlefield at their forward locations.” But brigades will need to reduce their reliance on any form of outside support in order to meet the objectives for independent operations that Piggee has laid out. The Army says that the biggest hurdle is fuel. One of the Army Rapid Equipping Force’s Expeditionary Laboratories in Afghanistan in 2014., US Army Modern militaries are notoriously fuel-hungry and this goes well beyond the immediate need to have sufficient stocks to make sure a unit’s armored and unarmored vehicles are gassed up and ready to go. Emplaced artillery and air defense systems , electronic warfare equipment , communications networks , ground-based sensor nodes, life support facilities – including temporary living spaces and mess halls – all require electrical power and therefore generators. Depending on the environment, vehicles may find themselves idling or running auxiliary power units at all times to either generate heat or power air conditioning units , too. Piggee says Army combat brigades will need to find ways to trim their fuel consumption by at least 30 percent to have any hope of operating for a week without resupply. The Army’s is already looking at increasing the use of electric or hybrid-electric propulsion and auxiliary power-generation systems on various vehicles, including the use of hydrogen fuel cell technology , to quickly reduce the need for fuel by between 10 and 20 percent . Vehicles with electric or hybrid-electric drives also have the benefit of being quieter and having reduced infrared signatures compared to those with traditional combustion engines, which has made them even more attractive to the Army. Unfortunately, these systems will still require charging stations, which typically involves a generator. High-capacity batteries and fuel cells offer one way to ensure sustained operations over extended periods of time. Another option might be to have mobile solar-powered generators to provide an additional source of power if necessary. The Army is also exploring the potential of wireless, microwave or laser power distribution. This could, in principle, allow the service to “beam in” power to remote locations, but that technology is not yet robust for powering military operations at extended ranges. A model of a solar-powered generating plant mounted on top of General Motors’ 4×4 Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure ( SURUS ) hydrogen fuel cell-powered optionally-manned vehicle., Joseph Trevithick Reducing a combat brigade’s fuel demands would also provide a cost-cutting benefit. Delivering large fuel shipments, especially on short notice, can be an extremely expensive affair. Factoring in the costs of using a U.S. Air Force C-17 transport plane to fly it into the theater, a delivery of a relatively modest 9,000 gallons of fuel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to a forward operating base somewhere in Iraq or Syria in 2015 cost the U.S. military between $25 and $35 a gallon. “The electrical demands on the Army’s vehicles today are growing far beyond anything we’ve seen before,” George Hamilton, the individual at the Army’s Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) in charge of Vehicle Electronics Architecture, said at a forum in November 2018. “Our focus is on developing and providing a modular, flexible and adaptable vehicle architecture that can expand to meet future demands of all kinds.” The Army hopes to have the necessary infrastructure to support electrification of its vehicle fleets at least ready for testing in 2024. There are also plans to demonstrate a workable, all-electric drive system for armored vehicles by 2027, which would likely go into one or more designs in the service’s planned Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) family. But, for all this talk about fuel, there are other challenges the Army will need to overcome in order to meet its goal of brigades conducting combat operations on their own for a week at a time. Water, an essential resource that gets far less attention, may turn out to be the bigger issue. A US Army briefing slide showing various technologies the service is interested in integrating into the Next Generation Combat Vehicle family in the future, including improved power generation and scalable, high-efficiency power distribution systems, which could help reduce fuel consumption., US Army There is no question that a brigade combat team that runs low on fuel will find itself with reduced combat capabilities and more vulnerable to enemy attacks. However, a similarly sized unit without a ready supply of fresh water would become combat ineffective entirely much more quickly. Scientific studies suggest that an average person can survive up to a week without water, but many experts say that this likely assumes optimal physical and environmental conditions. No matter what, any individual going days without water will increasingly be incapable of performing major physical tasks, such as combat operations. In its guidelines for preparing for and living in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends regular people drink at least a half gallon of water every day to ensure proper body function. Members of the New Jersey Army National Guard fill a trailer-mounted water tank, or “water buffalo,” which can hold up to 400 gallons of water. , US Army Following that requirement, a typical Army brigade combat team with between 3,000 and 5,000 individuals needs at least a total of a 1,500 and 2,500 gallons of drinking water alone, if not more, every day . This amount of water, which also weighs between 12,500 and 20,800 pounds, doesn’t take into account any additional potable water necessary for food preparation or localized medical facilities . Keeping this supply of water on hand and being able to distribute it properly throughout the brigade requires its own resources. In addition, if something were to happen to those stockpiles, it would also quickly put the unit at risk of individual succumbing to the effects of dehydration and needing medical attention. The Army has its own deployable water purification capabilities and various private companies are developing improved, mobile systems, but these would still require a ready source of water to begin with. Emergency resupply, including via unmanned air or ground vehicles, would be another option, but the entire point of the service’s new logistical plan is to make sure brigades can continue to fight even when their supply lines get disrupted. Tova Environmental has pitched this containerized solar- and wind-powered water purification system to the US Army., Joseph Trevithick Interestingly, hydrogen fuel cell technology may hold a dual-purpose solution to both fuel and water problems. The way in which these systems produce energy involves hydrogen bonding with oxygen, with water being a byproduct that a complete system can collect for reuse. General Motors’ experimental Chevy ZH2 hydrogen fuel cell pickup truck, which the Army has tested, was able to produce two gallons of potable water for every hour of operation. A larger, mobile fuel cell power generating plant might be able to produce both energy and water for a brigade combat team during operations. The Chevy ZH2., GM “I believe we are much better shape than we were just two years ago,” Lieutenant General Piggee said. “We have gone back to the basics.” It will definitely be important for the Army to keep improving its logistics mechanisms so troops can fight for extended periods without resupply if necessary. But it will still be a major challenge to find ways for a brigade-sized element to keep enough fuel and water on hand for a week of operations without any outside support.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 13, 2018",Norwegian Frigate To Oil Tanker Before Collision: ‘We Have Everything Under Control’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the official investigation continues into the collision between the Norwegian frigate Helge Ingstad and the Malta-flagged oil tanker Sola , a new report indicates that the naval vessel may have ignored repeated warnings from the other ship and a local maritime traffic control center that an accident appeared imminent. The incident left the warship grounded on a rocky embankment just outside of the Sture oil and gas terminal near Bergen, Norway and the country’s armed forces are now working to recover the ship in cooperation with private maritime company BOA . The mishap occurred on Nov. 8, 2018, and left the Helge Ingstad severely damaged both above and below the waterline and eight individuals with various injuries, but none of them were life-threatening, thankfully. As of Nov. 9, 2018, thick steel wires physically anchored the ship to the shore to prevent it from sinking and underwater cameras allow personnel to monitor the parts of the ship still submerged, according to the country’s Armed Forces , or Forsvaret . Though there was reportedly a brief oil slick coming from the ship after the accident, there have been no subsequent reports of any type of hazardous leaks from the vessel since then. The much larger Sola suffered only minor damage and its payload of crude oil remained safely within her hull. So far, Norwegian authorities have declined to release an official timeline of the incident and how it occurred. However, a report from Norwegian site AldriMer.no , citing multiple unnamed, but knowledge sources, says that there is evidence that the frigate was in the wrong, failing to yield to the larger Sola , and proceeded along its doomed course despite being in contact with the tanker and officials on shore the entire time. “The tanker, which was heading northbound, contacted the frigate, heading southbound, to ask if they had a plan to safely pass them as they seemed to be on a collision course,” Kjetil Stormark, top editor at AldriMer.no , told the BBC in a subsequent interview. “The response was: ‘We have everything under control.'” Helge Ingstad , almost completely on her side, after the collision on Nov. 8, 2018. Tugs later pushed her up against the shore to help right her and prevent the frigate from sinking altogether., Forsvaret A satellite image of the area near the Sture terminal, with the precise location of Helge Ingstad marked to the right., Google Earth Even more galling, it appears likely that the Helge Ingstad was in constant communication with the Fedje Maritime Traffic Center, or Fedje VTS, which is responsible for coordinating all maritime traffic in the fjord in question. The congested nature of the waterway, especially with all the traffic coming out of Sture and the main port in Bergen, means that any ship over 80 feet long, including military vessels, has to get approval from Fedje at least an hour in advance in order to enter the area, to begin with. The Fridtjof Nansen -class frigates are 440 feet long, well over this length requirement. Per AldriMer.no ‘s sources , Fedje VTS was indeed in contact with both ships and issued repeated warnings about a possible collision to no avail. It is not clear if either ship made a mayday call once it became clear the accident was inevitable. It does appear that Helge Ingstad only turned on her Automatic Identification System (AIS) transporter after the mishap had occurred. The Fedje Maritime Traffic Center., Wikimedia Commons After the collision, the Norwegian frigate lost power and control and required the assistance other ships to ground it on the shore and ensure it didn’t sink, according to AldriMer.no . “It was decided to drive the ship on land to prevent the ship from rolling over and canting,” Royal Norwegian Navy Commander Sigurd Smith, a service spokesperson, said on Nov. 9, 2018 , without officially confirming or denying that the ship was out of control at that point. The Helge Ingstad is one of five Fridtjof Nansen -class frigates Norway’s navy has in total and these are the service’s largest and most advanced warships. By the Forsvaret ‘s own admission , having one out of commision for any protracted period of time means a significant loss in Norway’s ability to project naval power and is forcing the country to revise its deployment schedules. If it turns out that the ship disregarded basic protocols and right of way leading up to the collision, the situation could turn out to be even more embarrassing. In the meantime, the Forsvaret is working to get Helge Ingstad off the rocks and move it to Haakonsvern naval base, which is located nearby. BOA is in the process of readying tugs and barges at Sture to assist in the recovery effort. There is no firm timeline for how long it might take to get the frigate into a dry dock, after which the Royal Norwegian Navy will have to conduct a more thorough assessment of the ship’s status. The pictures that are available now show significant external damage that could have seriously compromised its structural integrity. The longer any internal compartments remain flooded, the more costly it will become to repair those spaces, as well. Until then, Norwegian Police will continue maintaining a security cordon 1,640 feet from the beached ship on land and 3,280 feet in any direction on the water. Only time will tell how long it is before the official investigation wraps up and how much time and effort it might take to get Helge Ingstad back into service, if at all. We’ll definitely continue following this story and will continue updating it as additional information emerges.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Norwegian Navy’s frigate Helge Ingstad has almost completely sunk in the waters near the Sture oil and gas terminal outside of Bergen Norway. Norwegian authorities insist they still intend to salvage the warship, which suffered serious damage and was intentionally ran aground after colliding with the oil tanker Sola on Nov. 8, 2018, but the vessel’s future looks increasingly bleak. On Nov. 13, 2018, Rear Admiral Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway’s navy, disclosed that multiple steel wires anchoring the Fridtjof Nansen -class frigate to the shore had snapped overnight . At present, only a portion of ship’s main mast, which holds its advanced AN/SPY-1F radar , a key component of its version of the Aegis Combat System , along with a small portion of the rear superstructure, remain above the waterline. On Nov. 11, 2018, the Norwegian Armed Forces, or Forsvaret , had said the ship was “ stable .” Over the weekend, workers had also added two additional anchor wires between the vessel and the shore, for a total of seven. “It is too early to say what kind of damages there are,” Commander Haavard Mathisen, a Royal Norwegian Navy spokesperson, also said on Nov. 13, 2018, referring to the possibility of any additional damage from the sinking. Underwater video cameras had previously been in place to monitor the exterior of the portions of Helge Ingstad that were underwater. Salvage ships and remotely-controlled small submersibles had also been inspecting the frigate and mapping the seabed where it was sitting. If additional internal compartments are now waterlogged, it is almost certain that they will need significant and potentially expensive work to return them to operational status. This is on top of the necessary repairs to the ship’s badly damaged hull and other portions of its exterior, which will also be very costly. An aerial shot showing the Helge Ingstad , at right, almost entirely underwater on Nov. 13, 2018., Norwegian Coastal Administration The Royal Norwegian Navy’s plan remains to try and refloat the frigate and get it on board one or more barges from private maritime company BOA , which would then move the warship to Haakonsvern, the service’s main base, which is relatively close to the accident site. There is still no firm timeline about when authorities may move the ship or when, and if, Helge Ingstad might return to active service. At this point, the salvage operation may simply be focused on removing a hazard to navigation in a heavily trafficked fjord with the secondary hope that it may be possible to recover various weapons, radars, and other military systems for future use. Now that the ship is entirely underwater, even that seems less promising. The Forsvaret ‘s decision to hire BOA, over competitor Ardent Global Marine Services , to lead the salvage operation has come under scrutiny, as well. Ardent Global says it made an offer, but that it was rejected for being too expensive, according to Norwegian outlet AldriMer.no . Another nearby firm, Sotra Anchor & Chain , has criticized the decision to use wires instead of chains to secure the frigate to the shore, saying that the latter is the international standard for holding large ships in place after an accident. Wires hold the Helge Ingstad in place on Nov. 11, 2018., Forsvaret Workers attach additional anchor wires from Helge Ingstad to the shore on Nov. 11, 2018., Forsvaret The official investigation into circumstances surrounding the mishap, which has sidelined one-fifth of Norway’s Fridtjof Nansen -class indefinitely and forced the Royal Norwegian Navy to reassess its deployment schedules, is still ongoing. Authorities have been reluctant to provide any additional details, but, on Nov. 10, 2018, Norwegian outlet VG released audio of communications between Helge Ingstad , Sola , and maritime officials on shore, synced up with radar tracks showing the movement of the respective vessels in the moments leading up to the collision. The radio messages are all in Norwegian, but others have subsequently translated them into English . Together, the audio and radar images, which you can watch below, provide the clearest publicly available picture of what happened to date. After leaving Sture, the Sola ‘s crew spots an unidentified vessel sailing with its Automatic Identification System transponder switched off on its own navigation radar. The tanker then asks the Fedje Maritime Traffic Center, or Fedje VTS, which oversees marine traffic in the fjord as a whole, to confirm that this ship was both real and headed their way. Nearly two minutes after the initial call, Fedje VTS informs Sola that the ship in question could be the Helge Ingstad . The tanker then makes contact with the frigate directly and demands that the warship immediately turn to starboard, or the right, to avoid a collision. The response from the Norwegian naval vessel is unclear. The individual on the radio acknowledges the request, but seems to offer an alternative course of action, using the word blokkene . Many have translated this, which literally means “blocks,” to mean that whoever was at the helm of Helge Ingstad was concerned about hitting the shore had they turned to starboard. Blokkene is also reportedly a common Norwegian word for the port, or left side, of a ship. It is possible that both interpretations are correct to some degree and that the frigate initially tried to move in the other direction. This would have eliminated the need to cross in front of the tanker and would not have positioned the ship closer to the shore and increase the risk of running aground unintentionally. Unfortunately, there were other ships in the channel and it could have quickly become apparent that there was not enough space to safely maneuver on the other side of the tanker. The state of Helge Ingstad as of Nov. 13, 2018., Forsvaret The recording does not include anyone on board Helge Ingstad saying “we have everything under control,” as had been previously reported . It is very possible that the two ships and the maritime traffic controllers are using more than one radio to communicate and we don’t have the full extent of the discussions between the various parties. AldriMer.no noted that there are long pauses in the publicly available audio and a general lack of communication from Fedje VTS, which seem odd given the concerns about an imminent collision. Whatever happened, Helge Ingstad makes no apparent move to turn to starboard for almost a minute after receiving the initial radio call from Sola . A little over three minutes after the tanker first radioed Fedje VTS about the situation, the two ships collide. Regardless of the circumstances, the loss of Helge Ingstad , even temporarily, is a major blow to the Royal Norwegian Navy, which relies on the Fridtjof Nansen -class as its primary surface combatants, especially in a time of increased tensions between Norway and its NATO allies and Russia . The frigate had been on its way back from a massive NATO-led exercise, called Trident Juncture , the largest such drill in decades, when the accident occurred. If it turns out that Helge Ingstad is a total loss, which seems likely at this point, it could have a significant impact on Norwegian naval operations for years to come. In the meantime, we will continue to follow this story closely and provide any additional updates as they become available.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2018",Listen As Multiple Airline Pilots Report Very High-Speed Unidentified Objects Over Ireland (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating a new mysterious aviation incident that recently occurred over the country. The details are similar in some respects to reported sightings of unidentified flying objects over Oregon , Arizona , and New York , incidents that The War Zone was the first to report on. In the pre-dawn hours on Nov. 9, 2018, about 45 minutes before sunrise, at least three different airliners flying over or off the coast of southwestern Ireland reported seeing multiple unidentified objects flying near them at incredible speed. Authorities in Ireland confirmed they were looking into the situation on Nov. 12, 2018, but offered no additional information. “Following reports from a small number of aircraft on Friday, November 9, of unusual air activity, the IAA has filed a report,” the country’s aviation authorities explained. “This report will be investigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.” Publicly available audio of conversations between the passenger planes and Shannon Flight Information Region air traffic controllers offer more detail about what happened. At 6:47 AM local time, a British Airways 787, using the callsign Speedbird 94, radioed in to ask if there were any military exercises going on in the area, which there were not. “There is nothing showing on either primary or secondary [radar],” Shannon controllers told Speedbird 94. “O.K. It was moving so fast,” the British Airways pilot responded. She further explained that the object had appeared as a “very bright light” and had flown along the left side of their 787 before it “rapidly veered to the north” and then “disappeared at very high speed.” There is no indication of concerns about a possible collision. The Shannon control area is where the incident took place. , Eurocontrol A second pilot, flying a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 and using the callsign Virgin 76, then joined the radio conversation to say that they too had seen more than one bright light or even “multiple objects following the same sort of trajectory.” He repeated the details about the objects being very bright and moving at extremely high speeds, likening their appearance to an object re-entering the earth’s atmosphere from space. “Glad it wasn’t just me,” someone chimed in at one point. “No, ah, yeah, very interesting that one,” the pilot of Virgin 76 replied and noted that the two very bright objects went from 11 o’clock off their nose before climbing away at high speed. Here is a snapshot of the airspace over southern Ireland when the radio call was made. Notice BAW94 is in a line of aircraft and just passed over Kenmare. Virgin 76 was behind and slightly to the right by roughly 70 miles. A Norwegian Air International 737, IBK1768, is at about the same distance but on the left-hand side. , Flightradar24.com The pilot of another aircraft, a Norwegian Air 737, was also party to the overall conversation. Eventually, air traffic controllers said that they had received multiple reports about the objects and would pass the information on to authorities. A third individual – it’s unclear whether they were onboard Speedbird 94, Virgin 76, or a third plane – said they were going so fast it was “astronomical, it was like Mach 2.” The entire audio is available here . It begins 17:50 and ends right after the 20:00 minute mark. While objects regularly enter the earth’s atmosphere, and some are quite spectacular looking if they make it to lower altitudes, they do not fly up alongside aircraft, make hard lateral maneuvers, and then accelerate away at high speed. And they definitely don’t climb away after descending. Pilots see shooting stars more than most and they aren’t children who comment on just any pretty sight they see with air traffic controllers. This was clearly a very unusual occurrence as seen from the cockpit. This incident, like others we have felt worthy of reporting on before , was also corroborated by multiple aircraft, and in this case, those aircraft were spread quite far apart. The fact that Speedbird 94 provided a ‘close-up’ account of the incident while Virgin 76 conveyed a ‘wide-angle’ account that made this encounter even more compelling. We have reached out to a number of authorities for comment and more information regarding this bizarre incident, we will report back if we find out more. A big thanks to our friend Danny Silva of the SilvaRecord.com for a heads up on this incident. Update: 11:20pm PST— We asked the following questions of the Irish Defense Forces: – Did the Defense Forces of Ireland either scramble aircraft or otherwise respond to the incident on Nov. 9, 2018, and if so, in what way? – Does the Defense Forces of Ireland have any standard operating procedure for responding to these types of reports and, if so, is there any details available on what that policy entails? – How, if at all, are the Defense Forces of Ireland involved in the presently ongoing investigation into the incident? Here was their response: “The Defence Forces do not disclose their operational procedures for operational security reasons. This incident is a matter for the Irish Aviation Authority.” Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick"

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 17, 2018",Marines Riding On Cargo Ship To Pacific Exercises A Sign Of A More Flexible Deployment Strategy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy are conducting the latest iteration of a set of regional exercises throughout the South Pacific while embarked on a container and roll-on-roll-off cargo ship , the USNS Gunnery Sergeant Fred W. Stockham . This isn’t the first time the Marines and sailors have used this mode of transportation for these drills, but it reflects an increasingly important option for deploying Marines and other American forces during various types of combat and non-combat that also helps ease the strain on traditional amphibious vessels and surface combatants. The embarked elements of U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific and U.S. Pacific Fleet, kicked off the first of their exercises, known collectively as Koa Moana, or “ocean warrior” in Hawaiian, in French Polynesia in September 2018. They subsequently traveled to Vanuatu nearly 3,000 miles further west. The drills will run through December 2018, with additional stops in Palau , the Federated States of Micronesia , and the Northern Mariana Islands , the last location being a U.S. commonwealth. “The task force’s continued multilateral engagements are designed to strengthen and enhance relationships among the United States and partner nations in the Indo-Pacific and South Pacific regions,” a statement from the I Marine Expeditionary Force, which contributed personnel to the deployment, explained. “Koa Moana promotes regional security and stability, and improves interoperability between security establishments by preparing to respond effectively to crises, and maintain a flexible and effective maritime force in readiness.” These exercises cover a range of military, law enforcement, and disaster response skill sets and are valuable for forming relationships with security forces in these small island nations and territories that would be useful in the event of any future crisis. They also include civil-military engagements, typically pop-up medical and dental clinics and community construction projects, which provide an immense, if often intangible benefit in promoting American interests abroad. A French Army soldier, in shorts, speaks with Marines during a training exercise as part of Koa Moana in French Polynesia in September 2018., USMC Exercises such as Koa Moana are cost-effective tools to counter the influence of potential opponents, such as China, which is seeking to expand its influence and ability to project military power in the region . Though Chinese and Ni-Vanuatu authorities subsequently denied it, there were reports earlier in 2018 that the People’s Liberation Army Navy had sought to establish a base in the country, underscoring the outsized geopolitical significance of that island nation. Vanuatu’s government later asked for a more permanent U.S. military presence . But Koa Moana, which has occurred regularly since at least 2015, and the use of the Stockham in particular, also highlight important developments in the U.S. military’s own ability to conduct expeditionary and distributed operations in the region. Around the same time that the drills first began, the Marines and Navy were exploring increasing the use of non-combatant cargo ships and their civilian merchant marine crews from Military Sealift Command (MSC) to help support various operational demands . “We will evaluate and experiment with Marine detachments on ships other than amphibious vessels such as afloat forward staging bases, destroyers, littoral combat ships, mobile landing platforms, and joint high-speed vessels,” Former Marine Commandant General James Amos and then-current Chief of Naval Operations U.S. Navy Admiral Jonathan Greenert had argued in a 2013 article in Proceedings magazine . “[The Marine Corps needs to] modify traditional employment methods and augment amphibious warships by adapting other vessels for sea-based littoral operations.” Shipbuilder National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), now part of General Dynamics, originally delivered Stockham , which displaces more than 54,000 tons with a full load, to the Maersk Line shipping company as the M/V Lica Maersk in 1980. The Navy picked her up in 1997, originally naming her the USNS Soderman . The Navy withdrew her from service in 2000 to convert her into an “ enhanced prepositioning ship ,” which involved modifications to improve her ability to load and unload cargo simultaneously, either using her roll-on-roll-off features or rear helipad, and do so both while in established ports or sitting offshore. In the latter case, the ship can employ temporary floating docks to transfer cargo to smaller ships and landing craft who would then ferry it ashore. The ship returned to service in 2001, at which time the Navy rechristened her the Stockham . This makes the Stockham , one of three Shughart -class ships, a cost-effective option for shuttling the Marines and sailors around to their various ports of call in the South Pacific during Koa Moana. It can easily unload their vehicles and other equipment thanks to its roll-on-roll-off configuration. These same capabilities, plus its “enhanced” features, would make it a valuable tool in responding to any humanitarian disaster , as well. USNS Stockham , at rear, performs a “skin-to-skin” operation with the expeditionary transfer dock USNS Montford Point . A ramp connects the cargo ship to the other vessel, allowing vehicles to drive straight out onto the deck and then onto waiting landing craft., USN But leveraging MSC’s cargo fleets also gives Marines, as well as other American forces, added flexibility to respond to a wider variety of crises abroad where a maritime deployment may be the most effective option, but when no surface combatants are in the immediate vicinity or available on short notice. A roll-on roll-off ship such as the Stockham would be a good tool for delivering Marine Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST) Companies into a hotspot where the nearest military airfield or civilian airport may be off limits. These units are on call at various locations around the world to reinforce American embassies and rapidly respond to other overseas contingencies, such as a major terrorist attack or violent political upheaval. Special operations forces also benefit from the additional deployment capacity cargo ships offer. Special operators already have at least one dedicated converted roll-on roll-off ship themselves, the M/V Ocean Trader , that acts as a mothership and sea base for covert operations. Ships such as Stockham might not have all the features of purpose converted vessel, but could still provide a useful capability for less intensive, lower-priority operations. Having more Marines afloat at any one time, regardless of what units they come from, only increases the service’s ability to respond quickly to global crises in general. In the Pacific, in particular, distributed and expeditionary operations could easily see U.S. personnel spread across a broad area full of high- and low-risk environments, and everything in between, increasing the need to be able to rapidly and flexibility respond to new developments. Using MSC ships means the service can provide this enhanced presence that without the Navy having to buy additional ships. In using MSC’s ships, the Marines and sailors also don’t have to rely entirely on larger, traditional amphibious ships, or other surface combatants, especially for those low- or no-risk missions. This eases the operational demands on those vessels, which are limited in number, always in high demand, are more expensive to operate, and are suffering from Navy-wide maintenance backlogs that are limiting the availability of all surface warships and submarines . The USS John P. Murtha , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock, a type of amphibious ship that Marines more typically rely on to get around., USN The latter issue is “a sucking chest wound,” U.S. Marine Corps Major General David Coffman, in charge of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operation’s Expeditionary Warfare Division said during a talk at the Hudson Institute think tank on Nov. 9, 2018 . As such, the flexibility offered by MSC’s fleets is only of increasing importance, especially in the Pacific, where tensions with the Chinese have been ratcheting up all throughout 2018 as relations have cooled due to a number of different factors . Using cost-effective bolt-on launchers for over-the-horizon anti-ship and land attack missiles, such as the Navy’s newly acquired Naval Strike Missiles , MSC’s ships, including the Shughart -class roll-on-roll-off ships, can be more active players in future combat operations. The Navy has already been exploring simply embarking Marine Corps truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems ( HIMARS ) or other ground-based, mobile missile launchers on various ships to give them an immediate boost in stand-off strike capability. Either option would give forces ashore extra firepower without the Navy necessarily needing to employ more expensive surface combatants or submarines . Previous deployments have shown that embarking Marines and other uniformed military personnel on the cargo ships is something of a morale boost, as well. Merchant mariners usually “get pretty fancy meals and places to eat and meals and lounges that are pretty unheard of in the Navy,” as well as more luxurious crew quarters and recreational facilities, retired Navy Captain Bob Sweeney, formerly commander of MSC’s Far East division, told Marine Corps Times in 2015. Of course, using MSC’s ships for more varied roles isn’t an all-purpose solution. In their present state, the bulk of the command’s ships have, at best, very limited defenses and would be extremely vulnerable even in medium-threat environments, an issue that came to the forefront just recently when the Navy admitted it did not have the necessary ships to adequately protect maritime logistics operations during a high-end conflict. Increasing the offensive and defensive capabilities of MSC’s cargo fleets may be more complicated. The ships’ non-combatant status and civilian crews present doctrinal and legal obstacles to using them in more serious conflicts, to begin with. There’s also the matter of age and the total number of cargo vessels, which may be under increasing strain themselves in the near future. Still, the added capabilities and capacity that ships such as Stockham offer Marines and other uniformed personnel when it comes to various mission sets is definitely another argument for expanding and improving MSC’s inventory, though. All told, the Stockham transporting a relatively small number of Marines and sailors around to exercises in the South Pacific is a pretty mundane task for the ship. But it’s also an important demonstration of the less visible options available to the U.S. military to move personnel around the region, which may be vital for responding to future regional crises.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2018",What’s To Come Of The A-10 Now That It Has Lost Its Loudest Defenders In Congress?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Republican Representative Martha McSally’s Arizona Senate race loss to Democratic challenger Kyrsten Sinema, together with the death of the state’s beloved Senator John McCain , means the A-10 Warthog has lost its most vocal defenders in Congress this year. This has prompted many to question whether this will prompt the U.S. Air Force to redouble its efforts to retire the venerable ground attack aircraft for good. The impact may actually be less pronounced than the planes defenders might fear, but it also might still not be enough to save the ‘Hogs from going to the Bone Yard . McSally, herself a retired Air Force colonel, former A-10 pilot, and member of the House Armed Services Committee, had been the Warthog’s primary advocate in the halls of Congress after McCain passed away from cancer in August 2018. She had declined to seek re-election as a Representative for Arizona in 2018 in favor of running to take the Senate seat left open by Senator Jeff Flake’s decision to retire from public office. New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte , another Republican and supporter of retaining the A-10, had lost her re-election bid in 2016. There is, of course, a distinct possibility that Arizona Governor Doug Ducey will now appoint McSally to take McCain’s seat, propelling her into the Senate , anyway. It’s hard to understate McSally’s impact on the state of the A-10 program and her role in preserving it in the face of repeated attempts by the Air Force to retire the aircraft . She was instrumental in getting language in successive annual defense policy bills that prevented the service from ditching the ground attack aircraft without having an adequate replacement ready to go and without conducting a comparative “fly-off” between the Warthog and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force has long planned to replace the A-10 with the stealthy fighter jets and has hidden the head-to-head evaluation, which finally occurred last Summer, and its results from public view . Familiar with both the aircraft and the Air Force bureaucracy, McSally also had a knack for understanding various factors at play and knowing what questions to ask. During a hearing in June 2017, she picked up on the service’s first public disclosure of plans to cut three combat-coded A-10 squadrons entirely and immediately pushed back against that proposal. Representative Martha McSally on Capitol Hill in February 2018., Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Images At present, there are nine combat-coded Warthog squadrons in the active and reserve components of the Air Force, including the Air National Guard. There are a total of more than 280 A-10s are spread out across those units, as well as training and test squadrons . At the time of the June 2017 hearing, the Warthog was supporting combat operations in Iraq and Syria and were forward deployed in South Korea in order to respond to any potential North Korean aggression, as well as conducting various training engagements elsewhere around the world. “How are you going to maintain something like that with six squadrons?” she asked incredulously during the June 2017 hearing, referring to the combat capability offered by the current force. “It doesn’t make any sense to me.” Since then, the Air Force has ostensibly put those plans on hold. The service has also rebooted a program to re-wing dozens of Warthogs , extending their life expectancy at least until 2040. A stripped down A-10 undergoing maintenance work at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan in 2013., USAF “Losing McSally, that will hurt because she was a big voice for it [the A-10], but we have a pretty big voice right now,” David Perdue, a Republican Senator from Georgia and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Defense News after the November 2018 elections. “We’re making our case and so far they’re paying attention to it.” Georgia and six other states, in addition to Arizona, all host A-10 units, giving their legislators in Washington a vested interest in preserving the aircraft as part of the Air Force. When it comes to the Republicans from many of those states, many of them are just as supportive of the Warthog as McSally has been, if less publicly vocal. The Democratic Party’s victories in the House in the 2018 mid-term election, which has put them in the majority and given them control of the committees, including the House Armed Services Committee, have raised concerns about whether Republican advocacy may be enough. Many Democrats, including Adam Smith, a Representative for Washington State and incoming Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have announced their desire to trim the defense budget in the future. President Donald Trump’s own administration had already said cuts were coming in the face of surging federal deficits . But preserving the A-10, a relatively low-cost platform that has repeatedly proven its worth in combat, might not necessarily be a hard sell to cost-focused Democrats. There’s a good chance that Democratic members of Congress will also be quick to question the wisdom of retiring any Warthogs when the Air Force is complaining that it needs more planes and is pushing to increase its overall force size from 312 to 386 operational squadrons . The bigger problem on the horizon for Congress is that they’ve been in an increasingly impossible position with regards to the A-10 for months now. Legislators made sure to include sufficient funding for the wing upgrade kits for its oldest Warthogs and the Air Force is publicly supportive of that project. But, in reality, the service seems to be slow-rolling the process and doesn’t expect to begin taking delivery of bulk of those replacement spans for another four years . A-10s in South Korea take part in an “ Elephant Walk ” exercise., USAF There is evidence that the service is using accounting trickery to hide the fact that it is effectively pulling many of those aircraft out of service already. If there simply aren’t enough airworthy A-10s to fill out all nine combat-coded squadrons and support their routine activities, it becomes harder to argue against shuttering certain units and redistributing their personnel to other units that sorely need them. As McSally had rightly pointed out in 2017, six squadrons cannot provide the same operational capacity as nine and there are diminishing returns overall as combat aircraft fleets shrink. So, if the Air Force does succeed in doing away with three Warthog squadrons as it has sought to do, it will only help diminish the relevance of A-10 force, regardless of the utility of those aircraft. You cannot deploy airplanes you don’t have, which will leave commanders in the field seeking alternatives. This will only fuel the Air Force’s long-standing , but debatable argument that other aircraft are adequate substitutes. There’s only so much McSally, or any other members of Congress, could have done to avoid this increasingly no-win situation from developing. The Air Force’s deliberate and repeated hamstringing of A-10 upgrades and major maintenance, including canceling the initial re-wing program early, over the past decade has made the retirement of at least some Warthogs increasingly inevitable . An A-10 undergoing heavy maintenance at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., USAF Of course, none of this is to say that the battle between Congress and the Air Force is over. Far from it , especially if McSallys still becomes a Senator in the end. At the same time, though, it appears to be an increasingly losing proposition for legislators. There may come a time, and soon, when it would become more useful to spend this time and energy in ensuring the Air Force actually moves ahead with its light attack aircraft program , which also seems to be in danger of dying on the vine , and otherwise pushing the service to develop new ground attack capabilities and preserve the knowledge base the A-10 community has cultivated over the decades. Perhaps with McSally’s loss and McCain’s passing, now the remaining defenders of the vital ground attack capability and capacity the Warthogs provide will go on the offensive again. But considering that the USAF has made just keeping the aircraft in the inventory a constant and outright nagging battle, it’s possible that they will decide to focus their political capital elsewhere.

The video shows UTAP-22 drones launching , MANPADS blasting targets out of the sky, all types of guided air-to-ground munitions shacking the hell out of vehicles and structures, bunker-buster bomb bodies hurtling off rocket sleds through concrete walls, a big Tactical Tomahawk flying right through the spine of a parked F-4 Phantom target and many others clips of pinpoint destruction and general mayhem—all conducted under very tight and highly safe testing conditions! I described China Lake as follows when the installation posted its last highlight reel back in 2016 : Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, located in the western reaches of California’s Mojave Desert, is a wondrous place when it comes to military aviation and pretty much everything associated with it—and it still holds some secrets. From massive, sound-stage like missile seeker testing facilities, to rocket sleds, to electronic warfare ranges and a runway dedicated to unmanned aircraft operations , NAWS China Lake offers militaries and their associated industry partners from around the world a huge menu of testing capabilities. But above all else, NAWS China Lake’s expansive and diverse set of live-fire ranges are truly a national treasure. Soon we will be taking a deep dive into that national treasure via a first-hand account of what it’s like to work at the relatively isolated but fascinating facility. In the meantime, enjoy the fireworks! Side challenge! Pull the best still frames from the video and post them down in the comments section below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 31, 2020",Russian Cruiser Fires Odd Torpedo Tube-Launched Anti-Sub Missile During Arctic Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia recently concluded a series of drills in the Barents Sea , situated above the Arctic Circle, which had occurred in an area that overlapped in part with where NATO forces were conducting the alliance’s largest exercise in decades . The Kremlin had caused something of a stir by alerting civilian pilots and mariners in the area that it would be firing unspecified missiles . Now we know that these launches included the use of an unusual torpedo tube-launched anti-submarine missile system known as the RPK-6 Vodopad , or Waterfall. On Nov. 15, 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a video showing Kirov -class nuclear battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy , or Peter the Great, firing multiple Soviet-era RPK-6s , which NATO also refers to as the SS-N-16 Stallion. An unnamed nuclear-powered submarine was also reportedly involved in this specific drill. The exercise offered both vessels the opportunity to try to seek out and conduct simulated attacks on each other, according to the video’s caption . Unfortunately, it doesn’t say whether Pyotr Velikiy or the submarine scored the most “kills” against the other. The battlecruiser has a number of options for engaging underwater threats, including 254mm and 305mm anti-submarine rocket launchers that can send volleys of depth charges or anti-torpedo decoys into the water around the ship. It also has 10 553mm torpedo tubes of its own to respond in kind. Those latter tubes, however, can also fire the much more obscure RPK-6s, which first entered service in 1981. Unlike in a more conventional missile launcher, compressed air cold-launches what the Russians refer to as a “torpedo-missile” out of the torpedo tube and into the water, after which it sails away from the ship for a distance underwater. Then a rocket motor ignites and sends it flying back into the air and on its way. The weapon has an inertial navigation guidance system to get it to target areas more than 60 miles away. When it gets there, the missile releases its payload. During the exercises in the Barents Sea, this was a 400mm lightweight homing torpedo. However, the Soviet Union originally designed the weapon to also be able to carry a nuclear depth charge. That option would make it much more difficult for the target to escape. The stand-off range the RPK-6 would also help shield the launching ship from any adverse effects from the blast. The Russian Kirov -class nuclear battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. , AP Russia also has a submarine-launched version of the system, the RPK-7 Veter , or Wind, that works with 650mm torpedo tubes, but otherwise has the same basic characteristics. NATO refers to both systems collectively as the SS-N-16. The two variants replaced an earlier pair of torpedo tube-fired missile systems for use by surface ships and submarines, known simply as the RPK-2 Vyuga , or Blizzard, which had only half the range. NATO designated applied the designation SS-N-15 Starfish to both of these weapons. The submarine-launched configurations are roughly analogous to the U.S. Navy’s Cold War-era UUM-44 Submarine Rocket , or SUBROC, which also carried a nuclear depth charge. There was also the surface ship-launched RUR-5 Anti-Submarine Rocket , or ASROC, but this was in no way similar to a torpedo tube-launched system that sends the missile swimming in the water before it blasts off. The Navy retired SUBROC in 1989. That same year, it stopped deploying ships with nuclear-armed ASROCs and began using the version carrying a conventional lightweight torpedo only. In the 1990s, the service began replacing the RUR-5s with RUM-139 Vertical Launch ASROC, or VL-ASROC , which fits inside standard Mk 41 Vertical Launch System cells. Though the RPK-6 is odd, it’s really not surprising that Russia still has the weapon in service. It offers a stand-off, fire-and-forget anti-submarine weapon to virtually any ship with 533mm torpedo tubes. This, in turn, offers a major boost in firepower for even small ships without the need to find the space and power necessary to add in complicated vertical launch systems or even bolt-on deck-mounted missile launchers . There’s also a derivative, the RU-100 , also known as the SS-N-16A, which carries a conventional explosive warhead and functions in much the same way as an anti-ship cruise missile. We don’t know for sure, but it is likely that this missile has a radar seeker to detect and lock on to its target in the final stages of flight. This adds even more flexibility to the standard 533mm torpedo tubes found on various Russian ships. The SS-N-16 family is also related to the submarine-launched 91RE1 anti-submarine missile , a member of the Kalibr cruise missile family , which uses a similar booster rocket and carries a lightweight torpedo instead. There is a vertical launch derivative of that missile, the 91RTE2 , that is more analogous to the American RUM-139, as well. A model of the 91RE1 submarine-launched anti-submarine missile., Allocer via Wikimedia The Pyotr Velikiy is due for a major refit in the coming years, which will likely occur after her sister ship, the Admiral Nakhimov , the only other Kirov -class vessel slated to be reactivated, returns to service. Nakhimov ’s overhaul has been delayed multiple times and the Russian Navy doesn’t expect to get her back from the Sevmash Shipyard until between 2021 and 2022. The upgrades include the deletion of the Cold War-era P-700 Granit , or SS-N-19 Shipwreck , anti-ship missiles and the addition of new vertical launch system arrays able to fire the 3M54 Kalibr land-attack cruise missile, supersonic P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missile, and 3M22 Zircon hypersonic anti-ship missile. The ships will also get separate launchers for the navalized version of the S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile system. But there’s no mention of removing any of the torpedo tubes from either of the two ships or public plans to retire the RPK-6. So, unless something changes, it looks like the remaining Kirov -class battlecruisers, along with other ships in the Russian Navy, are set to retain their ability to fire these unique anti-submarine missiles for the foreseeable future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 1, 2019",Not A Surprise: North Korea Is Back To Publicizing Weapons Tests Overseen By Kim Jong Un,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what amounts to a major change in course, North Korea’s state media has publicized a weapons test overseen by Kim Jong Un. The announcement is highly reminiscent of the period of near constant weapons tests and military installation visits that led up to a sudden thawing of tensions between North and South Korea prior to the Olympic games in early 2018. Not long after, the U.S. joined the detente, culminating in a laughably lopsided summit between Kim Jong Un and President Trump in Singapore last June. Since then the Trump administration has claimed progress and put forward grand expectations from talks that seemed to be going nowhere fast. As we have written consistently , North Korea has not given any tangible proof that it intends to denuclearize. In fact, it hasn’t even offered clear statements that allude to this possibility. The notion that they have has been at best the result of poor understanding about the situation and the North Korean regime’s history and at worst straight-up misinformation. Even as North Korea repeatedly offered nothing of consequence, the Trump Administration has worked to court Kim Jong Un’s affection via canceling military exercising and ridiculously flattering language—the President of the United States said he fell in love with the North Korean dictator—as well as offerings of yet another photo-op summit between the two leaders. But even that didn’t seem to work as North Korea began canceling key meetings with the U.S. in early November. The entire thing has been a joke. There was no big multi-national comprehensive package put together for the summit that would have truly gauged North Korea’s threshold to make a deal. There weren’t even small but important steps, backed by hard deadlines, demanded of the North Koreans that would have either put them on a path towards denuclearization or force them to show their actual intentions without the long, and frankly, embarrassing wait. Instead, Pyongyang has been in the driver’s seat with the U.S. seeming to be very much playing the whole thing by the seat of its pants. For a recap of where we stand editorially on this matter, you can read all the previous articles linked in this article or check out the entire tweet string below that I posted recently on the topic. But it is very clear that this whole process has been ridden off the rails for the U.S., although that assumes it was on the rails in the first place. For defenders of the Trump Administration’s policy toward North Korea, the refrain has been the tired and somewhat misleading statement “well isn’t it better than going back to them testing weapons,” and even that now is probably on the brink of having zero relevance. And really, if we just went to them and said “here’s the deal, if you talk to us, send flattering letters, and stop testing then we will look the other way begrudgingly on your nuclear program” I am sure they would have taken it! They gave up nothing of meaning in regards to their nuclear weapons & missile programs & know full well S. Korea isn’t going back to max pressure. + they got what they always wanted-that handshake on equal terms that cost nothing. China back in their arms & Russia circling. 1/2 https://t.co/o0DFd72LCx — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) November 3, 2018 As for the weapon involved in this test, we really don’t know what it was. There is speculation that it could have been a new anti-tank or surface-to-air missile system, or another short-range guided weapon, but really, it doesn’t matter all that much. What matters is North Korea wanted their old modus operandi to rear its ugly head again in the propaganda space and the world is taking notice. The readout from KCNA is posted below and the photo from the outing is posted as the banner image of this article. KCNA Transcript The statement lacks fiery anti-American rhetoric, but that is likely to come soon unless the U.S. acquiesces and lifts some sanctions, which would be an unbelievably stupid move and something I doubt the administration would do. There’s also South Korea factor to deal with here as well with President Moon Jae In’s administration being heavily invested in the North Korean engagement process, politically speaking. Clearly, Pyongyang will do whatever it can to drive a stake between Seoul and Washington D.C., but if things continue as they are, Moon may have to make a decision to side with the U.S. and return to a maximum pressure military campaign or to continue on a separate path with the Kim regime. The latter would make America’s military role in the country more complex and ambiguous. In fact, Moon has already tried to decrease sanctions on North Korea, but that idea was swatted down by the U.S. and maligned internationally. Moon supposedly believes North Korea will crack under the brutal sanction regime in place on the country, but so far that seems like wishful thinking and it’s not like the Kim regime hasn’t weathered tough economic times before. With newly invigorated relations with China and Russia—two countries that are also increasingly at odds with the U.S.— sanctions relief will likely come under the table, one way or another, and there are already signs of that happening now. Both leaders also recently blew off a New York Times piece about North Korea’s illicit weapons programs. It didn’t include any major new information necessarily, but it did underscore how North Korea has not let its foot off the gas when it comes to their nuclear weapons and missile programs. Once again, this isn’t surprising as North Korea openly proclaimed that they would move to serial production of their nuclear weapons and delivery systems last Winter, but it does run counter to the idea that they are actually interested in denuclearizing or that they are starved of cash to the point of collapse. Even South Korea stated that North Korea has never agreed to stop any of these programs, but that hasn’t stopped Moon from continuing to push for deeper engagement. The story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate. We fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new – and nothing happening out of the normal. Just more Fake News. I will be the first to let you know if things go bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2018 South Korea's Blue House: ""North Korea has never promised to shut down this missile base. It has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory… There is no agreement, no negotiation that makes it necessary for it to be declared."" https://t.co/6hhdpw0CXX — Josh Smith (@joshjonsmith) November 13, 2018 So what’s the answer here? There isn’t a good one, but the options are pretty simple really. Either you stand fast and demand denuclearization and begin to put the military pressure back on in addition to the economic pressure in place, or you build a policy around an acknowledged reality that North Korea is a nuclear power and will remain that way going forward. Doing the latter would be a dramatic shift for the U.S. and its allies, but accepting that fact could lead to a moderation of the Kim regime and potential change within the Hermit Kingdom via foreign influence and investment. It could also lower tensions drastically, making Kim’s nukes less of a threat. This could be predicated on a reformed engagement initiative aimed at freezing North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, but not eliminate their existing arsenal or delivery systems. The sad part is we really had one shot at making our best offer collectively with the world community at that summit in June and putting forward a comprehensive framework for the long-term denuclearization of North Korea. This could have started with a true declaration of Kim’s arsenal and the freezing of his nuclear and missile programs verifiably. Included with this framework could have been substantial carrots and sticks that would make not moving on the path laid out truly against the self-interest of the Kim regime. At least then we could have said we did everything possible to make the standoff come to a peaceful conclusion while really help North Korea emerge from its failed state status and become a more peaceful actor on the world stage. Instead, it was a squandered and hollow mess that offered nothing of substance to North Korea that could really push them in a better direction. Above all else, it was a clear signal that Trump’s propensity for pocket dealings and basing foreign policy moves on the vapid illusion that it’s all about his relationships with other world leaders is woefully inadequate when it comes to solving the world’s most challenging problems.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 18, 2018",Star Wars: DOD Execs and the USAF Are Already Battling Over A Non-Existent Space Force Budget,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As seemed almost inevitable from the start, the Pentagon and the U.S. Air Force are sparring over their respective cost estimates for what it would take to create a Space Force . With so many questions still unanswered about what the new independent service would do, it’s very likely that neither party’s figures are entirely accurate, but the debate itself highlights some of the most serious pitfalls of the entire enterprise of creating a new military branch. On Nov. 15, 2018, Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who is in charge of planning for the new Space Force and its associated components, said his team has determined it would cost less than $10 billion , and perhaps even less than $5 billion, to establish the service. In September 2018, a leaked memo showed that Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson had pegged the new branch’s price tag at nearly $13 billion . “There’s going to be a cost, but what I want to do is take existing cost and move it over to this [Space Force,” Shanahan had told Defense News in an interview a week earlier. “In this department, you know with this secretary [James Mattis] and this Congress, people in the White House, they’re not going to let us just go throw money at that.” For more than a year , the Pentagon has been wrestling with the idea of an independent Space Force. Proponents of the plan argue that the existing bureaucracy and force structure, spread among the existing services, but primarily situated within the Air Force, isn’t adequate enough to respond to very real emerging threats and challenges to U.S. military activities outside the Earth’s atmosphere . Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, in the black suit, visits Los Angles Air Force Base, home of the Space and Missile Systems Center, in August 2018., USAF Critics contend that a separate Space Force would only exacerbate those issues and prompt infighting for funding and other resources. It’s a complicated debate, which we at The War Zone have explored multiple times in great detail . In June 2018, however, President Donald Trump made it clear that his administration would actively push for the new service. The White House plans to ask Congress to approve the proposal and provide the initial funds in its budget proposal for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which should be publicly available in February or March 2019. Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have made expanding American presence in space, both in terms of military and civilian activities , a major policy objective and may see it as one potential legacy of their Administration. The Air Force, which stands to lose the most in terms of budget, personnel, and other assets, initially opposed the idea of a separate Space Force, but appeared to change its attitude publicly after pressure from the White House. Still, it’s approximately $13 billion cost estimate drew criticism from supporters of the new service, who accused the USAF of trying to foment opposition to the new branch. “The president is going to be making some decisions to put forward a proposal in concert with his fiscal year 20[20] budget proposal that will go to the Congress in February,” Secretary of the Air Force Wilson said later on Nov. 15, 2018 , after Shanahan had made his remarks. “So the cost will be really based on what are the elements in the model in that proposal, and our cost estimate that we gave to a lot of people in the Pentagon is September was the cost of a fully fledged standalone department and also a unified combatant command.” Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP Images It is entirely possible that the Air Force’s estimate is overly conservative, whether that was a deliberate decision to frame Space Force as overly expensive or not. The service’s cost breakdown includes the price tag for creating a functional joint service Space Command , akin to Cyber Command , as well as the new service branch itself. At the same time, the Pentagon’s own plans have made clear that Space Command is an essential part of the process toward creating an independent Space Force. In addition, the U.S. military plans to create the Space Development Agency (SDA) to handle the development and procurement of certain satellites , launch vehicles , and other space-based systems . It is hard to understand how an accurate representation of Space Force’s costs would not include the price of establishing Space Command and SDA, as well. There is also considerable evidence that Shanahan’s estimates, or even just his understanding thereof, may be overly optimistic. Unlike the Air Force, the former Boeing executive has not offered any sort of cost breakdown to justify his total figure. A view inside what is now known as the Combined Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base., USAF “I haven’t looked at the number, but it’s going to be less than that,” he told Defense News just days before giving his broad cost estimate of less than $10 billion. “I’m not concerned that people are just going to generate a big bill.” Shanahan has also previously dismissed concerns about how complicated simply moving the various space-related components on the Pentagon’s organization charts will actually be, despite there still not being a clear understanding of how Space Force would interact with other stakeholders within the U.S. military and Intelligence Community. Nearly a decade after its creation, Cyber Command is still working on defining its exact relationship with the National Security Agency and how the activities of the two organizations in cyberspace overlap and align. The Deputy Defense Secretary has also shown an almost flippant disregard for other complexities within the military. This can only raise questions about whether he has an accurate interpretation of the information available to him. “A jet engine is a jet engine; no one will convince me otherwise,” he said at a Defense Writer’s Group event in October 2018 , while speaking on the topic of poor readiness rates within the U.S. military’s aviation communities. “I’ve been on more airplanes than anybody in the United States, I know these things, ok?” Then-Senior Vice President of Airplane Programs for Boeing Commercial Airplanes Shanahan, at left, walks with then-Secretary of State John Kerry at the firm’s Renton, Washington plant in 2013., US DoS Needless to say, the demands of military jet engines , together with the operational, maintenance, and logistics factors at play, are wildly different than those in the civilian aviation world. Shanahan primary experience at Boeing, the work that earned him the moniker “ Mr. Fix-It ,” was in commercial airliner programs. Hopefully, when the President’s Budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year comes out in 2019, we will get more detail about Shanahan’s Space Force cost estimate. But the entire debate would seem to bolster criticisms that the endeavor risks sparking acrimonious infighting, which itself wastes time and resources. Space Force’s budget will have to come out of the larger Pentagon budget, which is set to see cuts in the coming fiscal year, making it a point of contention and no one even knows exactly what the final projected price point and year-to-year costs will be yet. The energy that the Pentagon, Air Force, Congress, and the White House are expending fighting over these figures could be better spent on addressing real military space-related issues within the existing structure, or by adding far more limited bureaucracies, such as Space Command and SDA. A Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) missile warning satellite during final assembly, one of the many US Air Force systems that could transition to the control of an independent Space Force., Lockheed Martin All of the time and resources already expended on this debate could be increasingly moot, too. There was no indication that Space Force ever enjoyed enough support within Congress to come to fruition before and that now seems increasingly uncertain given Democratic Party victories in the House of Representatives. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington State who will head the House Armed Services Committee come January, has already voiced his opposition to the plan. “What I oppose is a separate branch. I don’t think a separate branch makes sense,” Smith said in September 2018 . “What is the most cost-effective way to give space the emphasis it deserves? I know it is not a Space Force.” Of course, criticism from Smith and other legislators is unlikely to end the debate over whether or not to create Space Force, though, especially given Trump’s personal support for the plan. So, with all that in mind, the real budget battle over Space Force may still be yet to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 19, 2017",Argentina’s Lost Submarine Has Finally Been Found (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly one year to the day after the Armada Argentina lost contact with their Santa Cruz class diesel-electric submarine ARA San Juan , they have announced that its broken hull has been finally discovered laying 2,620ft below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Although the big multi-national search for the submarine ended many months ago, a U.S. company named Ocean Infinity that specializes in mapping the seafloor has been contracted since late Summer to continue looking for submarine using its advanced side-scanning sonar and other technologies. The hit it received from the seafloor was remarkably detailed, showing an elongated and broken object that measures roughly 60 meters in length—the submarine was 67 meters overall when it was intact—making it a very promising discovery. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have been sent down to inspect the object of interest and the Argentine Navy has confirmed that it is indeed ARA San Juan . The revelation is part amazing and part bittersweet. On one hand, finding the submarine on the seafloor—the proverbial needle in a haystack—a year after it went missing is an awesome accomplishment. On the other hand, although it will bring much-needed closure to the 44 sailors’ families who have endured a nightmare of an ordeal over the past 12 months, it will also be an incredibly sad reality to face. San Juan disappeared on November 15th, 2017 after reporting a short circuit issue with its batteries to its Argentine Navy masters while on a patrol in the south Atlantic. According to the BBC , an Argentine Navy spokesman described the cause of the malfunction as such: “Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters last year that water had entered the submarine’s snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped on to a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smolder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared.” At the time of the call, the captain noted that the submarine’s crew was in fine condition and that they were returning to Mar Del Plata Naval Base located in Northern Argentina to deal with the problem. The sub’s previous port of call was Ushuaia Naval Base located near the southern tip of the country. ARA San Juan photographed in much better times., Juan Kulichevsky/wikicommons Not long after its disappearance, listening posts ran by an NGO that monitors for nuclear weapons tests picked up a loud anomaly that is thought to have been San Juan’s hull imploding. The approximate location of the anomaly was 30 miles north of its last known position. The entire event has played out on a world stage and has put a focus on the readiness and reliability of Argentina’s tiny and aging submarine force . Now that the wreck of the San Juan has been found, some sort of recovery operation will no doubt be executed. Hopefully, more facts about the events leading up to the submarine’s disappearance can be gained from it. We will continue to update this post throughout the day as more information on this important discovery comes to light. Update: 10:30am PST— Here are some of the images from the ROV that helped identify the wreck as ARA San Juan : Although the San Juan is relatively intact, Argentine Navy officials stated that it was totally clear that the submarine imploded. Debris from the implosion are scattered around the seafloor over a 70-meter wide area. The area where the wreck was found has extreme topography making it hard to find the wreck. Apparently, it was surveyed twice already over the last year before Ocean Infinity found it.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Based in Hawaii, the Army’s 25th Combat Aviation Brigade truly flies birds of paradise and sometimes soldiers hitch a ride on one of them without even climbing aboard. Known as Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction (SPIE), the long-proven method allows for soldiers to be quickly inserted into or extracted from enemy territory even in rough or obstructed terrain where a helicopter can’t safely land. Beyond its critical tactical applications, it is the ultimate e-ticket ride, sending commandos slung below a charging helicopter flying through the air as a team. Even though you may have seen this technique before, I guarantee you have never seen it like how it is showcased in the 360 video below. Here is a direct link to the Facebook video in case it doesn’t propagate automatically below on your mobile device: SPIE comes in two flavors, standard and ‘wet,’ the latter being for quickly plucking operators from the water as seen in the video above. SPIE and its closely related cousin, the Stabilized Body (STABO) method of aerial troop transfer, were developed by the U.S. military nearly 50 years ago and have since spread to many other militaries around the globe. It is especially popular among special operations communities. U.S. Soldiers with the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) are lifted off the ground by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter during Special Purpose Insertion Extraction (SPIE) training event at Eglin Base Air Force Base., US Army Generally speaking, it works like this: A helicopter drops a specially designed and weighted SPIE rope down to soldiers awaiting hookup below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Releases First Official Video Of Its Su-57s On Their Absurdly Short Trip To Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has released its first official video showing a pair of Su-57 stealth fighters during their bizarrely short deployment to Syria earlier in 2018. It’s as unclear as ever what the planes actually did in the two days or so that that they were there and whether they flew any actual strikes, but the threat of attacks on Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base may have cut the entire affair short. Russia’s Defense Ministry posted the video montage online on Nov. 19, 2018. The clips show the Su-57s landing and taking off from Khmeimim in Syria’s western Latakia governorate, as well as in mid-air against solid blue skies with no discernible landmarks. The jets arrived in the country on or about Feb. 23, 2018 , and were officially only there for two days, but we don’t know if this means approximately 48 hours in total, two nights, or some other exact length of time. Russia now says the aircraft together flew “ more than 10 sorties ” in that time, which would average out to more than 2.5 sorties per plane, per day if the deployment period is accurate. The sorties allowed the Russian Air Force to evaluate the Su-57’s basic flight performance, as well as the operation of its flight control, communications, and other mission systems, in a real combat environment and under extremely hot conditions, according to a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense . The jets also reportedly got a chance to test their weapon systems, but it remains unclear if this means they engaged actual targets in Syria. The video does not show either of the aircraft carrying bombs or missiles externally and there is no strike footage included among the clips. It is, of course, possible that the jets exclusively used weapons carried internally to strike rebel positions. In May 2018, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu publicly showed video of a Su-57 launching what appeared to be a Kh-59MK2 cruise missile from its internal bay. He added that this test had occurred in February 2018, but did not clearly indicate whether or not it had occurred in Syria. If the main objective of the deployment was to evaluate the capabilities of the Su-57 employing the Kh-59MK2 against real targets, it could help explain its brevity. Otherwise, it remains as difficult as ever to see how the Russians could have garnered any meaningful amount of data on the aircraft’s broader performance and other attributes in just two days. There is also the possibility that the Kremlin intended for the Su-57s to spend more time in Syria than they actually did in the end due to security concerns. By Russia’s own admission , Khmeimim had experienced a number of attacks by small drones since at least 2017. Then, in January 2018, the base suffered an unprecedented mass drone attack that only seemed to escalate the situation. Satellite imagery both confirmed the Su-57s had deployed to Syria, but eventually also showed at least one inside an impromptu revetment, suggesting the Russians were particularly concerned about the potential for damage to the aircraft. The size and layout of Khmeimim has long forced the Russians to park tactical aircraft very close to each other on the aprons, increasing the risk that the destruction of one jet could lead to serious damage to others nearby. The drone threat has persisted since then, with Russia claiming that there had been an increase in rebel use of small unmanned aircraft in August 2018 . The Kremlin has also accused the United States , among other foreign opponents , without providing any evidence , of supporting the militants and their drone operations. In addition, earlier in November 2018, Viktor Murakhovsky, military expert and editor-in-chief of Russia’s Arsenal of the Fatherland magazine, also claimed in a social media post that his sources had indicated that the Pantsir-S1 point air defense system had been virtually worthless in defending Khmeimim. He said that between April and October 2018, the vehicles, which have a combination of radio command-guided surface-to-air missiles and a pair of 30mm automatic cannons, hit less than one-fifth of their intended targets. In the same period, the Tor-M2U short-to-medium range surface-to-air missile systems at the base had an 80 percent hit rate. Murakhovsky has since deleted his post, possibly under pressure from Russian authorities , but there has also been no further confirmation of his claims. If his assertions about the capabilities of the Pantsir-S1 against small drones are true, it could point to even greater risks to Russia’s aircraft, other assets , and personnel at Khmeimim than had been previously understood. Losing a Su-57, or otherwise having one suffer major damage, at the hands of small, homemade rebel drones would have been especially embarrassing for Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has claimed total victory over militants in the country more than once . Putin easily won a particularly controversial re-election bid less than a month after the stealth fighters returned home unscathed. On Nov. 18, 2018, Russia’s Television Zvezda, the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television channel, released the second “chapter” of its Russian-language profile series on the Su-57, which also includes various footage of the aircraft, though none apparently from Syria. The danger of small drones continues to be a major issue for Russian forces, both in Syria and in general. As with other countries around the world , the Kremlin has realized the seriousness of the situation and is making training to defend against mass drone attacks mandatory for all units . It may have also prompted Russia to begin building reinforced concrete shelters at Khmeimim to help shield against future attacks. Satellite imagery that the Atlantic Council think tank’s Digital Forensic Research Lab obtained in November 2018 shows the construction in progress along base’s main flight line. The Russians have also installed other, less permanent open-topped revetments to protect various tactical aircraft. Closed-top shelters will also make it more difficult for observers to gauge the size and composition of Russia’s air contingent in Syria. This may enable the Kremlin to claim it has or is in the process of making good on its many pledges to reduce its force posture in the country without having to actually do so. It could also help conceal the deployment, or length thereof, of more advanced aircraft, such as the Su-57s, in the future. The shelters themselves, of course, only add to the existing evidence that Russia has no real intention of significantly scaling back its activities in Syria any time soon. With the new shelters in place, the Russians may even decide to send some of their Su-57s back to the country for a more extensive and realistic combat evaluation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 22, 2019",First Images Of New VH-92 Marine One Helicopter Landing On White House Lawn,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have the first images of not only a Sikorsky VH-92 Marine One replacement helicopter in its full ‘White Top’ presidential airlift colors, but also of that helicopter landing on the South Lawn of the White House. Although the Marine aviators of HMX-1 who fly the President around make landing at the White House look easy, it is not, with Marine One crews having to avoid a number of obstacles and touch down on exact markers placed on the lawn during a wide range of conditions and usually while being watched by throngs of onlookers and the global media. The operation not only serves the President, their closest aides, and their family for daily travel needs, but it is also a key component of so-called Continuity Of Government contingency plans . During a crisis, Marine One helicopters would quickly make the jaunt from their forward staging point at Naval Support Facility Anacostia to the White House where they would scoop up the President and move them to safety at any of a number of pre-planned undisclosed and hardened locations. A developmental VH-92A helicopter conducts landing and take-off testing at the White House South Lawn on Sep. 22, 2018. The aircraft is the first of six test aircraft developed under the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, which includes the design, certification and testing of a replacement helicopter to support the presidential world-wide vertical-lift mission. The landing and take-offs were part of a comprehensive test plan designed to ensure the aircraft meets all operational specifications., U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Hunter Helis The amazing photos come to us from our NAVAIR public affairs friends at Naval Air Station Patuxent River where the VH-92 is deep in testing. That testing is progressing well and the program is meeting or even beating budget forecasts according to recent reports. Risks still remain, but compared to many other high-profile defense programs, VH-92 has been largely unproblematic. As we noted in our last update on the VH-92’s progress, which includes a ton of details and even some possible renderings of the aircraft’s interior, the new helicopter’s impact on the White House’s lawn was an outstanding issue for testers: NAVAIR and Sikorsky, now a division of Lockheed Martin, had also not yet been able to find a way to prevent the force from the rotor blades from the destroying the grass and other plants on the White House’s South Lawn, which currently serves as the main helipad there. The GAO report states : “The lawn is a highly visible, size-constrained landing zone where damage to the White House grounds needs to be minimized. Currently, however, the program is not meeting a key system capability requirement to land the aircraft without adversely affecting the landing zone (including the White House Lawn).” The test landings shown in these images likely helped further evaluate, if not alleviate, those concerns. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Hunter Helis In all, 23 VH-92s will replace the current fleet of 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns , 21 of which will fly the President around and follow him or her nearly anywhere they go across the nation and abroad (yes, a pair of ‘White Tops’ are airlifted everywhere the President goes even if they are not used as primary transportation) or support HMX-1’s training needs. The two remaining helicopters will stay a NAS Patuxent River and will be used for ongoing developmental initiatives. The VH-92 is slated to reach initial operating capability in 2019 and fully replace the existing White Tops by 2023.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 30, 2019",Two USAF Fighter Wings Line Up 35 F-35s During Type’s First-Ever ‘Elephant Walk’ Exercise (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Personnel from the U.S. Air Force’s 388th and 419th Fighter Wings, both equipped with the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and based at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, staged the first-ever “Elephant Walk” combat power exercise involving the stealth fighters on Nov. 19, 2018. These drills test units’ abilities to generate as many sorties as possible in a 24-hour period, something they might have to do during a surge in combat operations. It’s not clear whether it was intentional or not, but for this debut event, the two wings sent a seemingly symbolic 35 jets onto the runway. These exercises, also known as short-notice combat readiness drills, typically occur at bases overseas and at major hubs in the United States, such as Hill. They can include all sorts of different aircraft , as well as helicopters , and even non-combat types on certain rare occasions . “We are ready to fight tonight, and exercising with multiple squadrons of F-35s can demonstrate our ability to defeat potential adversaries wherever they may arise,” U.S. Air Force Major Caleb Guthmann, the Assistance Director of Operations within the 34th Fighter Squadron, part of the 388th, and lead officer for the exercise said in a statement . A normal day, Hill’s Joint Strike Fighters fly approximately 30 to 60 sorties, according to the Air Force . During the Elephant Walk, the 388th and the 419th, the latter of which is an Air Force Reserve unit, launched a similar amount of aircraft, but in 20-to-40 second intervals. It’s worth noting that we have no confirmation as to how many aircraft actually took to the sky as part of this exercise. Taxing onto a runway is different than flying an actual sortie. The drill also comes as the three U.S. services who operate F-35 variants – the Air Force, Navy, and Marines – are struggling to improve their availability rates across the Joint Strike Fighter fleet and have suffered a number of high-profile accidents and groundings in the past four months. In October 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis ordered the services to ensure that 80 percent of all F-35s, as well as other types of fighter jets , are fully mission capable at any one time by the end of 2019. That goal is extremely ambitious as legacy aircraft, such as the F-15 and F-16, usually have a mission capable rate in the 70 to 80 percent range, meanwhile, the force’s newest and most advanced fighters, like the F-22 and F-35, have struggled to come even close to their decades-old stablemates, with sub-60 percent mission capable rates plaguing the fleets. USAF USAF Of course, this year, Marine F-35Bs also became the first American Joint Strike Fighters to conduct actual combat operations, attacking Taliban targets in Afghanistan on  Sept. 27, 2018. In addition, the Joint Strike Fighter’s much-awaited Initial Operational Test and Evaluation period also began earlier in November 2018 . So, for the Air Force, the Elephant walk likely carries the additional importance of sending signals within the U.S. military and to its critics that it is also making progress improving the readiness of its F-35 units and is ready to send those pilots and their aircraft down range, if necessary. In October 2018, the 388th and 419th together hit 10,000 total fight hours with their F-35s. The 34th Fighter Squadron, specifically, became the first operational squadron when the Air Force declared it had reached initial operational capability with the Joint Strike Fighter in 2016 . It was also the first combat-coded Air Force F-35A unit to receive the Block 3F software , which gave the aircraft the ability to employ all of the presently certified weapons for the jet, including its 25mm internal cannon in 2017. It brought those capabilities to Japan later that year in its first operational deployment overseas . Now the 34th, along with is sister unit the 4th Fighter Squadron, together with the 419th Fighter Wing’s the 466th Fighter Squadron, have now taken another step in demonstrating the Air Force’s ability to conduct, real, high-tempo operations with the Joint Strike Fighter if required in the future. Update: 7:00pm EST— All 35 of the F-35s that took part in the drill did successfully take off, Lockheed Martin has informed The War Zone in a statement.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 18, 2019",Pics Of USS Zumwalt While Replenishing At Sea Show Yet Another Non-Stealthy Antenna,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s controversial stealth destroyer, USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) , continues on its path toward entering operational service, albeit in a watered-down state. At the same time, the second of three planned Zumwalt class ships, USS Michael Mansoor (DDG-1001), is also making progress towards being commissioned. It even grabbed a quick photo op alongside the Royal Navy’s supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth as it sailed off the eastern seaboard while undergoing F-35 shipboard testing. But last time we caught up with Zumwalt , we noted how the ship’s stealthiness has been degraded by bolt-on systems, many of which are a result of the never-ending cost-saving initiatives that have plagued the Zumwalt program since its future fleet size began to shrink drastically. Now we have new detailed photos of these modifications and the first ones that we know showing the ship executing an underway replenishment operation. In the photo below, you see in detail the mast and a number of aerials installed atop the ship’s composite deckhouse and satcom antenna systems that have been bolted onto its sides. Maybe most concerning is that large high-frequency vertical antenna that is bolted on the smallest sponson. It probably has the ability to pivot down into a horizontal position as well. One can only guess as to how much such a non-low observable feature impacts the ship’s greater radar cross-section. MSC When we recently wrote about these alterations, which we said we have said were coming for years, after the ship first reemerged for ongoing trials after getting many of its combat systems fitted, the large vertical antenna array wasn’t installed. Also visible is a relatively small set of upper and lower sliding doors that are used for underway replenishments like this one being conducted alongside USNS Yukon (T-AO202). We also get a good look at the various serpentine apertures and duct systems built into Zumwalt’s deckhouse. From what I understand, these are largely used for cooling. The largest ones pull cool air in and mix it with the Zumwalt’s exhaust that exists out of a two-dimensional funnel on the top side of the deckhouse. This helps lower the ship’s infrared signature, a near-universal weakness that makes combat ships vulnerable to detection by everything from satellites to high-flying drones to maritime patrol aircraft and even other ships. It’s also worth noting that Zumwalt has no radar apertures on the port or starboard sides of her deckhouse. There appears to be some for electro-optical, advanced data-link, and electronic surveillance and electronic warfare systems , but her SPY-3 radar system, which was drastically downgraded as part of the aforementioned cost-saving initiatives, uses three arrays, two on the angled front facets of her deckhouse and one at the back. The shot below gives us a view of how tiny the opening is on Zumwalt for underway replenishments as well as some of her other features. These include the cupola for the 30mm Bushmaster cannons—downgraded from the far more capable 57mm gun systems—set above her rear hangar bay. Also, the Mk57 vertical launch system doors that line her flight deck appears to be open. Finally, we see her rear deckhouse angled surface, which has quite a few systems embedded flush into it. The SPY-3 radar array can be seen up the structure’s upper left area, which is pretty tiny looking actually! MSC Finally, below is another view of the ship taken from what appear to be Yukon’s bridge wings. Zumwalt is still an impressive and outright otherworldly looking machine. Sadly, her Advanced Gun Systems that take up her forward third are useless as they have no ammo , an issue we have dived into at considerable depth . But maybe what’s most visible here is Zumwalt’s tumblehome bow that produced amazingly little way judging by this photo. MSC Hopefully, now that she has been outfitted with her combat systems, the Navy will start really giving us a better look at this ship , including some photos or video of her one-of-a-kind mission center.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 7, 2018",Navy Attack Subs Lost More Than Two Decades Worth Of Operational Time To Maintenance Delays,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s submarine community has been the focus of great attention recently as the service has offered new details about plans for multiple new classes of submarines and plans for a Topgun-like training program for submariners. Unfortunately, a new report from a top Congressional watchdog highlights the Navy’s continuing struggles to maintain the attack sub fleet it already has, with the service incurring more than $1.5 billion in charges in the past decade to keep boats sitting pier-side for months, and sometimes years, awaiting major maintenance The result? Decades of operational time lost in the process. On Nov. 19, 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released an unclassified version of its review, which focuses on the maintenance backlog impacting Los Angeles – , Virginia – , and Seawolf -class attack submarines , but does not include data relating to Ohio -class ballistic and cruise missile boats. Just over a year earlier, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Tofalo, then-Commander, Submarine Forces, had himself acknowledged the extent of the issue and warned that the service might not be able to meet the demands for a surge in submarine deployments during a major conflict. “Submarine fleet and squadron officials emphasized the strict safety culture that permeates the submarine community,” GAO’s investigators noted in their new report. “Officials added that the Navy will delay deployment dates if necessary to ensure that these standards are met. As a result, deployed readiness is high and attack submarines are in excellent material condition as compared with the rest of the Navy fleet.” It’s not a bad attitude to have. Submarines, especially nuclear-powered types , are complex and any major system failure, particularly one that occurs underwater, could be disastrous . The Los Angeles -class USS Helena arrives at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for major maintenance in 2015., USN The problem is that the Navy has suffered a significant loss of its own shipyard capacity in recent years, something that GAO investigated separately in 2017 . At present, the service has four public shipyards capable of heavy maintenance on submarines, which are Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. With limited available space to conduct heavy maintenance, surface ships and submarines both have to dutifully wait their turn for repairs. These shipyards also serve surface vessels and perform other tasks . So, it’s not surprising that delays have had a cascading impact on the maintenance schedules. This has had a particularly pronounced impact on the extra safety-conscious officials in charge of the submarine fleets. “The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures,” the GAO review explained. “Our analysis found that the primary driver affecting attack submarines are delays in completing depot maintenance.” The Los Angeles -class USS City of Corpus Christi in Dry Dock 1 at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility., USN Between 2008 and 2018, attack submarines undergoing heavy maintenance experienced a combined total of more than 8,470 days of delays – equivalent to more than 23 years of total operational time lost. Boats in the aging Los Angeles -class, the Navy’s primary attack submarine type at present, alone accounted for more than 6,280 of those days. On top of that, attack submarines spent nearly 1,900 days – more than five years of total time – simply sitting idle in port, waiting to begin maintenance availabilities. Each day a Los Angeles class submarine was either in dry dock or waiting its turn cost the U.S. government almost $136,000 on average. This price point was significantly higher for the three larger Seawolfs , which have unique maintenance demands. Block I Virginias were slightly more expensive to maintain than the older Los Angeles types, but Block II boats were far cheaper. A breakdown of the days lost to delays and idle periods, as well as the average costs per day, among the US Navy’s attack submarine fleets., GAO In total, over the past 10 years, the Navy has spent around $1.5 billion paying just for delays and idle periods, in addition to just losing the use of those submarines for extended periods of time. The Los Angeles -class USS Boise has been out of service the longest, awaiting overhaul since June 2016. By the time she starts her maintenance availability in January 2019 she will have been sitting idle for more than two and a half years . “If you have a submarine that’s tied up in the shipyard, then obviously they’re not operating,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Tofalo had said in November 2017 . “It’s probably most manifest in our ability to surge in time of crisis. We meet our … demand on a day to day basis, but the impact would be, if there’s a crisis, then your surge tank is low.” The USS Boise sitting idle at Norfolk Naval Station., USN Since then, this has only become a more worrisome reality amid U.S. military planning for major conflicts with near-peer adversaries, such as Russia and China . Both of those countries have stepped up their submarine activity and the Chinese, in particular, are working to grow and modernize their already large submarine fleets . GAO did note that the Navy has been hiring more personnel to staff its existing public shipyards, is making new capital investments in those facilities, and has developed a plan to better optimize the space available. The service still expects the delays to continue, though, and GAO believes that the cumulative impact means that they will keep growing in length. This could cost the U.S. government around another $266 million between 2018 and 2023 to pay for delays and to keep submarines in shipyards waiting for maintenance – and that’s only if current trends continue as expected. So, GAO recommended that the service develop a proper formal business case to examine all of its available options for easing and hopefully eventually eliminating the maintenance backlog. This would include better exploring how it can spread maintenance work between its own shipyards and private firms. The Los Angeles -class USS Dallas arrives at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility to begin the inactivation and decommissioning process, another task that facility uses it shipyards to perform, in January 2018., USN Over the past five years, the Navy has sent around eight million man-hours of submarine maintenance to private yards, according to GAO. The problem is that this has been on a sporadic, case-by-case basis, which has, in turn, resulted in its own issues and delays. Without standing deals, the service has to go through a contracting process in each individual instance to get a boat into a private yard. That firm then has to hire or allocate workers who may not be experienced with the boats in question or submarines in general. The complicated demands of the Navy’s all-nuclear submarine fleet and the highly classified nature of the boats’ reactors, not to mention their missions systems , only exacerbates these issues . “The sporadic shifts in workload have resulted in repair workload gaps that have disrupted private shipyard workforce, performance, and capital investment – creating costs that are ultimately borne in part by the Navy,” GAO explained. “We would like to give them work on a semi-regular basis to at least create some efficiency for submarine maintenance,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Tom Moore, head of Naval Sea Systems Command, had said during a speech to the American Society of Naval Engineers (ASNE) Fleet Maintenance and Modernization Symposium in September 2018 . “So that when we have peak years at naval shipyards we can choose to source that work out to the private sector.” Sending boats back to the manufacturer, where these skill sets may be more established, is another option, but won’t necessarily be one forever. General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding, which build the Virginias and will also build the future Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines, say they will each have the capacity to host major submarine maintenance for the next five years. The Virginia -class USS Minnesota under construction in 2012., Newport News Shipbuilding However, with the Navy’s desire to increase Virginia -class production and begin constructing the Columbias at those same yards in the coming years, that isn’t a long-term solution. The maintenance backlog also raises questions about whether or not the service is ready to accommodate any influx of new submarines, as well as its plans for new types , on top of its existing fleets. Some older submarines will get retired as new ones come online, but there will still be transition periods and the Navy is almost constantly looking to expand the overall size of its submarine force. “The Department of Defense concurs with this recommendation and has taken the first steps to take a more holistic view of submarine maintenance requirements and impacts across both the public and private shipyards,” the Office of the Secretary of Defense told GAO after reviewing the report. Any direct response from the Navy is not provided in the unclassified version of the report. The Navy will have to move quickly if it wants to begin implementing any new maintenance processes in the near-term. It can ill afford to make any more of a habit of having submarines sitting idle in port for years on end. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",USAF Wing Boss Is Crowdsourcing New Paint Scheme For Aggressor F-16,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The commander of Nellis Air Force Base’s prestigious 57th Wing , Brig. Gen. Robert Novotny , is doing something truly outside-the-box and engaging—he is crowdsourcing a new adversary paint scheme for one of the 64th Aggressor Squadron’s (64th AGRS) Block 32 F-16C Vipers. This initiative has been taking place for nearly two weeks on the commander’s Facebook page , where he is taking submissions from the public and people are judging them in rounds. So far, participants have put forward some pretty good contenders, too. The War Zone is particularly interested in new aggressor paint schemes for a number of reasons beyond the fact that they just look cool. Most notably, they can reflect the geopolitical realities of the time and can give some indication of what aerial threats the Pentagon sees as pressing. They also serve a very real purpose, as I described in a previous piece on the topic : In an article in Aerotechnews.com , Captain Ken Spiro, the chief intel officer for the 64th AGRS described how they come up with these threat paint jobs. Of interesting note is that the new “shark” scheme seen today has been in the works since at least August of 2016: “The paint scheme is a means of representing threats more accurately… There are real-world threats that paint their jets in this way so we are changing over to make it more physically like their aircraft. Once a pilot who is training comes within visual range of the new Aggressor, they’ll be seeing a similar situation to what they would see with an actual threat aircraft… The idea started at the 64th AGRS because we’re always looking for different ways to be more threat representative, and make the training more realistic… The 64th AGRS gets creative in extra ways, such as paint schemes to accurately and better represent threats. We act like, look like, or anything you can think of we try so we can be true to the threats… We are working on a second ‘shark’ scheme because the 64th AGRS would like to see two threats eventually. That scheme is in the design stages right now and the preliminary designs have been sent over to Viper for their changes and approval.” The idea of US aggressors sporting the shark scheme adorned with red stars is maybe a little more controversial than other paint jobs that have come and gone in the past as US-Russian relations have hit an all-time low, and the paint job is being flown on Russian jets in Syria today. But really, the fact that the 64th can jettison the political correctness to bring a richer threat representation to front-line fighter pilots underscores how big of a deal their job is, and it is more important now than ever. Fighter pilots have been known to get “buck fever” the first time they see an enemy aircraft in real life. This distraction can lead to mistakes being made and to slower reaction times right when brevity is needed most. The 64th gets pilots accustomed to this phenomenon in a synthetic manner, so that on the battlefield they will be able to overcome their natural tendencies. In recent years, ever more elaborate and striking ‘splinter’ style camouflage schemes have become popular on U.S. aggressor aircraft, with the 18th Fighter Squadron out of Eielson AFB in Alaska adopting variations of it as their standard paint scheme, including this especially striking forest or ‘BDU’ splinter scheme. The Navy has also been quick to adopt the splinter scheme as of late. VFC-12 flies a white, gray, and black variation of this scheme first seen on an early Su-35 variant , for instance. That same unit also brought Russia’s dark gray scheme to life in the states and the 64th Aggressor Squadron followed suit with one of their F-16s. But considering that China is now the most concerning peer-state technological competitor of the United States, it may be smart to base future profiles more on the paint schemes commonly found on their fighter aircraft. The 64th Aggressor Squadron is one of only two dedicated aggressor squadrons in the USAF. A third unit existed at Nellis in recent times, the 65th Aggressor Squadron that flew F-15C/Ds, but it was shuttered and elements of it were absorbed by the 64th as part of the Obama-era defense cuts. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7g7B9aC6Jew The 64th AGRS flies an eclectic mix of paint schemes on their F-16s to replicate the threats U.S. and allied pilots could see during conflicts abroad. Each F-16 usually gets repainted about every six years. The squadron’s aircraft and their primary adversary mission are usually highlighted during each round of Red Flag large force employment exercises that occur at Nellis a few times year, but the 64th does far more than supporting Red Flag alone. They take part in Weapons School evolutions, provide adversarial components for operational test initiatives and also play the bad guys during many other USAF exercises. 64th Aggressor Squadrons Vipers high over the Nevada Testing And Training Range., USAF The reality is that the 64th AGRS is the most visible component of a deep and shadowy ecosystem within the Air Force that works tirelessly to provide as realistic simulation of and as accurate information on potential enemies as possible, as well as tailored tactics used to successfully counter those standing and emerging threats to airmen and their missions. This expansive but quiet initiative includes the clandestine exploitation of captured foreign military hardware and the collection of critical intelligence, as well as the conveyance of enemy tactics and capabilities to the fleet in the form of physical threat representations and hard intelligence products. A red star with sickle and hammer adorns a 64th Aggressor Squadron pilot’s flight bag as he walks to the jet. The emulation of the enemy runs far deeper than flying to mimic their tactics in colorful jets. , USAF Actual threat representations are the culmination of work of many aggressor stakeholders and come in a variety of forms. These include cyber, space, and electronic warfare, as well as employing enemy radars and surface-to-air missile systems on the training ranges and all the foreign tactics and procedures that go along with it. For instance, at Red Flag, it is not uncommon for pilots to try to communicate over the radio only to hear a Soviet-era standard crackling loudly over the frequency. Over the ranges during mission intervals, the 64th AGRS uses the ground control intercept concept to hone in on their targets, with controllers mimicking foreign procedures and tactics. Threat emitters that replicate foreign SAM fire control radars or actual foreign hardware is used to enhance the quality of the training. And before any of this happens, intelligence is secretly collected, pored over, and refined before being implemented in training. As noted earlier, this can even include the examination and testing of enemy hardware itself. USAF So having the 64th AGRS jets look awesome is not only good for training, but they are also something of public ambassadors for all those involved in this highly secretive and demanding facet of the USAF’s portfolio, much of which the 57th Wing holds. So if you have an artistic flare and want a say in what the USAF’s next aggressor F-16 will look like, head over to Facebook and tell the 57th Wing boss what’s up!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 5, 2018","Sacked Thunderbirds Boss Took Formation Supersonic, Placed Hands Around Neck Of Pilot","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report by Air Force Times’ Stephen Losey adds some much-needed color to the abrupt removal of Lt. Col. Jason Heard, the commander of the USAF Flight Demonstration Team, aka The Thunderbirds, a year ago. Not only was a physical altercation with another pilot at the heart of that decision, but a pattern of risk-taking and needlessly dangerous behavior also was a factor. Losey reports that the altercation in question occurred at an Irish pub located at National Harbor, Maryland on September 11th, 2017, a day after executing a delta formation flyover of the Redskins season opener at FedEx Field. The report, which Losey obtained via the Freedom Of Information Act, noted that multiple witnesses testified the Thunderbirds formation flew well below the minimum regulated altitude for a flyover of a populated area during that display. Before that, Heard, who was an F-15E Weapon Systems Officer turned Strike Eagle pilot, had repeatedly decided to break the rules while his teammates were flying just feet away from his aircraft. This included taking the diamond formation supersonic during a transit flight to the Royal International Air Tattoo in the UK back in July of 2017. Heard also attempted a loop on takeoff at an airshow in Boise even though weather conditions were below the minimums allowed for the maneuver. USAF Thunderbirds These types of acts, which made some pilots in the team think he was going to kill them, and a generally hostile and risk-taking management style led to tensions with those directly under his command to boil over at the Maryland bar on September 11th. Losely writes: “Seven witnesses observed the altercation, the report said, and “witness testimony was consistent that Lt. Col. Heard placed his hands around [the unnamed pilot’s] neck.” Witnesses told investigators that both Heard and the other pilot had consumed alcohol that evening. One of the witnesses, who was closest to the two, intervened and broke it up, the report said.” Ironically, Heard stated the following when he was selected to head the Thunderbirds in November of 2016: “To me, service as a Thunderbird is both an honor and a privilege… It requires significant sacrifice rewarded by the trust our fellow airmen place in us to represent them to the public. I promise to provide adaptive leadership, maintain the standards and fly a safe show.” Clearly, that was a hollow declaration considering what we know now. USAF It remains unclear what exactly happened to Heard after being pulled from the Thunderbirds roster, but based on these revelations, doing so seems now like a far more essential move than it did at the time. All we really knew then was that he had lost the trust of his team and that his focus on safety—or lack thereof—was an issue. Trust is everything in an elite aerobatic demonstration squadron environment. The CO literally flies with the other pilots in the formation’s lives in his hands. Still, it’s not like this is the first time someone in such a demanding position hasn’t worked out . But in this case, Heard got pulled for the very worst reasons, not because the unique type of flying just wasn’t a good fit—even the best fleet pilots can have issues with the very tight and precise formation flying the demo demands—or due to external, personal circumstances. Instead, he was selectively unsafe and fostered an adversarial work environment for his teammates. Make sure to read Losey’s entire report on the matter, linked here once again , for all the details.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2018",Tensions Between Ukraine And Russia Boil Over In Sea Of Azov As Chances For War Escalate (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Events have been moving very fast and details remain foggy, but what we do know is that the friction that has been building in the Sea of Azov, the shallow body of water between Ukraine and Russia, has come to a head. Reports indicate that a Russian vessel rammed a Ukrainian tugboat Yany Kapu , damaging the vessel. The tugboat was part of a trio of Ukrainian ships, which also included Berdiansk and Nikopol gunboats, that were transiting from Odessa in the Black Sea to the port city of Mariupol in the Sea of Azov. Ukraine says the Russian ships also opened fire on one of their gunboats, possibly injuring some of its crew. Russia says the boats were carrying out aggressive maneuvers after illegally entering their territorial waters. Ukraine says the small flotilla was also stalked by attack helicopters during the incident. The vessels have since been boarded by Russian forces. Not long after that encounter, Russia blocked the entrance to the Sea of Azov via positioning a freighter length-wise in front of the entrance under the 12-mile long bridge Russia had built recently across the Kerch Strait. Many have claimed that the bridge was partly designed for just this type of circumstance, to choke off access to Ukraine’s eastern ports from the Black Sea and beyond. Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters and Su-25 attack jets are now patrolling the Kerch Strait as part of what appears to be the beginning of a blockade. For months , Ukraine had warned that Russia would deny access to the Sea of Azov to ships heading to Ukrainian ports in an effort to further erode Ukraine’s economy and assert total control over the body of water. Some posit that such an act would be a prelude to large military offensive to seize Ukrainian port cities and to eventually connect Russian backed-separatist territory in Eastern Ukraine with Russian-held Crimea. Russia has been slowing and hassling marine traffic heading to Ukrainian ports via the Kerch Strait for months and the entire area has been under a persistent electronic warfare blanket, with GPS jamming being a regularly observed occurrence . Russia has also reinforced its military capabilities on the eastern shore of the Sea of Azov. A map of the region shows how the nearly land-locked body of water can be controlled via Kerch Strait. With Russia seizing Crimea to the west back in 2014 and Russian-backed separatists holding territory in eastern Ukraine, it isn’t hard to imagine Russian designs for connecting those to areas together and controlling all of the Sea of Azov and severely wounding Ukraine in the process. Doing so would likely mean an all-out war between Ukraine and Russia, and such a regional conflict could spread rapidly to become one global in scale. But just making Ukraine’s ports on the Sea of Azov useless would be a huge hit to Ukraine on many levels and could weaken the country’s ability to fight in the future substantially. , Google Maps Now, military capabilities from both countries are pouring into the area and an outright conflict has never been more possible between the two bitter neighbors. After calling an emergency war cabinet meeting, President Poroshenko ordered the country’s entire military to be ready for all-out conflict. Poroshenko has been warning of this exact type of circumstance for months now, stating a month ago: “We are getting ready to repel Russian aggression from sea in the Sea of Azov area. Powder should be kept ready.” What’s could very well come next is an outpouring of anti-Russian sentiment on the streets of Kiev and Russian cyber attacks at least on Ukraine’s ability to access and send information to the outside world, and possibly much more. Russia could also begin an electronic warfare operation around the Sea of Azov to limit Ukrainian forces’ ability to communicate and navigate the area. A pointed information warfare campaign is almost a given considering Moscow’s recent track record. We should also see NATO reconnaissance aircraft begin to push into the area on a much higher tempo than in the past so that an up to date picture of Russia’s electronic order of battle can be obtained, as well as critical intelligence on force movements and posture, as well as other intelligence products, such as communications intelligence, to get an idea of what Russia’s intentions are. A standoff around the Kerch Strait is almost inevitable at this point, but what how far this escalates militarily has a lot to do with Russia’s intentions. If Russian forces planned this event and it was not some fluke incident – which seems unlikely – then they likely had a larger outcome in mind. If this was a saber-rattling move aimed at moving forward Russia’s creeping control of the Sea of Azov by installing a short blockade, we could see a move to de-escalate not long after an initial standoff and Russian show of force. If the blockade was planned to be long-term in nature, then that’s a whole other and much more complex geopolitical and military problem. Regardless, the chances for an unintended spark to set the region on fire has risen drastically. The next 24 hours will be quite perilous and we can only hope the international community will step in and try to negotiate some sort of de-escalation deal. In an official statement , the Ukraine Government seems to be pushing for rapid external involvement in order to keep this incident from morphing into a full-blown conflict—one that could be very bloody and that they have a questionable chance of winning, quite frankly. The statement reads: Provocative actions of the Russian Federation in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov have transgressed all boundaries and become aggressive. Ships of the Russian Federation, in violation of freedom of navigation, unlawfully used force against the ships of Ukrainian Naval Forces. We consider such aggressive actions as a violation of the norms of the UN Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Ukraine will take all appropriate measures to ensure diplomatic and legal response. We will also inform our partners about the aggressive acts of the Russian Federation in the Sea of Azov. Such actions pose a threat for security of all states of the Black Sea Region, thus demand clear reaction of international community. We will continue to update this post as the aftermath of this incident plays out. Update: 1:00pm PST— Here is an updated official statement on the incident from Ukraine: On Sunday, November 25 a group of vessels, namely two small-sized ‘Berdiansk’ and ‘Nikopol’ armored artillery boats and the ‘Yany Kapu’ (Yanı Qapı) tugboat of Ukraine’s Navy were carrying out a planned transfer from the port of Odesa to the port of Mariupol of the Sea of Azov. Notification about the transfer plans was done in advance in accordance with international rules to ensure safe navigation. The Russian dispatcher service refused to ensure the right to freedom of navigation, guaranteed by international agreements. Though a 2003 treaty designates the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov as shared territorial waters, Russia first stopped Ukrainian navy vessels from entering the Sea of Azov via the Kerch Strait by placing a huge cargo ship beneath a Russian-controlled bridge. After that, contrary to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Use of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, Russian ships – Sobol-class patrol boats, the ‘Don’ coast guard ship, Mangust-class patrol boats, and the ‘Suzdalets’ corvette – carried out openly aggressive acts against the ships of the Ukrainian Navy. According to the Ukrainian Navy, Russia open fire at small-sized ‘Berdiansk’ and ‘Nikopol’ armored artillery boats. The boats have been damaged and lost ability to move. The ‘Yany Kapu’ (Yanı Qapı) tugboat also lost ability to move following Russian assault. Six Ukrainian crew members have been wounded. Russian special forces have captured all the three Ukrainian ships. All illegal actions have been recorded by the crews of the ships and the command of Ukraine’s Navy and reports will be handed over to the respective international agencies. The President of Ukraine is now holding a military cabinet meeting. UKRAINE CONSIDERS RUSSIAN ACTIONS AS ACT OF AGGRESSION. Russians are claiming that the Ukrainian ships are now heading back to Berdyansk. We are checking this information. The President of Ukraine has condemned Russia’s violation of norms of the international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. He has called international community to condemn Russian actions and introduce sanctions against Kremlin. Update: 1:27pm PST— It looks like Ukraine is expecting the worst. U.N. Security Council and NATO will probably announce emergency meetings. Update: 1:59pm PST— Russia has confirmed that it seized the Ukrainian Navy vessels. So this seems to also be a prisoner situation as well, at least at this point. They also confirmed that they fired weapons during the incident and that “three wounded military servicemen of the Ukrainian armed forces received medical assistance.” More here: Here’s another view of the ramming: Here’s NATO’s statement: Update: 3:00pm PST— There are now reports that the Ukranian government has moved to institute Martial Law and that the country’s parliament, known as the Verkhovna Rada or just the Rada, is also looking to formally declare a state of war with regards to Russia. This could include the activation of reserve forces and an increase in the alert status for all personnel deployed along Ukraine’s eastern front with both Russia proper and the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk . The latter areas are under the partial control of Russian-backed separatist forces. Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko has made it clear that a declaration of Martial Law would not lead to offensive operations outside of Ukraine’s borders. He also reiterated support for the two so-called Minsk agreements , which have sought to provide for a political settlement over the status of the country’s eastern separatist areas. In addition, Ukranian protesters in Kiev have set tires alight, fired flares, burned paper boats, and are otherwise demonstrating outside of the Russian Embassy. Some individuals are chanting “death to Russia.” Update: 3:40pm PST— Russia’s state-owned Channel 1 television station has put out the theory, without evidence, that the incident in the Kerch Strait was the product of a coordinated between unspecified members of the U.S. government and Ukranian authorities to up-end an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit, which will begin in Argentina on Nov. 30, 2018. Putin reportedly proposed some form of referendum on the status of Donetsk and Luhansk during a summit in the Finnish capital Helsinki in July 2018. The U.S. government later denied that it was considering any such proposal. Channel 24, another state-run outlet, later reported that that Ukranian vessels had turned back in the face of the blockade and did not mention the exchange of fire or the seize of Ukranian ships. Given what we have seen in the past, it is highly likely that Russian state-run and quasi-state media will seek to distract, deflect , and offer misinformation and disinformation about the incident. Reported Russian language audio of radio communications between the Russian and Ukranian vessels during the inciting incident in the Kerch Strait has also emerged. One translation suggests that the three Ukrainian vessels declared that they were moving through the region as per existing agreements even after the Russians fired on them and brought them to a halt. Update: 4:10pm PST— Lyudmyla Denisova , Ukraine’s top human rights official, says she is unaware of the location and status of the Ukranian sailors that Russia detained during the Kerch Strait incident. Update: 4:15pm PST— The European Union (EU), of which Ukraine is not a member, has issued the following statement : The tensions in the Azov Sea and Kerch Strait have increased dangerously  today, after an incident this morning between Russian and Ukrainian  naval vessels as the latter were attempting to pass through the Kerch  strait as well as subsequent developments, including the closure of the  strait for traffic by Russian authorities and reported seizures of  Ukrainian vessels and shots being fired at them. We expect Russia to restore freedom of passage at the Kerch Strait and urge all to act with utmost restraint to de-escalate the situation immediately. As clearly stated by the High Representative at the European  Parliament recently, the events in the Sea of Azov are a demonstration of how instability and tensions are bound to rise when the basic rules of international cooperation are disregarded. The construction of the  Kerch Bridge took place without Ukraine’s consent and constitutes another violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has led, in parallel with the militarization of the Azov Sea, to tougher controls on naval traffic in the strait. The European Union expects Russia to stop the inspections. The EU does not and will not recognize the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia. Update: 4:20pm PST— Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko has appealed to the EU, parties to the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances , and those countries participating in the Normandy format to “protect Ukraine.” Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia, United States, and the United Kingdom signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994, which gave security assurances to the post-Soviet republics regarding their territorial integrity. The Normandy format refers to a diplomatic bloc consisting of Germany, France, Russia, and Ukraine, which produced the aforementioned Minsk agreements. Update: 4:40pm PST— Russia’s Embassy in the United States has Tweeted out a Russian Foreign Ministry statement from Nov. 21, 2018, that says Russia holds “Ukraine and the states that support its provocative actions” responsible for “further aggravation of the situation in the Azov Sea-Kerch water area.” This press release does not make any mention of the 2003 agreement outlining both countries’ rights to use the body of the water. Update: 5:10pm PST— Per U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council regarding the situation in and around the Kerch Strait is set to occur at 11:00 AM on Nov. 26, 2018.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Defunct Military Listening Post For Sale In Scotland Is A Doomsday Prepper’s Dream,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sure, massive ranches, sprawling desert compounds, huge underground missile silos, and even castles tend to get the most attention when it comes to the fantastical end of the doomsday prepper spectrum. But for those preparing for the end of the world as we know it and are looking for a promising property that would demand far less investment, there’s a spot in Scotland that seems near ideal. Built in 1985 and officially opened by Princess Anne, Baldo Bridge Listening Station, a surplus SATCOM II intelligence gathering and communications post, sits on nine acres just a stroll away from the country town of Kinross in Scotland. The facility was manned by personnel from the Royal Corps of Signals 242 Signal Squadron and worked to intercept enemy satellite communications traffic—such a Russian ballistic missile launch orders—for two decades before being decommissioned in 2006 and sold off in 2007. It’s been back on and off the market since roughly 2014 and it appears to be in pristine condition and oddly unmodified from its past life. amazingresults.com The site sits on the corner of what was once RAF Balado Bridge, an airfield that opened in 1942 and served as an auxiliary station for larger nearby airbases as well as for training foreign aircrews on Spitfire and Hurricane fighters. After the war, the facility quickly turned into an aircraft graveyard and was shut down officially in 1956. Later on, the airfield was remediated and turned over to private hands. You can still see the outline of the runways in satellite photos. Google Earth The Balado Listening Station has garnered the nickname ‘The Golfball’ from locals in Kinross-shire due to the radome over the facility’s receiver antenna. Beyond this most outstanding detail, the installation offers all the things a prepper dreams of and not in some run-down and dilapidated state. The place is secured like a prison or other very high-value military site with double row security fencing lit by high-output lighting. The intense security is a product of the fact that it had to operate even during a time of extreme crisis or outright war, gathering time-sensitive communication intelligence. The structures on the site were built hardened and include office space, workshops, garages, guard posts, living spaces with mess and recreation areas, as well as the extremely secure areas that were specific to the listening post’s technical operation. There is even a tower for radio comms and nearby surveillance. , Veedar/wikicommons A filtration system protects the base’s inhabitants while ‘buttoned up’ during a nuclear, chemical, or biological incident and due to the nature of the place’s mission, the facility is hardened against electromagnetic pulses as well. Onsite fuel storage and powerful industrial generators allow the site to run independently without outside electricity for a prolonged period of time. There is clearly plenty of space for expansion and considering what surrounds the rural site, the land looks excellent for farming. There is also water right next door and the valley the place is located in appears to be gorgeous. Here is an entire tour of the property including interior shots. Altogether it seems like a doomsday prepper’s dream site that is just about as close to turnkey as they come. And the price is laughably low considering the many millions of dollars something like this would cost to build today. The property is currently listed at $1.22M, but it has sat on the market for some time so you could probably get a heck of a deal. amazingresults.com The fact is that many people have made something out of far more inconveniently located and run-down Cold War-era surplus sites than this which makes the reality that it is still on the market surprising. Oh yeah, and the big satellite listening dish also comes with the deal—maybe a plus for the amateur radio astronomer who also seriously believes in an impending zombie apocalypse?

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2018",Ukraine Moves Toward Martial Law As Russia Refuses To Free Sailors And Ships Seized In Skirmish (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A day after a serious skirmish between Ukranian and Russian forces in the Kerch Strait, which separates the Sea of Azov from the Black Sea, left multiple Ukranian boats and their crews, including injured sailors, detained in Russian-controlled Crimea, both countries are on high alert as the international community takes stock of the situation. Ukraine is on the verge of Martial Law while American intelligence gathering aircraft and drones have been flying missions in the region and pictures have emerged showing the Ukranian boats Russia seized during the incident sitting in the Russian-controlled port of Kerch. On Nov. 26, 2018, Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko signed a Martial Law decree , which would go into effect on Nov. 28, 2018. At the time of writing, Ukraine’s legislators in the country’s parliament, the Rada, were still debating whether to formally sanction the measure. Poroshenko had also gone on national television to make a public appeal, claiming, without providing evidence to the public, that his intelligence services had warned him that Russia was preparing a ground offensive against the country. Russia and Ukraine both accuse the other of provoking the incident in the Kerch Strait. If the Rada signs off on the Martial Law measure, Ukraine’s Border Guards will be empowered to increase their presence along the border with Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. The country’s intelligence agency, known by the acronym SBU, will step up counter-intelligence efforts, including those focused on disrupting hostile information operations and cyber attacks , both of which Russia has used to effect against Ukraine in the past. The Ukranian Ministry of the Interior would also deploy additional personnel to provide physical security at critical sites. Under Ukranian Law, a declaration of Martial Law could also give state security forces broad sweeping authority to restrict freedom of movement and assembly, implement curfews, and censor media outlets. So far, though, there are no clear indications that Poroshenko plans to implement any of those provisions. However, the 12th provision of his official decree was sealed and not published publicly. Poroshenko had originally called for 60 days of Martial Law, but has reportedly agreed to limit this to 30 days in exchange for parliamentary approval. With that truncated schedule, Ukraine would, barring an extension of the plan, return to normal law and order by the end of 2018. In the meantime, commercial transit through the Kerch Strait has resumed. Russia, however, is at present refusing to return the Ukranian boats and their crews. Photos have appeared online showing Ukraine’s two patrol boats, which the press has often referred to as “artillery boats,” along with the tug that was accompanying them, in Kerch Port. Russia’s top human rights official, Tatyana Moskalkova , said that Russian forces had detained a total of 24 Ukranian sailors and that three were injured and recovering in hospital. The location or locations where the Kremlin was holding the other individuals and under what conditions remained unclear. At present, neither President Donald Trump nor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has issued a formal statement regarding the skirmish. Other European countries, including NATO allies Canada, Poland, and the United Kingdom, have all issued strong rebukes toward Russia, blaming it for the altercation. U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, had already Tweeted out a less official condemnation of Russian actions. “Russia seizes ships and crew and then accuses Ukraine of provocation???” he wrote as the skirmish was unfolding. Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the annual G20 meeting, which will begin on Nov. 30, 2018, in Argentina. Russian state media has already accused the unspecified entities within the U.S. and Ukranian government, without evidence, of trying to scuttle those talks by deliberately touching off the maritime brawl in the Kerch Strait. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley offered the first real official condemnation of Russia’s actions, which she described as those of an “outlaw,” during an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Nov. 26, 2018. Russia had initially sought to set the agenda framed around what Deputy Representative Dmitry Polyanskiy described as a violation of Russia’s borders as part of a broader international conspiracy against the Kremlin. He offered no evidence to substantiate those claims. “This is no way for a law-abiding civilized nation to act. Impeding Ukraine’s lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law,” Haley said later. “It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept.” “We have seen this game before. Russia wants to consolidate its illegal annexation of Crimea and annex the Sea of Azov,” U.K. Ambassador to the U.N. said during the meeting. “Russia seems to hope that the international community will simply acquiesce and accept this new reality. We will not” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also extended the alliance’s full support to Ukraine, which is not a member of the bloc, on Nov. 26, 2018. “We are constantly assessing what more we can do,” he said. Per CNN ‘s Barbara Starr, U.S. officials say that the U.S. Air Force and Navy will be conducting increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in and around the Black Sea, Sea of Azov, and the Crimean Peninsula to gather more information about the situation. On Nov. 26, 2018, plane spotters using online flight tracking software had already seen an Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signals intelligence aircraft flying in the Black Sea and an RQ-4B Global Hawk drone performing a mission over Ukraine proper. Since Russia illegally seized Crimea in 2014 and began supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine, the United States has been flying these types of missions regularly to monitor Russian forces. Navy EP-3E signals intelligence aircraft are also routine contributors to that effort. So far, there have not been any reports of Russian aircraft aggressively intercepting American planes in the Black Sea, but this is also a regular occurrence. In February 2018, the Kremlin declared it would take more assertive actions in response to any aircraft flying near Crimea or its territory along the Black Sea. One piece of intelligence American aircraft may be able to recover is radio and other communications that could help explain just how premeditated Russia’s attempt to blockade the Kerch Strait actually was. Audio has already appeared online reportedly between Russian security forces on board the vessels that intercepted the Ukranian naval convoy, which, if confirmed, seems to indicate that at least the members of the Russian Coast Guard during the incident were actively seeking to damage or destroy the small boats rather than simply stop them. It remains unclear as to why Russia decided now as an opportune time to force the issue of the Sea of Azov, which has been brewing for months now , in such a provocative manner. Limiting Ukraine’s access to the Sea of Azov would cut off a vital trade route and help prevent the Ukrainians from rapidly deploying reinforcements during a flare-up in fighting in the country’s restive eastern Donbass region . It is possible that the Kremlin hoped to exploit President Poroshenko’s low approval ratings heading into Ukranian elections presently set to occur in March 2019 and hope to goad him into cutting a deal favorable to Russia’s demands. Russia has already accused Poroshenko of creating the tensions in the first place to invoke Martial Law and improve his political standing . Poroshenko insists that the Martial Law plan will not result in the postponement of the 2019 polls. France , Germany , and the United States all experiencing various levels of political upheaval and the primary focus in the Europe Union at the moment is the United Kingdom’s plans to leave the bloc . As such, the Russians may have simply felt it was a good moment to act when the international community was on a weaker footing overall. Whatever the reason, the skirmish is the most serious incident to occur between Russia and Ukraine directly in years and continues to hold the possibility of setting of a larger and more dangerous series of events. Hopefully, the international community can find common ground to de-escalate the situation and continue pushing for a final, negotiated settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: 11:40am PST— Ukraine’s parliament has formally voted to approval Martial Law for 30 days, beginning on Nov. 28, 2018. Of the 450 legislators, 276 voted for the measure, but only 30 voted against it. Update: 12:10pm PST— Russia’s Federal Security Service, better known by the acronym FSB, the country’s primary internal security agency, has issued an official timeline of events in the Kerch Strait, a machine translation of which is available here . What is particularly interesting is that the transcript appears to acknowledge that the Ukranian ships were operating in accordance with international law and a 2003 agreement between Ukraine and Russia over the use of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov. Russia’s primary contention appears to be that the ships did not properly file a notice that they would transit the Strait in advance with local authorities, a measure the Russians put into place in 2015, after illegally seizing Crimea. The Ukrainians contended that they had the right to freedom of navigation through the area under the 2003 agreement and ignored demands from Russian forces to stop. Update: 1:00pm PST— President Trump has offered his first comments on the situation in Ukraine while speaking to reporters outside of the White House. “We don’t like what’s happening either way,” he said, without specifically placing blame on either Russia or Ukraine. “We don’t like what’s happening.” Update: 1:50pm PST— The U.S. State Department has now issued its own statement on the skirmish in the Kerch Strait, which you can read in full below. Update: 6:00pm PST— The FSB has released a video where one of the captured Ukranian sailors “confesses” that the incident was a provocation on their part. The legitimacy of such a confession is, at the very least, highly suspect. Update: 11/27/2018 — A Russian court in occupied Crimea has reportedly remanded two of the captured Ukranian sailors to custody for two months , ostensibly for violating Russia’s borders. Another dozen individuals are awaiting hearings, with the remaining personnel to appear before the court on Nov. 28, 2018. This is almost certain to inflame tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as members of the international community, many of which have called for the immediate release of the Ukrainians.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Information is still coming in, but Russia’s future Project 22600 icebreaker the Viktor Chernomyrdin , which is under construction at Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg, has caught fire, injuring at least two people in the process. This adds to a string of fires on board Russian government-owned vessels in 2018 and comes less than a month after a major Russian Navy accident in which the floating dry dock PD-50 sunk while the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov was on board undergoing a major overhaul. The fire broke out around 7:00 PM local time in St. Petersburg on Nov. 27, 2018. By approximately 9:00 PM, the fire reportedly spread to two of the ship’s five decks and covered a total area of more than 3,000 square feet, according to a statement from the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations. The fire eventually spread to another deck . Some 15 fire trucks and more than 75 firefighters were on scene battling the blaze. Unconfirmed reports say that a short circuit started the fire and led to the initial injuries. The diesel-electric Viktor Chernomyrdin has already been something of a debacle for the Russian government. Construction first began in 2012 and the ship was supposed to enter service in 2015. Problems with the design subsequently left the project over budget and behind schedule. In 2017, Russia’s state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) moved the unfinished ship to the Admiralty Shipyard , better known for building warships and submarines, with the hope of speeding up its completion and getting it into service by the end of 2018. This fire could easily push that timeline back again. It’s another embarrassing development for Russia’s beleaguered shipyards and shipbuilding enterprises , which have seen serve high-profile accidents in 2018. In October 2018, the PD-50 dry dock, the largest in Russian inventory, sunk, leaving USC without any readily available alternatives to service the country’s lone aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov . That accident could also severely hamper the ability of the Russian Navy to conduct major repairs on other large ships and submarines in the future. The fire onboard Chernomyrdin is also only one of a number of similar mishaps that Russian ships have sustained in 2018, as well. The first of these was a blaze that broke out at Russia’s naval base in Vladivostok in the country’s Far East region in January 2018 . In February 2018, the destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov also caught fire in Vladivostok while undergoing repairs. We will update this story as more information becomes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three days after Russia fired upon and seized a pair of Ukraine Navy gunboats and a tugboat there has been no de-escalation in the tensions between the two countries. Both sides are posturing for a potential conflict and the U.S. and its European allies are coming to terms once again with the reality that Russia will continue to take whatever it can without being checked. There are increasing calls in Europe to place sanctions on Russia for what appears to be an outright and planned provocation.  Russian President Vladimir Putin denies this was the case, talking to Germany’s Chancellor Merkel by phone on Monday, Nov. 26, 2018, saying Russia will present evidence to support their claims regarding the incident. Ukraine is urging for sanctions as large parts of the country are about to come under Martial Law for at least 30 days and Ukraine military forces spin up for a potential all-out conflict. In his call with Merkel, Putin reportedly said he was “seriously concerned” about the Martial Law decree and told Ukraine to avoid any “reckless acts.” Ukranian President Petro Poroshenko says he has been unable to contact his Russian counterpart. Meanwhile, Russia is holding Ukrainian sailors – conflicting reports put the total number at either 23 or 24 – captive after its forces fired on their boats, boarded them, and seized control. The vessels are now docked in the port of Kerch with Russian guards standing watch over them while components are stripped from them. Some of these sailors were filmed making confessions that they were part of a pre-planned Ukranian provocation with those videos being plastered on Russian state-run television. The Ukrainian government denounced the confessions outright saying they were clearly forced. Those sailors may be staying under Russian lock and key for some time as a Russian court in occupied Crimea has demanded authorities continue to detain at least some of the sailors for months so that they can potentially face a trial, ostensibly for violating Russia’s borders. More hearings are scheduled and it is quite possible that all the sailors may end up facing a similar fate. The U.S. has condemned Russia’s behavior and has stated its support for Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty through all its formal diplomatic channels. Other members of NATO, including the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as the alliance’s leadership, have also denounced Russia’s aggressive actions. At the same time, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo told him that the U.S. would provide whatever support needed to Ukraine to maintain its sovereignty, including military support. What this means exactly, if indeed it is true, is still unclear. Furnishing Ukraine with offensive weaponry, a policy that the U.S. government has already begun to pursue , is one thing. Actually backstopping its military with a hard U.S. combat capability is another. The latter of which would be a drastic escalation in America’s involvement in Ukraine-Russian hostilities. We are also now getting our first images of the damage done to the Ukrainian gunboats. Reports vary, but some say the ships were fired on by a Russian border guard vessel and a Su-30 multi-role fighter. As the geopolitical drama is playing out, the U.S. has flooded the area with persistent reconnaissance flights over Eastern Ukraine and around the northern edges of the Black Sea. American intelligence and surveillance aircraft have conducted routine operations in the area to monitor the situation since Russia took control of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. NATO has also increased its presence in the region in recent years, establishing an air policing mission based in Romania and deploying additional ground forces to the area. Video of a convoy of Russian Bal anti-ship missile transporter-erector-launchers has also hit social media. Apparently, the weapons were headed near toward the center of the Kerch Strait. The Bal coastal defense system employs a version of the Kh-35 anti-ship cruise missile . The Kh-35 is roughly analogous to the American made Harpoon anti-ship missile . The significance of this, beyond optics, is being overplayed in the media as the entire Black Sea is a super anti-ship missile engagement zone . Russia has arrayed throngs of sea-, surface-, and air-launched anti-ship missiles in and around Crimea, with the Black Sea Fleet being especially heavily equipped for the anti-ship role. The Bastion-P coastal defense system , which is more capable than the Bal, was one of the first new systems to deploy to Crimea after Russia seized it in 2014. The stark reality is that it’s really a numbers game. If Russia wants something sunk in the Black Sea it will be sunk regardless of its defensive capabilities. Any foreign navies that might look to come to Ukraine’s aid and challenge Russia’s total control of the Kerch Strait face difficulties in just getting into the region at all. Per the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits, countries that do not have a Black Sea border can only deploy a certain total displaced tonnage of warships into the body of water at any one time and those ships can only remain there for a set period. The United Kingdom has reportedly dispatched the survey ship HMS Echo , which is armed only with a pair of 20mm automatic cannons and various machine guns, to the Black Sea, prompting criticism from members of parliament who say the auxiliary ship is hardly a show of force. The Royal Navy’s major surface combatants have unfortunately suffered serious readiness issues in 2018, which may be a factor in the decision. There is no word yet if the United States plans to send any ships into the area. HMS Echo ., Royal Navy Russia seems disinclined to back down regardless. Putin’s domestic approval ratings have precipitously dropped recently, which may have been one of the driving factors in why the altercation in the Kerch Strait occurred in the first place . There is also the possibility that Russia was trying to force Poroshenko, whose popularity in Ukraine is also flagging, to make concessions in the lead up to Ukranian presidential elections in March 2019. The Kremlin also has the benefit of the West, especially the United States and key members of NATO and the European Union , being distracted by a host of domestic political issues themselves. All told, it seems likely that the atmosphere in the region will remain particularly tense in the immediate future as all the parties involved continue to assess their options.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 11, 2019",Pentagon Moves Closer To Cutting Turkey’s Role In The F-35 Program If It Buys S-400 SAMs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government could reportedly reexamine Turkey’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program if that country goes ahead with its purchase of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia. But even if that particular issue is resolved, there could still be major hurdles in unfreezing deliveries of the jets to the Turkish Air Force. The potential for a change in Turkey’s status as a central partner in the Joint Strike Fighter project was among the core statements in a two-page unclassified summary of a report the Pentagon had submitted to Congress regarding the issue on Nov. 15, 2018, which Bloomberg obtained . As part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the 2019 Fiscal Year, members of Congress included a demand for Secretary of Defense James Mattis to submit a report by the end of 2018 detailing, among other things, the risks associated with Turkey’s planned purchase of the S-400s and the impact on the F-35 program if Turkey was to stop being a participant. It is not immediately clear if this summary had come attached to the report or if Congressional staff had produced it afterward. “The Turkish government has repeatedly and publicly stated that it has concluded an agreement to procure the S-400,” the summary says, according to Bloomberg . “The [Trump] administration will reassess Turkey’s continued participation as one of the eight partner nations should they continue their purchase of the S-400.” Congress had frozen the transfer of any of any F-35s to the Turkish Air Force until it had at least received this assessment. There is no requirement that they following the Pentagon’s recommendations, though. It is also a significant shift in tone from Mattis, who had previously argued stridently against Congress’ moves to cut Turkey out of the F-35 program. An artist’s conception of a Turkish F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., Turkish MND The U.S. government’s top concern, which a number of other NATO members share , is that Turkish military’s simultaneous operation of the S-400 and the F-35 could expose sensitive details about the latter’s performance against a major potential threat. Turkey has pledged to purchase up to 100 of the stealthy fighter jets. At the same time, Turkey is a major partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program, with Turkish companies building components for all three variants of the stealth fighter, including those in U.S. service. In some cases, those firms are the sole supplier. Turkey has invested more than $1.25 billion in the project and has expected to reap a much larger windfall during the aircraft’s worldwide service life as a producer of parts for new jets and replacement components. The United States could potentially seek to censure Turkey without withholding the F-35s entirely by simply scaling back the country’s involvement in the supply chain. But these disruptions could be costly for the program, which has spent considerable effort in recent years in trying to rein in the unit price of the individual jets and drive down sustain expenses . But the United States’ opposition to Turkey’s S-400 buy has been building since the Turkish government first formally announced the purchases more than a year ago. In 2015, the U.S. government succeeded in pressuring Turkey to abandon a previous plan to procure Chinese surface-to-air missile systems over similar concerns. Turkey has rejected past offers to buy the Patriot surface-to-air missile system in the past, citing cost and an unwillingness on the part of defense contractor Raytheon to provide industrial cooperation opportunities for Turkish companies. Unless something changes, the Turkish Military expects to get the first S-400s in 2019. But earlier in November 2018, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu indicated his country was still interested in potentially purchasing American air defense systems. A transporter-erector-launcher associated with Russia’s S-400 surface-to-air missile system., Vitaly Kuzmin “The current deal is a done deal – I cannot cancel it,” Cavusoglu said . “But I need more. I prefer to buy from my allies.” The tough talk in the summary is at odds with a statement from the office of Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, that came out after the Pentagon delivered the full, classified report to Congress on Nov. 15, 2018. Tillis, along with New Hampshire Democrat Senator Jean Shaheen, had been the primary sponsors of the NDAA provision blocking the delivery of F-35s to Turkey over the S-400s and other issues. “It appears that DoD has determined that Turkey has met its obligations to purchase F-35s pursuant to the provision in the NDAA,” the statement from Tillis’ office read . “The release of Pastor [Andrew] Brunson was a positive step that opens up the opportunity for improved relations between the US and Turkey. There are still some outstanding issues that must be addressed moving forward, including Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 from Russia and Turkey’s detention of other American citizens.” North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis., Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Images Brunson, an evangelic Christian minister who had been living in Turkey for years, was swept up in the crackdown that followed an abortive coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2016. Authorities charged him with terrorism-related crimes, which he strenuously denied. A Turkish court convicted him of the charges on Oct. 12, 2018, but released him immediately from house arrest afterward, citing time served and good behavior. This decision seemed to be carried out in exchange for the U.S. government relaxing various economic sanctions against Turkey. Still, in addition to the S-400 issue, the Fiscal Year 2019 NDAA had specifically name-checked Brunson, as well as Serkan Golge , a Turkish-American scientist who was also arrested in the aftermath of the failed coup. Golge remains in custody. Andrew Brunson, at left, meets with US President Donald Trump at the White House after his release in October 2018., Olivier Douliery/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images U.S.-Turkish relations remain generally strained over a host of other issues, as well. In August 2018, a group of pro-Erdoğan lawyers demanded Turkish authorities raid the American portion of Incirlik Air Base in the city of Adana, accusing various members of the U.S. military, without verifiable evidence, of having colluded with the coup plotters two years ago. Erdoğan’s administration also claims that Fethullah Gülen , an Islamic cleric and one-time political ally of the president, was behind the attempt to overthrow the country’s government. Gülen is a critic of the present Turkish government and lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Earlier in November 2018, the State Department said it was reviewing the latest extradition request from Turkey. The U.S. government has rejected previous requests , citing a lack of compelling evidence linking Gülen to the attempted coup and concerns about whether he would receive a fair trial. Lastly, despite attempts in recent months to ease the tensions , the United States and Turkey remain at odds over the former’s support for the People’s Protection Units, a Kurdish rebel group in Syria, better known by the acronym YPG. The Turkish government views these individuals as terrorists inseparably linked to other Kurdish militants waging an insurgency against the government in Ankara. American and Turkish forces conduct a joint patrol in Northern Syria in November 2018., US Army “Those who call themselves our ally and strategic partner have an opportunity to carry our relations to the future,” Erdogan told members of his political party in parliament in a televised address on Nov. 27, 2018. “If they revert from protecting terrorists that are targeting our country, then we will understand that they are siding with Turkey. Otherwise, we will do whatever is necessary for our own sake.” The United States has been working to establish joint patrols with Turkish forces in sensitive areas in Syria to help reduce the animosity, as well as setting up new outposts along the Syrian-Turkish border to try and contain the flow militants back and forth. At the same time, the U.S. military says its forces often come under fire from Turkish-backed militia groups in the country, underscoring the complex nature of the situation. Still, the summary of the Pentagon’s report on Turkey and the F-35 declares the country as “a critical NATO ally.” This may be another important factor in how the United States approaches its relationship with Turkey. A recent naval skirmish between Russia and Ukraine in the Kerch Strait separating the Black Sea from the Azov Sea has inflamed tensions between those two countries and earned the Kremlin widespread condemnation, including from NATO and the United States. Turkey occupies a particularly strategic location for the alliance in the region. All told, there are now a variety of factors beyond what may or may not happen with regards Turkey’s planned purchase of the S-400 that could impact Congress’ final decision about whether or not to lift their hold on the delivery of F-35s to Turkey. It remains to be seen whether Senator Tillis’ initially positive outlook on the situation will continue to hold in the near future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 26, 2018",Ukraine’s Ports In Azov Sea Totally Cut Off As Captured Sailors Sent To Moscow,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Days after Ukraine Navy vessels were fired upon, seized, and their crews taken captive, tensions between Moscow and Kiev continue to percolate. Those tensions have also spread around the globe, with European leaders demanding sanctions on Russia. In addition, President Trump says he canceled his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit, which begins in Buenos Aires on Friday. Ukraine now says that at least some of the detained sailors that have faced magistrates in Crimea are being moved to Moscow, which is not a good sign. Meanwhile, the Sea of Azov remains closed to all traffic destined for Ukrainian ports. This is a full-on blockade that will have a crushing impact of the already shaky Ukrainian economy. There are rumblings that Ukraine will call for the closure of the Bosphorus Strait to Russian Navy traffic as a result of Moscow’s recent acts, which would cut off the Black Sea Fleet from the Mediterranean. Ukraine Navy Commander Ihor Voronchenko stated the following during a speech at a Maritime Security conference on November 29th: “I am sure that the world community will nevertheless make a decision and recognize that aggression against the state of Ukraine was carried out … In this regard, as per the norms of the Montreux Convention, specifically item 19, we will request the closure of the Bosphorus Straight so Russia appreciates violating norms of international law.” Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko is also requesting NATO warships attempt to enter the Sea of Azov and provide security on Ukraine’s behalf: “We hope that NATO states are prepared to send naval ships to the Sea of Azov to support Ukraine and provide security… The only language he [Putin] understands is the solidarity of the Western world… We can’t accept Russia’s aggressive policies. First it was Crimea, then eastern Ukraine, now he wants the Sea of Azov.” NATO vessels passing into the shallow Sea of Azov has been a redline of sorts for Moscow, and doing so would be an incredibly bold and risky escalation. But a larger NATO presence in the Black Sea is a real possibility at this point. NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu stated the following as to the possibility of a buildup of NATO seapower in the Black Sea: “There is already a lot of NATO in the Black Sea, and we will continue to assess our presence in the region.” Poroshenko also gave his views on Russia’s wider ambitions in an interview with a German newspaper: “Don’t believe Putin’s lies… Putin wants the old Russian empire back… Crimea, Donbass, the whole country. As Russian Tsar, as he sees himself, his empire can’t function without Ukraine. He sees us as his colony.” Whatever Putin’s true objective are, the Russians seem increasingly focused on making things as turbulent as possible for Ukraine.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 16, 2018","Russia Just Launched Five Objects Into Space. One Problem, There Were Supposed To Be Four","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian military says it successfully placed three classified communications satellites into orbit today, along with the upper stage of the rocket that put them there.  But according to the U.S. military’s Combined Space Operations Center, or CSpOC, a fifth object, possibly another, unannounced satellite , may have hitched a ride into space on the launch. The Rokot/Briz-KM launch vehicle blasted off from Pad 3 at Site 133 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Western Russia at just before 5:30 PM local time on Nov. 30, 2018, according to RussianSpaceWeb.com . At approximately 7:12 PM, the three Rodnik communications satellites had deployed into their assigned orbits. Russia has named the trio of satellites Kosmos-2530, Kosmos-2531, and Kosmos-2532. This would all be rather banal had the CSpoC, as well as the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), not recorded the launch slightly differently. Information on Space-Track.org, a U.S. government website that publicly releases data on space launches from the CSpoC and NORAD, listed Objects A through E as resulting from the launch from Plesetsk. This would include the three satellites and the upper stage, but the fifth object is unexplained. It is possible that the upper stage simply fragmented into multiple pieces that were large enough for the U.S. military to track independently. Three of the objects – A through C – have essentially same perigee, the point in their orbit at which they are nearest to the earth. The other two objects – D and E – share a different general perigee. The data regarding the Nov. 30, 2018 launch from Plesetsk Cosmodrome on Space-Track.org at the time of writing., Space-Track.org But there is also the distinct possibility that this could be yet another so-called “inspector satellite.” More on that later, but we’ve actually seen almost exactly the same thing happen at least once before. On May 23, 2014, another Rokot/Briz-KM launch vehicle put three Rodnik communications satellites into orbit. Again, the U.S. military tracked five objects, with Object E , in that case, turning out to be an inspector satellite known as Kosmos-2499. The perigees and other data for the five objects are extremely similar in both cases. The five objects that the U.S. military tracked after Russia’s launch of three Rodnik communications satellites on May 23, 2014. It is noteworthy that in this case the inspector satellite Kosmos-2499, also shared the same perigee as the upper stage., Space-Track.org If this new Object E turns out to be another inspector satellite, the Russians will have now launched at least five of these that we know about. Russia launched the first three – Kosmos-2491, Kosmos-2499, and Kosmos-2504 – between 2014 and 2015. In June 2017, the Russians put a fourth such satellite into orbit known as Kosmos-2519 . To make matters more confusing , that satellite subsequently deployed another one, Kosmos-2521 in August 2017. A third subsatellite, Kosmos-2523, subsequently appeared from this cluster two months later. These three small satellites are typically treated as a single system. So, what is an inspector satellite? They ostensibly do just that, inspect other objects in space. From a benign perspective, this makes good sense, since it gives personnel on the ground a means of investigating damaged or malfunctioning objects in space remotely before deciding how best to proceed with repairs or replacement. There have even been proposals to give these maneuverable satellites their own limited ability to perform repairs. The United States and China, as well as Russia, have all be developing these types of satellites. The video below shows a concept the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been working on regarding an advanced inspector-type satellite called a Robotic Serving Vehicle (RSV). However, as we at The War Zone have noted on multiple occasions in the past, these same orbital inspectors could double as orbital spies or weapons. The craft are, by definition, capable of precise maneuvering to get close to the object of interest, have cameras, and may have small manipulator arms to help with their work. This would just as easily allow them to gather intelligence on foreign satellites or possibly disable or destroy them. They might even carry their own electronic warfare suites or other systems to blind or jam their targets. They might offer the Russians a way to locate top-secret spy satellites that certain countries, such as the United States, might not even acknowledge exist and that might be otherwise shielded from detection. We at The War Zone have previously explored the compelling information available that the U.S. government has been actively developing stealth satellites, or is at least very interested in the applicable technology, specifically to shield its space assets from potential terrestrial and space-based threats. In addition, their diminutive size could make them hard to track, especially if they hid next to their target, lying in wait, or blended in with the extensive amount of “ space junk ” floating about the Earth’s atmosphere. The ability for even smaller satellites to act as motherships for even tinier systems, as was apparently the case with Kosmos-2519, -2521, and -2523, could make it even harder to judge exactly what “inspector” capabilities an opponent may actually have in orbit. Inspector satellites have also generally been small enough for the Russians to include unannounced in other launches in the past. The Kremlin has categorically denied that any of these satellites, which it calls “space apparatus inspectors,” are weapons. Most recently, the Russians denounced concerns that Yleem Poblete, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, raised in August 2018 about the purpose of Kosmos-2519 and its associated sub-satellites as “unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions.” The Russian government, however, has not provided any hard evidence to support their insistence that the satellites are entirely non-threatening. But it is also clear that the Russians have an active and multi-faceted anti-satellite weapons program. In September 2018, The War Zone was first to report on the emergence of a new, air-launched anti-satellite interceptor and a specially modified MiG-31 Foxhound fighter jet to carry it. Russia also has ground-based interceptors that could engage satellites and claims to be working on airborne laser systems that may be able to blind or damage the optics on spy and early-warning satellites. A MiG-31, in the foreground, carries what appears to be an air-launched anti-satellite interceptor during a test flight in September 2018., ShipSash This makes perfect sense for the Kremlin. As such, the Russian military and intelligence agencies, which have far fewer satellites in orbit than the United States, have strong incentives to develop various means to curtail the significant American advantages in space-based early warning , intelligence gathering , navigation and weapons guidance , and communications during any potential future conflict. China, for similar reasons, has also been pursuing a robust anti-satellite capability . The United States has woken up to its reliance on space-based capabilities and the growing threats to the support infrastructure, including satellites, which we have explored in detail in the past . Unfortunately, at least at present, addressing these issues has found itself wrapped up in defense budgeting and domestic politics , distracting from the real issues at hand. On top of that, space-based weapons present unique challenges for the international community, especially since neither the United States nor Russia has so far been able to articulate the exact threshold for what would constitute a conflict in space . The U.S. government also opposed treaties that have been proposed so far to limit space-based weapons, arguing that the language is vague and unenforceable and the terms are unverifiable. Dual-use systems that have legitimate non-weapon functionality, such as inspector satellites, don’t help efforts to try and firmly establish these definitions. In the meantime, Russia doesn’t appear to be slowing down the development and expansion of its anti-satellite capabilities. As part of that push, it may very well have just added to its constellation of possible “killer satellites.” Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Orbital Systems Russian Space Program Space Spy Satellites War In Space"

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 17, 2019",Air Force Rescue Helicopters Raced To The Aid Of Special Operators In Somalia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Much about the exact circumstances surrounding a recent attack on U.S. special operations forces and partner troops in Somalia , which left one American dead and four more wounded, remains unclear. However, we do know that, unlike in the aftermath of the now infamous ambush in Niger in 2017, U.S. Air Force rescue helicopters were able to race to the scene and, together with other fixed-wing aircraft, potentially prevented the incident from resulting in more American deaths. On June 8, 2018, members of the terrorist group Al Shabaab , Al Qaeda’s franchise in Somalia, attacked a battalion-sized force of approximately 800 U.S., Kenyan, and Somali troops in the semi-autonomous Jubaland region near the border with Kenya, according to U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM). The firefight involved enemy forces armed with mortars and heavy machine guns. We don’t know if all 800 individuals were at the site of the attack, where the U.S. military was assisting the Kenyan peacekeepers, who are in the country as part of the African Union-led mission , and Somalia forces build a new forward operating base. Once the construction is complete, Somali forces will man the outpost as part of a broader campaign to secure the area from Al Shabaab, according to CNN . U.S. Army Sergeant Alexander Conrad, a member of the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), died after being hit by a mortar round during the attack. The U.S. military has not released the names of the four other casualties or details about the extent of their injuries. He was the first American to die in combat in Africa since the skirmish in Niger in October 2017, in which Islamic State in the Greater Sahara terrorists killed four Army soldiers. These were also the first U.S. military casualties in Somalia since a U.S. Navy SEAL died during a controversial raid in May 2017. The video below, which appeared on YouTube on June 9, 2018, shows HH-60G Pave Hawks flying in the background as Somali forces engage Al Shabaab terrorists. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oBeN_JI025Y In the 2017 Niger incident, American personnel and their partners had to wait hours for reinforcements to arrive in the form of French and later Nigerien forces. Contractors working for the U.S. military provided the only other potential means of evacuating the casualties in that instance. In the June 2018 incident in Jubaland, Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawks were able to fly from an unspecified “U.S. military installation” to the scene of the battle, a spokesperson for AFRICOM told The War Zone in an Email. Those helicopters helped three of the four wounded personnel, as well Sergeant Conrad, evacuate the area. A map showing various US military operating locations in East Africa.

The HH-60s were pre-positioned in the port town of Kismayo, the main commercial hub in the semi-autonomous Jubaland region during the operation, and were able to be on scene within 20 minutes, according to a separate report by The New York Times . Information in official contracting documents shows U.S. forces operate a forward operating base at the airport in the coastal city. A fuel delivery schedule from a Defense Logistics Agency contracting notice regarding potential fuel deliveries to “American Camp in Kismayo.” The Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), W91C8Y, points to the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), which manages U.S. military activities in Somalia from Camp Lemonnier in Neighboring Djibouti., DLA There were unconfirmed reports that the U.S. military had been moving Pave Hawks in and out of Somalia to support specific missions as early as June 2017. At that time, AFRICOM told us in an Email that there were no helicopters permanently forward deployed in the country, but this would not preclude short-term operational movements. The Times ’ report also said that for large, multi-day operations in Somalia, such as the one in Jubaland, armed air support is often on standby. We don’t know if this means manned or unmanned aircraft or if the U.S. military employed either type of aircraft in this case. Unfortunately, Sergeant Conrad died after the initial evacuation, though medical personnel were able to stabilize the other three personnel. The Pave Hawks also returned to the battlefield to recover another wounded individual and moved them to Kismayo. An unconfirmed photo reportedly showing HH-60Gs in Mogadishu circa June 2017. The individual who posted this image on Twitter no longer has an account and the original source is unclear., via @airops007 A C-130J Hercules airlifter from the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, also situated in Djibouti, then moved the first three wounded personnel and the sergeant’s remains from Kismayo to the Kenyan capital Nairobi. Air Force airlift and medical personnel regularly train to turn these aircraft into flying ambulances . Sending the individuals to Kenya rather than Djibouti makes perfect sense given the distances involved. From Kismayo Airport, the C-130J had to fly approximately 400 miles west to Nairobi, while Camp Lemonnier sits more than 800 miles to the north. The inside of a C-130J configured for aeromedical evacuations, complete with dummy patient, during a training exercise., USAF On the continent of Africa, where the base in Djibouti is the only official U.S. military outpost, this “ tyranny of distance ” can be especially problematic when it comes to getting aid to wounded personnel or trying to get them into a hospital quickly. In this case, the U.S. casualties appear to have been able to get to the next level of care within or close to within the so-called “ golden hour ,” which refers to a 60-minute window where medical professionals have a better chance of saving a person’s life or preventing serious complications. Once in Kenya, the medical team from the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi took charge of the wounded servicemembers and had them transferred to a civilian hospital. By June 10, 2018, however, an Air Force KC-135R tanker from an unknown unit had taken those individuals from the Kenyan capital to another, undisclosed location for “additional medical evaluation,” according to AFRICOM. It is very likely that the aircraft took these individuals to either Camp Lemonnier, which has a more robust military medical facility, or to the U.S. Army’s Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, which serves as a major hub for the treatment of seriously injured servicemen and women. A C-130J from the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron somewhere in East Africa., USAF This chain of events is a good example of how the casualty and medical evacuation processes are supposed to work under optimal conditions. It also highlights the not insignificant resources that have to be in place and on call for it to work as intended. On top of that, the mechanisms on display may not necessarily translate to a high-end conflict . Note that the HH-60s, C-130J, and KC-135R were all able to fly their respective missions entirely unmolested by enemy forces on the ground. These aircraft simply would not be able to operate deep inside a high-risk environment full of integrated air defenses. A C-130-type aircraft, at left, shares space on the ramp at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti with three KC-135R tankers in 2016., Google Earth But for limited conflicts, such as the one in Somalia, the arrangement is at least adequate and in this case may have prevented additional American deaths. And it’s an unfortunate, but distinct possibility that the Pave Hawks may be seeing more missions like it in the near future, as well. The growing scale and scope of the U.S. mission in Somalia, nicknamed Operation Octave Shield , could also increase the strain on the relatively limited Djibouti-based rescue personnel and other forces supporting their mission. Those forces already have to support operations across East Africa and out into the Gulf of Aden to the north. They also rely heavily on the aging HH-60Gs, which are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain and have suffered significantly declining availability as a fleet across the Air Force. The existing operational demands on these aircraft have pushed the U.S. military to increasingly turn to contractors for both airlift and casualty evacuation services in many countries, including Niger , the Philippines , and potentially Yemen . Airmen unload an HH-60G at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti in 2013., USAF These issues remain a factor in Somalia even over a year after President Donald Trump granted AFRICOM new authorities to combat Al Shabaab and allowed the Pentagon to designate much of the southern portion of the country an active conflict zone, giving it further flexibility in its operations there. The new base in Jubaland is just the latest indication of the expanding U.S. campaign , the goal of which is ostensibly to support African Union and local forces battle the Al Qaeda-linked terrorists. At a press conference on June 11, 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis implied that elements of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), tasked with hunting down senior members of Al Shabaab, were no longer physically in the country on a semi-permanent basis. It is possible that JSOC has relocated the bulk of its forces out of the country – possibly to the special operations mothership M/V Ocean Trader or another vessel offshore – in part to reduce the logistical strains of having to defend and maintain sites ashore. But there are approximately 500 U.S. military personnel in the country now, officially. In addition to the camp in Kismayo, there are at least two other major U.S. operating locations in Somalia, one in the capital Mogadishu and another just north of that site at a Somali air base in the town of Baledogle . We don’t know how many American troops are scattered elsewhere in the country, either permanently or temporarily. And there is an increasingly active combat component to the mission, too, as seen most visible in the dramatic surge in drone strikes against Al Shabaab starting after Trump took office in 2017. However, as has become steadily clearer for months already, the expanded advisory mission has also increasingly put Americans closer to the active fighting . For its part, the terrorist group has also been trying to put increased pressure on the United States and its partners, especially as the African Union continues to look for ways to extricate itself from the grueling conflict in the near future. There’s no end in sight for the U.S. mission in the country and if it continues to become a more proactive operation, American personnel will need to have these kinds of casualty evacuation assets and other medical support at the ready for the foreseeable future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Trump Is Alarmed By His Own Defense Spending And He Should Be,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Donald Trump is truly the Tweeter in Chief, having adopted Twitter as his communications platform of choice, for better or worse. Since becoming the 45th President of The United States, Trump has sent out plenty of puzzling and contradicting messages on the popular social media platform, but one sent today is especially peculiar. In it, he talks of needing to stave off an arms race he previously seemed to welcome and lamented defense spending, which his administration spurred and that he has touted in the past as one of his greatest achievements. The tweets read: “I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!” It seems very strange that he is calling his own self-touted achievement and a policy his administration presided over “crazy.” Trump has repeatedly claimed that he “ rebuilt the military ” after a couple years of increased budgets. Although there has been increased defense spending across the board, Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ prioritization of funds into readiness and sustainment have helped the military recover from years of sequestration, not just a larger total defense spending figure alone. The problem is that a quick spurt of research and development and procurement dollars will actually end up hurting the military in many ways compared to a far more constrained, but reformed defense spending agenda. With Trump already talking about possible cuts to defense spending before this tweet, the reality of having throngs of immature programs being jettisoned after ghastly wasteful spending is very real. This is exactly what I have been predicting for some time, that these current budget levels are wholly unsustainable and a snapback in spending will come far sooner than later, leaving the military with huge amounts of zombie programs, half-developed weapons, and new weapons that will be mothballed as soon or even before they formally enter service. The push for new nuclear weapons and delivery system concepts is by far the most vexing and frustrating. Instead of rationalizing America’s aging and bloated nuclear weapons ecosystem, the Nuclear Posture Review , and the Trump administration’s policy that went along with it, demanded not only to upgrade the entire existing arsenal , but also expand it in significant ways . In addition, there is the administration’s hard push for an independent Space Force, which is already mired in service-level infighting and will cost billions to establish and sustain. How will all this, and so many other new conventional weapons programs and defense initiatives, survive falling budget levels? There is no doubt that the sprawling Department of Defense is an incredibly wasteful institution. Inroads into even understanding what that waste looks like quantitatively are just now being made, most notably in the form of the department’s first ever and very much failed audit . Regardless of just how much money is unaccounted for or wastefully spent, deep systemic reform will be needed to really realize any meaningful savings. The big question is with all the special interests in play and with the better part of a century of shoveling money into countless black holes as fast as it can, is there really the will, both political and otherwise, to reform the Pentagon’s deeply ingrained and often downright reckless spending habits? Maybe the most alarming part of all this is that whenever I mention the coming fiscal pull-back to defense contractors they sound totally in denial of such a glaring possibility. They seem to expect that the current gravy train will chug along through the coming decade, spurred by threats from China and Russia. That is very unlikely as the skyrocketing debt is an issue that will increasingly hamper discretionary spending — in particular, defense spending —not to mention the national debt becoming a more perilous political liability. A major downturn in the economy will only further accelerate this looming fiscal reckoning. To give you an idea of just how dire the problem is, well within the next decade , interest payments on the debt alone will eclipse the entire defense budget in terms of annual cost. With all this in mind, I would posit that the skyrocketing national debt is a bigger threat to national security than any external state or non-state actor. USMC It appears as if Trump recently learned just how much the Federal Government was spending and on what in comparison to what it was taking in. This revelation seems to have occurred last October when a U.S. Treasury report stated that the budget deficit had grown 17 percent over just the last year to $779B and it will reach $1T per year by 2020. That is with a booming economy, if it were to hit the skids, that number would likely balloon. The cause of the year-to-year debt hike is primarily the Trump tax cuts and increases in defense spending . Following the report, Trump announced that he wants every agency to make a five percent budget cut , although he may exempt some government organizations, like the DoD, from as steep a budgetary decline. But even if he can pull off such reduction, it would amount to $68B in savings, which is far smaller than the projected deficit increases. It’s good that Trump wants to work at trilateral arms reduction agreements, but in the past, he has openly invited arms races, making this statement a bit confusing. Better late than never, though. Hopefully, he follows through with doing everything possible to craft such accords, by all indications doing so won’t be easy. One glaring roadblock is that Russia doesn’t seem interested in abiding by existing deals , so the idea that they would adhere to new ones is debatable. Also, between very chilly relations with China as the result of an ongoing trade war and with Russia basically entering into a new Cold War with the West, just getting to the table to negotiate will be a major undertaking. Beyond the traditional arms control agreements of the past that focused on established weaponry and domains of warfighting, areas that really need some sort of arms agreement between China, Russia, and the U.S. are in regards to space-based , cyber , and hypersonic weaponry and the combat doctrine associated with them. These areas are quickly becoming a Wild West of sorts where previous international agreement don’t address emerging capabilities that have the potential to destabilize established strategic norms and even wreak havoc on critical civilian infrastructure. The bottom line here is that it’s good news that Trump is coming to understand that arms reduction deals not only help limit strategic risk and lower tensions among peer state competitors, but they can also have an incredibly welcome fiscal impact on the budget. At the same time, it is outright concerning that the President of the United States seems not to have had any concept of the negative fiscal impacts his own policies would have. Now that’s crazy.
