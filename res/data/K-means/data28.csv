The War Zone staff,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",The Navy Has Finally Proven It Can Shoot Down An Intercontinental Ballistic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a milestone achievement for ballistic missile defense, an SM-3 Block IIA missile has successfully destroyed a threat-representative intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) target. The test, run by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy, is said to have “met its primary objective” — proving that an SM-3 Block IIA can engage an ICBM threat. You can read all about this missile’s capabilities in this past War Zone piece . The test, officially referred to as the Flight Test Aegis Weapon System-44, or FTM-44, and codenamed Stellar Lancer, had originally been planned for May 2020, but was delayed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it kicked off at around 12:50, Eastern Standard Time, on November 17, 2020, when the ICBM-representative target was launched from the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll. The remote test site is located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands deep in the central Pacific Ocean. The target missile, which was previously reported as being a three-stage Northrop Grumman ICBM-T2 , then climbed toward the “broad ocean area northeast of Hawaii,” according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The scenario envisaged that the ICBM was headed toward a target on Hawaii, which was defended by a U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer, the USS John Finn (DDG-113), at sea in the Pacific. The ship is equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system and has so-called “engage-on-remote” capabilities through the Command and Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC) network, in which the warship receives targeting data from other sensors. The destroyer received tracking data via the C2BMC system, producing a fire-control solution, before launching and guiding an SM-3 Block IIA missile toward the incoming threat. The SM-3 Block IIA then destroyed the target with its kinetic “kill vehicle,” which uses sheer force, rather than a conventional explosive warhead, slamming into the target as it travels outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The kill vehicle is larger and more maneuverable than the one found on the previous Block IB ballistic missile interceptor. The Block IIA also features a larger rocket motor to ensure increased range and altitude, and a higher terminal velocity. This interceptor was originally designed to defeat intermediate and medium-range ballistic missile threats, bridging a gap between terminal phase intercept systems, such as Patriot and THAAD , and to some degree the SM-6 , and the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system. However, the expansion of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor’s capabilities to allow it to engage intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, has long been an ambition of the Pentagon. For this to be achieved, it requires the missile — and its supporting Aegis BMD and C2BMC architecture — to be able to conduct mid-course intercepts —while the target is flying outside of the atmosphere, before it dives on its target—against higher and faster-flying targets. The SM-3 Block IIA interceptor has larger rocket motors than previous versions., RAYTHEON “This first-of-its-kind test shows that our nation has a viable option for a new layer of defense against long-range threats,” said Bryan Rosselli, vice president of Strategic Missile Defense at Raytheon Missiles & Defense, the company responsible for developing the SM-3 Block IIA in collaboration with Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. As a major partner in the program, Japan also plans to equip its own warships with the weapon but has shelved a proposal to establish land-based Aegis Ashore facilities within its territory. U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill, the Director of MDA, also said the following in a statement: “This was an incredible accomplishment and critical milestone for the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA program. The Department is investigating the possibility of augmenting the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system by fielding additional sensors and weapon systems to hedge against unexpected developments in the missile threat. We have demonstrated that an Aegis BMD-equipped vessel equipped with the SM-3 Block IIA missile can defeat an ICBM-class target, which is a step in the process of determining its feasibility as part of an architecture for layered defense of the homeland. My congratulations to the entire test team, including our military and industry partners, who helped us to achieve this milestone.” While judged successful in terms of meeting its main objective, program officials will now assess the telemetry and other data gathered during the FTM-44 test to evaluate the overall performance of the Aegis BMD system and other assets involved in the test. FTM-44 was the sixth flight test of an Aegis BMD-equipped vessel using the SM-3 Block IIA missile. Not all of these have been successful, as The War Zone has reported in the past , even if at least one of the failures was ultimately attributed to a simple human operator error . The latest test was mandated by the U.S. Congress to evaluate the feasibility of the SM-3 Block IIA missile’s capability to defeat an ICBM threat before the end of 2020. The idea was to prove that a suitably equipped warship could serve as a back-up to ground-based homeland defense systems if needed. If all goes according to plan, Aegis radar-equipped warships such as the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and land-based configurations, known as Aegis Ashore , will ultimately be capable of employing these interceptors. Under Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, the SM-3 Block IIA will be deployed in the ground-based role in Poland and Romania. Eventually, the SM-3 Block IIA could help partially satisfy the demand for enhanced ballistic missile defenses in the Pacific theatre, where the United States is confronted by North Korea’s rapidly evolving missile capabilities . This will be especially significant if the SM-3 Block IIA demonstrates a reliable ability to engage ICBM-like targets. Being based on warships, it would offer a considerable amount of flexibility, especially compared to the fixed GMD missile fields . RAYTHEON The U.S. has previously argued that its entire BMD enterprise, including the SM-3 Block IIA, is not intended to limit the credibility of Russia’s or China’s nuclear deterrents and the fact remains it wouldn’t be able to defeat any kind of large-scale nuclear attack from either of those countries. In fact, we really don’t know how big the envelope of the SM-3 Block IIA actually is, and thus where a ship would have to be positioned in order to defend a certain potential target area. Still, even the ability to successfully nullify a limited strike by less capable foes is very questionable at best. On the other hand, it’s not hard to imagine that Moscow or Beijing might view this latest development in a different light and perhaps use it to legitimize new investments in their deterrent forces. Russia is already working to improve its anti-missile defense capabilities to defeat just the kind of problem that the SM-3 Block IIA could pose. As long ago as 2016, a Russian television documentary on the RS-24 Yars ICBM claimed that its warheads had advanced maneuvering capability to defeat these kinds of interceptors. China’s ballistic missiles, meanwhile, present an ever more potent threat, reportedly now including the potential to strike larger-sized warships underway in the Pacific with its “carrier killer” missiles . The FTM-44 has shown that defense against ICBMs using Aegis BMD-equipped warships is technologically feasible. The U.S. Navy now has to work out how it could employ this defensive capability as part of the wider missile defense system. At the same time, the United States may have to negotiate a potentially hostile reception from China and Russia in regards to this latest breakthrough.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed off on a plan to establish a Russian naval logistics and support base in the East African country of Sudan. This will be the country’s first official military base on the continent since the fall of the Soviet Union and only its second formal naval facility abroad, the other being Tartus in Syria . The Sudanese base will offer a valuable additional location for Russian Navy warships to stop and resupply, as well as perform maintenance. Putin’s order, which was posted on Russia’s Official Internet Portal of Legal Information, is dated Nov. 16, 2020. Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin had approved a draft agreement regarding the base on Nov. 6. The base facilities will reportedly be constructed near the Sudanese Navy’s main base at Flamingo Bay, which is situated just north of Port Sudan, the country’s main port city on the Red Sea. A map showing the general location of Port Sudan on the Red Sea, a very plausible location for the future Russian naval base in Sudan., Google Maps A satellite image showing the very spartan facilities at Flamingo Bay, just north of Port Sudan, where the Sudanese Navy has an existing base., Google Earth The draft deal that Mishustin signed off on did say that what Russia is officially calling a logistics center will have 300 personnel assigned to it and will have berthing space for up four warships at a time. It’s not clear from the reports what kinds of vessels the base will be able to accommodate, but it will be able to host “naval ships with a nuclear propulsion system on condition of observing nuclear and environmental safety norms.” There are also reports that Russian air defense and electronic warfare systems may be deployed to protect the site. Sudan to host Russian naval logistical supply point. Staff of ~ 300, able to dock 4 Russian ships. Not a base – doesn't have permanently assigned ships but will serve as a logistical hub for Rus ships operating in the Red Sea. #Russia #RussianNavy https://t.co/NuJxY3bhUv pic.twitter.com/9ZfhDCENUB — Jeffrey Edmonds (@jeffaedmonds) November 13, 2020 “The Sudanese side has the right to use the mooring area upon agreement with the authorized body of the Russian side,” the draft document says, as well. This could indicate that the deal is also intended, at least in part, to help Sudan modernize its own naval facilities at Flamingo Bay. The planned base also sounds very similar in form and function to the Russian Navy’s base in Tartus, Syria , especially as it existed prior to Russia’s intervention in that country in 2015. That facility was also relatively small and intended to provide a place for Russian warships to stop and replenish and make certain repairs. In the past five years, however, it has seen significant expansion as the Kremlin’s involvement in Syria has grown. A satellite image of the port at Tartus, Syria, where Russia has its only overseas naval base at present., Google Earth In 2017, Putin signed a deal to extend the Russian government lease on Tartus for another 49 years , with provisions for additional 25-year-long extensions after that. Russia reportedly now spends around $41.5 million annually to maintain that base. The lease of the Sudanese base will last 25 years and there is an option to extend it for another 10 years after that. Russia says that the future base in Sudan will “meets the goals of maintaining peace and stability in the region, is defensive and is not aimed against other countries.” Whether or not this is true, it certainly provides another valuable naval stopover for Russian forces in the region and one that is notably on the other side of the Suez Canal, offering a new potential naval stronghold south of that potential choke point. This would offer an opportunity for Russian warships sailing in and out of the Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to stop and supply without them first having to try to reach Tartus by sailing all the way through the Red Sea, through the Suez Canal , and into the Eastern Mediterranean. If the base is truly capable of supporting nuclear-powered vessels, it could become a very important operating location for the Russian Navy’s nuclear submarines, potentially helping to increase the total number of patrols those boats can conduct in the region and the distance they can cover. Russia reportedly pursued the deal with Sudan after failing to secure a deal with Djibouti on the Horn of Africa further to the South. The United States and China , among a number of others, have established bases in that country with a similar eye toward supporting naval operations in that general region and out into the Indian Ocean and beyond. Most of Russia’s naval bases are in the country’s far north and far east regions and are often beset by ice and poor weather in the winter months. At the same time, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country has found itself with more limited access to naval facilities abroad. The Soviet Union, for instance, had previously maintained a similar base in Somalia that has now long been shuttered. Tartus in Syria already offered an important warm-water naval port facility for the country’s warships to use outside of Russia. Unlike the country’s naval facilities in the Black Sea, it was also unbound by the provisions of the Montreux Convention , which puts significant limits on the movement of warships and submarines in and out of that body of water. Of course, it is worth noting that the Kremlin has played fast and loose on occasion with those provisions in recent years. While a naval base in Sudan would certainly be very valuable to Russia, and could have benefits for the Sudanese Navy, as well. It could also present new challenges to both countries. Sudan is still very much in the midst of a transition to more stable civilian leadership following the ouster of long-time dictator Omar Al Bashir in 2019. Two years earlier, the Kremlin had signed a number of military assistance deals with the Al Bashir’s regime and the dictator reportedly expressed interest at that time in hosting a Russian naval base, in part as a deterrent to the United States. A major bilateral cooperation arrangement between the two countries came into force just months before the Sudanese leader was deposed. There were reports of shadowy private military contractors with strong, if not direct ties to Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, better known as the GRU, being involved in some way in the violent crackdowns on popular protests in the lead up to Al Bashir’s final removal from office in a coup. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5lUcj2VMzB0 The United States has been actively courting the new Sudanese coalition government and President Donald Trump’s Administration removed the country from the U.S. list of designated state sponsors of terrorism in October. This followed an agreement with Sudanese officials to make payments, totaling $335 million, to the victims of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which were carried out by Al Qaeda terrorists based in Sudan. The Trump Administration appears to have hoped that it could further parlay that deal into Sudan agreeing to normalize its relations with Israel, as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have recently done as a result of U.S.-brokered agreements. The current Sudanese government has, so far, not implemented such a plan and a number of political parties that form the current coalition backing the transitional government, which includes some that had previously had close ties to the Al Bashir regime, have more forcefully pushed back on the idea, underscoring the fragility of the political situation in the country. “Normalization [with Israel] opens risks to our fragile transitional situation,” Sadiq Al Mahdi, the head of the National Umma Party and a former Prime Minister of Sudan, said, according to The Wall Street Journal . “This decision violates Sudan’s constitution and can easily result in the collapse of this government.” The Financial Times newspaper in the United Kingdom reported that Sudan’s deal with Russia “could be seen as a blow to Washington” and that “U.S. officials dismissed the news of the Russian base in Sudan as not real.” For their part, Sudanese officials have apparently declined to confirm or deny the Russian base deal, despite the Kremlin first publishing the draft agreement and now Putin’s order regarding the plan publicly online. It remains to be seen how long it will take Russia to establish its base in Sudan and when the Russian Navy may start making use of it. Regardless, though the planned base in Sudan right now is small, it stands to become an important facility the Kremlin can use to help project both military power and geopolitical influence far from its shores.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 29, 2021",Chinese Long-Range Ballistic Missiles Struck Moving Ship In South China Sea: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At least some of the ballistic missiles that China’s People’s Liberation Army fired into the South China Sea during an exercise earlier this year, which you can read about more in the War Zone ‘s initial story on those drills, reportedly hit a moving target ship. If true, this would be the country’s first known demonstration of an actual long-range anti-ship ballistic missile capability , which could significantly change the operational calculus for any potential opponent, including the United States, in the disputed maritime region and elsewhere in the Pacific. The South China Morning Post reported last week that Wang Xiangsui, a retired People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officer, had said that one DF-26B intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and one DF-21D medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) had struck the target vessel as it sailed near the Paracel Island chain during the August exercise. Wang, who has been described as “ well-connected ” in the past, is best known as one of the co-authors of the 1999 book Unrestricted Warfare , which covered various asymmetric means to undermine and defeat countries that were technologically superior to China. It has become a highly influential text , and general concept , in national security circles. “We launched the DF-21 and DF-26, and the missiles hit a vessel sailing south of the Paracel Islands,” Wang said during a closed-door gathering in China’s eastern Zhejiang province in October, according to the South China Morning Post . “Shortly after that, an American military attaché in Geneva, [Switzerland] complained and said it would lead to severe consequences if the missiles hit an American aircraft carrier. They see this as a show of force. But we are doing this because of their provocation.” Wang does not appear to have given any details about the target ship, its construction, how fast it might have been moving, or how the PLA may have cued the missiles their target. It remains unclear exactly how many missiles the PLA fired during the exercise on Aug. 26. South China Morning Post ‘s initial report had indicated that two weapons had been launched, one DF-26B and one DF-21D, from sites in China’s northwestern Qinghai province and in Zhejiang, respectively. A subsequent report from Reuters said that the U.S. government had assessed that the Chinese had fired four ballistic missiles, in total. “The Department of Defense is concerned about the People’s Republic of China (PRC) recent decision to conduct military exercises, including the firing of ballistic missiles, around the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea on August 23-29,” the Pentagon said in a statement on Aug. 27. “The PRC’s actions, including missile tests, further destabilize the situation in the South China Sea.” The statement did not say anything about how many missiles the Chinese had fired in total or what types they had employed in the drill. The DF-26B and the DF-21D are both understood to have maneuvering reentry vehicles capable at least of hitting large ships, such as aircraft carriers or large amphibious assault ships. The DF-21D has a maximum range in excess of 932 miles (1,500 kilometers), according to the Pentagon , while DF-26-series missiles can reportedly strike targets out to 2,500 miles . Chinese media outlets, including the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post , refer to the DF-21D, specifically, as a “ carrier killer .” The longer-range DF-26 is nicknamed the “ Guam Express or Guam Killer ,” a reference to the strategic U.S. island territory in the western Pacific, which is home to major air and naval bases , but the B model with its maneuverable warhead also often gets referred to as a carrier killer missile, as well. Guam would be an important target for Chinese forces during any large-scale conflict. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hqU76dINtqQ A map showing the approximate ranges of various Chinese conventional strike weapons including the DF-21D, here referred as the “CSS-5 ASBM,” and the DF-26., DOD It’s worth noting the PLA has been launching ballistic missiles at generally ship-sized and shaped fixed targets in the Gobi Desert since at least 2013 . However, this did not necessarily reflect an ability to hit moving targets at sea. In fact, some of these flat silhouettes were part of larger target arrays that were clearly arranged to reflect ships in port at American bases in Japan or Taiwanese naval facilities . The Chinese had also fired DF-26s from the western portion of the country into the South China Sea in a similar exercise in January 2019. An aircraft carrier-sized static target in the Gobi desert with multiple craters from large missiles hitting it., Google Earth via the Federation of American Scientists Flat ship silhouette targets arrayed as part of a mock port facility in the Gobi., Google Earth via the Federation of American Scientists It’s still not entirely clear how Chinese forces may now be spotting and tracking targets at sea and cueing ballistic missiles, such as the DF-21D or DF-26B, to engage them. However, “the PLAN’s [People’s Liberation Army Navy’s] expanding network of sky wave and surface wave over-the-horizon (OTH) systems provide warning and targeting capabilities at extended distances from China to support long-range precision strikes, including employment of ASBMs [anti-ship ballistic missiles],” the Pentagon noted in its most recent annual report to Congress on the Chinese military. That same document indicated that the DF-26 series was becoming one of China’s preeminent ballistic missiles, with a reported dramatic increase in the number of those weapons in service in the past year. Other ships, such as China’s new and very capable Type 055 destroyers , as well as long-range maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft , could help find enemy fleets and relay that targeting information to missile units. China also has a steady expanding fleet of unmanned aircraft, including increasingly advanced high-altitude, long-endurance types , which could also be used in this role. In the South China Sea, the PLA may further be able to make use of any fixed long-range sensors on its man-made island outposts , which includes aerostats . The Chinese government has also been expanded its space-based sensor capabilities in recent years. The maneuvering reentry vehicles themselves likely have some form of guidance, such as a radar or imaging infrared seeker, to zero in on their targets in the terminal phase of flight, as well. The CM-401 , a short-range anti-ship ballistic missile that China is developing, notably features a radar seeker for terminal guidance, though it’s not clear if that its only guidance option. A mockup of a CM-401 with the nose cutaway to show a dish representing a radar seeker., Chinese Internet Regardless, if the PLA can now reliably engage large warships using long-range ballistic missiles, this would represent a major additional anti-access/area denial capability, in general, but especially in the South China Sea. As noted, the DF-26B was reportedly fired from Qinghai, well inside China proper, which provides an extra layer of protection to the launching unit from preemptive or counter-strikes. Even being able to launch DF-21D missiles at ships from bases in eastern China would offer those units added survivability. This is all on top of the immense flexibility that ground-based ballistic missiles could offer in the anti-ship role simply by being able to engage targets across a very broad area without necessarily having to relocate first. At the same time, the DF-21D and DF-26 are both road-mobile and could be repositioned to be closer to the target area in order to shorten the time it might take for the weapon to get there, an important consideration for engaging even slow-moving ships, as well as any other time-sensitive and fleeting targets. All of this also means that this capability would not necessarily be limited to use during any potential conflict in the South China Sea. DF-26s in Qinghai would be just as capable of hitting ships in the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea , and the Philippine Sea , during a major confrontation in the Western Pacific, further impacting the ability of opponents, such as the United States, to operate in those bodies of water, all of which equally strategic. These missiles could possibly engage vessels in the Indian Ocean , which could be a factor in a large-scale conflict with India, as well. This revelation about the ballistic missiles reportedly having hit an actual moving target during the August drills comes amid a continued uptick in naval movements , as well as aerial military activity , on the part of the United States and its allies, as well China , in the broad Indo-Pacific region. Just weeks before the PLA fired the missiles near the Paracels, the U.S. Navy had sent two aircraft carriers , along with various escorting ships, into the South China Sea for the first time in years. Those flattops conducted various training maneuvers, including one involving an Air Force B-52 bomber , while they were there. The first-in-class USS Nimitz and her sister ship the USS Ronald Reagan sail in the South China Sea along with various escorting ships as elements of their carrier air wings fly overhead in July., USN Right now, the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, a grouping known as “The Quad,” are notably in the middle of the latest iteration of the Malabar naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal. Australia is taking part in these drills for the first time in 13 years, underscoring an increased emphasis on regional cooperation in light of China’s increasingly assertive actions with regards to various territorial claims , especially in the South China Sea . Ships taking part in the Malabar 2020 exercise sail in the Bay of Bengal., USN Just this weekend, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar “expressed concern about actions and incidents that erode trust in the region” at the 15th East Asia Summit, referring specifically to Chinese activities in the South China Sea, according to a statement from the country’s Foreign Ministry. Tensions between Chinese and Taiwanese governments are also at a notable high point, and both parties have been conducting their own dueling military exercises , as well. Increasingly visible support for authorities in Taipei from their counterparts in Washington has added to the friction. On top of all this, the United States and China themselves have been increasingly sparring for months over a host of issues, ranging from Beijing’s fiery rhetoric toward Taiwan and its ongoing anti-democratic crackdown in Hong Kong to trade disputes and the handling of the global COVID-19 pandemic . Anti-ship ballistic missiles represent just one way that China has been looking to add risk to the U.S. military’s operations in the Western Pacific and hamper it from challenging Chinese claims, in the South China Sea and elsewhere. While the PLA’s ability to engage moving ships with these weapons remains unconfirmed, there is mounting evidence that they are moving closer to being able to reliably employ this capability, if they can’t already do so.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 20, 2018",Canada’s New Frigate Will Be Brimming With Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Canadian Navy’s future Canadian Surface Combatants , frigates derived from BAE System’s Type 26 design for the U.K. Royal Navy, are set to have an impressive and particularly diverse missile armament for warships of their size. This includes Sea Ceptor , RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile , and Standard Missile 2 surface-to-air missiles for close-in, point, and area air and cruise missile defense respectively, as well as Naval Strike Missiles for engaging surface targets. Most notably, an official Canadian infographic says the ships will carry variants of the Tomahawk cruise missile , a weapon that the United States has only ever exported to the United Kingdom. Naval News was first to report on the new details about the Canadian Surface Combatant’s (CSC) armament on Nov. 9, 2020, after noticing the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) infographic. The Canadian government had first announced that the Type 26-based design, pitched by a team led by BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin, was its “preferred” bid for the CSC competition in 2018. The Canadian government intends to buy 15 CSCs to replace its existing 12 Halifax class frigates , the first of which began entering service in the early 1990s. This Royal Canadian Navy’s Canadian Surface Combatant infographic discusses the ship’s planned armament and other features., Royal Canadian Navy BAE Systems had already begun the construction of the first of eight Type 26s, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece , in 2017, so there had been some idea of what kind of capabilities the Canadian ships might have. The Royal Navy’s Type 26s are set to have a 24-cell Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) array, as well as 48 more VLS cells for the Sea Ceptor missile, also known as the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM), along with a five-inch main gun and torpedoes. However, it had previously been unclear what the exact armament for the Canadian derivatives would be. We now know that the RCN ships will also have a five-inch gun and torpedo tubes. When it comes to missiles, though, the CSCs will have a 32-cell Mk 41 array, eight more than the Type 26s, which can accommodate various weapons. Most interestingly, the infographic mentions the inclusion of the Tomahawk cruise missile in the ship’s arsenal for “naval fires support.” Last year, Lockheed Martin representatives confirmed to Naval News that the Mk 41 cells on these ships will be “strike-length,” meaning that it is the larger version of this VLS that can accommodate Tomahawks and other longer missiles. The video below shows the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Gridley firing a Tomahawk from one of its strike-length Mk 41 cells in 2015. Naval News said it had been unable to confirm, so far, what the RCN’s plans are exactly with regards to integrating Tomahawks onto the CSCs. It’s important to note that Canada does not have any other ships armed with Tomahawks and that the United States, to date, has only ever exported these weapons to the United Kingdom. It has long been posited that the Type 26’s Mk 41 array would also have strike-length cells and be able to be armed with the Tomahawk. It is possible that Canada could be eying newer anti-ship focused variants of the Tomahawk , such as the Block V Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST). However, the infographic states that the CSC would carry these missiles for naval fire support, a term that typically refers to strikes against targets on land, which strongly indicates that, if this is indeed the RCN’s plan, it is looking to acquire an entirely new maritime capability. For Canada, having ships capable of very long-range stand-off strikes against targets on land could give it a completely new role in future operations, especially together with allies and partners, such as other members of NATO. Within that alliance, only a very few countries beyond the United States, most notably the United Kingdom and France , have this kind of capability. Other nations in that bloc do have land-attack cruise missiles, but generally not with anywhere near the range of a missile like the Tomahawk. CSCs armed with Tomahawks could certainly give the Canadians a new organic ability to project naval power, in general, as well. This could offer something of an anti-access/area-denial deterrent for responding to challenges to the country’s specific national security interests, especially its claims in the increasingly strategic Arctic region . These ships will also have the shorter-range, stealthy NSMs , a very capable and increasingly popular Norwegian-designed missile, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . This missile, which uses an imaging infrared seeker that electronic warfare systems can’t jam to find its target in the terminal stage of flight, also has a land-attack capability, making a very flexible weapon in its own right. Beyond all that, the RCN is also planning to fill at least some of the Mk 41 cells on the CSCs with a mixture of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) and Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) Block IIICs. The U.S. government approved the sale of the SM-2 Block IIICs for Canada’s future frigates just last week. Only one SM-2 can be loaded into a single Mk 41 cell, but four ESSMs can be packed into one, expanding the ship’s available magazine capacity. At present, the plan is for the ESSMs, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story , to provide point defense against incoming threats, including barrages of cruise missiles, while the SM-2s tackle more general area air defense duties. The CSC’s primary sensor to cue these weapons will be a version of Lockheed Martin’s AN/SPY-7 Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) type, supplemented by a solid-state AESA radar target illuminator. With this already significant anti-air defense capability, it’s interesting that the CSCs will also be armed with Sea Ceptors. It’s unclear what launchers will be used to fire these missiles or where they will be located, but Naval News has pointed out that a model of the ship publicly displayed last year had a previously explained six-cell VLS array, possibly a version of Lockheed Martin’s Extensible Launching System (ExLS), amidships. Sea Ceptors can also be quad-packed into a single ExLS cell, which would allow these ships to carry 24 of these missiles in total. A Sea Ceptor missile flies from an Extensible Launching System cell during a test in 2018., MBDA ESSM and Sea Ceptor are typically seen as somewhat equivalent competitors and the Royal Navy’s Type 26s will have a 24-cell VLS loaded with them for general air defense. However, MBDA told Naval News that, on Canada’s CSCs, its Sea Ceptor missiles will be filling the role of a close-in weapon system. Typically, very rapid-firing guns or horizontally-fired missile systems, such as the U.S. Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) with its 20mm Vulcan cannon or the SeaRAM loaded with RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM), provide this last line of defense for warships. Of course, it is possible that Sea Ceptor will also be capable of supplementing the ESSMs in the point defense role, meaning their addition to the CSC’s arsenal could offer the ships added flexibility in that regard. Regardless, taken together, all of these missile options represent major, multi-purpose firepower for a frigate-type warship. It’s not entirely clear how big the CSCs will be compared to the British Type 26s, but the general size of the two designs will be very similar. The Type 26s are expected to displace around 7,000 tons, which is more than existing variants of the Franco-Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate, on which the U.S. Navy’s future Constellation class frigates will be based. Those forthcoming American warships, also referred to as FFG(X) , are also set to be armed with ESSM, SM-2 Block IIIC, and NSM, as well as the SeaRAM close-in weapon system, but there are no plans to add a weapon like Tomahawk to their arsenal at present. Canada’s plans for its CSCs, at least as they are understood now, would make them very similar capability-wise to the U.K. Royal Navy’s future Type 26s, as well as France’s FREMM variants, known as the Aquitaine class. Those French warships also have a long-range land-attack cruise missile capability in the form of MBDA’s Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN), or Naval Cruise missile. The Aquitaine class frigate Languedoc actually fired some of those weapons in anger in 2018 as part of a U.S.-led missile barrage against chemical weapon-related sites in Syria, underscoring the kind of capability that could become available in the future to the RCN if it does ultimately acquire Tomahawks. The CSCs had already looked set to usher in a new era for the Royal Canadian Navy. Armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, together with the various other missiles they will be able to employ, the ships now look set to offer Canada an entirely new form of maritime power projection.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 25, 2020",NSA Spied On Denmark As It Chose Its Future Fighter Aircraft: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports in the Danish media allege that the United States spied on the country’s government and its defense industry, as well as other European defense contractors, in an attempt to gain information on its fighter acquisition program. The revelations, published online by DR , Denmark’s Danish public-service broadcaster, concern the run-up to the fighter competition that was eventually won by the U.S.-made Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter. The report cites anonymous sources suggesting that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) targeted Denmark’s Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the defense firm Terma, which also contributes to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Allegedly, the NSA sought to conduct espionage using an existing intelligence-sharing agreement between the two countries. Under this agreement, it is said the NSA is able to tap fiber-optic communication cables passing through Denmark and stored by the Danish Defense Intelligence Service, or Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste (FE). Huge amounts of data sourced from the Danish communication cables are stored in an FE data center, built with U.S. assistance, at Sandagergård on the Danish island of Amager, to which the NSA also has access. This kind of sharing of confidential data is not that unusual within the intelligence community, in which the NSA is known to trade high-level information with similar agencies within the Five Eyes alliance (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), as well as other close allies, such as Germany and Japan, for example. It would be hoped, however, that these relationships would not be used by the NSA to secretly gather information on the countries with which it has agreements, which is exactly what is alleged to have taken place in Denmark. A source told DR that between 2015 and 2016 the NSA wanted to gather information on the Danish defense company Terma in a “targeted search” ahead of Denmark’s decision on a new fighter jet to replace its current fleet of F-16s. This is the competition that the F-35 won in June 2016. A Danish F-16 painted in the same colors as the upcoming Danish F-35, over the capital, Copenhagen, in October 2020., Flyvevåbnets Fototjeneste According to DR , the NSA used its Xkeyscore system, which trawls through and analyzes global internet data, to seek information on Terma. An unnamed source said that search criteria had included individual email addresses and phone numbers of company employees. Officially described as part of the NSA’s “lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system,” Xkeyscore is understood to be able to obtain email correspondence, browser history, chat conversations, and call logs. In this case, the sources also contend that the NSA used its access to Danish communication cables and FE databases to search for communications related to two other companies, Eurofighter GmbH and Saab, who were respectively offering the Typhoon and Gripen multi-role fighters for the Danish F-16 replacement program. While the Gripen was withdrawn from the Danish competition in 2014, the Typhoon remained in the running until the end, alongside the F-35 and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A photo taken from a Royal Danish Air Force Challenger during joint training with Italian Air Force F-35A fighter jets over Iceland., Forsvaret/Steen Lee Christensen DR says it has so far not been able to “determine exactly what information the NSA was looking for, or how the US intelligence service may have used the information about the fighter companies.” Importantly, however, it is alleged that the NSA’s use of Danish-American intelligence channels to “listen in” on Danish organizations was illegal. Concerns about the breach of trust led to an internal whistleblower making at least two confidential reports for the FE, some of the contents of which have now apparently been leaked. The whistleblower reports are said to have warned the FE leadership about possible illegalities in an intelligence collaboration between Denmark and the United States to drain Danish internet cables of information that the intelligence services could use in their work. Furthermore, the reports allegedly warned that the NSA was also targeting a number of Denmark’s “closest neighbors,” including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden and that some of the espionage conducted by the NSA was judged to be “against Danish interests and goals.” The DR investigation admits it’s currently impossible to determine whether the FE acted on the basis of the whistleblower’s reports. Intelligence-sharing between the two countries has been a public issue since last summer, when it first emerged that the NSA was accessing data from the Danish cables, apparently including Danish citizens’ personal data and private communications. At the time, the Danish government suspended the head of the FE and three other officials. As for the Joint Strike Fighter purchase, it seems likely to escape any fallout from the revelations. There is currently no evidence that the government’s decision to procure the F-35 was in any way influenced by alleged activities by the NSA, although it’s worth noting, too, that the country’s decision to choose the stealth fighter has been the subject of its own criticism. Denmark’s national audit agency, for example, identified serious shortcomings in the decision-making process and calculations used as the basis for selecting the aircraft. However, the country is still on track to receive 27 F-35As and Lockheed Martin reported on October 21, 2020, that Denmark’s first example, AP-1, was headed to final assembly at its Fort Worth, Texas, production facility. The delivery of the first aircraft is due next year. Denmark’s involvement with the Joint Strike Fighter program dates back as far as 2002, when it joined the System Development and Demonstration phase and, according to Lockheed Martin, “influenced technical elements of the F-35.” In October 2008, meanwhile, a Danish F-16 was delivered to the 461st Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, California, to serve as a chase plane for the F-35 Development, Test and Evaluation program, further enhancing the Royal Danish Air Force’s partnership with the program. Terma, for its part, is still a major player within the multinational F-35 production effort, producing more than 70 mission-critical parts, including missionized gun pods for the F-35B and F-35C variants. The company did not respond to a request for comment from DR . A graphic showing components produced by Terma for the Joint Strike Fighter., Terma/Lockheed Martin Regardless of how the FE and the government react to the latest allegations, if they are substantiated, then the terms of the current U.S.-Danish intelligence-sharing agreement may be judged to be in need of at least a major review. If there is any substance to these allegations, then it’s possible other countries that have made controversial choices to select the F-35 may come under new scrutiny, as well.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",Watch This Huge Russian An-124 Condor Skid Off The Runway After An Engine Failure,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An Antonov An-124 Condor strategic transport aircraft, operated by Russia’s specialist Volga-Dnepr Airlines, made a dramatic emergency landing today at Novosibirsk in Siberia after a catastrophic engine failure after take-off. On landing, the airlifter’s nose landing gear collapsed and it skidded off the end of the snowy runway. Despite several pieces of engine debris landing on a populated area, no injuries have been reported so far. The An-124-100, which has the Russian registration RA-82042, and is one of around a dozen in service with Volga-Dnepr, had departed Novosibirsk International Airport in Tolmachevo and was destined for Vienna, Austria. It was not carrying any cargo at the time of the incident, but 14 crew members were on board. The An-124 has a normal flight crew of six and it generally carries two loadmasters for handling cargo, as well. For long-distance assignments, an additional relief crew can be carried in a separate compartment on the upper deck, behind the cockpit, which was the case on this particular flight. https://youtube.com/watch?v=yah0otipvqo https://youtube.com/watch?v=RTzH1qi9Oeg Videos of the incident show the An-124 coming in to land at Novosibirsk International Airport in a tight banking turn, before touching down on runway 25, around two minutes after it had taken off. The An-124, which weighs over 390,000 pounds when unloaded, overran the end of the runway by around 650 feet, with its nose undercarriage collapsing in the snow. Initial reports indicate that the aircraft’s number two engine, in the inboard left nacelle, suffered an uncontained engine event, which occurs when fragments of rotating turbine parts penetrate and exit through the nacelle. These types of failure can be especially dangerous since they pose a risk of fast-moving parts penetrating the cabin, fuel tanks, flight control surfaces, or other critical parts of the aircraft. In this case, it seems that some of the engine parts penetrated one side of the fuselage before passing through the other, tearing especially visible holes around the wing root, while other parts fell to the ground. Photos posted after the event seem to show that some of this debris smashed through the roof of a warehouse. The An-124 is powered by four Ivchenko Progress D-18T Series 3 turbofans, each rated at over 51,000 pounds of thrust at take-off. Like the An-124, these powerplants date from the Soviet era. It’s worth noting these engines were originally produced in Ukraine. The collapse in the Kremlin’s relations with that country following its annexation of Crimea in 2014 has made it impossible to secure additional engines and spare parts. Depot-level maintenance had also previously been carried out in Ukraine. It’s not clear if any of these issues contributed in any way to this particular accident and a formal investigation is currently underway. Two of the An-124’s four Ivchenko Progress D-18T Series 3 turbofans., Dmitry A. Mottl/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS As well as the engine failure, the An-124 reportedly experienced a loss of communications, with its radios and transponder failing. This all reportedly occurred when the plane reached approximately 1,800 feet, while it was still climbing to its cruising altitude. It’s unclear if the communications loss occurred simultaneously with engine failure. Developed by the Antonov Design Bureau in Kyiv, Ukraine, from the early 1970s, the An-124, which is also named Ruslan, after a character from Russian folklore, was intended primarily as a strategic military transport, equipped with modern features including a fly-by-wire control system. The first of two prototypes first flew on December 26, 1982, and a total of 54 series-production aircraft followed, these being built in both Kyiv and at a factory in Ulyanovsk in Russia. Four An-124s have been previously lost entirely in accidents, the most recent incident being in December 1997, when an example leased from the Russian Air Force by Cargotrans, carrying two Su-27UB Flanker jet fighters to Vietnam crashed after take-off at Irkutsk in Russia’s far east. The aircraft hit a residential building, killing 23 people aboard the aircraft and 45 people on the ground. As of 2016, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) operated 26 An-124s, but only nine were airworthy. The non-flyable examples are in a process of being gradually returned to service, at a rate of one or two each year. The An-124 continues to offer unique capabilities to the Russian military and its allies, with aircraft operated both by the VKS and by commercial contractors, such as  Volga-Dnepr, who also provide their services to the country’s military and play a key role in transporting Russian-made military materiel to export clients, for example, the S-400 air defense systems delivered to Turkey . Important roles for VKS An-124s have included delivering arms and equipment to the Russian contingent in Syria and, more recently, ferrying Russian military materiel for its peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh . Volga-Dnepr An-124-100 registration RA-82042, in May 2020., N509FZ/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS As well as serving Moscow and its clients, the An-124 has also played an important role for NATO in recent years, providing heavy-lift air transport to the alliance under the Strategic Airlift International Solution (SALIS) agreement that ensures access to up to five An-124-100 aircraft in support of national, NATO and European Union operations. In the past, Russia planned to resume production of a modernized An-124 in Ulyanovsk, with hopes to have the first of 45 examples completed in 2020. However, this project had to be shelved following Russia’s breakdown in relations with Ukraine in 2014, as the Ukrainian Antonov company still retains the rights to the An-124. Instead, Russia is now looking at an all-new design to replace the An-124 in the future. This program is named Slon, meaning elephant in Russian, and envisages an aircraft of similar overall appearance to the An-124, but even larger. You can read more about this proposed replacement in this previous War Zone piece . When it comes to RA-82042, the exact causes of this mishap remain unknown and it’s unclear whether it will be possible to repair the aircraft and, if so, how long it might take to return it to service.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 10, 2021","French Army To Test Small Drones That Can Detect, Intercept, And Possibly Jam Communications","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. France has kicked off a program to develop an electronic warfare payload for a mini unmanned aerial vehicle. The French Ministry of Defense is looking for a payload, or payloads, that will be able to detect, locate, and identify radio communications transmitters, as well as potentially jam them. The project’s name — Sauron — seems to be a nod to the all-seeing-eye antagonist in Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings , not the first time such a reference has been used for a military surveillance application . The country’s Defense Innovation Agency has released a request for proposals (RFP) for the new payload, which it wants to be small enough that it can be carried by drones weighing less than 55 pounds in total. The RFP calls for submissions by January 18, 2021, and the defense ministry hopes to contract several research and development projects that will each run for a seven-month period, including a demonstration at the end. The RFP doesn’t specify the type of drone that the payload could be integrated on, but says that either fixed-wing or rotary-wing types will be considered, providing that the payload weighs less than 11 pounds and has an energy requirement of less than 50 watts. Also, it demands that a single drone be able to carry out all the desired missions, rather than splitting components of the system across multiple unmanned platforms. The new SIGINT payload could be adapted for a fixed-wing UAV, or a rotary-wing type like this S-100 Camcopter used by the French Navy., French Ministry of Defense While other initiatives call for multiple drones to be employed in an autonomous “swarm,” this requirement is not mentioned and it instead stresses the importance of the system being unitary in nature. This would allow the suitably equipped drone to be used as an infantry support tool operated by a small team on or close to the battlefield. However, a larger number of drones could still potentially be equipped with the same payload to provide coverage over a wider area. Once deployed onboard the chosen unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform, the payload is expected to be able to detect, locate and track one or more types of radio communications transmitters operating in the bands between 30 and 6000 megahertz (MHz). It will need to be capable of identifying multiple transmitters simultaneously and mapping the radio-frequency environment in the area of interest accordingly. The information collected will need to be transmitted to a ground station in real-time. In an operational context, the electronic warfare drone could provide even smaller French Army units with greater situational awareness about any enemy units around them. If used on a larger scale, it could help map out enemy locations across a broader area, a capability that you can read more about here . The French Ministry of Defense describes this electronic support payload as an “emerging requirement” in drone warfare and notes that it will have to be capable of being programmed and reoriented during the flight. An offensive jamming capability is not presently a prerequisite, but is something the French do appear to be interested in and would reflect similar developments underway in Europe right now. “We are not only interested in new technologies,” the French Ministry of Defense outlined in its RFP, and “the innovative nature of the proposals may consist of ‘diverting’ the use of existing technologies.” This seems to open the door to other electronic warfare drone payloads already in development, although restricting the bidders to European Union industry rules out some solutions, such as those already planned for the U.S. Army under its Air Launch Effects initiative , for example. Catapult launch of a SURVEY Copter DVF 2000 drone from a French Navy warship. This UAV has a payload of 4.4 pounds., French Ministry of Defense At this stage, the French Ministry of Defense is just looking for proposals before down-selecting those that it sees as having potential for further development, including a demonstration. The organization confirms, however, that “industrialized solutions resulting from these projects could equip [French] Army drones. The possibility of scaling up (in terms of technological maturation and mass production) should be taken into account in the proposal.” This plan to put an electronic support measures payload on a mini UAV is an ambitious one, although there has been significant miniaturization of related technologies in recent years. There are already similar signals intelligence (SIGINT) payloads available for the U.S.-made Scan Eagle that provide a lot of this desired functionality already. Launched by catapult, the ScanEagle weighs around 44 pounds, so is in the same category as the types of drones the French are looking to explore in a similar role. The Scan Eagle’s SIGINT capability is known as “Peebles” or the “ Peebles Payload .” This is thought to offer the same capabilities as a “ dirtbox ” system, allowing soldiers to track the position of an individual from their phone signal and potentially intercepting audio from the call, as well as the associated metadata. Such a capability would undoubtedly be of use in the French Armed Forces’ ongoing anti-insurgent operation in Africa’s Sahel region and would parallel similar tactics used by French fixed-wing aircraft in both Africa and the Middle East. French troops operate an ECA Group DROGEN vertical take-off and landing UAV on deployment in Africa’s Sahel region., French Ministry of Defense Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps operate the Silent Echo , a SIGINT payload for Group 1 UAVs, which weigh less than 20 pounds. Another such electronic warfare payload is the Spectral Bat for the RQ-21, suggesting that the kind of capability the French military is now looking for is within reach. Whatever the results of this latest initiative, France has shown that it, too, is increasingly embracing the potential of UAVs to carry a wider variety of payloads for new types of missions.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",Watch The Biggest Unexploded World War Two Bomb Ever Found in Poland Blow Up,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A British Royal Air Force “Tallboy” bomb, intended to sink a German cruiser during World War Two, blew up spectacularly in a Polish canal while divers were working to defuse it. After lying dormant for 75 years, the 12,000-pound bomb exploded underwater, sending a huge column of water skywards, but fortunately not resulting in any injuries or serious damage. Polish Navy demolition experts were in the process of trying to make the 21-foot bomb safe by a process of deflagration, meaning that, using a remote device, the weapon was being exposed to heat to burn away the explosives. According to reports, the bomb had been buried in mud 39 feet below the waterline with only its nose remaining visible. A controlled explosion had earlier been ruled out due to the risk of damaging a nearby bridge. As it is, the effort to make the “Tallboy” safe has been described in local media as the largest underwater bomb disposal operation ever to take place in Europe, and required around a year of planning and preparation. “The deflagration process turned into detonation,” the Polish Navy’s Second Lieutenant Commander Grzegorz Lewandowski was quoted as saying by Polish state-run news agency PAP. “The object can be considered as neutralized, it will not pose any more threat,” he added. The shockwave from the detonation of what remained of the bomb’s 5,200 pounds of Torpex explosive filling rapidly engulfed the channel, demonstrating how the weapon’s “earthquake” effect was designed to destroy targets even without scoring a direct hit. At the time of the detonation, on October 13, 2020, the divers were at a safe distance from the bomb, while more than 750 civilians had been evacuated from an area within a 1.6-mile radius, close to the town of Swinoujscie in northwest Poland. This particular “Tallboy,” a weapon that was carried operationally only by the Avro Lancaster four-engine heavy bomber , had originally been directed against the German Kriegsmarine cruiser Lützow , anchored in the Piast Canal that connects the Bay of Szczecin with the Baltic Sea, in what was then Germany. Although fitted with three detonators, for some reason, the bomb had failed to explode. A satellite image showing the location of the narrow Piast Canal that runs from the Bay of Szczecin to the Baltic Sea, in the far northwest of what is today Poland., GOOGLE EARTH On April 13, 1945, a force of 24 Lancasters targeted the heavy cruiser Lützow and sister warship Prinz Eugen , but the raid was hampered by heavy cloud cover. Two days later the bombers returned, again without success. Finally, on April 16, Lancasters scored several “Tallboy” near-misses — some sources also claim a direct hit — on Lützow , and the cruiser foundered in shallow water. With the warship’s guns still operational, Lützow saw out the war as an anti-aircraft battery before being captured by the Soviets. Original footage from the RAF attack on the Lützow can be seen from around the 0:52-minute mark in this video: Surrounded by craters, the German cruiser Lützow , damaged by British bombers, in the Piast Canal, on April 25, 1945., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/PUBLIC DOMAIN The “Tallboy” in question was finally discovered in September 2019 during work to deepen the channel to improve access to the Polish port of Szczecin. The heavyweight weapon was designed by British engineer Barnes Wallis , who was also responsible for the “bouncing bomb” used by the RAF in the raid against the dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley during World War Two. The “Tallboy” was a deep-penetration weapon with a streamlined shape to ensure near-supersonic speed at the point of impact. After the success of the “Tallboy,” Wallis enlarged the design still further, to produce the colossal 22,000-pound “Grand Slam,” also designed for deep penetration. A “Tallboy” immediately after release from a Lancaster of No 617 Squadron over a V-1 flying-bomb store at Watten, France, in 1944., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/PUBLIC DOMAIN The “Tallboy” was first used by Lancasters of No 617 Squadron, the “Dambusters,” on the night of June 8/9, 1944, against the Saumur railway tunnel in Normandy, France, a critical route for transporting German reinforcements toward where the Allies had conducted the D-Day landings just days earlier. The weapon also saw notable use against hardened German U-boat pens and at least one example was used to strike Hitler’s mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, Germany. Other major operations involving the weapon included the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz , anchored in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the war, a total of 854 “Tallboys” had been dropped. Polish authorities claim that the example found near Swinoujscie was the largest unexploded World War Two bomb ever found in Poland, and this seems likely. The RAF employed the biggest freefall bombs in the Western European theater of operations and the only one to exceed the weight of the “Tallboy” was the “Grand Slam.” There’s no record of that weapon having been used on targets in what is now Poland. As one of the most bombed countries during World War Two, it’s not surprising that Poland still plays host to unexploded munitions, although a “Tallboy” bomb is a genuine rarity. Bearing in mind its destructive power, we should be thankful that the Polish Navy took all the right precautions to ensure that, when things didn’t go quite as planned, no injuries occurred as a result.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 8, 2021",The Secret Service Has A New Chevy Suburban Presidential Limousine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Presidential Motorcade is one of the most visible manifestations of a President’s might. At the same time, it is a huge rolling reminder of the immense security bubble that surrounds the President even when making short trips within the confines of the National Mall. As time marches on, new vehicles are added to the motorcade fleet, some of which are quite exotic , while older models get pushed down to lower-risk diplomatic security missions or retired altogether . Just over two years ago, the newest Presidential Limousine, popularly referred to as “The Beast,” emerged . Now, a new Chevy Suburban-based Presidential limousine has joined the fleet. You can read all about the various vehicles of the Presidential motorcade and what they do in this past feature of ours . The Secret Service’s heavily armored Suburban limousines don’t get the same attention that the traditional Presidential Limousines get. The reality is The Beast has far more in common with a Chevy Suburban than with a Cadillac sedan, but that’s another story. Still, these specialized SUVs are used extensively, especially when the President travels across the United States and the Vice President seems to ride in them even more regularly. An example of the existing fleet of armored Suburbans that cart the President around is seen as Trump returns to Mar-a-Largo in West Palm Beach on Nov. 29, 2019,, AP The use of the large sport utility vehicles for transporting the President and Vice President began in the early 2000s. Now they are a largely interchangeable staple, along with iconic Beast limousines, for many of POTUS’ and VPOTUS’ trips. Prior to the arrival of this new vehicle, these highly modified Suburbans were based on the tenth generation of the big family hauler. The production run of those vehicles ended in 2014. The new one that has been popping up from time-to-time in recent months is based on the 11th generation, which just ended its production run in 2020. As such, it seems that it was time for an upgrade. President Trump gives a thumbs-up through the thick bullet-proof glass on one of the current generation Presidential Suburban limos during his time at Walter Reid Hospital while getting treated for COVID-19. , White House The Presidential Suburban in question is somewhat of a rare breed even before its modifications. It is a 2500 HD model, with heavy-duty running gear. The Drive ‘s Caleb Jacobs told The War Zone that “Chevy actually discontinued the Suburban HD a few years back and even then, it was only available to fleet and military consumers. The vehicle shown here is based on the previous-gen Suburban though there have been rumors an updated model may be coming for the 2021 model year.” Obviously, the Secret Service has the funding and a mandate to get the configurations they need, and the heavy running gear is necessary to support the thousands of pounds of additional armor, communications, defensive systems, and other electronics that are installed during the vehicle’s conversion. Chevy is also fully aware of the high-level exposure the Presidential Motorcade gives its products. So, I think it is safe to say that the Secret Service will get what it wants, regardless of the state of a vehicle’s commercial production. The Tweet below includes a picture showing Vice President Pence getting out of one of the Suburbans at Joint Base Andrews. Note the gold Presidential seal embedded in the door: The new Suburban limo introduces something fresh to the Presidential Suburban lineage—a raised roofline. It is unclear what the exact reason for this modification was, but it would make it easier for passengers to get in and out of the vehicle’s deep cabin. It could also make up for some space taken up by ventral and dorsal armor. The threat posed by drones , in particular, has ballooned in recent years, which may have resulted in heavier topside armor. From what we can tell, this particular configuration first showed up nearly a year ago, and apparently, it even carried the President back in December of 2019, although it was for a short stint within Joint Base Andrews as you can see in the video below. Advance to 6:13:20 if the video does not start there automatically: But, as with the new Beasts, it seems like these vehicles were used sparingly during their initial entry into service, before they became well-proven in actual operations. They are likely to become more plentiful and end up being regular fixtures in the Presidential Motorcade as time goes on. It’s also worth noting that many of the other vehicles in the motorcade have been converted over to this same generation suburban. Like all of the Presidential Motorcade, these new super-SUVs will live quite the remarkable lives during their time in service, ferrying around the first and second families. They will be constantly flown on C-17 and C-5 transports around the world from locale to locale. In fact, the vehicles in the Presidential Motorcade are certainly the most well-traveled (via air) vehicles in the world. While the existing fleet of older armored Suburbans isn’t likely to disappear in the very near term, if everything goes right, we should expect them to slowly fade away with this new configuration taking their place.

The footage comes from a weapons qualification event that members of the Army’s 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division took part in earlier in the month. The brigade is based at Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The soldiers used the new googles, known as the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENVG-B) to engage targets on a training range using M4 carbines also equipped with the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I), a new compact thermal optic. You can watch the entire video of the training below. The clip that shows what the user sees when looking through the ENVG-B comes at the very end, at around 6:56 in the runtime. https://youtube.com/watch?v=XTG29w9tf-w What you see first in the footage when it comes to the picture the ENVG-B presents to the user is a very good overview of the kind of new capabilities the goggles offer. What’s immediately notable is that the view has something of reddish tint in certain areas, rather than the green or gray coloration commonly associated with night vision optics. A screengrab from the video showing the view through the ENVG-B., US Army This is because the ENVG-B fuses together the view from an image intensifier, just like you would get with older night vision optics, and one from a thermal sensor. This combination offers greater overall fidelity compared to older goggles and also provides a means of spotting targets through visual obscurants, such as dust and smoke. Also seen right in the center of the view is another key feature of the ENVG-B, the ability to wirelessly connect to other optics, in this case the FWS-I, and overlay that feed on top of everything else. This allows soldiers to take advantage of the magnification of those optics to more closely investigate targets and other objects of interest. They can also fire on them, from the shoulder or the hip, as seen in the video, using that remote sight picture. That additional feed means that troops can point their weapons around corners to get a view of what might be around them without having to expose themselves to potential hostile fire. The ENVG-B can present these various feeds in many other different ways, as well. The video shows the soldier switch to having the feed from the FWS-I as a picture-in-picture in the lower right-hand corner of the display, before swapping it around so that the optic on the rifle is their primary view. The display can further be toggled to just show the feed from offboard systems. A screengrab from the video showing the feed from the FWS-I rifle optic as the primary view when looking through the ENVG-B, while the goggle’s own view is in a picture-in-picture box at the bottom right., US Army The Army, as well as the ENVG-B’s manufacturer, L3Harris Technologies, says the goggles’ wireless connectivity means that it can also pipe in other kinds of data and project that onto the display, including from the Army’s Nett Warrior situational awareness system. This turns the entire system into a sort of miniature heads-up and situational display for individual troops. The video from the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division’s weapons range training only shows a compass. A video that L3Harris previously released also shows another view with a video game-esque “radar” in the corner showing the general locations of friendly troops in relation to the user, as well as possible hostiles and other waypoints and objects of interest. A red diamond symbol, the U.S. military’s standard symbol for enemy forces, is also seen in the center of the feed denoting the location of a hostile structure and the picture-in-picture view has more information about that building. “Any info that can make it to a tactical radio, as long as that’s in Nett Warrior, can be populated into the picture-in-picture mode in the video,” Lynn Bollengier, President, Integrated Vision Solutions Sector at L3Harris Technologies, said at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference, which was held virtually in October due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This raises the possibility of linking the ENVG-Bs to other sensors and data feeds, including those from manned and unmanned fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as manned and unmanned vehicles on the ground, among other sources. One of the most obvious immediate uses of this capability would be to pipe the feed from a drone into the goggles to allow soldiers to more readily identify enemy forces and other possible hazards well ahead of their positions. This would give even small Army units significant advantages when maneuvering on the battlefield, making it easier to flank opponents, scout ahead, or simply avoid dangerous spots. Altogether, ENVG-B represents a major upgrade of the sensor and situation awareness capabilities available to each Army soldier. It’s also the result of extensive work that’s been going on for more than a decade now. ENVG-B itself is an outgrowth of the monocular ENVG series , which first demonstrated many of the features now found on the refined binocular system, including the sensor fusion and multi-display options. https://youtube.com/watch?v=LwOTWQc9YmY Compared to those previous goggles, the ENVG-B also offers a wider field of view. It can still be used in a monocular configuration that gives the user a more readily available option to see normally, if desired, as well. A composite image showing the various ways a user can wear the ENVG-B., US Army The Army is already looking at helmet-mounted optics that will offer even greater functionality, including true augmented reality capabilities that could be valuable during combat, as well as training . The service, together with the Marine Corps, conducted a major test of one such system now in development, the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), in October. Army soldiers use IVAS augmented reality headsets during a test in October 2020., US Army “There are a lot of features on it that are futuristic, I guess you could say, including things like advanced battle tracking,” Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Christopher, an Army paratrooper that took part in that testing said. “I can see where my entire platoon is projected on a map, and for me as a platoon leader, that’s amazing, because there’s a lot of guesswork that goes out the window. There’s a lot of verbal communication over radios that I don’t have to do anymore. It’s very solid I can see how this is going to make a great impact on the way we fight.” Earlier this year, pictures emerged showing special operations forces, and the conventional forces supporting them, in Syria using an Israeli-made computerized weapons sight that also features advanced targeting and target recognition features, among others. The system is primarily in service there now to offer an additional capability to bring down small drones as well as extremely accurate fire, but could have broader applications within the U.S. military as a whole. You can read more about the Smart Shooter SMASH 2000 system and an automated gun turret, that also looks straight out of a video game, in these past War Zone pieces . There have been significant advances in night vision technology that allows users to see in near true color, even in the middle of the night, as well, which the Army could look to integrate either into the ENVG-B or a future system. You can read more about color night vision in this past War Zone piece . The Army has historically owned the night compared to most other adversaries, but even non-state actors are increasingly using older, but still useful night vision goggles and thermal optics. The impressive new capabilities that the ENVG-Bs offer show that the service has been working hard to ensure its soldiers maintain their edge over any opponent once the sun sets, but above all else, it is maybe our clearest reminder as of late that what was recently the stuff only seen in video games is now become very much part of our reality.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter assigned to a multi-national peacekeeping force crashed on an Egyptian island in the Red Sea today, killing all eight individuals on board, including six Americans. An investigation into the incident is underway, but the evidence so far indicates that it was an accident and not the result of any hostile action. The UH-60 came down on Egypt’s Tiran Island, off the coast of the country’s Sinai Peninsula, in the Red Sea on Nov. 12, 2020. Egyptian officials said that the helicopter, part of the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) had been conducting an aerial reconnaissance flight in the area at the time. In addition to the six Americans on the helicopter, there was one French national and one Czech national. MFO initially released a statement saying that seven individuals on board the helicopter had died and that another had survived the crash and had been medically evacuated. That release was subsequently taken down and replaced with one that said that there were eight fatalities, but that there had still been a survivor. The Israeli military reportedly offered to send a rescue team to the crash site and MFO said that both Egypt and Israel had cooperated and supported the recovery effort. The full statement from MFO at the time of writing is as follows: During a routine mission in the vicinity of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, nine members of the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) were involved in a helicopter crash. We are deeply saddened to report that eight uniformed MFO members were killed; six U.S. citizens, one French, and one Czech. One U.S. MFO Member survived and was medically evacuated. Names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The MFO will conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. At this point, there is no information to indicate the crash was anything except an accident. We greatly appreciate the cooperation and support of Egypt and Israel in the recovery effort. Fox News has reported that an unspecified mechanical failure may have been the cause of this apparent accident. MFO was established following the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel in 1979. As part of that agreement, Israeli forces withdrew from the Sinai, where they had been since the Six Day War in 1967. The agreement had also called for the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to monitor the terms of the deal and make sure that neither side was building up its forces again in that region. However, in the face of a likely veto of the plan from the Soviet Union in the United Nations Security Council, the treaty parties accepted the deployment of a separate multinational peacekeeping entity, which became MFO. This organization has been conducting peacekeeping operations in and around the Sinai continuously since 1981. In February, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had raised the possibility of ending American participation in the MFO in order to free up those forces and associated resources for other purposes. Though all the available evidence so far points to an accident, it is also important to note that ISIS has a very active franchise in the Sinai Peninsula and that MFO forces have come under attack from these terrorists in the past. We will update this story as new information becomes available. UPDATE: 12:20pm EST Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller has now issued a statement regarding the crash, which is as follows: The Defense Department is deeply saddened by the loss of six U.S. and two partner nation service members in a helicopter crash in the Sinai Peninsula operating with the United Nations Multinational Force and Observers (MFO). Yesterday we recognized the sacrifice of millions of American veterans who have defended our nation for generations, and today we are tragically reminded of the last full measure our uniformed warriors may pay for their service. I extend the Department’s condolences to the families, friends and teammates of these service members. UPDATE: 3:20pm EST MFO has now issued another statement , which has revised the casualty total again back to the original figures of seven dead and one injured. We are deeply saddened by the loss on November 12, 2020, of seven of our uniformed military colleagues from three countries who died in a helicopter crash during a routine mission. This included one Czech, one French, and five U.S. MFO members, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these soldiers at this difficult time. We wish the one U.S. MFO Member who survived the crash a speedy recovery. A full investigation of the cause of the crash, which appears to be mechanical in nature, has been launched. We greatly appreciate the cooperation and support of Egypt and Israel. The incident is a reminder of the sacrifices MFO Members make in support of the cause of peace.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 20, 2022",Israel Has Taken Delivery Of Its Most Capable Warship Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Navy has officially welcomed to its fleet the first Sa’ar 6 class missile corvette, the INS Magen , which it describes as its “newest and most advanced ship yet.” The warship will provide Israel with a major boost in its ability to project naval power out into the Mediterranean and maybe even beyond. The flag transfer ceremony on November 11, 2020, took place at Kiel in northern Germany where the first ship was built by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems over a three-year period. Magen is the first of four in its class being built for the Israeli Navy. The corvette is due to arrive in Israel in December, after a period of training off the German coast. Israel signed the contract for the four new corvettes in May 2015 and construction is being handled jointly by German Naval Yards Holdings and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Work on the future INS Magen began in February 2018 and the ship was launched 15 months later. An official naming ceremony for INS Magen took place in Kiel in May 2019. The future INS Magen nearing completion., ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems INS Magen under construction in the ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems yard., ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems Compared to the Israeli Navy’s Sa’ar 5 class, American-built corvettes acquired in the mid-1990s and previously the largest in the service’s inventory, the Sa’ar 6 ships are considerably bigger. They measure 295 feet long and have a displacement of 1,900 long tons fully loaded, while the Sa’ar 5 is 281 feet long and has a displacement of 1,255 long tons fully loaded. All three Sa’ar 5 class missile corvettes of the Israeli Navy cruise off the shore of Israel during a training exercise., Israel Defense Forces The Sa’ar 6 warships are derived from the German Navy’s own Braunschweig class corvettes but have substantial differences centered around the integration of weaponry and sensors of Israeli origin. For a corvette, the Sa’ar 6 is unusually well-armed, with different surface-to-air missiles for area and point defense, anti-ship missiles, guns, and torpedoes. In comparison, the previous Sa’ar 5 class has a single type of surface-to-air missile, two quadruple anti-ship missile launchers, and a Mk 15 Phalanx 20mm close-in weapon system (CIWS). The Sa’ar 6’s anti-ship missile launchers will be fitted amidships and are expected to be loaded with the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Gabriel V , which has an active radar seeker and is optimized for use in cluttered littoral environments. These missiles are reportedly already in service on the Sa’ar 5 class corvettes and are thought to have a range of up to 248 miles. In October 2020, Israel’s Ministry of Defense posted a video showing what it said was the test-firing of a new type of anti-ship missile from a Sa’ar 5 corvette. This may well have been an improved Gabriel V, featuring an active radar seeker and a two-way data link. If so, this would be the latest iteration of a family of weapons first used in combat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Two types of air defense weapons are also provided. These are Rafael’s Barak-8 surface-to-air missiles, launched from 32 vertical launch cells on the Sa’ar 6, plus a pair of Rafael C-Dome systems, each armed with 20 Tamir missiles . While the Barak-8 is intended to engage targets out to around 60 miles, including supersonic anti-ship missiles, the C-Dome, a version of the land-based Iron Dome , is designed to intercept and destroy lower-flying aircraft, anti-ship missiles, as well as short-range rockets and artillery shells. Other armament consists of an Italian-made Oto Melara 76mm main gun, two Rafael Typhoon Weapon Stations with 25mm automatic cannons, and a pair of 324mm tubes for Mk 54 lightweight torpedoes. Since the vast majority of this weaponry is of indigenous production, it will be added to the INS Magen once it arrives at its homeport of Haifa in Israel. Electronics, including electronic warfare and cyber systems, will also be primarily of Israeli origin, with Elbit Systems taking responsibility for the electronic warfare suite. Further protection against missile threats will be provided by Rafael’s C-Gem offboard active decoy. This is launched from the ship before descending under a parachute while using electronic jamming to spoof incoming missiles. Among confirmed sensors is the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR multifunction active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar developed by IAI’s Elta division and known as “Adir” in Israeli service. The MF-STAR is already in use on the Sa’ar 5 boats, as well as warships of the Indian and South Korean navies. The radar will automatically track and engage the full spectrum of aerial threats, from aircraft to sea-skimming missiles, at ranges up to 124 miles. Like the Braunschweig class, the Sa’ar 6 vessels incorporate stealthy design features. However, the Israeli media has in the past reported that the original design required modifications to ensure the required low radar signature. This is particularly important in view of the threat from radar-guided anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) launched by Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militant group. During the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah attacked and damaged an Israeli Sa’ar 5 class corvette using an ASCM. INS Magen in a completed state, but still to receive weapons and sensors, which will now be installed in Israel., Israel Defense Forces Unlike the Braunschweig class, the Sa’ar 6 also has a hangar that’s large enough for an embarked helicopter, likely the SH-60F Seahawk , eight of which Israel plans to acquire from U.S. Navy stocks . In the meantime, the Israeli Air Force operates five Eurocopter AS565 Panther helicopters, known locally as “ Atalef ,” which would at least be of a suitable size to operate from these ships. All in all, the balance of weapons, sensors, and capabilities found in the Sa’ar 6 class seem to have been tailored for what is expected to be its key mission: defending offshore gas platforms within Israel’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the eastern Mediterranean. Today, these gas reserves provide the majority of Israel’s electricity requirements and as such constitute a major strategic asset. Alongside the threat from Hezbollah , Hamas militants operating in the Gaza Strip have also been expanding their capabilities, improving and building up their rocket and missile arsenals, including weapons that are thought to have enough range to reach gas installations in the EEZ. There is also a growing threat from ASCMs launched by other non-state actors in the wider region, as when the HSV-2 Swift , an ex-U.S. Navy experimental high-speed logistics catamaran being utilized by the UAE government, was struck by a missile launched by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in 2016. These kinds of threats demand the multi-tier defense architecture that Israel has introduced on land, and which it is now migrating to the sea, as well, on board the Sa’ar 6 corvettes. Furthermore, Israel Defense Forces officials have confirmed that the warships will also be “plugged in” to a wider land-based air defense network that includes Iron Dome, David’s Sling medium/long-range surface-to-air missile, and other assets. Israeli Navy crew onboard INS Magen during the handover ceremony., Israel Defense Forces A larger warship, like the Sa’ar 6 design, also offers much greater endurance, with the range and onboard stores required to mount longer patrols securing the EEZ. According to different sources, the Israeli Navy is likely to engage “several” of the new corvettes on EEZ protection duties at any one time, leaving the remaining one or two to conduct other tasks, as well as training, or to undergo maintenance. As well as defending the EEZ, the Sa’ar 6 corvettes will be expected to protect the flow of imports to Israel, on which the country is heavily reliant. With a range of 2,500 miles and a long loiter time thanks to a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system, they also have the potential to undertake longer-range operations, including interdiction of all types of arms as well as preventing contraband smuggling. It’s also worth noting that the capabilities inherent in the Sa’ar 6 will also give Israel an additional means of responding to other challenges in the wider Mediterranean, particularly Turkey’s increasingly assertive maritime claims . Israel has joined Greece, Cyprus, and Egypt, among others, in opposing Turkey’s claims and a warship of this type provides Israel with an additional, more capable means of patrolling and enforcing its own maritime claims. The next deliveries in the Sa’ar 6 program are expected to follow at a rapid tempo, with the next three vessels all due to arrive in Israel in 2021: INS Oz in July, INS Atzmaut in September, and INS Nitzhahon in November. Clearly, the Sa’ar 6 signifies a major advance for the Israeli Navy as it sets about resetting its core mission in the eastern Mediterranean.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 20, 2021",The Laser System Protecting The Capital Against Aerial Intruders Is Getting An Upgrade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Battle Management Directorate at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts issued a request for information regarding a refresh of laser projector components for the Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness (ERSA) system on November 9, 2020. This “system provides the National Capital Region-Integrated Air Defense System (NCR-IADS) with ‘eyes on’ video of aircraft in the NCR through a network of visual and infrared cameras,” according to the contracting notice. The far less talked about laser components work to grab the attention of wayward aviators and warn them away from highly sensitive areas. The Air Force states that the current ERSA system was introduced in 2004 and underwent a “partial technical refresh” in 2012, although the original lasers have remained in use since the beginning. The contracting document provides a general description of how the component ERSA system works: “The ERSA system is a collective suite of lasers, electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors, connecting networks, data correlation, applications, decision support tools, and operator displays. The specific mission of the lasers is to generate a visual warning signal visible to the aircrew of aircraft that may have entered into controlled airspace in error.” “The laser system and the red/green pulses of light it develops are mentioned to all aircraft in their approved flight plan if they are to be near the NCR; additionally, the laser system is published in FAA Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS) for all aircraft.” The tightly controlled and well-defended airspace around Washington, D.C., FAA The service also identifies the current limitations that it hopes to address with regard to the eight laser systems deployed throughout the NCR. Each of these lasers is collocated and bore-sighted to a camera system. If an aircraft needs to be warned, the laser projects a beam of light that is focused and compressed using a telescope. The Air Force notes that the telescope units and fiber-optic links are still supportable and it’s only the laser units that need to be swapped out for newer equipment. The RFI notice states that the government is looking for existing technical solutions that could be adopted, or modified if needed, for integration within the existing NCR-IADS architecture. “The NCR-IADS ERSA system seeks non-proprietary, open system refresh that meets or exceeds current capabilities and provides a more efficient, effective, and supportable laser projection/warning system,” the RFI reads before adding that the government requires a technical solution that can be implemented “rapidly.” A visual warning system, part of the Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness, or ERSA system, monitors situational awareness in the NCR. , U.S. Air Force The document doesn’t provide any meaningful data on the performance or capabilities of the lasers used in the existing NCR-IADS ERSA architecture but does say that the replacement laser system is required to be accommodated in an enclosure measuring approximately 16 x 10 x 5 inches and 8 x 5 x 13 inches. Clearly, a highly focused laser beam would be able to get the attention of a pilot who may have unwittingly strayed into the National Capital Region. ERSA is not designed to deliberately disorient or confuse a pilot with hostile intent , but it’s worth noting that potentially hazardous lasers are used around airports and other locales to blind and disorient aircrew. These tactics are not only used by i ndividual actors , but they have also been adopted by peer-states, as well . Lasers can be highly dangerous to aircrews, but when properly modulated for the target in question, they can be used to draw a pilot’s attention and warn them that something is wrong. , FBI ERSA is just one component of the larger NCR-IADS network, which originated as an urgent capability initiated by North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, after the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001. While provisions have always been made for the general air defense of America’s capital, NCR-IADS has become increasingly optimized to detect and track low-altitude, low-speed airborne threats. The War Zone has, in the past, examined what can happen when a possible intruder enters the airspace surrounding Washington D.C. and specifically how these cameras can work to rapidly attempt to identify the aircraft in question. You can read that piece here . The bottom line is that seconds can make the difference between engaging a target with deadly force and waiting for it to be escorted away, so the visual ID capabilities that these telephoto, stabilized cameras provide is absolutely critical. Today, the NCR-IADS also includes U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin helicopters to intercept “slow-movers,” Avenger short-range air defense systems , and medium-range NASAMS surface-to-air missiles, as well as supersonic F-16 Viper fighters on round-the-clock alert duty at Andrews Air Force Base . You can read more about each of these “hard-kill” elements here . There are also electronic warfare systems now deployed to deal with the drone threat, as well. A U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin helicopter on patrol over the National Mall in Washington, D.C., U.S. COAST GUARD The NCR-IADS has been frequently updated, reflecting the critical role it plays in defending the Capital Area. Now, the latest enhancements for the ERSA should ensure that its laser projection capability keeps pace with evolving technologies.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 10, 2020",Israel’s Specially-Built F-35I Test Jet Just Touched Down In-Country,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israeli Air Force’s uniquely outfitted test variant of the F-35I stealth fighter has arrived in the country, the air force confirmed today. The one-off version of the “Adir,” as the aircraft is named in Israel, touched down at Tel Nof Air Force Base in the center of the country, which has new facilities, including a revamped flight line, to host the fifth-generation jet. ​ Described by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) as “the first test F-35” outside the United States, the specially equipped F-35I will join the service’s Flight Testing Center (FTC) Squadron, also known by its Hebrew acronym MANAT, which is charged with putting all of its equipment through its paces, including aircraft and weapons trials, avionics integration, and airframe modification and testing. The first new aircraft to be assigned to the FTC in 14 years, the F-35I, line number AS-15, IAF serial 924, was the 15th “Adir” to come off the production line at Fort Worth, Texas and was initially retained in the United States, presumably for pre-delivery testing. During that time, it was seen with calibration markings , normally associated with weapons release tests, and it now sports the FTC’s orange and blue markings and squadron insignia, plus high-visibility national markings, making it one of the world’s more colorful F-35s. If required, however, the test “Adir,” which you can read about in detail in this previous War Zone article , can be converted to a fully operational configuration, as can all the other aircraft in the FTC Squadron. Israel has already flown its F-35Is in combat, as disclosed by the Israeli Air Force back in 2018. The test F-35I on the Tel Nof flight line together with one of the FTC’s F-15I fighter jets., Israeli Air Force/Amit Agronov “To the FTC Squadron personnel, the absorption of the “Adir” poses new challenges,” said Brigadier General Oded Cohen, commander of Tel Nof AFB, speaking at the induction ceremony for the new jet. “I have no doubt that by virtue of your skill and professional spirit you will know, as you have proven in the past, how to challenge the limits of the “Adir’s” capabilities and lead the IAF through toward new horizons.” Among those challenges will almost certainly be the introduction of Israeli-developed weapons destined for the IAF’s operational F-35Is, which are now serving with two other squadrons . Currently, all the IAF’s fast jet platforms have been adapted to use indigenous weapons and, in the past, the FTC has hinted that the aircraft’s flight envelopes have also been expanded while carrying these weapons. The IAF has mentioned that the “Adir” will receive locally developed electronic warfare and communications systems, too. Weaponry is expected to include the Rafael SPICE precision-guided bomb, but may eventually include air-to-air missiles and other weapons, too. However, the air force also admits that incorporating indigenous systems in the F-35I will not be as easy as with previous-generation aircraft, thanks to the Joint Strike Fighter’s closely guarded software codes. “In the “Adir” program, the IAF doesn’t have access to everything, and cannot fully intervene,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Y, commander of the FTC Squadron. Nevertheless, Lieutenant Colonel Y added that “The experimental F-35I will act as the main building block for acquiring new flight capabilities and allow for independent installation of munitions.” The induction ceremony for the test F-35I at Tel Nof AFB., Israeli Air Force/Amit Agronov Each new weapon introduced for the “Adir” will be tested as part of a certification process, and AS-15 will carry equipment to measure and record factors including load testing, flutter, and release characteristics. “In load testing, we examine the durability of the weapon and aircraft while performing complex maneuvers,” Lieutenant Colonel Y continued. “In flutter testing, we check for aerodynamic phenomena that may endanger the jet. While testing release fluency, we scan for issues in the release process of munitions — a significant test for the “Adir” since its payload is released from an internal hold in the jet’s body. After the testing process is completed, we are able to determine the guidelines for operating with the new capability.” All the data gathered by AS-15’s sensors in flight will be relayed in real-time to a ground station and evaluated by flight-test engineers. Most of the required sensors were installed in the jet on the production line, but the IAF also confirms that additional equipment can be installed in Israel, depending on the particular test being flown. Ground crew attend to the test “Adir” at Tel Nof., Israeli Air Force/Amit Agronov In the near future, Tel Nof AFB will also receive engineers from manufacturer Lockheed Martin to help the FTC’s personnel learn their way around the F-35I. “The IAF knows how to operate the “Adir,” but does not yet know how to operate an experimental model,” Lieutenant Colonel Y continued. “We need to receive the relevant knowledge in order to operate the aircraft and fly it prior to the testing process.” Intriguingly, the commander of the FTC Squadron has said that he considers it likely that the United States will now “produce additional aircraft based on the current [AS-15] model for themselves.” This could take the form of a so-called “unlocked” F-35 that would be rigged up to make testing of all kinds a simpler, and less costly, proposition. Whether the U.S. military also gets its hands on specially configured test F-35s any time soon, the future capabilities of the IAF’s frontline “Adir” fleet can now be more fully explored thanks to the latest equipment for Tel Nof’s Flight Testing Center.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 29, 2020",Taiwan Issues Rare Confirmation That U.S. Special Operators Are Training On The Island (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan has provided official confirmation that units from the United States military have been training in Taiwan . It’s the latest example of how ongoing US-Taiwanese military relations have increasingly been played out in public amid growing tensions with mainland China . U.S. Marine Corps special operators from the Marine Raider Regiment recently began conducting drills on the island, Taiwan’s Naval Command confirmed to Taiwan News on November 9, 2020. While U.S. forces have trained in Taiwan, this fact has generally not been publicized by either American or Taiwanese officials since 1979. That year, the U.S. government officially recognized the Communist regime in Beijing as the sole legitimate authority in China and formally severed diplomatic ties with the Nationalist government in Taipei. At the same time, the United States has reserved the right to continue supporting Taiwan and its military until there is a final settlement over its status vis-a-vis the mainland. A statement from Taiwan’s Naval Command described the drills as “routine Taiwan-U.S. military exchange and cooperation training,” which it said were designed to enhance the combat capabilities of its own troops. The Marine Raiders also reportedly undertook two weeks of coronavirus-related quarantine prior to beginning the exercise. Taiwan’s United Daily News had previously reported that the Marine Raiders will be supervising Taiwanese Marines in skills including assault boat and speedboat infiltration operations at the Tsoying Naval Base in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. This would make sense considering the maritime skill sets of the Marine Raiders and the kinds of missions that Taiwan’s Marines, as well as its own maritime special operations forces, could be called upon to perform during a conflict with China. As we noted earlier, the U.S. military is known to send troops from various branches, including other special operations units, to Taiwan for joint training, but it is rare for these engagements to be publicized in any way. Prime examples include the regular iterations of Exercise Balance Tamper, a so-called Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) event that sees U.S. Army Special Forces working alongside Republic of China Army Aviation elements and Taiwan’s Special Forces Command. A rare video from the U.S. Army’s 1st Special Forces Group that briefly appeared earlier this year showed Green Berets training on Taiwan during a recent Balance Tamper exercise. The maneuvers apparently also involved a Republic of China Army special operations unit, the 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, also known as the Sea Dragon Frogmen. You can read more about that whole episode in this previous War Zone story , which was published before the video was removed. MARSOC operators during a training exercise. , USMC These latest maneuvers in Taiwan involving the Marine Raiders also come at a time in which the Republic of China Marine Corps is being strengthened in order to enhance the country’s amphibious warfare capabilities as tensions between Taipei and Beijing continue to rise. Taiwan News reports that an additional $28.8 million has been added to the island’s budget for its Marine Corps to fund new equipment including special operations raiding craft, thermal imagers, and boarding equipment. This all suggests that a particular focus is being placed on infiltration and interdiction missions, as well as reconnaissance, reflected also in this latest exercise with the Raiders. In particular, in a conflict scenario, Taiwan is expected to deploy special operations teams to various islands in or near the Taiwan Strait from where they would be able to harass Chinese forces, delaying their advance , or perhaps even launching raids on the mainland. These forces could also act as an early warning force of an impending invasion via the collection of critical intelligence during clandestine amphibious operations.

The People’s Liberation Army Navy, meanwhile, is busy expanding its amphibious warfare capabilities, most prominently by constructing the powerful new Type 075 class of big-deck amphibious assault ship. In recent weeks, Taiwan has also revealed other military training drills intended to increase survivability during a potential invasion from the mainland, including urban warfare maneuvers by the Republic of China Army during the Combat Readiness Week exercises, which you can read more about here . U.S. MARINE CORPS Beyond all this, the rare official confirmation of U.S. special operations forces training in Taiwan goes to show how the U.S. government under the Trump administration has increasingly shown its support for Taiwan in more visible ways. The U.S. stance has included sending warships and aircraft through the Taiwan Strait and approving significant arms sales to the Taiwanese military, and Beijing has not surprisingly taken a dim view of all these developments. Now, the acknowledgment that the Marine Raider Regiment has also been training on the island is the latest expression of this increasingly open military relationship that is bound to antagonize the powers that be in Beijing. UPDATE: 11/11/2020 The Pentagon has pushed back against reports that U.S. Marine Corps Raiders are training in Taiwan. Pentagon spokesman John Supple told Stars and Stripes on Nov. 11, 2020, that these reports were “inaccurate,” but declined to elaborate. He also underscored that “the United States remains committed to our One-China Policy,” which recognizes the government in Beijing as the sole legitimate authority in China. He made no apparent mention of the U.S. government’s continued relationship with the government in Taiwan under the authority granted by the Taiwan Relations Act. For its part, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense has declined to further confirm or deny these reports, which now includes a story from Taiwan’s government-owned Central News Agency .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",Army Offers Glimpse Of New Low-Cost Surface-To-Air Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has released what appears to be one of the first images of a prototype low-cost surface-to-air missile following a successful flight test. The weapon is primarily designed to provide a defense against unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles , but could also engage fixed and rotary wing aircraft in certain envelopes. It is intended to be cheaper to employ than the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, but has a greater range and is otherwise far more capable than the shoulder-fired Stinger man-portable air defense system, or MANPADS. The Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s (CCDC) Aviation and Missile Center announced the successful flight test on Twitter on Nov. 9, 2020. The social media post did not say when or where the service had fired the missile or offer any additional details about the test parameters. This is not the first flight test of this missile under what is formally known as the Low-Cost Extended Range Air Defense ( LOWER-AD ) program. However, the accompanying picture the Army released, seen at the top of this story and below, showed a yellow band on the forward portion of the missile body, which typically indicates the presence of a live high-explosive warhead, as well as a brown one at the center, generally used to mark the location of a missile’s rocket motor. All this suggests that this may have been one of the first tests of a fully-functional prototype against an actual target of some kind. A photograph the US Army released along with its announcement of the recent LOWER-AD flight test., US Army “LOWER AD will conduct a flight test in fiscal year 2021, using various targets at extended ranges to demonstrate Level 6 maturity of the technology,” CCDC had said in September 2019. The 2021 Fiscal Year began on Oct. 1. The Army’s most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year had also said that its plans for the previous fiscal cycle had included integrating the “motor, airframe, mission computer, power supply, telemetry, and data link as an interceptor for demonstrating initial capability in two Ballistic Test Vehicle (BTV) flight tests.” There is notably no mention of a warhead with regards to those flight tests. It’s also not clear who the U.S. Army is working with on the development of the missile. It does have some visual similarities to concept art Raytheon has previously released of its Peregine , a small air-to-air missile derived from the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), but we no indication that there is a relationship of any kind between the two weapons. Concept art of Raytheon’s Peregrine air-to-air missile., Raytheon We do know that the service has conducted other flight testing in support of the LOWER-AD program since at least 2018, when it carried out “successful Launch Test Vehicle flight tests to verify operation of the launcher testbed and validate predictive dynamic models,” according to one CCDC document . The program, as a whole, has been ongoing since at least 2012 . The stated goal at that time was to develop an air defense interceptor that would have a range of more than 25 kilometers, or over 15.5 miles, and be able to knock down fixed and rotary wing aircraft and large artillery rockets, as well as drones and cruise missiles. The missile would be cued using existing Army radars and use an active seeker of an unspecified type to home in on its target in the terminal phase of flight. The hope was that the weapon would be able to do this all while costing less than $150,000 “per kill.” It’s not clear what the current projected unit cost of the LOWER-AD interceptor is, but, for comparison, the Army said it expected to pay just over $3.85 million for each of 122 examples of the latest PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors for its Patriot systems in its 2021 Fiscal Year budget request. A briefing slide from 2012 regarding the LOWER-AD program., US Army Various interceptors for Patriot have demonstrated their ability to knock down targets representing subsonic cruise missiles and lower-end unmanned aerial vehicles, but at a significant expense compared to that of the incoming threat. “That quadcopter that cost 200 bucks from Amazon.com did not stand a chance against a Patriot,” now-retired Army General David G. Perkins, then commander of the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), said during a speech in 2017, underscoring the cost disparity. Perkins was referring to a then-recent intercept that an unspecified “ally,” possibly Israel, had carried out using that surface-to-air missile system. A picture showing the launch of a PAC-3 interceptor during a test., US Army The concern has long been that during an actual conflict, it could become exorbitantly expensive for the Army to intercept waves of incoming cruise missiles or swarms of unmanned aircraft using Patriot alone. Smaller, cheaper interceptors, such as LOWER-AD, could also offer Army units valuable additional magazine depth when dealing with large groups of threats. “The LOWER AD technology will make it possible to reduce the size of the missile, which in turn will allow more missiles per launcher,” the Army said in 2019. “Internal components of the LOWER AD missile technology will include improved navigation and a low-cost seeker and warhead, which will maximize its capability to protect defended areas and troops.” LOWER-AD is just one of a multitude of efforts the Army , along with the other branches of the U.S. military , is working on now, including using 155mm self-propelled howitzers to shoot down cruise missiles , to make up for the fact that shorter-range and lower-tier air defense capabilities quickly atrophied across all of the services after the end of the Cold War. You can read about these somewhat dire circumstances in more detail in this past War Zone piece . This has come as the U.S. military, as a whole, has sought to reorient itself to be more prepared for potential high-end conflicts against major adversaries, such as Russia and China, who are developing increasingly more capable drone and cruise missile technology . https://youtube.com/watch?v=0QqomuuAeQ4 Of course, small drones and lower-end cruise missiles are also increasingly proliferating to smaller countries and even non-state actors . All this has underscored the threat these weapons pose to American troops on the battlefield , as well as in garrison , especially at bases overseas, not to mention to other sensitive targets outside of a conventional conflict . These are issues that the War Zone has been exploring and highlighting for years now . LOWER-AD is also set to form the top end of a future Army layered shorter-range air defense architecture that also includes a number of other gun, missile , and directed energy-based systems meant to counter a variety of threats, ranging from fixed and rotary wing aircraft to artillery rockets, shells, and mortar bombs. The latter mission set is typically referred to as Counter Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars, or C-RAM. The service’s primary C-RAM system at present is Centurian, a ground-based version of the U.S. Navy’s Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), which features a 20mm Vulcan cannon . A graphic showing how the Army sees LOWER-AD in the context of a larger, layered shorter-range air and missile defense architecture. Also included are laser-based directed energy weapons in the form of the High Energy Laser-Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator (HEL-TVD) and Multi-Mission High-Energy Laser (MMHEL), as well as the multi-purpose Maneuver Air Defense Technology (MADT) effort and the Ballistic Low Altitude Drone Engagement (BLADE) system, a derivative of the Army’s Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)., US Army In October, the Army also received the first of two batteries worth of the Israeli-made Iron Dome system , which is primarily geared toward the C-RAM mission. However, the service had initially decided to acquire these systems primarily to satisfy interim cruise missile defense requirements. This demand had become more pronounced with its separate decision to cancel work on its Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) system, a truck-mounted system that was to be capable of firing various kinds of air and missile defense interceptors to respond to a variety of threats. A truck-mounted launcher unit that was among the initial tranche Iron Dome systems delivered to the US Army., Israeli Ministry of Defense However, the Army subsequently halted those plans over concerns about whether Iron Dome could adequately defend against these threats, as well as issues relating to integrating the systems with its over-arching Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network architecture, which you can read about in more detail in this recent War Zone feature . It’s unclear how the two batteries it has already agreed to buy will now be integrated into the service’s overall air and missile defense force structure plans. On top of all that, the Army recently announced plans to acquire a ground-launched version of the U.S. Navy’s SM-6 missile , ostensibly as a medium-range surface-to-surface weapon. However, the existing variants of this missile have air and missile defense capabilities , as well, which might lead to their future inclusion into its integrated air defense plans. LOWER-AD, and the recent successful test of a prototype interceptor, represents another important push to develop a low-cost air and missile defense interceptor that could fill a critical gap between Patriot and lower-end short-range air defense systems.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 27, 2020",Here’s Exactly What’s In America’s Massive Advanced Weapons Deal With The UAE,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After weeks of reports that the U.S. government has been planning to sign off on the possible sale of various aircraft, including F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and MQ-9B drones , as well as other weapons and military equipment, to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it has now formally approved three major proposed arms deals. These packages include up to 50 F-35As, 18 MQ-9Bs, and a multitude of air-delivered munitions, such as stealthy AGM-154E Joint Stand-Off Weapon-Extended Range cruise missiles, as well as other ancillary items, all valued at nearly $23.4 billion in total. The U.S. military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) officially announced that the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sales on Nov. 9, 2020. There is still a need for Congress to grant its own approval for the deals. These various approvals also do not reflect a finalized agreement by the United Arab Emirates and exactly what that country decides to purchase, and what it will cost, could be subject to change in the future. “This is in recognition of our deepening relationship and the UAE’s need for advanced defense capabilities to deter and defend itself against heightened threats from Iran,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement prior to the posting of the DSCA announcements. “The UAE’s historic agreement to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to positively transform the region’s strategic landscape.” Full descriptions of the contents of the three possible sales are as follows: “The Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has requested to buy up to fifty (50) F-35A Joint Strike Fighter Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) aircraft and fifty-four (54) Pratt & Whitney F-135 Engines (up to 50 installed and 4 spares).

As had previously been reported, the package includes up to 50 Joint Strike Fighters, which the UAE has been interested in acquiring for years now . An F-35A Joint Strike Fighter, USAF Of the additional items mentioned therein, it is important to note that this sale would include Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN), the replacement for the much-maligned Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). ODIN, like ALIS before it, is the “computer brain” behind the F-35A and consists of a cloud-based network supporting hardware at bases, as well as in the jets themselves, which is used for everything from maintenance and logistics management tasks to mission planning and debriefing. You can read more about ALIS and ODIN in these previous War Zone pieces . The War Zone has previously explored in-depth how ODIN could be at the core of various export controls designed to limit any potential risks of a UAE Joint Strike Fighter fleet to Israel. If the UAE does ultimately acquire these F-35As, it will be the first country in the Middle East beyond Israel to receive approval to do so. The U.S. government had long opposed the sale of any Joint Strike Fighters to other countries in the region in order to meet a legally-mandated requirement to preserve Israel’s so-called Qualitative Military Edge (QME) in that part of the world. Talk of the possible sale of F-35s to the UAE following the signing of the Abraham Accords in September quickly became a major source of controversy within Israel. Those concerns have increasingly appeared to have been tempered in recent weeks with talk of various assurances from the United States that the deal will not negatively impact Israel’s national security interests. “The proposed sale will make the UAE even more capable and interoperable with U.S. partners in a manner fully consistent with America’s longstanding commitment to ensuring Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge,” Pompeo said in his statement. The possibility of other arms sales to the UAE had been much less of an issue for Israel. The DSCA notices still provide important insight into those prospective deals, though. It had previously been unclear exactly what the configuration might be for the MQ-9Bs, which is a variant of the U.S. Air Force’s MQ-9A Reaper. We now know that the drones being offered to the UAE, at least in part, would be configured in much the same way as their American counterparts, armed with Hellfire missiles and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bombs, as well as examples now entering service with the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF). A UK Royal Air Force Protector drone. Protector is that country’s name for General Atomics SkyGuardian variant of the MQ-9B, which is similar in configuration to at least of the drones the UAE could receive in the future. , Crown Copyright However, the package also very notable includes maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare systems, including maritime surface search radars and sonobuoy launchers. It’s not clear how many of the MQ-9Bs would be in this configuration, but it would offer new and important over-water capabilities to the UAE, which you can read about more in the War Zone ‘s recent reporting on this prospective drone sale. An artist’s conception of an MQ-9B configured for maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare missions with a surface search radar and underwing sonobuoy launchers., General Atomics This proposed MQ-9B sale also notably comes after the U.S. government decided to reinterpret various provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) arms control pact to make it easier to export higher-end drones. With the Air Force, the largest Reaper operator, looking to halt purchases of those unmanned aircraft and replace that fleet , this deal could also be an important windfall for the manufacturer, General Atomics. The aerial munitions package is the one that there had been the least previous reporting on and is absolutely massive in size and scope. Since the proposed F-35 deal includes no weapons, it appears that these are at least partially intended for those jets and would provide the UAE with a full range of air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance for those aircraft. One of the most notable components of this possible deal is 50 AGM-154E Joint Stand-Off Weapon-Extended Ranges (JSOW-ER), a powered cruise missile version of the stealthy JSOW glide bomb family, which you can read about in more detail in these previous War Zone pieces . The UAE already had stocks of earlier AGM-154 variants, which provide an important standoff capability, especially in the suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, a mission set commonly referred to collectively as SEAD/DEAD. An AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb. The UAE is now in line to buy the powered cruise missile version of this weapon, known as the JSOW-ER., MKFI via Wikimedia It’s not clear if the Emiratis already have the AGM-154C-1 variant, which has an imaging infrared seeker that also gives it a demonstrated anti-ship capability, or could receive it as part of this new package. Regardless, the JSOW-ER offers the ability to conduct those kinds of strikes at significantly greater ranges than its unpowered predecessor. There 150 AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles (AARGM) in the package, also primarily intended for suppression of enemy air defenses. These missiles are capable of carrying out time-sensitive strikes against other fleeting targets, as well, using their multi-mode guidance system, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone piece . The arms package also includes a huge lot of 802 AIM-120C-8 variants of the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). This version of the AMRAAM has some of the improvements found on the more substantially upgraded AIM-120D variant , including a two-way datalink that allows third-party targeting. However, it does not have the extended range of the D, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Still, those missiles would give the UAE significant new air-to-air capabilities. This prospective deal also includes very large numbers of multiple types of precision-guided bombs, as well. A basic breakdown of what the UAE could be in line to buy in that regard is as follows: 2,500 250-pound-class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) 2,004 500-pound-class Mk 82 bombs and 2,000 associated Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits 1,002 1,000-pound-class Mk 83 bombs and 1,000 associated Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits 1,000 2,000-pound-class Mk 84 bombs and 1,000 associated Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits It’s worth noting that the UAE’s fleet of F-16E/F Desert Falcons , some of the most advanced versions of the F-16 series in service today, should be able to carry all of these weapons, as well. Together with the F-35s, this would give the Emiratis a very impressive combat jet mix. The United States clearly sees all three deals as both a reward for UAE’s agreement to normalize relations with Israel and a major boost to that country’s military capabilities, with which it could further challenge mutual regional adversaries, chiefly Iran. “Our adversaries, especially those in Iran, know this and will stop at nothing to disrupt this shared success,” Pompeo said in his statement. Of course, it remains to be seen whether Congress will ultimately approve these deals and whether a new presidential administration under Joe Biden, which seems increasingly inevitable despite legal challenges to the recent election from President Donald Trump’s campaign team, might alter these proposed sales in some way. A number of legislators have, in the past, been extremely critical of arms sales and other military support to the UAE over its involvement in the conflict in Yemen. In addition, a representative of the Biden campaign team had previously said there might be a future reexamination of the F-35 sale, specifically, if he were to win the election, as it appears he has done now. If any of these sales, especially the F-35 deal, do come to pass, it could have ramifications for further arms deals in the region. Saudi Arabia, notably, has also expressed interest in buying Joint Strike Fighters in the past, though it has not yet normalized relations with Israel. No matter what happens, the Trump Administration, which will continue to serve at least through Jan. 20, 2021, is clearly seeking to push ahead with the sales of state-of-the-art aircraft and other weapons and military equipment to the UAE.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 25, 2021",Germany Axes Plan To Buy Either Sikorsky CH-53K Or Boeing CH-47 Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a surprise development, Germany has, for the time being, ditched its plans to buy a new heavy-lift helicopter, after Boeing’s CH-47F Chinook and Sikorsky’s CH-53K King Stallion were both judged too expensive. This means that the German Luftwaffe’s aging CH-53G series helicopters will have to soldier on in service for the immediate future, at least. The German Ministry of Defense’s cancelation of the tendering procedure for the Schwerer Transporthubschrauber (STH) program, German for Heavy Transport Helicopter, was announced on September 29, 2020. An official statement , in German only, explained the reason for the termination of the process: “In the context of the ongoing tender, it was recognized that realization of the project within the planned financial framework and simultaneous fulfillment of all requirements is unlikely,” it reads, according to The War Zone ’s translation. “The awarding authority of the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support assessed the offers presented as uneconomical and for this reason, canceled the award procedure.” While the German Ministry of Defense says it still aims to replace the existing CH-53G “in a timely manner” it admits that the project now needs to be “reexamined” and this will inevitably have an impact on the previous planning. The goal had been to award a contract for new helicopters in 2021. Berlin had received offers from both Boeing and Sikorsky, for the CH-47F Chinook and CH-53K King Stallion, respectively. According to unconfirmed reports in the German media, both submissions were almost twice as expensive as expected. The first new CH-47F Chinook is delivered to the Royal Netherlands Air Force at Boeing’s Philadelphia production facility in April 2020., FRED TROILO/BOEING A CH-53K King Stallion is prepared for a mission from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, in January 2020., LOCKHEED MARTIN Back in March 2019, it was reported that the government in Berlin was to allocate $1.8 billion under its budget plan to pay for the new helicopters. This earmarked the STH as one of the “mandatory elements” within the country’s defense expenditure until 2023. In the longer term, the program was expected to cost approximately $4.54 billion. Clearly, priority status was not enough to ensure the safety of the STH program, which had been expected to result in the acquisition of 45-60 helicopters. In the meantime, the Luftwaffe might face an uphill struggle in keeping its existing CH-53G fleet flying, despite successive upgrades. These rotorcraft first entered service in 1972. In May 2019 it emerged that, of a total of 71 CH-53Gs assigned to the Luftwaffe, an average of 48.5 aircraft were available , the others being used for test and evaluation work or undergoing maintenance with industry. Of this 48.5 figure, however, only an average of 21.8 helicopters were judged ready for operations. The first of 112 CH-53Gs entered service as a German equivalent of the U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D Sea Stallion, which that latter service retired in 2012 . Since its introduction in the German military, efforts have been made to keep the CH-53G operationally relevant, beginning with the CH-53GS variant, 20 of which were provided with instrument flight rules (IFR) capability, external fuel tanks, a flight deck compatible with night-vision goggles (NVGs), and electronic warfare self-protection equipment. This work was completed in 2002. Next in the line of upgrades was the CH-53GE, which featured the same improvements as the CH-53GS, with the exception of additional internal fuel tanks for a further increase in range. A CH-53GE pumps out flares during a training mission in the Oberlausitz region of Germany., BUNDESWEHR/CARSTEN VENNEMANN Between 2006 and 2015, 40 aircraft underwent improvements that brought them up to CH-53GA status, work addressing navigation and communications systems as well as the self-protection suite. More recently, there has been an effort to manage obsolescence issues facing the fleet as a whole. A total of 26 aircraft — 20 CH-53GS, and six CH-53GE models — were earmarked for further improvements , to be implemented in Germany by Airbus Helicopters at a rate of six aircraft per year, beginning in 2018. The rotorcraft are getting revisions to their flight control, navigation, and communications systems. The revised cockpit features multifunctional displays, a new radar altimeter, and a full autopilot system. Final deliveries of the re-worked helicopters are due in 2022 and the conversion work is expected to allow the CH-53 to remain in service until around 2030. The effort to replace the CH-53G had already run into some problems after its official launch in December 2017, at which point the CH-47 and CH-53K were identified as the only candidates. At this stage, it was expected that the tender would be issued in September 2018 and a contract for the winning helicopter would be signed by mid-2020. Further details of the prospective timeline included first deliveries in 2023 and a declaration of operational capability by 2026. However, the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support only began the tender procedure in February 2019, almost six months later than planned. The delay was a result of the STH not having initially been included in the government’s defense budget, and a spending commitment was not made until November 2019. Both U.S. contractors submitted their initial proposals to the STH bidding before the deadline of January 13, 2020. There were other problems seemingly “built in” to the program too, including an aspiration from the Bundeswehr to have an aircraft capable of demanding combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions, apparently at odds with the original plan to acquire an affordable off-the-shelf transport helicopter. Other potential pitfalls that could have increased program costs included a requirement for European civilian aviation certification, specific radio communications systems, and a more capable weather radar than that used in the CH-53K. Both prime contractors had built up industry teams involving local partners. The Boeing teaming envisaged collaboration with AERO-Bildungs GmbH, Aircraft Philipp, CAE Elektronik GmbH, COTESA, Diehl Defence, Honeywell, Liebherr-Aerospace, Reiser Simulation and Training GmbH, Rockwell Collins, and Rolls-Royce. The Sikorsky offer, meanwhile, included Rheinmetall, MTU Aero Engines, Autoflug, and Hydro Systems. The German military’s long use of the CH-53G might have been a reason to view the CH-53K as the favorite in the competition, but the King Stallion has suffered from its fair share of developmental woes and was considered the more expensive option. Meanwhile, although the CH-53K can carry a heavier cargo load than the CH-47, the dimensions of its cargo hold are smaller, requiring bulkier items to be carried as underslung loads . Now, having rejected the two candidates on cost grounds, it would appear that the most likely outcome will be a restructuring of the STH program and, accordingly, a reduction in the number of aircraft to be purchased. A more ambitious option — such as launching the development of a new heavy-lift helicopter within Europe, an idea discussed between France and Germany in the past — would seem unrealistic, based on the requirement to replace the last of the CH-53Gs before 2030. Green Party defense spokesman Tobias Lindner pointed to the problems inherent in continuing to fly the old CH-53Gs: “The continued operation of outdated systems is time-consuming and very expensive. The ministry approached the procurement project in a completely naive way.” The high priority that was assigned to the STH program reflects the fact that the Luftwaffe’s CH-53G fleet has been involved in critical combat missions in Afghanistan and Africa in recent years. The type also has an important role domestically, including firefighting and disaster response. A CH-53G is prepared for transport to Afghanistan on board an An-124-100 cargo aircraft, at Berlin-Tegel Airport in 2011., BUNDESWEHR/SEBASTIAN WILKE Despite previous promises to invest in defense, Germany is facing serious budgetary constraints as the financial realities of the coronavirus crisis begin to bite. As such, the STH might not be the last big-ticket program to face cancelation or at least restructuring. The German Defense Ministry has said it remains wedded to procuring a replacement for the CH-53G, but the project now requires a complete overhaul. For now, at least, the ministry’s alternative remains unclear. Contact the author: thomas@the drive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air CH-47 CH-53K H-47 H-53 Helicopters"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2021",China Deployed Bombers To One Of Its South China Sea Islands For The First Time According To Photo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new photo indicates that China has deployed at least one H-6J missile-carrying bomber to Woody Island in the northern portion of the South China Sea for the first time ever. If confirmed, the forward-deployment of Chinese heavy aviation assets there would be a significant addition to the forces the country already has in the region and could present new challenges for potential opponents in the region, such as the United States. One of the first mentions of the apparent deployment was on the Chinese Military Aviation blog , which said only that it took place in August 2020. A photo subsequently emerged online showing ground crew attending to an unarmed H-6J apparently soon after it arrived at Woody Island, which is located around 200 miles south of Hainan Island . While it’s not been possible to verify the date of the image, it certainly appears to have been taken at this location. It’s also not clear whether this was the only H-6J to touch down on Woody Island or if it is part of a group of bombers that made the trip. Regardless, actually landing at the island outpost is a significant development that could point to plans for more regular deployments in the future. Back in May 2018, a People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) H-6K made what looked like a touch-and-go landing at Woody Island. This earlier mission indicated that the base was capable of handling larger aircraft, although there’s no evidence that the twin-jet aircraft actually landed on that occasion. If true, the introduction now of some kind of bomber presence at Woody Island — even if it’s just irregular visits by small numbers of aircraft — should be seen as part of Beijing’s wider anti-access, area-denial strategy for the South China Sea, which is one of the world’s most important shipping corridors as well as a rich fishing ground and a potential source of energy. Heavy airpower, combined with ground-based air defenses and anti-ship missiles on various island outposts, only gives China increasing options to curtail the ability of foreign militaries, especially the United States , to operate freely in the region. An aerial view of Woody Island, dominated by its runway., Google Earth Although derived from the Cold War-era Soviet Tu-16 Badger, the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) H-6J is one of the most modern bombers in the PLA inventory. It’s a naval version of the PLAAF H-6K , which features an entirely revised airframe, more efficient turbofan engines, and the potential to carry up to six long-range cruise missiles. Compared with earlier H-6s, the J model can be distinguished by its airliner-style nose, lacking the previous glazing, and enlarged engine air intakes. This naval variant entered service in late 2018 and it can carry up to six YJ-12 heavyweight anti-ship missiles. The YJ-12 is a supersonic weapon powered by a rocket/ramjet engine and capable of a speed of around Mach 2.5 to 3.5. Carrying a 500-pound warhead, some sources assume that it was tailored for use against high-value warships including aircraft carriers. The apparent appearance of the H-6J also reflects the ongoing militarization of Woody Island. Part of the Paracel Islands chain, a group of around 30 islands and many more 100 reefs, banks, and other maritime features, Woody Island — known to China as Yongxing Island — is already established as a forward operating base for PLA aircraft. Back in January 2015, the first images appeared of armed PLAN J-11 Flanker fighters operating from a newly reconstructed runway and aviation support facilities. The Flankers provide a defensive umbrella that extends to cover Taiwan’s Dongsha Islands to the north, most of Vietnam to the west, the Philippines in the east, and down towards the Spratly Island archipelago. In addition to the detachments of J-11s, it is also known to host BZK-005H drones. A PLANAF J-11 Flanker fighter jet deployed to Woody Island in 2015., VIA TWITTER In addition to supporting aviation operations, Woody Island also provides a port for Chinese naval, coast guard, and fishing vessels, while the location’s military presence extends to a signals intelligence (SIGINT) facility and a radar station covering the northern portion of the South China Sea. In February 2016, it was confirmed that China was taking steps to further bolster defenses on Woody Island when it deployed a pair of HQ-9 surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries there . Broadly similar to the Russian S-300 , the HQ-9 has an active electronically scanned array radar and its missiles reportedly have an engagement range of between 100 and 125 miles. In June-July 2019, Woody Island was also involved in tests of Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles of an undisclosed type as part of a wider exercise. China issued Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) for two areas in the South China Sea, one of them covering an area stretching from the Chinese island of Hainan to the Paracel Island chain, including Woody Island. It seems likely that one or more anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from the Chinese mainland, apparently testing another option for targeting high-value shipping in the South China Sea. Beyond just reinforcing the PLA’s position around Woody Island itself, deploying bombers there also allows the Chinese military to extend long-range heavy aerial firepower further south, where China has been busily building artificial outposts in the disputed Spratly Islands. This includes at Fiery Cross Reef, which has a 10,000-foot runway also capable of supporting bombers. In May 2018, it was confirmed that China had deployed both HQ-9B SAMs and ground-launched YJ-12B anti-ship missiles on Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, and Subi Reef. A map showing the location of various Chinese island outposts in the Spratly Island chain., DOD The reported H-6J deployment itself comes in the middle of a noticeable uptick in military aviation and naval activity in the region, in general, by Chinese and other militaries. Just last week, Chinese Su-30 Flankers conducted a long-range mission to the Spratly Islands. Taiwanese F-16s armed with live Harpoon missiles also conducted a patrol in the northern end of the South China Sea. This followed reports that Chinese forces will soon conduct an exercise simulating an operation to capture the Taiwan-administered Dongsha Islands in that region. There has been a clear increase in American intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and maritime patrol aircraft operating in the area in recent weeks, as well. Some of this coincided with major naval exercises, including a rare event involving two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and another large drill in which Australian and Japanese ships also took part. This is all on top of steady U.S. Air Force bomber sorties in the South China Sea , as well as elsewhere in the Pacific , including flights from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam , some of which is clearly intended to be signal to China. Should tensions here escalate to the point of conflict, Beijing could now be able to project heavy air power across the region, preventing foreign forces from entering. While the deployment of the H-6J to Woody Island remains unconfirmed, it might only be a matter of time before we start to see PLA bombers and heavy missile-carriers operating routinely from bases in the South China Sea.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 26, 2021",Video Indicates Armenia Has Fired Its Russian-Made Iskander Ballistic Missiles At Azerbaijan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged on social media showing what appears to be the first instance of Armenia firing its Russian-made Iskander ballistic missiles at Azerbaijani forces. This represents a major escalation in the conflict between the two countries , which erupted in September and is primarily over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region . At the same time, the clip appeared just hours before an increasingly embattled Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced he had signed to a Russian-brokered ceasefire deal, which will reportedly lead to major concessions to Azerbaijan. It’s not clear when the footage of the apparent Iskander launch was shot, but it first appeared online earlier today. While the video quality is low and the transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) and missile are hard to make out, all the evidence points to Iskander, rather than Armenia’s Soviet-era Tochka and Scud ballistic missiles . Most notably, the TEL in the clip fires two missiles in relatively quick succession. The TELs for the Tochka and Scud missiles only carry one weapon at a time. Armenia has already employed Tochka and Scud missiles against Azerbaijani forces, but, despite threats to do so dating back to September, had held off from using its Iskanders. These are its newest and most capable short-range ballistic missiles, which it acquired from Russia in 2016. To date, Armenia is the only country to have purchased the export variant of this weapon system, known as the Iskander-E. It features versions of the missile with a reduced range of around 174 miles to comply with the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) arms control pact, to which Russia is a party. An Armenian transporter-erector-launcher for the Iskander-E ballistic missile seen on parade in the country’s capital Yerevan in 2017. , Jonj7490 via Wikimedia Azerbaijan also has its own Tockhas, as well as Israeli-made Long Range Attack (LORA) ballistic missiles. Azerbaijani forces employed LORA for the first time operationally in October , becoming the first country to fire one of these missiles in anger anywhere in the world. Fighting first broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan in late September in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region , which lies between the two countries. These former Soviet republics had gone to war over control of this area before the collapse of the Soviet Union. A ceasefire agreement in 1994 had left the self-declared Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh in de facto control of the region, though the international community widely accepts it to be part of Azerbaijan. Major skirmishes have broken out in the region over the years, but the latest conflict has led to missile and artillery strikes in parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan proper, including the indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas,. A map showing disputed borders areas under direct Armenian and Azerbaijani control, as well as Nagorno-Karabakh, the home of the Republic of Artsakh, prior to the outbreak of the latest conflict in September 2020., via Wikimedia Besides the apparent Iskander launches, today had already been something of a whirlwind day in the conflict, with Azerbaijan already admitting to shooting down a Russian Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunship as it flew near the border of its geographically separated Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to the southwest of Armenia. Azerbaijani authorities subsequently said it was a case of mistaken identity and have offered condolences to the families of the two Russian personnel who died in the incident, as well as compensation payments. Azerbaijani forces also declared they had taken control of Shusha , Nagorno-Karabakh’s second-largest city, today. This underscores the significant advances Azerbaijan has made in its campaign to retake the region in the past five weeks or so. Armenian and Armenian-backed forces have suffered notable losses in that time, as well, in both men and materiel , especially to strikes by Azerbaijani armed drones and loitering munitions , also known as “ suicide drones .” The use of the Iskanders after weeks of fighting would seem to have been another unequivocal escalation in the conflict, had they not come ahead of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s announcement via Facebook that he had signed a deal with Azerbaijan to end the conflict. Russia, one of Armenia’s chief allies, had helped craft this agreement, the first parts of which were reportedly supposed to have gone into effect as of midnight tonight, Moscow time. “The text of the statement that has already been published is unbelievably painful for me and our people. I made that decision as a result of a deep analysis of the military situation and appreciation of the people who have the best possession of the situation,” Pashinyan wrote. “It’s not a victory, but there’s no defeat until you know yourself. We will never know ourselves and this should be the start of our national unity, rebirth era.” A reported Russian-language copy of the text of the agreement has been circulating online and notably includes provisions that say that Armenia will abide by existing United Nations resolutions that have declared Nagorno-Karabakh to be an integral part of Azerbaijan’s territory. There is reportedly a timeline for the transfer of various parts of the region to Azerbaijani control starting on Nov. 15 and running through Dec. 1. Armenia is also set to turn over control of ethnic Armenian villages in the Azerbaijani district of Qazax, which have also been under Yerevan’s control for decades now. Russian peacekeepers will patrol a buffer zone along the so-called Lachin Corridor, a mountain passage that forms the shortest route between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, for the next five years under the peace plan. Besides a prisoner swap, there are no apparent calls for any significant concessions on Azerbaijan’s part. Now, it very much remains to be seen how this peace deal may fare in the near future. Three previous ceasefires, including ones brokered by Russia and the United States, all collapsed shortly after they first took effect. There were reports shortly after Pashinyan’s statement went up on Facebook of explosions in the Azerbaijani capital Baku. So far the apparent blasts remain unexplained and they came well after the Iskander launches. At least based on its publicly reported range, the Iskander-E also simply does not have the range to reach Baku from Armenian territory. Pashinyan, who had already been the target of increasing criticism over his handling of the conflict, now appears to be in a particularly precarious position despite his calls for national unity. Video has already begun to emerge of protesters converging on his official residence and some 17 opposition political parties in the country have called for his resignation . If he is deposed or otherwise forced from office, it is not at all clear if whatever administration comes next will necessarily honor the Kremlin-backed deal with Azerbaijan. Pashinyan certainly appears to have had no good options available to him, especially after Russia looks to have declined the Armenian Prime Minister’s formal request for unspecified security assistance on Oct. 31. Russia and Armenia are both members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) bloc, which includes collective security provisions. However, the Kremlin had said it had no intention of intervening in the conflict unless Armenia itself came under threat, seemingly ignoring increasing Azerbaijani artillery and missile strikes on Armenian territory. If there’s any silver-lining for Pashinyan’s deal it is that it cut out Turkey, Azerbaijan’s primary benefactor, and puts Russian troops in a critical junction between the two countries. That being said, if experience in recent years in Syria is any indication , this is still no guarantee against further flare-ups over any residual territorial disputes that may remain if the peace deal does go into effect as planned. The agreement still raises very real concerns about the possibility of ethnic cleansing of Armenians in areas ceded to Azerbaijan, as well. There have already been multiple reports of potential war crimes since the conflict began, including videos purporting to show Azerbaijani forces executing Armenian troops . All told, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia do appear to have made a new and significant push to try to end this conflict, but it remains to be seen if it’s a peace that all the parties will be able to live with.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 30, 2021",This May Be Our First Glimpse Of China’s New Air-Launched Anti-Radiation Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An image that appeared over the weekend appears to show, for the first time, a new anti-radiation missile, which would primarily be used to destroy hostile radars, intended to arm Chinese combat jets. Two of the missiles are seen under the wings of a People’s Liberation Army Air Force J-11BS Flanker two-seat multirole fighter jet as it takes off. While there is no information about how this new missile might work or the kind of performance that might be expected, a typical anti-radiation missile (ARM) functions by homing in on radio-frequency emissions from hostile surface-to-air radar systems. Typically, these weapons require high speed in order to ensure they can hit their target before it switches off its radar. Andreas Rupprecht, a Chinese military aerospace expert and friend of The War Zone who tweets as @RupprechtDeino , was among the first to highlight it and has said he thinks it is China’s new anti-radiation missile, noting that its appearance has been “long expected.” The original source of the image is a brief clip in a recent People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) pilot recruitment video that was then posted to Facebook by a user named @柳成梁. The fact that the tail fins of the J-11BS are obscured means it’s not possible to determine what unit the jet is assigned to, and whether it is from an operational unit, or a test and evaluation outfit. It’s also worth noting that the image also shows, apparently for the first time, a PLAAF J-11BS wearing low-visibility national markings, a trend that now seems to be taking hold among that service’s frontline units. An example of the possible ARM, which appears to be fairly large, is carried under each of the fighter’s wings. The poor quality of the image doesn’t reveal many details of the missile, although it seems to have prominent cruciform fins on its mid-body section and at the rear, very similar to the U.S. military’s AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). Other observers were quick to point out the purported ARM’s similarity to another Chinese-developed ARM, the CM-102 , although this weapon also seems to have some key differences. Notably, the CM-102’s fins are cropped rather than pointed, and the mid-body fins are long and fairly slender. Apart from this, the CM-102 was also developed by China for export — primary for the JF-17 Thunder multirole fighter — and is not known to be in PLAAF service. The new weapon also shares some features with the Indian Rudram-1 ARM that was test-launched from an Indian Air Force (IAF) Su-30MKI Flanker two-seat multirole fighter on October 9, 2020. You can read more about this weapon in this previous War Zone story . Like India, China has relied primarily on Soviet-designed ARMs to equip its aircraft for the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) mission. The most important of these weapons is the Kh-31P, known to NATO as the AS-17 Krypton , and its locally produced version, the YJ-91, or Hongdu YingJi-91. A PLAAF Su-30MKK armed with a pair of YJ-91 anti-radiation missiles., CHINESE INTERNET Moscow agreed to provide China with the blueprints required to develop a version of the Kh-31P in 1994. While the missile’s airframe and engine are thought to be similar to the original, China reportedly adapted the seeker to meet local requirements. However, the basic Kh-31 dates back to the late 1970s and it would make sense for China to be working on a more modern, and fully indigenous, successor. Furthermore, the considerable size of the Kh-31/YJ-91 puts it beyond the capacity of the lighter J-10 multirole fighter, which could potentially carry the new weapon in a SEAD role, much like the U.S. Air Force’s own F-16 “Wild Weasel” force. The PLAAF’s J-16 two-seat multirole fighter — a further development of the J-11BS that is among the most advanced of all Flanker versions — has long been expected to undertake a SEAD and electronic attack role with the air force, and appearance of a new ARM at this stage would not be unexpected. A J-16 was spotted carrying this secretive air-to-air weapon in 2016 and could also be the intended platform for a new anti-radiation missile., CHINESE INTERNET In particular, a new ARM might be expected to arm the J-16D, a dedicated suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), and electronic warfare (EW) version of the J-16. This is thought to be equipped with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with specialized EW modes and also sports wingtip electronic pods thought to be analogous to the AN/ALQ-218 used on the EA-18G Growler . In the past, however, it was anticipated that the new-generation Chinese ARM would either be a version of the CM-102 or an air-to-ground version of the PL-15 air-to-air missile . As a beyond-visual-range weapon, the PL-15 would make a potentially suitable candidate for an ARM derivative, potentially swapping out its air-to-air radar with a passive homing seeker to engage air defense targets and, since the PL-15 is scaled for internal carriage in the stealthy J-20 fighter , an ARM version could equip this jet, too. On the other hand, if the new weapon is indeed an ARM, then it would appear that China has chosen a different development path altogether. Close-up of a J-20 fighter carrying four PL-15 air-to-air missiles in its main ventral bays., CHINESE INTERNET Whatever the case, it seems that ARMs will play an increasingly important role for the PLAAF in the future, especially in light of the developing air defense capabilities among China’s major regional rivals. These include India, whose air defense capabilities include the Russian-supplied S-400 surface-to-air missile, and Taiwan, for which the U.S. government earlier this year approved a possible refresh of its Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. In the meantime, we will have to wait for more imagery before we can confirm that this really is China’s new air-launched radar-killing missile, but the alternative explanations are few in number and far less logical.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 10, 2020",Russian Mi-24 Hind Gunship Shot Down In Armenia Near Border With Azerbaijan (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but the Russian Ministry of Defense says that one of its Mi-24 Hind gunship helicopters has been shot down over Armenia while operating close to the country’s western border with Azerbaijan’s geographically separated Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Kremlin has not yet said who it believes to be responsible. Armenian forces have been fighting an increasingly grueling conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region since the end of September . Video purporting to show the moment a missile hit the Mi-24, as well as images from the crash site, first began to emerge on social media on Nov. 9, 2020. The Russian Ministry of Defense subsequently confirmed the shootdown , which it said was the result of a shoulder-fired man-portable surface-to-air missile system ( MANPADS ), adding that two individuals on board had died in the incident. A third person was seriously injured and medically evacuated from the crash site. The helicopter had been providing an aerial escort for a convoy of Russian troops from the country’s base in Armenia, known as the 102nd Russian Military Base in the city of Gyumri in northwestern Armenia. “On November 9, at about 17:30 Moscow time, a Russian Mi-24 helicopter came under fire from the ground from a man-portable air-defense system when accompanying a vehicle convoy of the 102nd Russian military base on the territory of the Republic of Armenia in the airspace close to the Armenian settlement of Yeraskh near the border with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (the Republic of Azerbaijan),” the Russian Defense Ministry’s statement said. A map showing Gyumri in Armenia, to the north, where Russia’s base in the country is situated, as well as Yeraskh, to the south along the border with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, where the Russian Ministry of Defense says its Mi-24 helicopter was shot down., Google Maps A map showing the general disposition of Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in the region prior to the outbreak of the current conflict in September 2020. The core of Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the de facto control of the self-declared Armenia-backed Republic of Artsakh since a ceasefire agreement between the two countries was established in 1994., via Wikimedia It’s not clear how many people were riding in the helicopter when it came down. The Hind is a unique design with its crew of two seated one behind the other at the front, as is the case with most gunships, but with a small passenger compartment also in the center of the fuselage. The current fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan broke out on Sept. 27, with Azerbaijani forces moving into the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. The two countries, both former Soviet republics, have been fighting over the region since before the collapse of the Soviet Union. A ceasefire agreement brought an end to that initial fighting in 1994, with the self-declared, Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh being the de facto authority in the territory ever since. There have been multiple significant skirmishes between the two sides since then. While the Kremlin has yet to publicly blame anyone for the shootdown and no party in the region has taken responsibility, there is already growing speculation that Azerbaijani forces in Nakhchivan may have been responsible. The incident appears to have taken place at night and Armenia also operates Mi-24s, raising the distinct possibility that troops in the Azerbaijani autonomous region may have believed the helicopter to have been Armenian. Yeraskh is less than five miles from the Armenian border with Nakhchivan. Since the latest conflict over Nagoro-Karabakh first erupted in September, there have been concerns about a potential Russian intervention into the fighting. Armenia is notably a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) bloc, as is Russia, which includes collective security provisions. The Kremlin had previously said that it would not intervene unless Armenia proper came under attack. Azerbaijan has launched artillery and ballistic missile strikes into Armenian territory since then. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan formally asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for unspecified security assistance on Oct. 31, but it’s unclear what support Russia may have provided since then. There were already unconfirmed reports before then that Russian personnel in the country had been assisting the Armenians, including with electronic warfare systems to counter Azerbaijan’s distinct advantage in armed drones and loitering munitions , also called “ suicide drones ,” which have been a major factor in the fighting so far. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, at left, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting in 2018., The Kremlin For its part, Azerbaijan has been receiving significant support from Turkey, which publicly supports its current campaign to recapture Nagorno-Karabakh. A contingent of Turkish Air Force F-16 Vipers have also notably been in that country since July , though it remains unclear if they have taken a direct part in the conflict. Turkey has also facilitated the transport of Syrian militants to the region to fight on behalf of the government in Baku. There are other unconfirmed claims that Turkish special operations forces may be on the ground assisting Azerbaijani forces. If Russia determines Azerbaijani forces were responsible for the shootdown and that the incident was not a case of mistaken identity or some other kind of accident, it could well change the Kremlin’s position on its role in the conflict. This, in turn, would increase the risks of further escalation, especially if Turkey were to become more directly involved. In the meantime, the fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan shows no signs of letting up despite international calls for the two sides to seek a non-violent resolution to the crisis. There have been three failed ceasefire attempts already , each of which has collapsed within 24 hours of the agreed start time. Whatever happens next, the shootdown of the Russian Mi-24 is a dangerous new development in the conflict and underscores the continued risk of it becoming a broader, regional affair. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 1:55pm EST The Azerbaijni Foreign Ministry has now confirmed that its forces shot down the Russian Mi-24 with a MANPADS, but also say that it was case of mistaken identity. “The helicopter was flying in the close vicinity of the Armenian-Azerbaijani state border at the time of active hostilities in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The flight was taking place after dark, at a low altitude, outside the air defense radar detection zone. Helicopters of the Russian Armed Forces had not been detected in said area previously,” Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “In the context of the aforementioned factors and in the light of the tense situation in the region and the high military alert due to possible provocations of the Armenian side, the on-duty operational crew made the decision to use deadly force.” “The Azerbaijani side apologizes to the Russian side over this tragic incident, which was of an accidental nature and was not aimed against the Russian side,” the statement continued. “The Azerbaijani side sends its deepest condolences to the families of the crew members killed in the incident and wishes the soonest recovery to those injured. The Azerbaijani side is ready to pay the corresponding damages.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces Helicopters Mi-24 Russian Air Force"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 6, 2020",The Army Has Officially Selected The Navy’s SM-6 Missile To Be Used In A Strike Role,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as The War Zone had predicted and reported on as recently as two months ago, the U.S. Army has now officially chosen to adopt the Navy’s SM-6 (RIM-174) surface-to-air missile to satisfy its ground-based Mid-Range Capability (MRC) as part of its larger Long-Range Precision Fires initiative . As such, the weapon’s secondary ballistic missile-like surface-to-surface strike capabilities will become a primary capability set for the Army units equipped with it in the future. This will initially be a prototype effort to combine the missile with a fully integrated ground-based fire control and launching system, but barring any unforeseen major setbacks, which are unlikely for a relatively mature off-the-shelf system like SM-6, it will facilitate the fielding of the missile in an operational capacity in 2023. The Navy’s BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile was also selected by the Army to become its staple ground-launched cruise missile in the post-Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF) era. This was all but a given as testing has already begun for introducing this capability, which the Marines are also looking to field in some fashion, and it is similar to the Army’s BGM-109G Gryphon ground-launched derivative of the Tomahawk that was fielded during the twilight of the Cold War. It’s also worth noting that the latest Tactical Tomahawk is far more capable than its predecessors. It can be retargeted mid-flight, it can avoid hostile air defenses, home in on its target using an imaging infrared sensor, and is fully capable of anti-ship operations. Unlike the BGM-109G, this is a conventionally armed weapon as it sits today, though. Gryphon missile launch from its purpose-built mobile launcher. , US Army An official announcement from Redstone Arsenal offers some justification for the award: REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. (November 6, 2020)– The U.S. Army awarded a prototype Other Transaction (OT) agreement to advance its development and delivery of a ground-launched, mid-range fires capability that will enable the United States to deter, and if necessary, defeat near-peer competitors. The Mid-Range Capability (MRC), part of the Army’s number one modernization priority of Long-Range Precision Fires, will be designed to hit targets in the range between the Precision Strike Missile and the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. The MRC prototype, consisting of launchers, missiles, and a battery operations center (BOC), will be fielded to an operational battery in Fiscal Year 2023. The MRC addresses a need identified in the Army’s Fiscal Year 2020 Strategic Fires Study in coordination with Combatant Commanders in key theaters. The Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) will develop and deliver the prototype MRC. “Adapting existing systems as much as possible will allow us to move faster than traditional acquisition methods to get this capability into the hands of Soldiers in support of the National Defense Strategy,” said LTG L. Neil Thurgood, Director of Hypersonics, Directed Energy, Space and Rapid Acquisition, who leads the RCCTO. “Soldier feedback and touchpoints will be embedded throughout the prototyping effort in order to make this system operationally effective the day it is delivered.” On November 6, 2020, the Army awarded the prototype OT agreement on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin in the amount of $339.3 million, inclusive of options. Under this agreement, Lockheed Martin will design, build, integrate, test, evaluate, document, deliver, and support the MRC prototype battery capability. In order to accelerate fielding to meet the FY23 timeline, the MRC prototype will utilize and modify existing hardware and software from the Army and joint service partners, and integrate additional technologies to achieve new operational effects. Following a broad review of joint service technologies potentially applicable to MRC, the Army has selected variants of the Navy SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles to be part of the initial prototype. The Army will leverage Navy contract vehicles for missile procurement in support of the Army integration OT agreement. The MRC will complement other critical systems in the Army’s long range fires portfolio, providing a combined operational and strategic capability that can attack specific threat vulnerabilities in order to penetrate, disintegrate and exploit targets in deep maneuver areas critical to the joint fight. The capability also allows the Army and joint services to synchronize and leverage modernization efforts and investments across mid-range missile programs in support of multi-domain operations. The MRC supports one of the Army’s chief roles in multi-domain operations: to use strategic fires to penetrate and disintegrate enemy layered defense systems, creating windows of opportunity for exploitation by the joint force As to the question of what configuration of the SM-6 will the Army adopt, we have an answer to that thanks to Breaking Defense . The wider form-factor borrowed from the SM-3 Block IIA ballistic missile interceptor, a cousin of the SM-6, will be available in the future. This new SM-6 variant is already under development and will extend the range of the missile, which is already measured in hundreds of miles, and increase its kinetic performance significantly. You can read all about this new SM-6 variant in this past War Zone article . But as it stands now, the MRC capability will initially be fielded with the existing SM-6 the Navy is currently buying with an eye on upgrading to the more capable variant once it is fully developed. We don’t know what type of launcher configuration would be used for a ground-based SM-6, although it could share the one being developed for the ground-launched Tomahawk, as both were originally designed to fit into the Navy’s Mk 41 Vertical Launch System cells. Ground-launched Tomahawk test using a trailer-mounted Mark 41 VLS. , DOD Another huge outstanding question we have is will the Army’s ground-launched SM-6 also leverage its surface-to-air missile capability, which is effective against air-breathing threats like aircraft and cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missiles in their terminal stage of flight. One can imagine just how beneficial this secondary capability could be if it was distributed throughout a theater of war. The Army is introducing a highly integrated air defense architecture that is perfectly suited for enabling such a dual-role system. It could also serve as an offensive command and control system for engaging ground targets with the SM-6, as well. You can read all about the Integrated Battle Command System in this in-depth interview of ours here. So, we may be looking at an enormously flexible capability set the Army is adding that will work far beyond the surface and ground strike roles. The bottom line here is that the Army is racing to get a ground-launched cruise missile (Tomahawk) and a quasi-ballistic missile (SM-6), the latter of which approaches or exceeds hypersonic velocities during its terminal stage of the flight, into service and the Navy just happens to have what it needs. Adapting these proven missile designs and integrating them into the Army’s larger command and control networks and overall strategy not only speeds their entry to service, but it also stands to save massive sums of money. SM-6, DoD There is one other major benefit to these choices. Both programs, SM-6 and Tomahawk, will have another huge customer now. Not only will much larger combined purchases of these weapons lower their unit cost, but it could also significantly accelerate research and development of additional improvements and upgrades for these systems via the sharing of those costs as well. So, there you have it. The Tomahawk will find itself in a U.S. Army ground-based launcher once again and the SM-6 could become one of the most versatile weapons in the service’s entire arsenal.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 16, 2020",Canadian Fighter Pilot Training Company To Buy FA-50 Light Combat Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ITPS Canada Ltd, a commercial provider of tactical aviation training services, is poised to add the two-seat Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 Fighting Eagle light combat aircraft to its roster, with a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Canadian firm and the jet’s manufacturer. The relationship, which ITPS officially announced yesterday, is described as serving to “promote the FA-50 for tactical and adversary training,” but the company plans to eventually entirely replace its legacy Aero Vodochody L-39C Albatros jet trainer fleet with the type. ITPS President Giorgio Clementi told The War Zone that his company plans to buy between eight and 12 examples of the South Korean FA-50 for the advanced training role. Like the Albatross, they will be based in Canada. As well as its five L-39Cs, the company also owns three Aero L-29 Delfins and two Hawker Hunters , all of which would potentially be superseded by the far more capable KA-50s. “The KAI FA-50 is a great aircraft!” Clementi had said in an earlier company press release. “The aircraft’s performance, flying qualities, and mission capabilities make it the ideal platform for tactical and adversary training missions and a great fit for ITPS to replace our L-39 fleet. A new aircraft supported by the manufacturer and with the associated engineering and logistical support ensures reliable and cost-effective operations into the future.” ITPS President Giorgio Clementi (back row, sixth from left) together with instructors and students from the Royal Malaysian Air Force in front of a pair of L-39Cs., ITPS From its base at London International Airport in Ontario, ITPS presently runs its two divisions, the International Test Pilot School, one of only eight fully accredited test pilot schools in the world, and the International Tactical Training Center, or ITTC, which it claims is the only commercial setup currently offering advanced fighter pilot training. Its syllabuses include Fighter Weapons Instructor Courses, Advanced Tactics Courses, and Mission Commander qualifications. ITPS has provided tactical training since 2001 and its ITTC division offers courses tailored to international customers who may either struggle to provide it themselves or require additional expertise or capacity. Currently, clients include the Royal Malaysian Air Force, pilots of which receive Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) at London International. Previous ITPS customers for tactical training include the Indonesian Air Force , the Royal Thai Air Force, and the Pakistan Air Force . Other major ITPS customers come from industry, for example from global aerospace giant Airbus, which recently chose the Canadian firm to provide three years of training for its in-house test pilot and lead flight-test engineers, due to begin in January 2021. As previously noted, the ITTC fleet today is based around the two-seat L-39, a jet trainer that dates back to communist-era Czechoslovakia, when it equipped most Warsaw Pact air forces, as well as others aligned with that bloc. However, the Cold War jet remains in widespread use as a trainer and “red air” adversary aircraft , including in the United States, as it is robust and straightforward to maintain. Just as importantly, it lends itself to avionics upgrades to better represent modern fighter jet cockpits. Four of ITPS’s five L-39Cs have now been equipped with modern touchscreen color cockpit displays. They are slated to receive a head-up display and a Thales helmet-mounted display within the next 12 months. An instructor pilot prepares for a sortie in an ITTC L-39C., ITPS/Eric Dumigan Two of ITTC’s five L-39Cs take off for a training sortie., ITPS/Eric Dumigan An ITTC instructor and his Malaysian student head back for a post-flight briefing., ITPS/Eric Dumigan Two more ITTC L-39Cs outside the hangar at London International Airport, Ontario., ITPS/Eric Dumigan Still, while ITTC’s upgraded L-39Cs will be suitable for the LIFT syllabus, the company has ambitions beyond this aircraft. This explains the new tie-in with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). The future introduction of the FA-50 reflects significant changes within the ITTC, extending beyond LIFT to encompass more complex courses for advanced-level aircrew. Earlier this year, for example, the Royal Thai Air Force signed up for a full Fighter Weapons Instructor Course to begin in 2021. The Thais already operate the T-50 Golden Eagle, from which the FA-50 was derived, and which is optimized for the advanced training role. “We are seeing tremendous growth and potential for [the ITTC] division and pursuing multiple opportunities with international customers,” the company’s President Clementi explained to The War Zone . The Malaysian training deal initially led to ITPS launching its L-39C upgrade, but subsequent customer response and opportunities have led to further enhancements currently in the works. “Based on discussions with current and potential customers it was clear we would have to upgrade to a more modern and capable trainer [than the L-39C] within the next three to five years,” he continued. “The KAI T-50 is known to me and we have had a good relationship with KAI for having trained some of their helicopter test pilots and flight test engineers in the past as well as many Republic of Korea Air Force test pilots and engineers since 2011. KAI was receptive to our proposals and we have worked well with them in developing some of our initiatives centered around the FA-50 version which is equipped with systems that align with our intended use of the aircraft.” To get an idea of the kind of capabilities that the FA-50 can offer, it’s worth looking at its genesis. A further development of the T-50 Golden Eagle and its armed, radar-equipped TA-50 derivative, the FA-50 was tailored from the start for the light combat role, to replace the A-37B Dragonfly and a portion of the F-5E/F Tiger II fleet operated by the Republic of Korea Air Force. Compared to the TA-50, the FA-50 has improved avionics, additional internal fuel capacity, and a radar warning receiver suite. The ROKAF’s FA-50 can carry precision-guided weapons, including the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile and GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The Elta ELM-2032 multimode radar is also a significant advantage of the FA-50, whether for training future fighter pilots or working as an adversary. The pulse-Doppler radar has all-aspect, look-down shoot-down capabilities and, according to the manufacturer, has a range of 120 nautical miles against air or ground targets. The avionics can also be configured to include a data link, which could also have significant benefits, allowing students to practice coordinated tactics and engagements, for example. In terms of flying characteristics, the FA-50 — or rather, its T-50 forebear — was designed using F-16 technology and, according to test pilots, has even better turning performance than the Viper, aided by an airframe that’s rated at +8g and a digital flight control computer. The General Electric F404 engine’s 17,700 pounds of thrust also ensures fighter-like qualities, and the jet has been tested to speeds of up to Mach 1.3. A pair of ROKAF FA-50s., KAI An FA-50 drops a stick of inert bombs over a training range., KAI The FA-50 wing is similar to that of the F-16; while the overall design is smaller and lighter than the Viper, the jet reportedly turns even better., KAI The FA-50 is ultimately a genuine light combat aircraft with an additional training capability. As such, it is ideal for ITTC customers that are looking for the highest-end training, including weapons and tactics. The aircraft would seemingly also lend itself to adversary work, providing a fourth-generation type threat, should clients request it. The contractor-operated red air market has grown substantially in recent years, and with a particular focus on more advanced capabilities to help train pilots flying late fourth-generation and fifth-generation aircraft, especially in the United States. Even without modification, the FA-50 would potentially offer sufficient performance and sensors to seriously tax fighter pilots — and other forces — training against it. According to Clementi, the company is also continuing to invest elsewhere in its ITTC enterprise, including a state-of-the-art simulator center with eight networked simulators and a tactical control center that will allow training within complex missions scenarios. This facility will be fully operational by April 2021 in time for the first Fighter Weapons Instructor Course to be held in London. For KAI, meanwhile, the agreement with ITPS could be a very useful first step into the wider North American market. The South Korean Company, in partnership with Lockheed Martin, offered a version of the FA-50, known as the T-50A, to the U.S. Air Force for its T-X advanced jet trainer competition. Specific changes for the T-50A version included a large-area display and a Dorsal Air Refueling Tank allowing aerial refueling via the U.S. Air Force’s boom method. A rival Boeing/Saab offering , now known as the T-7 Red Hawk , won that competition in 2018. Since the T-X loss, however, there have been suggestions that the T-50A could still play a role in the Air Force’s training environment. That service explored a plan that envisaged leasing a small number of T-50As, pending the arrival of the first of its new T-7As. The aircraft was expected to support a proof of concept experiment that could lead to ambitious and radical changes in how the service trains fighter pilots. That sole-source proposal was then ditched in favor of an open competition, the status of which is unclear, but the T-50 could still be the selected type if the U.S. Air Force continues down that route . Suffice to say, the deal with ITPS represents another promising path into the North American market for the T-50/TA-50/FA-50 family. While contractor-provided adversary and threat replication has emerged as a real growth industry in recent years, the number of companies offering in-cockpit training for military air arms, using a privately-owned fleet of aircraft, is still limited. ITPS, however, is fast carving out a niche for itself in this sector, and by adding the FA-50 to its fleet it will be able to offer one of the most advanced training jets available anywhere in the world.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2021",The Trump Administration Plans To Sell The United Arab Emirates Armed Reaper Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States is reportedly lining up a sale of MQ-9B variants of the U.S. Air Force’s Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle to the United Arab Emirates. The drone package follows a proposal to sell 50 F-35 stealth fighters to the same country and, if it proceeds, it would be the first sale of U.S.-made armed drones to a customer in the Middle East. Although a formal confirmation of the move has not yet appeared on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) website, Reuters reported that the U.S. State Department has informally notified Congress of the plans. The proposed package is said to include up to 18 MQ-9B unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) — a baseline fleet of 15, plus an option to buy three more — worth up to $2.9 billion, although, should the sale go through, this total could be subject to change. If the deal, which would almost certainly include other ancillary items and support services, goes through, it’s reported that the drones could be delivered from 2024. While we don’t know the exact configuration of the drones that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) might be approved to buy, the General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) MQ-9B Sky Guardian is the “Type Certifiable” variant of the U.S. Air Force’s MQ-9 Reaper that’s configured to meet airworthiness certification standards around the world. The Reuters report also makes it clear that the drones will be armed, or at least capable of carrying weapons. The first customer for the Sky Guardian was the British Royal Air Force, which has named the drone Protector RG1 , and it was subsequently selected by Australia and Belgium. An RAF Protector. The United Kingdom became the first export customer for the MQ-9B Sky Guardian., Crown Copyright The MQ-9B Sky Guardian configuration is essentially very similar to that of the U.S. Air Force’s existing MQ-9 Reaper and is intended for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and has the ability to carry various weapons . General Atomics also offers a maritime surveillance version of the MQ-9B, also referred to as the Sea Guardian, which notably features a surface search radar. A potential sale of four “weapons-ready” Sea Guardian UAVs to Taiwan, at an estimated cost of $600 million, was announced three days ago. The Taiwanese deal specifically includes Raytheon’s SeaVue Maritime Multi-Role Patrol Radar, which the company says has a “proven ability to detect small maritime vessels in high sea states including the stealthy, self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) craft that pose a significant threat to homeland security.” Should the UAE go ahead with its plans, it could be very good news for General Atomics, whose Reaper drone faces a potentially uncertain future in terms of U.S. Air Force procurement, at least. As The War Zone discussed here , the Air Force’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request includes plans to buy its last 24 MQ-9 Reaper systems, which would close out production in 2021 with a total of 337 drones delivered. An artist’s concept of a Sea Guardian in an anti-submarine warfare configuration., GENERAL ATOMICS Reportedly, the drones for the UAE will be also equipped with the maritime surveillance radar, which suggests they could be of the Sea Guardian variant. The maritime version of the MQ-9B would offer particular capabilities that would be useful to the Gulf state, which has a requirement for persistent maritime surveillance, especially in light of the spate of attacks on commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman in 2019. These drones could also be useful for patrolling the waters around Yemen, both for detecting threats and helping interdict weapons smuggling to the Houthis . More generally, variants of the MQ-9 are increasingly being pitched for the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role, as The War Zone discusses here . As well as sensors, GA-ASI has also been looking at the possibility of adding anti-submarine capabilities to the design including underwing sonobuoy dispensers . Iran’s small fleet of submarines could be a driver behind the UAE adding some kind of ASW capability to its drones, which could then be used to hunt them down during a crisis. The planned drone sale to the UAE could also be the first transfer of U.S.-made armed unmanned aircraft since the Trump administration revised its policy of limiting such sales to only the closest and most trusted allies. Reports that the United States had reinterpreted the multinational Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) first appeared in June this year and, at the time, the UAE was mentioned among the potential beneficiaries. The UAE’s possible MQ-9B deal could still run into official opposition, however. Like the previously announced F-35 package, for the sale of the drones to proceed, the U.S. Congress would have to agree that it adheres to legislation that secures Israel’s qualitative military edge (QME) in the region. You can read more about the potential ramifications of this policy here . Furthermore, attempts could be made to block the sale by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees, some members of which have in the past been critical of the UAE’s role in the ongoing civil war in Yemen . Reuters suggests that the U.S. State Department may be holding off on formally notifying Congress of the sale until it has briefed these committees. Of course, a potential drone sale to the UAE also has to be seen through the prism of the ongoing election issue in the United States, where, as of November 6, a winner was still to be declared. It remains to be seen if a Biden administration will continue with the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the MTCR guidelines. Moreover, a new administration may or may not try to continue the Trump administration’s overall push to increase U.S. arms sales abroad. The Biden camp has previously said it would have to review the sale of F-35s to the UAE, and the same may well apply to the planned drone sale, too. Successive plans to sell the UAE F-35s, EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, and now advanced armed UAVs indicate that the Trump Administration is still pushing to provide the Gulf state the cutting-edge weapons that it clearly desires. Whether the proposed deals pass their political hurdles remains to be seen, however. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Unmanned"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 19, 2020",British Army Apache Gunship’s 30mm Cannon Accidentally Fires During Maintenance,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Army is investigating the apparent accidental discharge of the 30mm M230 automatic cannon on one of its AH-64D Apache gunship helicopters while it was undergoing repairs earlier today. There are no reports, so far, of any damage or injuries as a result of the incident, but there is a search underway for any remains of the shell, which was thankfully an inert practice type. The incident reportedly took place at Wattisham Flying Station in Suffolk on Nov. 6, 2020. The AH-64D in question had returned to this base the day before after experiencing a malfunction with the gun during live-fire training. As such, it had been loaded with practice rounds, which have solid projectiles, rather than high-explosive or high-explosive-incendiary shells. “We are aware of an incident at Wattisham Flying Station which is being investigated,” a British Army spokesperson told Sky News . A British Army Apache fires its M230 gun during an exercise in 2016., Crown Copyright The exact circumstances of the incident, including how the M230 went off, are still unclear. It’s also not known if British Army personnel were actually working on the gun at the time of the discharge. There are unconfirmed reports that ground crew personnel at Wattisham had noted that an ammo counter on the helicopter had indicated there was still one more round in the gun, but had believed this to be in error and had reset it to zero. The M230 is an electrically-driven chain gun that has one barrel, but uses a rotating mechanism that functions in a broadly similar manner to the rotating cylinder in a revolver . Ammunition is fed into the system at one end and rounds are fired as they align with the barrel, after which the mechanism continues to rotate and the spent cartridge cases are ejected. There is the potential for the weapon to fire accidentally if a live round is moved into the firing position. There is also the possibility that whatever the nature of the malfunction was with the gun the day before had resulted in a misfired round stuck somewhere in the action, which subsequently went off as work began on the helicopter or due to a shock from it being moved out of a hangar at Wattisham where it had been reportedly sitting overnight. There could be other explanations for the mishap, as well. In addition, while it’s certainly good that the helicopter wasn’t carrying high-explosive or high-explosive-incendiary shells, the 30mm practice ammunition for the M230 is designed to have the same ballistic performance as those other rounds for training purposes. This means the steel-cored projectile they do fire still goes flying out the barrel at around just over 1,800 miles per hour and has an effective range of just over 1.8 miles. A briefing slide showing the construction of the 30mm target practice round for the M230, as well as the target practice spotter cartridge, which has a shell with a small amount of incendiary mixture to make it easier to observe where the rounds hit., General Dynamics The shell could still have done significant damage or caused fatal injuries had it struck something. It makes good sense that the British Army is trying to ascertain exactly where it went to make sure nothing happened. This is not the first time an accidental discharge of a military aircraft or helicopter’s cannon on the ground. In 2018, the 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon on a Belgian F-16AM Viper went off during an apparent inspection . In that incident, the weapon was loaded with high-explosive rounds ahead of an upcoming sortie and the cannon fire destroyed another F-16AM and damaged a third, and left two ground crew personnel injured. These kinds of accidents are limited to accidental discharges from guns, either. In April, an unguided rocket went flying from a pod under the wing of a Chadian Air Force Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft sitting on the tarmac at its base in the country’s capital N’Djamena. That projectile narrowed missed a nearby French Air Force C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, passed through a thankfully empty fuel truck, but then flew into a house and killed four innocent bystanders. Mishaps like this don’t have to happen on the ground, either. In 2018, the pilot of a Spanish Air Force Eurofighter fighter jet accidentally fired one of his aircraft’s AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) during a NATO Air Policing patrol over Estonia. It also recently emerged that the U.S. Air Force had to revise the rules and regulations regarding strafing training for its F-16 Vipers following a fatal accident in 2017. In that incident, a pilot accidentally identified a line of rental cars as a set of mock targets during a nighttime training sortie and engaged them with their Vulcan cannon, killing a contractor. The U.S. government subsequently paid nearly $25 million to the family of the late retired Master Sergeant Charles “Chuck” Holbrook after they won a lawsuit over his wrongful death. Thankfully, so far, it appears that this accidental discharge of an Apache’s M230 cannon in the United Kingdom has not resulted in any damage, let alone injuries or fatalities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 17, 2020",New Images Of Chinese Bomber Carrying Huge Mystery Missile Point To Hypersonic Capability,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New images have emerged of what looks to be a Chinese H-6N missile carrier aircraft carrying an outsized missile underneath its fuselage. Though more detail is now visible, the general shape and size of the apparent missile are very similar, if not identical to the one seen in another video that appeared on social media last month. The features that we can now see further point to a hypersonic design, which could potentially be air-breathing and nuclear-capable. Still captures from a video showing the heavily burdened H-6N first appeared on Twitter on Nov. 5, 2020. They came from a clip that had been posted on the Chinese social network Weibo, but which appears to have been subsequently taken down. The payload under the aircraft is the same general length as the one seen in the video footage from October and reasonable estimates put it at around 40 feet in length, or about one third the length of the H-6N. The nose section, which strongly appears to be some kind of hypersonic vehicle, has visible fins and a nose with a flattened shape. In the War Zone ‘s analysis of the first video from October, we noted that the shape was very broadly reminiscent of what we had seen of the unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that sits on top of the DF-17 missile , referred to in the past as the DF-ZF , which China first showed off publicly at a major parade in Beijing last year. That same event was the public debut of the H-6N, which is designed to carry very large payloads, including missiles and drones , semi-recessed on the bottom of its fuselage. The H-6N is an evolution of the H-6K cruise missile carrier aircraft, which is a derivative of the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger bomber. DF-17s on parade in 2019., Chinese Internet From what can be seen in the stills from the new clip, there is also the possibility that what we’re seeing actually a very large, high-speed, air-breathing design of some kind. Certain features look broadly similar to an experimental hypersonic research vehicle called the Jia Geng No. 1 , pictures of which first emerged last year. The Jia Geng No. 1, which Xiamen University Aerospace Academy developed together with Beijing Lingkong Tianxing Technology Company, Limited, ostensibly for hypersonic research purposes, is reportedly just under 30 feet long, which would make it shorter than whatever the H-6Ns have been carrying. This same general shape has been seen in other air-breathing hypersonic research vehicles, such as NASA’s X-43 , as well as weapon designs, such as the Soviet Union’s Kh-90 , which never entered service. Xiamen University Chinese Internet Chinese Internet A NASA B-52 bomber carries the X-43A experimental hypersonic vehicle during a flight test., NASA A prototype of the Soviet Kh-90 missile., Public Domain There had been some speculation previously that the Jia Geng No. 1 could itself be a prototype of or test article supporting the development of a large air-breathing hypersonic weapon. Though the H-6Ns in the two videos we have seen now very much appear to be carrying missiles of some kind, it is also worth noting that this aircraft would present a very viable launch platform for outsized flight test vehicles, hypersonic and otherwise, for general aerospace research and development purposes, similar to how the U.S. Air Force and NASA have used B-52 bombers over the years. Whatever the case, the vehicle at the front of this missile looks very different from a traditional ballistic missile warhead, even a maneuvering type, such as the one on China’s DF-21D medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), which is thought to have anti-ship capabilities . There have been reports of an air-launched DF-21D being in development since at least 2017 . The U.S. military has also said that the Chinese are developing an air-launched ballistic missile, which it has referred to as the CH-AS-X-13, but it’s unclear if this is the same as the purported air-launched DF-21D. A screengrab of a video showing the launch of a DF-21D missile., CCTV The locations where these videos were shot may hold additional clues. In the screengrabs from the new video, it’s not clear whether the aircraft was taking off or landing at the time or where the footage was shot. The previous video of an H-6N carrying a very large weapon, which appeared online in October, was subsequently geolocated to Neixiang Air Base, home of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s (PLAAF) 106th Brigade. There are high trees visible in the background of that footage that look broadly similar to the ones seen in the new clip. As such, it is possible that the two videos were shot in the same general area, but from different angles. A separate analysis of developments at Neixiang from The Diplomat in September had raised the possibility the 106th might have gained, or be in the process of gaining, a nuclear mission as part of China’s efforts to establish a nuclear deterrent triad. “China is pursuing a ‘nuclear triad’ with the development of a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) and improving its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities,” the Pentagon said in an annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments that it released that same month. This all raises the possibility that this missile, whatever its actual design, maybe nuclear-capable or a precursor developmental effort intended to lead to a future nuclear capability. The combination of this aircraft, which also has an aerial refueling capability, with an air-launched ballistic missile with a nuclear-tipped hypersonic vehicle of some kind could give the PLAAF a more realistic deterrent capability. It would also be very much in line with how the U.S. Air Force, at least, sees the future role of the equally non-stealthy B-52 bomber, which looks set to be a flying weapons truck to carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles and conventionally-armed hypersonic weapons , as well as other conventional weapons, for years to come. China is also believed to be developing a stealthy, flying-wing type strategic bomber, known as the H-20 , which could be very roughly analogous to the B-2 Spirit, which, together with the H-6N, would give the PLAAF the same general mix of aerial deterrent options as its American counterparts. Of course, these are just possibilities, and once again, this could be a research vehicle, not even a weapon necessarily. Because of the limited quality of the imagery, it is also possible that this could be something else, like a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle or even a ballistic missile, although the latter seems far less likely now with this new imagery. Still, based on our standing analysis, these new images of the H-6N carrying an outsized weapon also speaks to the very real hypersonic arms race that is going on around the world now and that China is a very active participant in it. This is hardly surprising given that these weapons are presently virtually impossible to defend against and offer the ability to conduct very precise, short-notice strikes against time-sensitive and other high-value or highly defended targets at long ranges. This especially relevant considering the posture of U.S. forces arrayed in the western Pacific region who already closer to China, such as those on the U.S. islands of Guam or Wake Island , or forward-deployed in Japan . If nothing else, we seem to be getting more looks at this new and very large air-launched missile, which we have now seen images of H-6Ns carrying twice in just a matter of weeks.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 22, 2021",Marine Corps Boss Has Big Plans To Get Into The Business Of Hunting And Killing Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General David Berger, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, recently laid out a bold vision for his service to organize and prepare itself, at least in part, for a new mission, anti-submarine warfare , as part of equally new and rapidly evolving distributed and expeditionary warfare concepts of operations. In recent years, the top Marine officer has already initiated a dramatic overhaul of his forces , including eliminating heavy armored units and their tanks , and has called for a major rethinking of how they fight, including a push to significantly reduce its reliance on traditional U.S. Navy amphibious warfare ships . Berger explained how the future Marine Corps could also contribute to anti-submarine operations in an article published in the November 2020 edition of the U.S. Naval Institute’s magazine Proceedings . He said that this mission set was among those that Marines could carry out while conducting broader distributed and expeditionary operations as part of his service’s still relatively new Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept. At its most basic, EABO envisions Marine units rapidly establishing forward operating bases across a broad area from which they can conduct various missions and then disestablishing them just as quickly, relocating, and repeating the process elsewhere. In principle, this creates a dynamic battlespace across a huge geographical expanse that makes it difficult for opponents to prioritize threats and adequately respond to them. You can read more about this in-depth in this previous War Zone piece . “As Chinese and Russian undersea warfare capabilities continue to improve, logistics and other supporting operations for U.S. ASW forces will grow in importance,” Berger wrote in Proceedings . “Integrating cross-domain ASW [anti-submarine warfare] operations into the Marine Corps’ expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) concept could enable the joint force to sustain or widen its advantage in ASW.” The Commandant of the Marine Corps General David Berger., USMC The Marine Corps Commandant is certainly not the first within the U.S. military to sound the alarm about increasing Russian and Chinese submarine and other underwater activity , as well as both countries’ development of improved submarines and new undersea capabilities , and the challenges and threats that they represent. The Navy has been particularly outspoken in recent years about the dangers it sees in a new “ Fourth Battle of the Atlantic ,” though these same issues also apply to the Arctic and Pacific regions , as well. “Nearly two years ago, my predecessor, former Commandant General Robert Neller, drew applause at the 2019 Naval Institute/AFCEA WEST Conference when he said, ‘We’re going to have to fight to get to the fight,’ and, ‘I think we’re going to need more submarines ‘ in a fight against a peer adversary,” Berger added. “While those were bold statements from a Marine general, I am ready to take that line of thinking even further. The undersea fight will be so critical in the High North and in the western Pacific that the Marine Corps must be part of it.” In his article, Berger described a variety of different ways in which Marines could contribute directly to hunting and killing submarines from forward bases in the future. When it comes to finding submarines, the Commandant noted that Marine unmanned aircraft could potentially deploy sonobuoy arrays and other anti-submarine warfare sensors in the waters around an expeditionary outpost. This could be a tall order for the Corps’ existing RQ-21 Blackjack drones, but the service is actively working toward acquiring more capable, longer-range unmanned capabilities. The service has two MQ-9 Reapers on order now and is training personnel to operate them already. General Atomics, the Reaper’s manufacturer , already offers the Sea Guardian variant of this unmanned aircraft configured for maritime surveillance missions with a large surface search radar and been exploring adding anti-submarine capabilities to the design, including underwing sonobuoy dispensers . In 2017, one of these drones also demonstrated its ability to serve as a relay for data from sonobuoys other aircraft and helicopters might deploy. The Marines also see their Reapers as a stepping stone to fielding other larger unmanned aircraft . In addition, though Berger doesn’t specifically mention it, manned aircraft, such as the service’s KC-130 Hercules tanker-transporters and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, and helicopters could also contribute and might be better suited to rapidly deploying components of a more robust anti-submarine sensor array. Just in October, the Marine announced that, for the first time ever, it had used an MV-22 to deploy oceanographic sensors , used to gather important environmental data to support amphibious operations planning, from an MV-22 as part of an exercise. Typically, C-130 variants have been used to drop these systems in the past. An oceanographic sensor falls from the back of an MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor during a first-of-its-kind demonstration during an exercise in 2020., USMC “Using the MV-22 to deploy these sensors not only greatly expands when and where oceanographic data can be collected, but having the capability to organically deploy these sensors, can ensure that the data most relevant to the Marine Corps is captured,” Steven Jayne, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who took part in the demonstration, said afterward in a statement. “Because of how accurate the sensors are, commanders can ensure a safer environment for future amphibious operations.” It’s also worth mentioning that a 2016 “toolkit” describing various notional future concepts for Marine planners to use in tabletop wargames around the EABO concept also included potential methods for the emplacement of bi-static and multi-static sonar arrays via aircraft or personnel on the ground. The expectation was that Navy personnel would operate these systems. USMC USMC With these organic means of detecting submarines in place, as well as information from networks linked to other anti-submarine elements, including those within the Navy and those operated by allies and partners, Marines could then engage any undersea threats they detect. This could be done using Marine manned aircraft, drones, or helicopters armed with traditional lightweight torpedoes, according to Berger. The 2016 wargame toolkit also specifically raised the possibility of using armed MV-22s in the anti-submarine warfare role. From the very beginning of the Osprey program there had also been talk of developing an anti-submarine variant using a roll-on/roll-off kit, that would add capabilities such as dipping sonar , with the Navy going so far as to reserve the designation SV-22A for this version. Other weapons, including torpedoes with stand-off wing kits and anti-submarine mines might also be options to increase the anti-submarine capabilities of Marine manned and unmanned aircraft. Various proposed additional missions for the Osprey tilt-rotor, using roll-on/roll-off kits. There have been past proposals to use a similar kit to give them an anti-submarine capability., USN More interestingly, Berger also described the possibility of employing “ground-launched ASW missiles.” Though he did not describe what this kind of system would consist of, the Indian military recently tested a weapon that would seem to fit this general description called the Supersonic Missile Assisted Release of Torpedo ( SMART ). SMART is a supersonic missile that carries a lightweight torpedo instead of a more traditional warhead and releases this payload after arriving at a designated target area. The Marine wargaming toolkit from 2016 also included notes on possibly tethering an unspecified launch platform with the RUM-139 Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (VL-ASROC), which is presently in service with the Navy, in some way to an expeditionary Marine Corps network. A ground-launched version of VL-ASROC could certainly be something Berger has in mind, as well, but the ship-launched version has a maximum range of just around 15 nautical miles. As such, this could valuable for littoral defense around a forward operating location, but it could be necessary to extend that range for the system to be more useful in a distributed, expeditionary environment. India’s SMART is expected to be able to carry its torpedo out to areas up to 400 miles away. It’s important to note that Berger’s new Marine Corps force structure already focuses heavily on expanding the service’s land-based anti-ship and land-attack missile capabilities, including ground-launched Tomahawk and Naval Strike Missile (NSM) cruise missiles. There are also plans for a multi-purpose, unmanned launcher vehicle , called Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE Fires), to employ these weapons, among others. ROGUE Fires will combine the chassis of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) with a launcher derived from the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Semi-hidden in back of Oshkosh Defense booth at Modern Day Marine is first ever concept art of JLTV ROGUE Fires, emerging USMC tech study to place HIMARS on JLTV @ShephardNews pic.twitter.com/XrmSewA45o — Scott Gourley (@ScottGourley1) September 26, 2018 The Marine Corps officer’s vision isn’t limited to this kind of direct action against enemy submarines. His piece in Proceedings underscored how Marines operating from forward bases could also provide anti-air and anti-ship capabilities to neutralize or otherwise mitigate threats to other anti-submarine warfare assets in the air and at sea, including the Navy’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes. He also pointed out the increasing threats to established U.S. bases during a major conflict, an issue that the U.S. military, as a whole, has been grappling with in recent years, which will demand greater focus on distributed operations to make it more difficult for opponents to target American forces and disrupt their operations. The Marine Corps’ EABO concept is already focused on this kind of warfare and Berger highlighted how those outposts could potentially serve as forwarding bases for other anti-submarine warfare assets or as logistics nodes to support other nearby locations where those assets might be operating from. The 2016 wargaming tool kit included an entry on one possible concept involving a shore-based Navy SH/MH-60 Seahawk detachment flying from a Marine forward base and conducting local anti-submarine operations, as well as anti-surface warfare (ASUW) and other missions. The document described this “ASW/ASUW Hunter Killer / Pouncer Team” as being “like when ship based, operates as the striking, search and localization arm of the other local ASW and associated Expeditionary sensor units.” USMC There’s also the possibility that, depending on how the Marine Corps might ultimately deploy the various capabilities in question, that the service could be able to contribute to the anti-submarine warfare fight from the decks of amphibious warfare ships or sea bases . The Marines have already demonstrated the ability to employ HIMARS in this way from the deck of San Antonio -class landing platform dock and have also used a mobile electronic warfare jamming system on deck of a Wasp class amphibious assault ship to knock down hostile drones . A US Marine Corps all-terrain vehicle-mounted Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System (LMADIS) electronic warfare jamming system on the deck of the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge in 2019., USN “From operating areas in Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, EABs could support an ASW fence across the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap , bottling Russian submarines in the Norwegian Sea and keeping them out of the North Atlantic,” Berger explained. “The same concept could be applied to the First Island Chain in the western Pacific.” “Without being limited to the Philippines and Japan , EABs could create opportunities from multiple locations beyond the South and East China Seas ,” he continued. “Close, confined seas may offer more opportunities for Marine EABs to sense and strike Chinese ships and submarines, while supporting fleet and joint ASW efforts.” As already noted, the challenge that Russian or Chinese submarines would present in any major contingency or conflict in the future, both to naval forces on the front lines and maritime logistics chains in rear areas, is very real. It’s hardly surprising then that Berger would be adamant about contributing to that part of the fight. Russia’s Yasen class nuclear-powered attack submarine Severodvinsk , a multi-purpose design with vertical launch capabilities this among the most capable in Russian Navy service today., Russian MoD At the same time, it remains to be seen just how much of this vision the Marines will be able to actually implement. While many of the technical aspects appear to be readily achievable, hunting submarines is a very specific skill set, as the War Zone has explored on multiple occasions in the past . It’s not clear how realistic it might be to train Marine units to take on this mission set on top of all the other tasks they are already expected to perform as part of the EABO concept. Using Navy assets or those from U.S. allies and partners to cue Marine anti-submarine warfare attacks might help mitigate this, but could limit the Corps’ ability to conduct these kinds of operations independently. There is also a basic manpower question. Berger, and his predecessor Neller, has already talked about expanding the Marine Corps ability to carry out other kinds of operations, including electronic warfare and cyber warfare , but with an understanding that the overall size of his service is unlikely to increase in any substantial way and that it could even shrink . Any effort to establish a dedicated anti-submarine force within the Corps, or even just set aside units to focus more heavily on this mission, could find itself competing for these finite personnel resources. At the same time, Berger clearly understands that the Marines would always be just one component of a larger anti-submarine warfare picture. In Proceedings , he rightly described several valuable indirect ways in which his service could provide valuable protection for other services or foreign allies and partners hunting for undersea threats and otherwise support those operations. What is clear is that the threat that submarines would pose to U.S. military operations, broadly, in any future high-end conflict has come sharply back into focus in recent years amid Russian and Chinese developments. Any contribution that Berger’s Marine Corps can make toward any future undersea fight would certainly be more than welcome. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

Already one of the most well-known U.S. Air Force fighter units when it comes to commemorating its heritage, the 457th Fighter Squadron has now gone the extra mile in repainting one of its F-16C Viper fighter jets in the famous colors of its Texas home state. The 457th, nicknamed the “Spads,” is marking 75 years of operations. The accompanying photos of Block 30 F-16C, serial number 86-0246, painted in its “Lone Star State” scheme were kindly provided to The War Zone by Caulun Belcher, whose other work is well worth looking at on his Instagram page, @TXAVGEEK . He captured the jet during a flight from the 457th Fighter Squadron’s home station of Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth , formerly known as Carswell Air Force Base, near the city of the same name in Texas’s Tarrant County. For its 70th anniversary in 2014, the “Spads” put up a memorable two-ship formation over Forth Worth comprising of the currently-flown F-16C and a P-51 Mustang, the first fighter type with which it was equipped. Although the jet has apparently only recently appeared in its new colors, the 457th Fighter Squadron actually notched up its 75th year in 2019, as referenced by the wording on the tail. The jet’s fin also depicts silhouettes of the fighters flown by the squadron through the decades: P-51 Mustang, F-84 Thunderjet, F-100 Super Sabre, F-105 Thunderchief, F-4 Phantom II , and F-16. Caulun Belcher Caulun Belcher Caulun Belcher The 457th was first established at Lakeland Army Airfield in Florida in October 1944 as part of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) and flew its Mustangs in the Pacific theater during World War II. Operating from Iwo Jima and Tinian, the squadron’s P-51s escorted B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber raids on Japan, and also attacked ground targets, before being inactivated in December 1945.

During this period, the unit first flew the F-84 Thunderjet and then transitioned to the F-100 Super Sabre. It stood down again in April 1959. The 457th Tactical Fighter Squadron came back into being as an F-105 unit at Carswell in July 1972, now as a part of the Air Force Reserve, and was finally redesignated as the 457th Fighter Squadron in February 1992, by which time it had already traded in its F-4s for F-16s, the first of which arrived in 1990.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 18, 2020",The Nanchang J-12 Is The Lightweight Chinese Fighter You’ve Probably Never Heard Of,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Considering the huge advances made by China’s aerospace industry in recent years, it’s odd that the first jet fighter to be designed and built in that country is almost unknown today. Surviving now as a museum exhibit, the Nanchang J-12 was, for its time, a forward-thinking project for a truly lightweight fighter. Chinese military aviation developments have long been cloaked in secrecy, but details of such activities during the Cultural Revolution — Mao Zedong’s brutal overhaul of Chinese Communism between 1966 until 1976 — are especially hard to track down. Despite the turmoil of that period, the Chinese industry remained engaged in design work on a range of combat aircraft, including the J-12 lightweight fighter. Paralleling contemporary thinking in the Soviet Union and the United States, in the late 1960s, the People’s Republic of China began to explore the potential of a fighter that was smaller, lighter, and more agile than the-then current generation of combat jets, typified by the twin-engined MiG-19 Farmer from the Soviet Union and the F-4 Phantom II from the United States. A requirement for the new fighter was first drafted in April 1967 and by 1969 it had been given the official go-ahead. The new fighter was expected to replace the Shenyang J-6 — a Chinese-built version of the Soviet-designed MiG-19, manufactured in huge numbers — and its design was to take into account lessons from recent conflicts in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. As well as maneuverability, a short take-off and landing (STOL) capability was to be considered, reflecting contemporary concerns about the inherent vulnerability of airfields . Like the J-6, the new fighter was expected to be easy to maintain and cheap to acquire and operate. A J-12 prototype preserved at the Chinese Aviation Museum at Datangshan, near Beijing, with the original engine intake configuration., VIA ANDREAS RUPPRECHT Two design teams responded to the challenge, Shenyang with its J-11 (a designation reused years later for a Chinese-made clone of the Soviet-designed Su-27 Flanker ) and Nanchang with the J-12. While the J-11 was destined to remain on the drawing board, work on the rival J-12 proceeded quickly, which is remarkable considering the tumultuous nature of the Cultural Revolution. By August 1969, the basic design of the J-12 had been approved and within 18 months the first three airframes had been completed. The first prototype took to the air on December 26, 1970. Together with a second flying prototype, it took part in evaluations for the next two and a half years, while the third airframe was used for static ground tests. This J-12 prototype made an unexpected appearance as a static exhibit at the Nanchang Flight Convention airshow that took place from October 31 to November 1, 2020., VIA @CHENGTU小喵 and @太湖啥个 / WEIBO The design team that created the J-12 was led by Lu Xiaopeng, who had previously been responsible for the Nanchang Q-5 Fantan , a robust ground-attack aircraft derived from the MiG-19. The J-12 was very different altogether. A single-seat fighter, it was powered by a single afterburning WP-6B engine fed by a nose intake. The highly swept wing was tailored for a planned maximum speed of Mach 1.5, although in practice, the fighter’s speed topped out at Mach 1.39. Unloaded, the J-12 weighed less than 7,000 pounds and its tiny dimensions meant there was no space for an internal radar. Internal fuel capacity was just 2,756 pounds, although a pair of external fuel tanks could be fitted to extend the jet’s range to a maximum of 861 miles. In contrast, the MiG-21 Fishbed , which was already in production in China as the Chengdu J-7, weighed, in its initial production version, over 10,700 pounds unloaded, and this figure would continue to grow throughout its further development. The range of the early MiG-21, without external fuel tanks, was around 980 miles. A J-12 with the later nose intake configuration, featuring a MiG-21-style center-body cone. , VIA ANDREAS RUPPRECHT Armament for the J-12 comprised internal 23mm and 30mm guns in the wing roots, with 120 and 80 rounds of ammunition, respectively, plus a pair of short-range infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. To keep weight to a minimum, and in turn boosting performance and agility, the J-12’s structure made use of metal-honeycomb and early composite structures, which were employed for the first time on a Chinese fighter. Other exotic materials used in its construction included titanium alloys. The first two prototypes were followed by at least three improved aircraft characterized by a revised air intake, featuring a MiG-21-style center-body cone. Other changes were made in an attempt to rectify some performance shortcomings, including a lighter structure and an area-ruled fuselage. The first of the improved jets — which are sometimes designated J-12A or J-12I — made a maiden flight on July 1, 1975. A bare-metal J-12 wearing the red code “7112.”, VIA ANDREAS RUPPRECHT After demonstrating to high-ranking Communist Party and air force officials in September 1973, the prospects for the J-12 initially looked good. Unfortunately, even with the improvements made, the jet was still falling short of official expectations of what a modern fighter should offer. Finally, the flight-test program was wound up in January 1977, after 135 flights that included just over 61 flying hours. In the process, Nanchang had demonstrated that the performance of the J-12 outstripped that of the J-6, including maneuverability, speed, acceleration, ceiling (over 57,000 feet), and take-off and landing performance. The program was officially terminated in February 1978. Ultimately, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) considered the J-12 just too small and light to be a useful combat asset. While the move toward lighter weight, lower cost, and improved agility was relevant for the time, the end result offered little more than the J-7. This J-12 serves as a “gate guard” at the Chinese Aviation Museum, this J-12 is actually an early example that has been retrofitted with the intake center-body and repositioned pitot probe., VIA ANDREAS RUPPRECHT It’s tempting to wonder whether the fate of the J-12 would have been different had it been large enough to incorporate a more useful load of fuel, avionics, and weapons. As it was, the PLAAF had to wait until the mid-2000s before it got its hands on a truly effective indigenous “lightweight” fighter, the Chengdu J-10 . An export-optimized light fighter, the Chengdu-developed JF-17 Thunder , entered service with Pakistan later the same decade. However, as the progenitor of what’s today a flourishing Chinese military aerospace industry, the J-12 certainly deserves more than a footnote in the country’s aviation history.

The RAAF is also blazing a bold trail by working to field its own indigenous loyal wingman drone that will supplement and force multiply its modernized manned tactical combat jet fleet. As such, it’s not like the RAAF is letting much go by retiring their decades-old Hornets, some or even all of which could find a second life of their own . Still, it won’t be easy to see an aircraft go that has performed marvelously over more than three decades and many conflicts abroad.

You can read all about how these jets are being modified and how they will impact a revamped demonstration in this article of ours. The team will then head to its remote winter training site at Naval Air Facility (NAF) El Centro in Southern California in January, where it will have a couple of months to perfect the altered demonstration with the larger Super Hornets before the 2021 show season kicks off at the base. The Blues will also have their new—at least to them—KC-130J “Fat Albert” Super Hercules transport for next year’s show season, which will mark the team’s 75th anniversary. Altogether, it will be a monumental year for the squadron.

A number of them still serve in support and training roles, but the Marines have acquired the cream of the Navy’s retired fleet. Some of those jets will serve for a decade more in an upgraded form, which you can read all about here . For many of us who grew up watching the Blue Angles in their iconic Legacy Hornets, the introduction of which marked a big boost in performance over the A-4 Skyhawks they had before, this is a bittersweet moment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 20, 2021",Navy’s Next Attack Submarine Will Be Wider And Based On The New Columbia Class Missile Boats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s future nuclear attack submarine , or SSN(X), is set to be notably wider than the service’s present Virginia class , bringing it more in line size-wise with its advanced Seawolf class . It will also leverage technology in development now for its future Columbia class ballistic missile submarines. USNI News reported on these latest details about the Navy’s next attack submarine following a third-quarter earnings call with Rex Geveden, CEO of BWX Technologies on Nov. 2, 2020. BWX Technologies is a major subcontractor to General Dynamics Electric Boat on the Columbia class and has also supported work on other submarine programs, including supplying the nuclear reactors that power the Navy’s Virginia , Seawolf , and Los Angeles classes . “We do expect it will be a larger type of submarine, probably in the size class of the Columbia , but there’s not much more to tell than that. But we’re working with our Navy customer in what that would look like and how we could take that into production,” Rex Geveden said, according to USNI News . “It has the moniker SSN(X) until it gets a class name, and there’s some thought, discussion, and analysis. It would be the follow-on to the Virginia fast-attack submarine, and it would feather in sometime in the late 2030s.” An artist’s conception of the future USS Columbia ., USN USNI News said that despite Geveden using the word “larger,” what he was referring to was the overall width of the submarine, rather than its length or displacement. This would make sense considering that the Columbia class boats are expected to have a submerged displacement of almost 23,310 tons. This is more than twice that of existing Virginia class boats, early block models of which displace around 7,800 tons, and even more than that of the unique, extended-length Seawolf class spy submarine USS Jimmy Carter , which has a displacement of just under 12,160 tons, according to the Navy . That the SSN(X)’s width would be greater than that of the Virginia class would also be well in line with past Navy statements about this future design, dating back to the first public disclosure of its plans for these submarines in 2018, at which time the service described the notional design as Seawolf -like. The beam, or widest point, of those advanced attack submarines, which have seen been modified and reconfigured to be better equipped to carry out intelligence-gathering missions and other specialized activities, is approximately 40 feet , while that of the Virginia class is just 34 feet. Previous reports have indicated that the Columbias will have a beam of 43 feet. The Virginia class submarine USS Delaware under construction., USN The Seawolf class submarine USS Jimmy Carter ., USN A wider design could allow for the insertion of additional sound-dampening features between the inner hull, where the submarine’s systems are and where its crew works, and the outer hull. Reducing the acoustic signature of any submarine is important for making it harder for opponents to detect and track, which, in turn, makes it more survivable. Of course, the size of the inner hull could also be increased, which would provide added space for various kinds of equipment and weapons, This coulda also make it easier to integrate future technologies and capabilities, such as the ability to deploy and recover unmanned underwater vehicles . It’s worth noting that the Seawolfs , as originally designed, were dedicated hunter-killers meant to engage hostile ships and submarines and have eight torpedo tubes, along with the ability to carry up to 50 Mk 48 heavyweight torpedoes or torpedo tube-launched Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles. By comparison, the existing blocks of the more multi-mission focused Virginias have just four torpedo tubes and have a standard loadout of 37 torpedoes, though they do also have Vertical Launch System cells to fire Tomahawks. A 2018 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said that the Navy was, at that time, targeting an SSN(X) design that would be able to carry up 62 torpedoes or other torpedo tube-launched weapons, including anti-ship missiles, such as the UGM-84 Harpoon , a well as future anti-ship cruise missile weapons, and would not necessarily have a vertical launch capability at all. “Specifically, the Navy indicates that the next-generation attack submarine should be faster, stealthier, and able to carry more torpedoes than the Virginia class – similar to the Seawolf class submarine,” CBO’s report said of the projected design as a whole. “CBO therefore assumed that the SSN(X) would be a Seawolf -sized SSN, which displaces about 9,100 tons when submerged, and would have an all-new design in keeping with the Navy’s description of it as a ‘fast, lethal, next-generation attack submarine.’” It also makes good sense that the companies working with the Navy now on SSN(X), such as BWX Technologies, would be looking to leverage any features from the Columbia class design that could offer improved performance and increased stealthiness for the SSN(X). This all raises the distinct possibility that the Navy’s future attack submarine could have a shortened derivative of the Columbia hullform at its core, but one optimized for the hunter-killer mission rather than nuclear deterrence patrols. That being said, attack and ballistic missile submarines have very different mission sets with very different general performance requirements. The former needs speed and maneuverability to hunt, while the latter is expected to cruise at lower speeds for extended periods of time while endeavoring to stay undetected at all costs. As such, the SSN(X) could easily have a markedly different configuration even if shares a significant portion of its hull and subsystems design with the Columbia class. In addition, there have been discussions about developing a Large Payload Submarine, also derived from the Columbia , as something of a successor to the four Ohio class submarines converted into guided missile boats, which also have significant additional multi-mission capabilities that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . Any significant additional commonality between the Large Payload Submarine and SSN(X) might also raise the possibility of potentially merging the two designs. No matter what, the SSN(X) design, and the requirements driving it, are likely to evolve, at least to some degree, in the future. The Navy is still very early in the process of crafting this submarine, requesting a very small $1 million for the project in the research and development portion of its most recent budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year. There also remain very real questions about how the Navy plans to budget for the design and construction of a new class of advanced and potentially very expensive attack submarines together with its other priorities. The service had run into similar issues with the Seawolfs and, together with general defense spending drawdowns following the end of the Cold War, ended up only buying three of those submarines. The first-in-class USS Seawolf and its sister USS Connecticut both cost $6 billion in the end, while the Jimmy Carter , which, as already mentioned, is a unique subclass unto itself, was even more expensive. The Seawolf class submarine USS Connecticut ., USN They remain the costliest attack submarines ever built anywhere in the world. However, their advanced capabilities, including their especially good performance while operating under thick ice , such as in the Arctic region , mean they are in very high demand within the Navy. All of this also comes as the Navy is now pushing a proposal to expand the size of its overall fleet to 500 ships and submarines, up from less than 300 now, by 2045, another questionably ambitious plan that you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . Still, the Navy is clearly very committed to its new attack submarine plans, at least at present, which it feels are critical to countering expanding and increasingly active Russian and Chinese submarine fleets , as well as other naval developments in both of those countries. China has been on a naval construction blitz in the past few years, including the stunningly rapid construction of large capital ships, including aircraft carriers , amphibious assault ships , and destroyers , as well as various submarines . “The advantage we have in the undersea is an advantage that we need to not only maintain, but we need to expand. I want to own the undersea for forever because I know that I can be really lethal from the undersea,” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said in October, according to USNI News . “When you think attack boat, you’re thinking, that can move around the timing and tempo of an operational commander’s need to deliver ordinance on target in a timely fashion. And so it’s got to be a fast sub as well.” As it stands now, the Navy’s next class of attack submarine is set to be even larger and far more advanced than the Navy’s prized Seawolf class, which remains among the most capable submarines in the world.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 29, 2019",Iran Now Has Mobile Ballistic Missile Launching “Magazines” For Its Underground Bases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video and photos have emerged showing for the first time an underground Iranian ballistic missile facility in which groups of missiles ready to fire are moved around massive tunnels using an automated railway-type system. The vertically-stowed missile “magazine” appears to bring groups of missiles into position for rapid, consecutive launching from the cavernous subterranean bunker . On its YouTube channel, the quasi-official Iran’s Military Achievements Media states that “Wagons carrying ballistic and long-range missiles can create continuous shooting conditions in this platform.” The same source adds that “the quantity and continuity of the missile fire will increase impressively in a safe atmosphere,” i.e. within the protected underground cavern. The location of the facility seen in the latest imagery is unconfirmed, but Iran is known to have built underground caves to protect ballistic missiles operated by its Revolutionary Guards Corps in the past. Previously, imagery from within these caves showed long lines of ballistic missiles sitting on launchers, a process that now seems to have been refined, or at the very least augmented, using the automated railway system. The thinking behind the system seems to be to allow launches of ballistic missiles in quick succession. Since the missiles on their individual platforms are ready to fire, there is no need to reload individual launchers using a crane or trans-loader. The magazine method would potentially allow many more missiles to be fired from a single bunker while increasing the chances of the outbound missile strike overwhelming anti-ballistic missile defenses . The new method is also much more space-efficient. While previously, bulky conventional transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) would be parked and moved under the firing apertures in the cavern’s ceiling, using this new approach, Iran could potentially massively increase the number of missiles stowed in each underground complex. Some of the tunnels in which the rail-mounted missiles are being transported also look too narrow to accommodate conventional TELs or towed launchers. The concept seems also to be broadly aligned with Iran’s recently announced “missile farms,” in which short-range ballistic missiles are hidden in buried launchers to help reduce their vulnerability to pre-emptive strikes. You can read more about recent developments in this area here . In the case of the railway missile magazine, however, the weapons themselves have been identified by analysts as Emad liquid-fuel, medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM), a derivative of the Shahab-3. The Emad is reported to have a range of around 1,000 miles and is considered to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead if such a capability existed. The Emad missile was apparently developed around a new re-entry vehicle (RV) fitted with fins to give it increased maneuverability, accuracy, and additional stability. A close-up view of an Emad IRBM as personnel prepare to move it from its transport cradle to the rig that will bring it into a vertical position., IMA MEDIA SCREENCAP The missiles on the magazine assembly also appear to be separated by dividers, which could include all the umbilicals and pre-launch test equipment required for them to be fired in an autonomous, or near-autonomous manner. Although it is not clear from the available imagery, it’s reported that each missile “clip” contains five rounds. In a wartime scenario, it might be expected that the fueled and ready-to-launch Emads would be fired first, with the aim of getting as many as possible into the air during a first strike, before their underground facility was destroyed.

Normally, Iranian missile caves like this have ports in the roof through which the missiles are launched. However, the proximity of the missiles to one another as arranged within their magazines suggests that there might be another stage in the process, in which an individual missile is moved into a launch chamber, to avoid damaging the adjacent missiles when it blasts off. These facilities are thought to have a number of launch chambers arranged in rows, so each ‘clip’ with five missiles could be separated into five launch chambers for a coordinated launch.

He highlights how the Iranian missile complex shares similarities with the La Coupole bunker that was constructed by the Germans in northern France as an underground V-2 launch facility during World War II, as well. An Allied reconstruction of the 1944 conjectural reconstruction of the La Coupole bunker in France, including rocket preparation chamber and tunnels., U.K. GOVERNMENT/PUBLIC DOMAIN Other observers have pointed to the writing on the side of the missiles, which seems to read “UAE.” However, some of the lettering that follows this has been obscured with a placard and there’s no other evidence to suggest that it refers to potential targets in the United Arab Emirates. It is possible that the missiles are pre-programmed for their intended targets for expediency and launched in groups at those colocated targets in an attempt to overwhelm missile defense systems. A crane lifts an Emad MRBM from its trolly. The “UAE” inscription is clearly visible on the missile body., IMA MEDIA SCREENCAP Above all else, this new missile launch system reveals that the country is clearly interested in expanding and improving its already extensive underground missile facilities that, in the case of a full-scale conflict, would likely be one of Tehran’s primary means of striking an early blow against its enemies.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Tupolev Tu-160M Blackjack swing-wing strategic bomber took to the air yesterday with a new engine. This marks a major development in Russia’s ongoing program to relaunch production of the Cold War-era missile-carrier. Since no photos of the re-engined bomber have so far been released, it’s not yet possible to determine the identity of the particular Blackjack, or whether all four of the turbofans are already installed. The United Aircraft Corporation, which now has manufacturing responsibility for the Blackjack, announced that the “deeply modernized” Tu-160M had performed its first flight with its new serial-production NK-32-02 engines at the Kazan Aircraft Production Association airfield in southwest Russia on November 3, 2020. The flight lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes and saw the bomber climb to a height of over 19,000 feet, with the crew led by test pilot Anri Naskidyants. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported that the flight went smoothly, adding that the aircraft “was equipped with new flight and navigation equipment, an onboard communications system, modernized control system, radar, and electronic countermeasures system .” Deeply modernized Tu-160M ​​missile bomber has succesfully performed its maiden flight with new serial engines NK-32-02 at the airfield of Kazan Aviation Plant.  The flight took place at an altitude of 6,000 meters and lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes. pic.twitter.com/YoSkTIU5Ie — UAC Russia (@UAC_Russia_eng) November 3, 2020 Lack of engines had been a serious hurdle in Moscow’s ambitious plans to restart production of the Blackjack, which had originally come to a halt in 1994 after just 36 examples – three of them non-flying static test airframes – had been completed. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, 10 of the Tu-160s left in Ukrainian territory were scrapped. Another four of the bombers were left unfinished on the assembly line and two of these were eventually completed in 1999 and 2007. Today, the Russian Aerospace Forces fleet is thought to include around 17 Blackjacks, which have performed a number of high-profile long-range missions in recent years, as well as regular “patrol” flights close to NATO’s borders . Then, in April 2015, Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu announced that production of the Tu-160 was to be resumed. Ahead of this, the Kuznetsov company in Russia’s southwestern city of Samara received a contract to restart production of the Blackjack’s NK-32 turbofans, now producing an improved NK-32-02 version. The first of these engines was planned to be ready for tests in 2016 and some observers have expected that the same powerplant to be used in Russia’s still-secretive and still-unseen PAK DA new-generation bomber. As well as powering new-build Blackjacks, the NK-32-02 is required to keep Tu-160s from the original production run operational. One of the Tu-160s from the original production run, Aleksandr Novikov , over the River Volga during a mission from its home base at Engels in the Saratov Region., ALEX BELTYUKOV/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The Kuznetsov NK-32, as installed in the original Tu-160, is widely reported as the most powerful combat aircraft engine in the world, developing over 55,000 pounds of thrust at full afterburner. While the NK-32-02 is considered a “new” engine, it actually dates back to the mid-1980s, when the Soviet Union canceled its production on cost grounds. The improvements over the initial design included new blades for the compressor and turbine, plus more efficient cooling. The NK-32-02 is understood to have the same output as the original powerplant but offers increased efficiency, extending the bomber’s range by around 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, according to Russian media reports. Tupolev has in the past claimed a 13 percent overall range increase. The program to get the Blackjack back into production has been a protracted one, perhaps not altogether surprisingly, as the effort to reinstate a production line and setup required tooling after decades of inactivity is considerable. In January 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a contract for the next 10 new-build Blackjacks, which cost around $270 million per copy. Plans called for a first example for the Russian Aerospace Forces to be rolled out in 2021; according to RIA Novosti , this schedule is still on track. In the past, the Russian Aerospace Forces have declared a requirement for at least 50 new-build Tu-160M aircraft. One of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ original batch of Tu-160s undergoes overhaul in Kazan in 2016., MAKSIM BOGODVID/SPUTNIK VIA AP Upgrade program In parallel with the new-production Blackjacks, Russia has been busy with a mid-life upgrade program for its existing Tu-160s, including new mission systems and avionics. Originally, the existing bombers were to be designated Tu-160M after completing their upgrade, while the new-build aircraft would be designated Tu-160M2. This has now been rationalized, and both variants are now known as Tu-160Ms. Therefore, the first aircraft to be re-engined with the new NK-32-02 turbofans is not a new-build Blackjack, but either an example from the earlier production batch that has been brought up to Tu-160M status or a prototype for the new-build aircraft constructed using one of the two incomplete airframes from the original production run. One of these two unfinished aircraft has been completed as a Tu-160M, perhaps to serve as a proof-of-concept for the new-build bombers. This aircraft was rolled out in November 2017 and began flight trials in January 2018. It is named Petr Deyneken after the former Russian Air Force chief. The most recent Blackjack to be completed is Petr Deyneken , which has been finished to Tu-160M standard., UAC Meanwhile, a first “deeply modernized” Tu-160M based on an aircraft from the original production series — named Igor Sikorsky — performed its maiden flight at Kazan in February 2020. The aircraft was originally built in February 1989 and was one of eight Blackjacks purchased by Russia from Ukraine in 1999, after the fleet had been left there following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The full Tu-160M configuration includes a new Novella radar as well as a new self-defense suite and electronic surveillance system. The flight deck is now equipped with a ‘glass cockpit’ and the revised avionics encompass the communication suite, flight control system, and navigation suite. Alongside the “deeply modernized” Tu-160M, Russia has also been performing a less-extensive upgrade on its Blackjack fleet, at a rate of one or two aircraft per year. This is the so-called “small modernization,” or Tu-160M1, and provides a digital upgrade for the aircraft’s inertial navigation and engine control systems, as well as armament. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov has said the Russian Aerospace Forces will continue to operate modernized Tu-160Ms (both upgraded and new-build examples) “until the 2050s or even the 2060s.” The elusive PAK DA Considering the Blackjack can now deploy conventional weapons, as well as nuclear ones, and have been combat-proven in the Syrian campaign, it’s unsurprising that Russia wants to get the most out of its supersonic strategic bombers. On the other hand, the continued focus on the Blackjack — including the tricky task of bringing it back into production — should be seen against the prospects for the future PAK DA, which stands for Perspektivnyi Aviatsionnyi Kompleks Dalney Aviatsii, or Future Air Complex of Long-Range Aviation. The research and development program for the PAK DA began around 2009, before the order to resume Tu-160 production. That suggests that difficulties faced by the PAK DA program led to the new bomber program’s priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested Blackjack. To this day, there has been no official concept art of the PAK DA, so we really have no idea what the design looks like. However, most observers expect that it will be a subsonic “flying wing” design, possibly with low-observable (stealthy) features. Probable PAK DA/Izdeliye 80 (©Butowski/Air&Cosmos/bmpd) . 145 tons, 30 tons payload, 15000 km range, 2 engines with 23 tons thrust based on NK-32-02. @russianforces @nukestrat @GuyPlopsky @PaperMissiles pic.twitter.com/EOLauH8v0B — Dmitry Stefanovich (@KomissarWhipla) February 9, 2018 Tupolev’s concept for the PAK DA was apparently approved in 2013, after which the United Aircraft Corporation received a follow-on contract for detailed design work and other contracts to develop the aircraft’s systems. The then commander of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation branch, Anatoly Zhikharev, said in late 2014 that a PAK DA prototype would fly in 2019. In 2015, however, the idea of resuming series production of the Tu-160 appeared and with this, the urgency assigned to the PAK DA seems to have diminished. Indeed, speaking in 2018, Deputy Prime Minister Borisov described that relaunching production of the Blackjack was “a less risky path” than the PAK DA. “At the same time, we have postponed the PAK DA, to gain experience and restore technology”, he added. Borisov’s predecessor, Dmitry Rogozin, had the same year said that the PAK DA would perform its first flight in 2023 or 2024. The prospects of the PAK DA taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote, especially as the focus is now on the Tu-160’s continued upgrade and production restart, which will consume both funding and production capacity at the Kazan plant. Meanwhile, similar upgrade programs for the Tu-22M3 Backfire and Tu-95MS Bear strategic bombers further reduce the urgency of getting the PAK DA into service. There is also the enormous cost involved in getting a sophisticated “clean-sheet” design into production and service in meaningful numbers. Moscow’s planned purchases of Sukhoi Su-57 new-generation fighters currently stand at just 76 and other expensive weapons programs have been abandoned altogether . While the PAK DA looks like it will have to wait in the wings sometime longer, the “new” Tu-160 will, at least, provide the Russian Aerospace Forces with a very capable stopgap.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has revealed more details about its plans for its future fleet of Boeing MQ-25A Stingray tanker drones and how it will integrate them into its carrier air wings attached to squadrons flying the E-2C/D Hawkeye airborne command and control aircraft. This comes as the service is working to stand up its first MQ-25A unit, Unmanned Carrier Launched Multi-Role Squadron 10, or VUQ-10 . The new information comes from a draft environmental impact assessment regarding the construction of new facilities at Naval Base Ventura County, in Point Mugu, California, which the Navy posted online recently. These kinds of assessments are a routine part of the process of approving major new additions to U.S. military bases, which also includes input from various other federal, state, and local stakeholders. “The Navy proposes to establish facilities and functions at Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Point Mugu, California to support West Coast home basing and operations of the MQ-25A Stingray Carrier-based Unmanned Air System (Stingray CBUAS),” the report says. “Under the Proposed Action, the Navy would home base 20 Stingray CBUAS; construct a hangar, training facilities, and supporting infrastructure; perform air vehicle (AV) maintenance; provide training for air vehicle operators (AVOs) and maintainers; conduct approximately 960 Stingray CBUAS annual flight operations; and station approximately 730 personnel, plus their family members.” The largest single planned addition is a new hangar and associated ramp and taxiways, at the northern end of the base attached to Naval Air Station Point Mugu’s Runway 03/21. NAS Point Mugu is part of the larger Naval Base Ventura County.

Point Mugu will also require the expansion of a battery shop on base to accommodate “lithium-ion battery maintenance and storage,” as part of the proposed basing plan. An existing hangar, Hangar 365, is set to receive minor renovations to support VUQ-10 and its initial cadre of drones, as well as provide space for some maintenance tasks. The Navy is hoping to begin construction of the new and expanded facilities in 2023 and have that work completed by 2025.

The squadron at Point Mugu, which will be in addition to VUQ-10, is set to be the first of at least three operational Stingray units, one more being based at a yet-to-determined location on the East Coast of the United States and another forward-deployed in Japan. From these locations, the drones will be situated to best support U.S. carrier strike group operations originating from the East and West Coasts of the United States, as well as Japan, where the Navy maintains a forward-deployed aircraft carrier . This will also help position the MQ-25s to best support carrier strike group training, including pre-deployment Composite Training Unit Exercises (COMPTUEX), as well as other exercises. Point Mugu is particularly well-positioned near an expansive collection of training ranges off the coast of southern California that the service regularly uses for various drills, carrier-related and otherwise. A map showing the various warning areas (W) and restricted airspace (R) off the coast of Point Mugu that is available to the US military for training and other purposes., USN From the environmental assessment report, we also now know that the Navy plans for a typical MQ-25 squadron to have four detachments. The Navy has yet to specify exactly how many Stingrays a typical detachment will have. A briefing officials from the service presented at the Tail Association’s annual symposium earlier this year, which was held online due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, said that, by 2030, a typical carrier air wing could have between five and eight of the drones. A briefing slide showing a projected carrier air wing as of 2030 with between five and eight MQ-25s., USN Regardless, these detachments will provide aerial refueling support to carrier air wings, a mission presently performed by F/A-18E/F Super Hornets equipped with buddy refueling stores. The tanker drones will allow those jets to focus on other missions, as well as reduce the overall strain on those aircraft, while, at the same time, significantly extending their reach. They will also be able to refuel Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighters as they begin to deploy as part of the service’s carrier air wings. In addition, the Stingrays will have a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability from the start and could very well gain the ability to conduct other missions as time goes on. USN USN For actual deployments, a single detachment will be attached to the assigned carrier airborne early warning squadron within the carrier air wing, units that presently fly the E-2C/D Hawkeye airborne command and control aircraft. “At sea, detachments from the Stingray CBUAS squadron will leverage personnel and maintenance administration as well as chain of command representation of the VAW [carrier airborne early warning] squadron with the CVW [carrier air wing],” the environmental assessment report notes. “Co-locating Stingray CBUAS squadrons with VAW squadrons ashore is important due to the synergies and efficiencies of the two codependent communities.” It has already been established that the Navy’s Airborne Command & Control Logistics Wing (ACCLOGWING), which presently oversees the service’s E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound fleets, the latter of which is headed for retirement in the coming years, will also be in charge of the Stingrays. The service had already revealed that the Hawkeye and Stingray communities would be particularly heavily tied together going forward, including the cross-training of E-2 crews as MQ-25 operators. Last month, Navy personnel from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron One (VX-1) and Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23) traveled to Boeing’s facilities in St. Louis Missouri to do three days of simulated training relating to operating the MQ-25. VX-1 and VX-23, which are both based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, are responsible for testing and evaluating of various aircraft and helicopters, including unmanned platforms. Among the naval aviators that made the trip was Lieutenant Venus Savage, the MQ-25 assistant operational test director for VX-1 and an MQ-25 air vehicle operator (AVO), who was spotted at Boeing’s St. Louis’ offices wearing a Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 125 (VAW-125) patch, further underscoring the burgeoning relationship between those two communities. Navy Lieutenant Venus Savage conducts simulated MQ-25 operations at Boeing’s offices in St. Louis., USN “Especially for operational test, we’re lucky to be involved this early in the program,” Savage said in a statement. “It helps when you get that side information from an experienced AVO that adds to what’s in the documentation. We were able to ask detailed questions and get clarification on what the checklists and commands are and they let us know what to expect from the air vehicle. It helps ingrain it in your memory because it’s more than just book learning.” Pictures of the training that Navy released also notably showed a desktop computer-based control interface that is indicative of the planned semi-autonomous concept of operations for the MQ-25. Of course, it’s not exactly clear how representative these simulators will be of the final ground control station design. Boeing has also been conducting flight testing of an MQ-25 demonstrator drone, also known as T1 , since September 2019. So far, it has flown 30 hours, in total. It is presently undergoing additional ground testing following the integration of an underwing buddy refueling store earlier this year. The T1 demonstrator carrying a buddy refueling store., Boeing The company is also under contract to build four Engineering Development Model (EDM) prototypes, with the goal of delivering the first one to the Navy next year. The service’s present plans call for the acquisition of a fleet of at least 72 MQ-25As. Thanks to this recent environmental assessment, we now have a much better understanding of how the Navy plans to organize and employ its future Stingrays, which are set to dramatically alter how its carrier air wings operate in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2020",New Details About Controversial Army Helicopter Flights In DC Emerge Ahead Of Tense Election,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent report has revealed a convoluted and in some cases disturbing chain of events that led to D.C. Army National Guard UH-72 Lakota and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying dangerously low over groups of protesters in Washington, D.C., this summer, actions that were improperly authorized and broke Army regulations. The new information about the incident, which had immediately drawn widespread criticism , comes as the nation’s capital, as well as other cities around the country, are bracing for protests and other potential unrest that may result from the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Defense One got the inside scoop on the helicopter flights that occurred on the night of June 1-2, which The War Zone was among the first to report on. You can get up to speed on what was known about what happened at the time in our initial stories on these events here and here . Defense One ‘s Katie Bo Williams also reported that the final report into the investigation appears to now be in bureaucratic limbo as the D.C. National Guard and the Department of Defense’s Inspector General wrangle over who is responsible for what. The individual who appears to have been most centrally at fault is Army Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Wingblade, the D.C. Army National Guard’s top aviation officer. At around 7:00 PM on June 1, Wingblade sent an Email to his immediate superior, Army Brigadier General Robert Ryan, who is the head of the Army component of the D.C. National Guard, to let him know Secret Service had given them special permission to conduct helicopter flights inside Washington’s heavily restricted airspace. Before the night in question, Army Major General William Walker, the head of the D.C. National Guard, as a whole, had ordered two UH-72s and three UH-60s to be put on alert at Davison Army Airfield in nearby Fairfax County, Virginia, in case there was a need for conduct medical evacuations, rapid troop movements, or other missions on short notice. At the time, the nation’s capital, among other cities, was seeing continued protests, and some associated violence, in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota the month before. A file photo of US Army UH-72 Lakota and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying over Washington, D.C., US Army The D.C. National Guard had approximately 1,200 troops on the street on the night of June 1-2 for crowd control operations, augmented by the controversial deployment of National Guard personnel from other states in a federal capacity, as well as federal law enforcement officers from various agencies . Active U.S. Army forces, including elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, were also in staging areas just outside the city, but were ultimately never employed in response to the protests. Shortly after he got Wingblade’s Email, Ryan called the aviation officer to get the five helicopters on alert into the air over the National Mall. Wingblade told investigators that he was under the impression that there was a desire to have the Lakotas and Black Hawks actively help disperse the protestors in line with a nightly curfew, beginning at 7:00 PM, which was in place in Washington at the time. “I need you to orbit around the cross [the center of the National Mall] to disperse any type of looting, mayhem, whatsoever,” is how he remembers the Brigadier General’s instructions. Ryan denied this, in his own sworn statements, in which he said that that intent of his order was to have the helicopters airborne to simply obverse the protests, as well as be on station for other missions, with the hope that their simple presence in the skies above might have a deterrent effect. Army Command Sergeant Major Michael Brooks, the D.C. National Guard’s Senior Enlisted Leader, who was also on the call said “At no time in the conversation did I hear BG Ryan instruct or authorize aviation assets to fly at low altitudes. Nor did BG Ryan speak of utilizing aviation assets to disperse crowds.” It’s not clear where the disconnect may have occurred. It’s worth noting that Wingblade was, unbeknownst to any of his superiors, driving in his car, heading home at the time. “They may very well be trying to protect the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff,” said Taheri, the retired National Guard Bureau two-star. “I suspect there was a lot more involvement from the highest level that they don’t want to highlight.”Regardless, after apparently misinterpreting Ryan’s instructions, Wingblade called an operations officer at Davison from the road and relayed the orders as he had understood them. “The tasking that I received was to kinda go over the crowds wherever there was any type of looting and then just try to orbit around the crowds, if there was any looting, and whatever that mission is, but just show a presence there if there is anything kinda crazy going on,” the aviation officer said he told his subordinates over the phone, despite his other comments about what he thought his superior officer was asking the helicopters to do. What happened next is well known from videos of UH-72s and UH-60s hovering at potentially dangerously low levels over groups of protesters, which quickly went viral online. Initially, there seems to have been some positive reaction within at least the D.C. National Guard to this use of these helicopters. https://youtube.com/watch?v=k1kXcZ7jYlI https://youtube.com/watch?v=TSLda23AdcU “LTC Wingblade, your helicopters are looking good!!” one message in a group text chain, which accompanied a picture of one of the helicopters flying over the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, said, according to one of the reports as seen by Defense One . “OMG! I am out here too. Incredible. I got special permission to launch. Full authorities,” Ryan responded. Criticism came swiftly, though, including from at least one other Army official. “Presidential approval…Fully vetted,” Ryan retorted. Major General Walker quickly ordered an investigation, which laid essentially all of the blame at the feet of Wingblade for misinterpreting his superior’s orders. It also found that no one in the chain command had secured the proper approval, under Army regulations, to employ air ambulance helicopters for non-medical missions. Four of the five helicopters on alert on June 1-2 were designated air ambulances. That initial investigation, which the Army conducted, also concluded the low-level flights were not dangerous based on the fact that the helicopters each had two engines and that absent a catastrophic failure of both of them, would have had enough power to safely avoid crashing into protestors below. There is no mention in Defense One ‘s report about any response to criticism that injuries on the ground could have easily occurred due to the rotor wash kicking up debris, which might also have also subjected the helicopters and their crews to unnecessary risks, something The War Zone explored in detail shortly after the incident. However, the Department of Defense’s Inspector General subsequently reviewed the findings and voiced concerns that it did not suitably explore Brigadier General Ryan’s role, or that of other superior officers in the chain of command, in the affair. Unlike state National Guards, since D.C. is not a state its chain of command goes through Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to the President of the United States, Donald Trump. When the final report, whatever its findings are, may become public is uncertain. There is a belief among some, inside and outside the U.S. military, that the entire investigation, which Army officials have since resubmitted with unknown revisions to the Department of Defense, is becoming politicized on one or more levels. “They may very well be trying to protect the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff,” now-retired Air Force Major General Mike Taheri, who last served as the Director of Staff at the National Guard Bureau, told Defense One. “I suspect there was a lot more involvement from the highest level that they don’t want to highlight.” “I don’t know what those conversations were, but at the end of the day Ryan was the task force commander and one of the units that he was responsible for violated nearly every FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] law to include international law by using a medevac [medical evacuation] helicopter to forcibly disperse peaceful protesters,” a member of the D.C. National Guard who was in the city during the incident also told the outlet. “When you look at it in totality, you’re like, ‘Holy shit.’ Ryan needs to be held accountable.” The entire debacle has certainly stayed in the minds of many Americans who were critical of the use of the National Guard helicopters at the time, especially D.C. residents. A very low-level flight yesterday by a Department of Energy Bell 412 helicopter, carrying the U.S. civil registration code N412DE, caused something of a stir online among those in and around the capital, despite a public announcement in advance about the sortie by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). “The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) will continue to conduct low-altitude helicopter flights over downtown Washington, D.C., primarily over the weekend of Oct. 31-Nov. 1, including over the restricted airspace that includes the National Mall. The flights are expected to conclude by Nov. 6,” NNSA said in a press release on Oct. 29. “The flights are part of a mission to measure background radiation in and around the Nation’s capital in preparation for the Presidential Inauguration, which is scheduled to take place Jan. 20, 2021.” NNSA had also conducted another round of these flights in the middle of October for the same purpose . N412DE is one of two Bell 412s that are part of NNSA’s Aerial Measuring System (AMS), which is maintained by its Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST) and also includes a number of Beachcraft King Air fixed-wing aircraft also configured for the nuke-sniffing mission. The helicopters routinely conduct aerial surveys well ahead of high-profile events, such as the Presidential Inauguration, to establish a baseline for what normal radiation levels are for a certain area. That way, flights conducted during the event in question will be more readily able to detect worrisome radiation spikes that might indicate the presence of a nuclear weapon or a “ dirty bomb ” full of radioactive material. AMS, which you can read more about in this previous War Zone piece , can also be called upon to assess the spread of radiation after a nuclear or radiological incident. The incident has also come to be seen as indicative of heavy-handed reactions to protests and unrest around the country then and since, broadly, including the controversial subsequent deployment of federal law enforcement units to multiple cities as part of what the Trump Administration dubbed Operation Legend . There concerns now that demonstrations and violence following the election could be met with similar responses. There are already reports that elements of the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Prisons have been put on alert to respond to any unrest. Both of these agencies previously contributed SWAT-like tactical teams to Operation Legend . Last week, the heads of the National Guards in Nebraska, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin, all publicly came out against any decision to federalize their personnel to respond to demonstrations or upheaval, as the Trump Administration had done in D.C. in response to the George Floyd protests. At the same time, however, National Guard elements in various states have been preparing for crowd control duties under the control of state authorities. “There would be no added benefit of federalizing those Guard forces,” Army Major General Jeff Holmes, the Tennessee National Guard’s Adjutant General, told reporters last week. “We can do more in the Title 32 [status] but under the governor’s control as commander-in-chief.” State National Guards operating under state authority have more leeway to conduct law enforcement style activities than federalized National Guard troops or active duty military personnel, who are both legally prohibited from performing many of those functions by the Posse Comitatus Act. You can read more about these legal issues in this previous War Zone piece . It very much remains to be seen what, if any, sizable protests or violence may erupt as a result of the election, the final results of which may not even be certified for some time. Several cities, including Washington, D.C., have been preparing for at least some disturbances, with some shops boarding up their windows. Authorities in the capital notably erected an additional anti-scaling fence around the White House overnight, as well. After all the controversy these flights caused, it is unlikely we will see U.S. military helicopters being used for crowd dispersal domestically anytime in the future, but the investigation does highlight major failings in the chain of command. Hopefully, we won’t see similar occurrences if indeed some sort of social unrest erupts following the Presidential election.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2020",Japan Considers Building Two Super-Sized Destroyers As An Alternative To Aegis Ashore,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports from the Japanese media say that the government is looking into the feasibility of procuring two new “super-destroyers” as an alternative to the pair of land-based Aegis Ashore systems, work on which was suspended earlier this year amid technical issues, rising costs, and domestic criticism. The new warships would also be focused on missile defense, primarily to defend against North Korean ballistic missiles , and equipped with a version of the Aegis combat system utilizing the Lockheed Martin AN/SPY-7 Long Range Discrimination Radar originally intended for the Aegis Ashore sites. Plans reportedly call for the Japanese Ministry of Defense to receive an interim report on the proposed destroyers in mid-November, before the government decides whether or not to proceed before the end of the year. One report from Nikkei Asia suggests that the plan is likely to be given the go-ahead. It’s unclear whether Japanese officials are looking at a new ship design or a derivative of a warship already in production. It is very possible that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) could receive additional vessels in the Maya class , one of which is already in service with another due to join the fleet in 2021. The Mayas already feature an advanced version of the Aegis combat system, or an enlarged derivative of the same class. The Maya class warships are themselves subvariants of the Atago class , which evolved from the Kongō class , a Japanese derivative of the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Aircraft fly in formation above the JMSDF Hatakaze class destroyer Shimakaze (DDG 172), left, the Atago class destroyer Ashigara (DDG 178), and the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Winnipeg (FFH 338) during Exercise Keen Sword 21 in the Philippine Sea in October 2020., U.S. NAVY/SEAMAN SANTIAGO NAVARRO According to a report from Tokyo’s Kyodo News agency, the Japanese government is now looking at vessels with a standard displacement of around 9,000 tons. The Maya class destroyers displace around 8,200 tons, but this would not preclude the development of a further expanded subclass. Indeed, it had been expected that the Maya class would eventually yield four hulls, so it remains possible that the final two will instead be completed to this revised specification, including AN/SPY-7 radars. Kyodo suggests that the thinking behind the increased size of the proposed new destroyers is the need to increase the available living space in the “harsh working environment due to North Korea’s ballistic missile alert.” It is worth noting that the U.S. Navy has pursued something of a similar strategy with the upcoming Flight III Arleigh Burkes , which displace around 9,700 tons and represent what the U.S. Navy says is the fullest extent to which that hullform can be expanded upon. As noted, the reported Japanese plan is for the new warships to be equipped with the same AN/SPY-7 radars that were to have been used in the Aegis Ashore system, which Japanese authorities had already agreed to buy . The additional requirements of this new system, in terms of space and manpower, may demand a revision of the superstructure of the existing Maya class, which could, in turn, demand changes to the hull. The main control center at the Aegis Ashore missile defense test complex in Kauai, Hawaii. Japan’s Aegis Ashore sites were expected to be of a similar design, but with the AN/SPY-7 radar instead of the AN/SPY-1 seen here., KYODO VIA AP IMAGES Some funding for the two additional destroyers will be allocated from the fiscal year 2021 budget, Nikkei Asia reports, although additional costs will be involved in modifying the AN/SPY-7 for installation on warships. It is important to note that Lockheed Martin is already supplying versions of this radar for the future Canadian Surface Combatant , a class of ships based on the BAE Systems Type 26 frigate design , and Spain’s forthcoming F110 class frigates , both of which are smaller than the proposed destroyer Japan is now considering building. Japan has considered alternatives to create special-purpose ships or offshore platforms dedicated to intercepting missiles, which were judged to be cheaper than procuring more “super-destroyers.” However, these options were too judged to be too vulnerable to attacks from the air or by submarines. Unlike both these options and Aegis Ashore, a new class, or sub-class, of full-scale destroyers also offers a greater degree of flexibility, being able to take on a range of missions in addition to missile defense. The ships will also be a key node in the U.S. missile defense shield, which makes their procurement a priority for the U.S. as well as Japan. Whatever the vessel ends up looking like, it will eventually field the SM-3 MkIIA interceptor. The missile will have extended engagement capabilities against more missile types over the currently fielded SM-3 variants. You can read all about this missile and the U.S.-Japan consortium that developed it here , here , and here . Raytheon Raytheon Beyond the ship’s design questions and weaponry, this plan raises additional questions, especially around personnel issues, which could still present a problem. It’s worth recalling that the decision to procure Aegis Ashore systems in the first place was originally based on concerns about the limited number of available JMSDF crews to man traditional ships. Fielding another two major surface combatants will accordingly increase the pressure on the Japanese naval arm to expand its personnel numbers. The pressures on the available crew have already led to plans to introduce a new class of smaller, multi-mission “destroyer,” known as the 30DX, or FFM, a categorization that highlights that this is actually more of a frigate-type warship. With a displacement of 3,900 tons, these ships have been specifically tailored to cope with the JMSDF personnel shortage and the first example is expected to be launched imminently . While cheaper than Aegis-equipped warships, and with a crew around a third the size, the multi-mission design is unable to perform the anti-ballistic missile role. Providing the new Aegis-equipped destroyers are approved, they could provide a valuable means of defending against threats emanating from North Korea, as well as projecting power in the East China Sea and elsewhere. Japan’s defense budget request for the 2021 fiscal year was the biggest on record , at around $55 billion, and reflects the growing importance assigned to the country’s military, to face off threats from both North Korea and China. Whatever shape and size the proposed new warships take, it is clear that the JMSDF destroyer fleet is in the ascendancy. Buoyed by increasing budgets, the defense ministry plans on boosting overall destroyer hull numbers to 54, compared to just below 50 at present. Cost, however, will still be a factor, reflected by the fact that ultimately 22 of Japan’s destroyers are planned to be the less-expensive 30DX/FFM warships, rather than full-scale destroyers like the Maya class.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 29, 2021",Was The Secret RQ-180 Stealth Drone Really Photographed Over The Mojave Desert?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A photo taken in early October 2020 of what appears to be a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE), low observable (stealthy) unmanned aircraft flying high over the Mojave Desert north of Edwards Air Force Base in California emerged on Instagram over the weekend. The source had taken other images in similar locations that were not of any unique interest and the photo itself looks legitimate upon examination, but does it actually provide our first glimpse of the Air Force’s secret high-flying drone, the so-called RQ-180 ? The answer is maybe. It was flying in more or less a logical place for that aircraft to be, especially as we understand that at least some RQ-180 operations have migrated to Edwards , but the fact that it was doing so during daytime is odd, to say the least. Its planform is what we would expect from a HALE low-observable drone, and is very similar to that of the B-21 Raider , another Northrop Grumman product like RQ-180 and a stealth aircraft intended to cruise at high altitudes. You can read all about how the B-21 got this unique high-flying configuration in this past War Zone feature . Even the aircraft’s white color would make some sense in the testing environment, but also because unmanned penetrating UAVs use white/cream/light pastel colors to better hide at altitude during the daytime. Still, it isn’t clear if the RQ-180 would wear a dark or light scheme, as it would be able to persist for very long periods, which would stretch from day into night and back again. Regardless, there is one major issue. Upon initial examination of the photo, I said to myself “oh, the Polecat’s back in the air!” What I am referring to is Lockheed Skunk Works’ P-175 Polecat experimental flying-wing drone that was flown in 2005 as a technology demonstrator. It was housed adjacent to Yucca Dry Lake in the Department of Energy’s section of the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) during its trials. The aircraft eventually malfunctioned and crashed and that was the end of the somewhat mysterious program, or at least that’s what we were told. The P-175 Polecat., Lockheed Martin P-175, Lockheed Martin P-175, Lockheed Martin P-175, Lockheed Martin Yet we know that other Polecat fuselages were built—one of the program’s goals was pushing advanced composite structure manufacturing and design to the limits of technology at the time. In fact, one laid shrink-wrapped in the backlot of the Skunk Works sprawling complex at Plant 42 in Palmdale for years—that is until a few years ago. A 2015 satellite image of a building at Skunk Works’ plant with the Polecat fuselage sitting in the backlot area., Google Earth In fact, the aircraft seen is in the image is a dead ringer for Polecat in every way, including its twin centrally-mounted engines, slender, clipped wings, and bulbous ventral shape. Polecat was also the exact same color and flying it in the middle of the day wouldn’t be a huge issue as it is a declassified program. Why would Lockheed revive Polecat? Well, for similar reasons that the RQ-180 exists , and more. In fact, we posited it was a near-perfect platform for the airborne laser trials that the Missile Defense Agency was planning just a couple of years ago. You can read all about this initiative and the P-175 Polecat in this past piece of ours . A revived and upgraded Polecat could work as a testbed for all types of stealthy flying-wing-related technologies, including some of the components being integrated into the B-21. At the same time, there are only so many ways to skin the proverbial cat when it comes to the best configurations for a high-flying, stealthy, subsonic, flying-wing aircraft. As mentioned earlier, Polecat has much in common with the shape of the B-21 Raider, at least based on the renderings we have seen of the bomber, which is a glowing endorsement of just how far head the Skunk Works was with the Polecat’s basic shape. It is very possible the RQ-180 shares a very similar shape, as well. In fact, the B-21’s configuration, once again a Northrop Grumman product like the RQ-180, would be evidence of this and the company has released a number of high-flying notional UAV designs that are very similar in appearance going back nearly two decades. An artist’s rendering of the B-21 Raider., USAF So, what do I think we are seeing here. It’s unclear, but I would not be surprised if this is indeed our first glimpse of the RQ-180. At the same time, the possibility that this could be Polecat reborn, or a derivative of it, is also valid, especially seeing as it was flying during the day and a dead-ringer to that previously declassified platform. In fact, both could be true. While only one could be seen in the image, both types could be flying today and this may have complicated some of the information we know about the RQ-180. For instance, Guy Norris over at Aviation Week says the RQ-180 has a new nickname: The unusual light color of the vehicle is also believed to be a link to the RQ-180. A local nickname around Edwards AFB for the RQ-180 is the “Great White Bat”–or sometimes “Shikaka”–a fictional sacred white bat from the 1995 movie Ace Venture 2 [sic; Ace Ventura 2 ]. The reality is that it could be the Polecat and not the RQ-180 that is operating in the open at the base from time to time, while the RQ-180 operates more in the shadows. We just don’t know. It is all but certain the RQ-180 exists though, while the Polecat flying again is more speculative, at least at this time. Either way, this is exciting stuff and yet another indicator of a capability that will increasingly become a central fixture of the future of high-end air combat—high-altitude, long-endurance, penetrating unmanned aircraft—is moving forward. Our entire report on the RQ-180, which has been a year in the making, will address all this and so much more in the very near future. So standby for that. In the meantime, keep looking up!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 30, 2021",Deadly Taliban Attack On Governor’s Volleyball-Playing Bodyguards Points To Armed Drone Use,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Taliban reportedly used a small drone to kill four of Kunduz province head Asadullah Omarkhel’s bodyguards while they played volleyball in the governor’s compound yesterday. If true, this would be one of the first known instances of a successful drone attack by the Afghan militant group, as well as its most deadly such attack to date.Â The New York Times was among the first to report the attack, which took place at the guesthouse within the governor’s residence in Kunduz province’s capital of the same name on Nov. 1, 2020. Kunduz, both the city and province, have seen continued fighting between the Taliban and government security forces despite ongoing negotiations between U.S. and Taliban officials on a potential peace deal. The militant group briefly took control of the city in 2015, but its forces were eventually ejected with the help of heavy American air and other support, a counter-offensive that included the infamous accidental destruction of a Doctors Without Borders-operated hospital by a U.S. Air Force AC-130U Spooky gunship. â€œWhen the Kunduz governor bodyguards were playing volleyball in the governorâ€™s guesthouse, the explosion took place among them,” Ghulam Rabbani Rabbani, who sits on Kunduzâ€™s provincial council, told The Times . “It is not clear that it was an explosion or a missile or drone attack.” The Taliban used “a new method of attack,” Fazal Karim Aimaq, who represents Kunduz in the country’s National Assembly in Kabul, wrote on Facebook, according to The Times , but did not elaborate. The Taliban itself has not yet offered any details of how it carried out the attack, but The Times reported that there have been previous, unreported instances of the militant group using small drones to drop improvised explosive payloads or to act as improvised missiles themselves.Â It’s unclear if any of those other attacks have resulted in deaths or injuries. In May, one person did die in a very similar strike on a party at the governor’s compound in Kunduz, which a spokesperson for Asadullah Omarkhel blamed on a missile, but may well have also been carried out by a small armed drone. The Taliban’s use of small quad-copter-like drones to conduct reconnaissance on Afghan forces and members of the NATO-led coalition in the country, as well as film attacks for propaganda purposes, is hardly new. In 2018, Tom Lockhart, then the Director of the Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office (SDPE) at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), described how prevalent the militant group’s use of these small unmanned platforms during a trip to the country the year before. “Coming back from Afghanistan last year in October [2017], I was at a base where we had a lot of unmanned systems sitting over and watching everything we do,” Lockhart said. “For the future, our airmen would like to not be monitored 24/7.” The employment of quad and hex-copter-style drones to carry out attacks using small improvised munitions is also well established and has only become a growing threat since ISIS began very publicly employing the tactic in Iraq and Syria since at least 2017. The very low barrier to entry when it comes to the cost and difficulty of acquiring the necessary technology to carry out these kinds of attacks mean that other non-state groups, including drug cartels in Mexico , have also begun carrying them out. In 2018, a group opposed to dictatorial Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro notably attempted to assassinate him in this manner in a very high-profile attack. That the Taliban may be more actively carrying out attacks using low-end drones certainly reflects a worrisome development with regards to the group, which has already been employing other more modern technologies, especially night vision and thermal optics , in its operations in recent years. At the same time, it is hardly surprising given the obvious benefits drones could offer, especially when it comes to targeting VIPs If the attacks this past weekend and in May were carried out by drones, it shows that the Taliban now has the ability to execute more precise attacks inside what have been traditionally more secure areas in Afghanistan, such as inside fortress-like government compounds. In the past, the Taliban has more commonly relied on insiders to gain access and then launch suicide attacks inside these kinds of facilities to try to kill key government figures. It has also long had the ability to launch indirect, but also more imprecise attacks using rockets and mortars against these kinds of targets. While the immediate message from the Taliban to Kunduz governor Omarkhel seems clear, how the militant group’s continued use of this tactic in that province or anywhere in the country might ultimately impact the course of the conflict is less so. Talks between the U.S. government and the Taliban, as well as between the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan, appear to have stalled despite the Trump Administration signing a framework agreement with Taliban representatives for how to proceed in February.Â At the same time, despite continued Taliban attacks and other activities intended to undermine the authority of the central government in Kabul, there is a continued push by President Donald Trump’s Administration to draw down U.S. forces in Afghanistan.Â Beyond the Taliban, there is the matter of the ISIS franchise in the country, which also presents a serious threat to peace and stability and that appears to have just carried out an attack on Kabul University today, killing 19 people and wounded 22 more. The Taliban have denied responsibility. The U.S. military has also acknowledged conducting airstrikes on what is formally known as ISIS-Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) in such a way as to benefit the Taliban , who are also fighting this terrorist group. Last month, The Washington Post published a detailed piece on the U.S. forces, including elements of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), that are running what has come to be euphemistically referred to as the “Taliban Air Force.” A #MOAB bomb strikes #ISIS cave & tunnel systems in eastern #Afghanistan . The strike was designed to minimize risk to Afghan and U.S. Forces pic.twitter.com/7pfBYQzk5F — Department of Defense ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@DeptofDefense) April 14, 2017 Of course, small drones carrying out attacks in Afghanistan also simply underscore how this threat continues to proliferate and become more ever-present among both non-state and state actors. Striking the governor’s residence in Kunduz only further highlights how this technology could enable very real attacks on VIPs and other sensitive targets anywhere in the world . All of this, as well as the need for the development of countermeasures , is something that The War Zone has explored and underscored on multiple occasions . Just last week, the U.S. State Department issued what appeared to be the first-ever alert of a possible impending low-end drone or missile attack in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh. Thankfully, that attack does not appear to have occurred, but Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen did launch so-called “ suicide drones ” against targets in southern Saudi Arabia on the same day, something that has become a regular occurrence . All told, Taliban drone attacks look set to present an increasingly serious challenge for Afghan security forces and their international partners, but it’s not at all surprising that the militant group is employing this relatively-low cost and potentially high-reward tactic.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 26, 2021",Putin Says He’ll Limit Cruise Missile Deployments To Get Missile Defense Site Inspections,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With Russian and American officials still locked in negotiations over the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or New START, the Kremlin has now put its controversial 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile on the table as part of a separate arms control pitch. While Moscow continues to deny it, Washington and its NATO allies say this weapon, also known as the SSC-8 “Screwdriver,” violated the terms of the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, and it directly led to that agreement’s final collapse last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a formal statement on “additional steps to de-escalate the situation in Europe in the wake of the termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty” via the Kremlin’s website on Oct. 26, 2020. This comes more than a year after the U.S. government formally withdrew from the INF over the 9M729/SSC-8. “Given the unrelenting tension between Russia and NATO, new threats to European security are becoming evident,” Putin’s statement says. “Under these circumstances, active efforts are required to reduce the deficit of trust and to strengthen regional and global stability, as well as to reduce the risks arising from misunderstandings and disagreements in the sphere of missile weapons.” The most significant component of Putin’s new post-INF offer is some sort of unspecified “verification measure” that would prove to the United States that there are no 9M729/SSC-8s in its Kaliningrad enclave now and that it would stay that way in the future. This Russian territory, which lies on the Baltic Sea , is geographically separated from the rest of the country, sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland, two NATO members. A transporter-erector-launcher, as well as two missile canisters, seen to the left, that Russia showed publicly in 2019 and said were associated with the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile., Sergei Bobylev/TASS The highly strategic enclave, which is home to major air and naval bases, offers the Russian military an extension of anti-access and area denial bubble in the region, including through the deployment of surface-to-air missile systems and ground-based anti-ship cruise missiles . It also offers a valuable forward base for ballistic missiles and ground-launched land-attack cruise missiles, including the 9M729/SSC-8. The exact maximum range of the 9M729/SSC-8 is unclear, but the U.S. government said that it violated the INF, which prohibited the United States and Russia from fielding ballistic and ground-based cruise missiles able to hit targets between 300 and 3,400 miles away. With a range of around 1,500 miles, this weapon would be able to hit anywhere in Europe from Kaliningrad. You can read more about what is known as the 9M729/SSC-8 in this past War Zone piece . In exchange, what Putin is asking for primarily is access to U.S. Aegis Ashore missile defense sites in Europe so that Russian inspectors can similarly verify that they won’t be able to launch offensive weapons. While the INF was in effect, the Kremlin routinely accused the United States of violating the deal with Aegis Ashore. However, the U.S. military has long publicly said that the variant of the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System that Aegis Ashore uses lack the fire control components necessary to launch land-attack strike weapons, such as the Tomahawk cruise missile, and there are no plans to install them in the future. Russia has also contended that Aegis Ashore threatens its nuclear deterrent capabilities, something the system is in no way capable of doing. Putin’s statement appears to offer to keep the 9M729/SSC-8 out of Kaliningrad as long as the United States, or any other NATO member, do not field missiles that would have been covered on the defunct INF treaty in Europe. Since the agreement’s collapse, the U.S. military has initiated the development of a variety of previously banned weapons, including a ground-based Tomahawk system and a new ballistic missile . The U.S. Army has also now announced that it plans for its future ground-launched Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), now unrestricted by the INF, to have a maximum range of up to 930 miles . “Remaining committed to the consistent position on the full compliance of the 9M729 missile with the provisions of the previously existing INF Treaty, the Russian Federation, nevertheless, is ready, in the spirit of goodwill, to continue not to deploy 9M729 missiles in European Russia, but do so only provided NATO countries take reciprocal steps that preclude the deployment of the weapons earlier prohibited under the INF Treaty in Europe,” Putin’s statement said, reiterating Russia’s position that the 9M729/SSC-8 did not violate the INF. It remains to be seen whether the U.S. government will respond favorably to Putin’s offer and whether it would be possible for either side to agree to verification mechanisms that satisfy their respective concerns. The United States had previously offered Russia opportunities to inspect the Aegis Ashore sites over INF compliance, but the Kremlin declined. The Russian government also denied the very existence of 9M729/SSC-8 for years before officially revealing it and then claiming it was not in violation of the treaty. Also, the 9M729/SSC-8 uses a transporter-erector-launcher that is road-mobile and air-transportable, making it very easy for Russia to deploy the weapons to Kaliningrad on short notice, should it decide to abrogate its part of this new deal. Its range means it would still be very capable, especially against targets in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe , from within Russia proper, as well. It’s not clear from Putin’s statement whether the Kremlin would be willing to accept the U.S. government making similar arrangements to rapidly deploy its own post-INF weapons to Europe as being within the spirit of the proposed moratorium. There is a possibility that both sides could look to expand Putin’s offer to a continent-wide moratorium, as well. A transporter-erector-launcher for the BGM-109G Gryphon, a ground-based version of the Tomahawk cruise missile that the US military fielded in Europe in the 1980s before the signing of the now-defunct INF. , DOD Beyond that, the U.S. government could potentially see this as a way to mitigate potential threats in Europe, to its interests and those of its allies, while still offering the opportunity to field post-INF weapons in the Asia-Pacific region with an eye toward challenging China. Before the final collapse of the INF, the United States had also argued that the treaty had outlived its purpose, regardless of any Russian violations, and had given the Chinese an unrestricted advantage in the categories of weapons it covered. Still, Putin’s statement suggests that there is a hope that there could be a freeze on the deployment of these weapons in that part of the world, where Russia also has its own interests, as well. “We also call on all the stakeholders to search for ways to maintain stability and prevent missile crises ‘in a world without the INF Treaty’ as it applies to the Asia-Pacific region,” the statement added. Critics of withdrawing from the treaty have also raised concerns about potential future arms races in both Europe and Asia. No matter what, it is interesting that Putin is publicly offering up restrictions of any kind on the deployment of the 9M729/SSC-8 in exchange for what, at least on the surface, appear to be relatively limited concessions. The Kremlin could see additional future value in trying to get Washington back to the negotiating table on INF-like arms control arrangements now. It also presents another opportunity to frame the U.S. government as being solely responsible for killing the treaty and creating new uncertainty and instability in Europe and elsewhere, which could be useful for domestic and foreign propaganda purposes. The US military’s Aegis Ashore missile defense site in Romania. Another such site is under construction in Poland. Putin says he is looking to be able to send inspectors to these sites in exchange for not sending the 9M729/SSC-8 to Kaliningrad., USN All of this also comes at a time when the United States and Russia appear to be deadlocked over what to do about the strategic-focused New START deal , which is set to expire in a matter of months absent a formal agreement to extend it. With regard to that treaty, the Kremlin has offered the possibility of a one-year extension with no preconditions, while Washington wants a freeze in the total numbers of nuclear weapons on both sides, as well. There is a very real possibility that Washington’s negotiation position, as well as its general stance on arms control, could change dramatically in the very near future if President Donald Trump loses his re-election bid to former Vice President and Senator Joe Biden in the upcoming election in November. The Russian government’s proposed short-term New START extension may well have arisen, in part, from a desire to wait and see what administration the Kremlin will be dealing with next year. This new post-INF offer could similarly be intended as a signal to a possible future Biden Administration about its willingness to go back to the negotiating table on other issues, too. All told, neither Moscow nor Washington look headed toward cutting a new INF-style treaty, but this new Kremlin pitch could offer a framework for the two countries to begin talking anew about confidence-building measures and what they might want from the other in the post-INF world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",SEAL Team Six Executes Long Distance Rescue Operation Of Kidnapped American In Nigeria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. special operations forces, including members of the U.S. Navy’s elite SEAL Team Six , have rescued an American citizen, who was kidnapped just days ago in the northwest African country of Niger, in a raid in neighboring Nigeria. You can read more about what is known about the abduction of 27-year-old Philip Walton from his home in the Nigerien village of Massalata, less than five miles from the Nigerian border, on Oct. 26, in The War Zone ‘s previous reporting on that incident. At the time, we had predicted that some type of special operations mission operation to rescue Mr. Walton could be imminent. ABC News was first to report on the operation, which occurred at an as-yet-undisclosed location in Northern Nigeria and was conducted with cooperation from Nigerien and Nigerian authorities. The Pentagon has now confirmed that the rescue mission took place in the early hours of Oct. 31, 2020, and was successful, with Walton now safely in the care of the U.S. State Department. “U.S. forces conducted a hostage rescue operation during the early hours of 31 October in Northern Nigeria to recover an American citizen held hostage by a group of armed men. This American citizen is safe and is now in the care of the U.S. State Department,” Jonathan Hoffman, the Chief Pentagon Spokesperson, said in a statement. “No U.S. military personnel were injured during the operation. We appreciate the support of our international partners in conducting this operation.” The Pentagon statement did not say how many members of the armed group who kidnapped Walton had been killed or wounded, but ABC News’s report said that all but one of the captors had died in the raid. The status of the remaining individual is unclear. Details about the exact composition of the raiding force, beyond the inclusion of SEAL Team Six, are limited. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided intelligence about Walton’s location and Marine Corps special operations units deployed in northwest Africa helped to determine where he was being held, according to ABC News. The raid also included the extremely long-distance movement of forces via multiple C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft flights and the employment of a quartet of both CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors and MC-130 special operations transports , the latter of which pushed through Rota, Spain, before continuing to their target. AC-130 gunships and a large contingent of aerial refueling tankers also supported this operation. The armed group who took Walton remains unidentified, but is said to have not been associated with any known terrorist groups in the region, pointing to some form of criminal enterprise. This would align with the initial reports about the circumstances of Walton’s abduction. However, as ABC News noted, criminal groups in the region do have a history of selling foreign hostages to terrorist organizations. Concern that the American national might find himself at the center of just such a transaction was reportedly the impetus for the operation. This region of northwest Africa is home to multiple factions aligned with both ISIS and Al Qaeda. One of these groups, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), was responsible for the infamous ambush of U.S. and Nigerien forces outside the southwestern village of Tongo Tongo in 2017, which led to the death of four Americans and four Nigeriens. Niger, where the U.S. military formally opened a new, large base last year, is a major hub for American counter-terrorism operations in the region, as a whole. Nigeria, which has been battling the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram , and now its splinter faction, the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP), for years now, has also been an important regional partner for the United States in combating terrorism in northwest Africa. This is a developing story and The War Zone is already working to confirm additional details and we will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Update: @Aircraftspots spots, a master open-source plane tracker and radio interceptor, has more details about some of the aircraft that took part in the mission, telling The War Zone : The aerial operation consisted of multiple special operations command and aerial refueling aircraft which were all forward deployed to NAS Rota, Spain for the operation. These included four MC-130Js callsigns PINCH41-44, four CV-22s callsigns JOLT31-34, one AC-130J callsign RCH1009, one P-8A callsign MN801, and six KC-135Rs callsigns  QID636/638-642. All of the aircraft flew south over Africa down to a task area near Niger or Nigeria. Update: Here is the official statement from the White House: Last night, at my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage in Nigeria, kidnapped just 96 hours earlier. United States Special Forces executed a daring nighttime operation to rescue their fellow American with exceptional skill, precision, and bravery. No United States Service Members were harmed. The former hostage is currently in good health and has been reunited with his family. Securing the freedom of Americans held in captivity abroad has been a top national security priority of my Administration. Since the beginning of my Administration, we have rescued over 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries. Today’s operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and criminal thugs who mistakenly believe they can kidnap Americans with impunity. It’s also worth noting that some sources state that the SEALs parachuted into the area to initiate the rescue and then were flown out, presumably by the CV-22Bs.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 31, 2020","American Kidnapped In Niger, A Major Hub For Counter-Terrorism Ops in Northwest Africa","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An American citizen living in the northwest African country of Niger was kidnapped earlier this week by unknown gunmen and is being held for ransom. Though 27-year-old Philip Walton is said not to be an employee of the U.S. government or any other organization with ties to the United States, Niger is a major hub for U.S. military activities in this part of Africa targeting terrorist organizations linked to both ISIS and Al Qaeda. In 2017, militants from the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara infamously killed four U.S. military service members, as well as four Nigerien troops, in an ambush near the southwestern village of Tongo Tongo, where they had stopped after an abortive attempt to kill or capture Doundou Chefou, one of that group’s leaders. Reuters was first to report Walton’s abduction from his home in the village of Massalata, which is situated less than five miles north of the border with Nigeria and just over 200 miles east of the country’s capital Niamey, on Oct. 26, 2020. Six gunmen armed with AK-47-type assault rifles are said to have demanded money from the American national, who offered an equivalent to between $35 and $40 in Nigerien francs, and then searched his house, before forcing him to go with them at gunpoint. His wife, daughter, and brother were all there at the time, but were left unharmed. There are conflicting reports about whether the armed men arrived on motorbikes , a common mode of transportation in the region, or on foot . Walton is reportedly the son of a Christian missionary also living in the country, but it is unclear if he is directly involved in this work. Local authorities said that his father, Bruce Walton, subsequently received a phone call demanding an unknown ransom. The U.S. State Department subsequently confirmed the kidnapping and said “we are providing their family all possible consular assistance” in a statement to various outlets . Bruce Walton and other local officials say that the gunmen appeared to be members of the Fulani ethnic group , but it’s unclear what that assessment is based on. The Fulani are a traditionally nomadic, pastoral group, with significant populations in at least 17 countries, including Niger, in north and west Africa. There are unconfirmed reports that the men who took the younger Walton may have taken him across the border into Nigeria. A map of Niger showing the approximate location of the village of Massalata, as well as its extreme proximity to the border with Nigeria to the south. Niger’s capital Niamey and the major central city of Agadez are visible to the west and northeast, respectively., Google Maps The predominantly Muslim Fulani are not broadly associated with any specific regional terrorist group, but they have often been caught up in the fighting with and between those organizations. ISIS and Al Qaeda-linked terrorists, for instance, have played off existing ethnic tensions between Fulani and other groups in Mali, to the west of Niger, to try to gain sway over certain communities. Regardless, no group has, so far, claimed responsibility for Walton’s abduction. It is possible that the gunmen were simply criminals looking to profit from the kidnapping. Reuters did report that at least six foreign hostages, in total, were being held by various Islamist terrorist groups in Niger , as well as Burkina Faso and Mali at the time of Walton’s abduction. Earlier this month Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, also known by the acronym JNIM, the latest iteration of Al Qaeda’s franchise in Mali, had also notably released three Europeans, including a 75-year-old French aid worker and two Italians, as well as a Malian politician, as part of a controversial swap for 100 terrorist prisoners with the Malian government. Terrorist groups are also known to simply attack foreigners, as well as government security forces, across the region. In August, ISGS claimed responsibility for an attack in which they killed six French aid workers, as well as the Nigerien driver and guide, in the Koure wildlife reserve, some 40 miles west of Niamey. No matter what the exact circumstances turn out to be, kidnapping an American in Niger does shine a light on U.S. military operations in the region and this country, specifically. In 2013, then President Barack Obama announced the deployment of U.S. forces to the country to begin flying MQ-9 Reaper drones , on unarmed surveillance missions only, from Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey. American personnel walk toward an MQ-9 Reaper inside a hangar at Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey., USAF The American military presence in Niger subsequently expanded significantly, with the country now being a major hub for U.S. forces deployed in support of Operation Juniper Shield, the nickname for the overarching U.S. counter-terrorism campaign in north and west Africa, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . In October 2019, American forces officially began conducting operations from a new, much larger base near the city of Agadez in the center of the country, which you can read more about in this previous War Zone story . After the Tongo Tongo incident, the U.S. military had also reportedly gained Nigerien government approval to conduct drone strikes from bases in the country. Beyond unmanned aircraft operations, Agadez can more easily accommodate large U.S. military transport aircraft, such as the C-17A Globemaster III and C-130 Hercules , than often cramped ramps at Diori Hamani International Airport, which also hosts French and German military aircraft and personnel. This, together with its large overall size, which already houses significant facilities beyond the airstrip, makes it a much more versatile facility for supporting a wide array of operational activities. A satellite image showing the large perimeter around the new base in Agadez, Niger, as of September. , Google Earth A close up of the airstrip, with a C-17A Globemaster III cargo aircraft visible to the left., Google Earth The U.S. military, as well as private military contractors supporting American forces, does still maintain a significant presence at Diori Hamani. American troops, primarily special operations forces , train and otherwise advise Nigerien military units, as well as conduct targeted counter-terrorism operations, such as the failed attempt to kill or capture Doundou Chefou in 2017, from a constellation of smaller sites around the country. As the American force posture has expanded, the threats from terrorists in the region have also grown. The base in Agadez, in particular, has also drawn criticism from civil society groups inside Niger, especially those that are also critical of the country’s President Mahamadou Issoufou, a long-time opposition figure who first assumed the office in 2011 and who is now accused of becoming increasingly dictatorial himself. The 2011 election was part of a transition back to civil authority after elements of the Nigerien armed forces had ousted Mamadou Tandja, who had been president since 1999, in a coup the previous year. There have been reports for years now about potential cuts to the U.S. military force posture across Africa, as well, as the Pentagon has sought to refocus itself toward so-called “great power competition” against major adversaries, such as Russia and China. There has even been talk about shutting down the American component of the base at Agadez despite the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in its construction. How all of this may or may not impact efforts to secure Philip Walton’s safe release remains to be seen. If a terrorist group turns out to have been involved in his kidnapping, or actionable intelligence exists as to his whereabouts and there is a concern his life may be in jeopardy, the U.S. could potentially launch a military operation to recover him and punish those who snatched him.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 22, 2020",F-117s Photographed Flying Out Of Nellis AFB For The First Time In Over A Decade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The small pocket force of still active F-117s that are flying in the aggressor and test and evaluation roles continues to expand its operations beyond the confines of its ‘childhood’ and ‘retirement’ home of Tonopah Test Range Airport , located in a remote swathe of Southern Nevada. Now, after deploying briefly to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego last week, a bizarrely high-profile operation for the traditionally extremely shy Nighthawks, the type has returned to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, a place that its operations have been tied directly to, in one way or another, throughout its active service. This is the first known visit of a Nighthawk to the base since its retirement 12 years ago. The photos of the F-117s flying out of Nellis come to us from aviation photographer Santos Caceres, who goes by santos_caceres.lv on Instagram. He snapped the shots off base at around 3:40 pm on October 30th, 2020. F-117s were also seen in the pattern overhead the huge airbase in the morning. The aircraft flew under their staple, but still mysterious ‘KNIGHT’ callsign. Santos Caceres The F-117 force was officially retired in 2008, but has become increasingly active in recent years . Although the handful of flying F-117s had remained very shy in nature , not venturing beyond the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) , this has since changed with Nighthawks flying in support of naval group workups off the Southern California coast , and then months later deploying to Miramar for what appeared to be similar activities. Now, the stealth combat jet’s return to Nellis, in broad daylight, makes the change in operational security for the type crystal clear. It also makes complete sense as they have been flying alongside the 64th Aggressor Squadron and private contractor aggressors in the adversary role over the NTTR for some time now, and to an increasing degree, even taking part in Red Flag wargames earlier this year. What exactly the presence of F-117s at Nellis means in the near term isn’t clear. It is very possible that the type will start staging from there for major exercises in the future. This would provide much smoother integration with the rest of the ‘red air’ forces that emanate from the base during major training and test events . As we have discussed in-depth , there is a great need for low-observable adversary threat replication for fleet pilots, as well as a need to face off against dissimilar types. There is no tactical aircraft we know of that is more dissimilar to frontline types than the F-117. Its stealthy characteristics, paired with creative tactics, could really give ‘the good guys’ a run for their money. The same is true for weapons and tactics development operations with the operational test community at Nellis. The F-117’s very well studied signature, including its reduced infrared signature, is clearly a major reason for its use in developmental roles, as I posited six years ago along with the aircraft’s potential utility as an aggressor. So, are we getting to the point where the Air Force will just be open and even celebratory about the F-117s unique little role in its sprawling air combat ecosystem? Maybe. Santos Caceres Clearly, the security around the program has changed, but it isn’t clear if the Air Force is planning on actively promoting it. We reached out to Air Combat Command last week about the F-117’s visit to Miramar. Although they were kind enough to respond to our query with something, it was very limited in nature: The Air Force retired the F-117 from active service, but pilots from the Air Force Test Center still fly them for limited research activities. Still, this visit could have been a prelude to a bigger media operation around the F-117’s recent higher profile. We would all love to know more about its current roles and even the chance to see it again in action, at least before they disappear forever sometime later this decade. Eventually, the F-35 will take up the stealthy aggressor role, which could eventually put an end to Nighthawk operations, at least in the red air capacity. At the same time, the aircraft is unique enough, and its ‘first generation’ stealthy characteristics are also quite special in their own right, that keeping the Nighthawk around longer in smaller numbers is a real possibility. Although about a dozen F-117s are earmarked for museums, and some have already been delivered to them , there are still around four dozen F-117s either flying or in storage at Tonopah, so that in itself is a huge spare parts bin to pull from to keep half a dozen or so jets airworthy for an extended period of time. As it sits now, all of the non-museum F-117s are mandated to be destroyed at a rate of four per year, but that has not happened just yet as far as we know. As such, the F-117 should be at least available for support operations throughout the decade. The War Zone has reached out to Nellis Air Force base for comment on their special throwback visitor. We will let you know what we find out.

The Japanese Ministry of Defense has formally laid out the path it will take in its effort to create an advanced manned fighter, awarding the main development contract to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. At the same time, Japanese authorities confirmed that a yet to be announced overseas partner will also be involved in the program. The announcement that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) would be heading up the future fighter project, with overall responsibility for the aircraft’s development, was made today by Japan’s Minister of Defense Nobuo Kishi. Beyond talk of foreign cooperation on designing the aircraft itself, it was also confirmed that work on the engine will be subcontracted to another company yet to be confirmed. In all, the Japanese government expects the fighter program to cost around $40 billion and it aims to provide a replacement for the Japan Air Self Defense-Force’s (JASDF) existing Mitsubishi F-2 that will be ready for service by 2035. The future fighter is unofficially known as the F-X but is expected to be designated F-3 by the time it enters service. With the choice of a new fighter falling upon an indigenous, or, at least, indigenous-led, solution, MHI was the clear front-runner to head up the project as the only aviation company in Japan with fighter jet experience. MHI built the F-16-derived F-2, which was itself a successor to the same company’s supersonic F-1 combat jet, an earlier development program that began in the 1960s. The company also undertook the license-production of the F-4EJ Phantom II and the subsequent F-15J Eagle air superiority fighters for JASDF service. A Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-15J Eagle arrives at Yokota Air Base, Japan, in September 2019. , U.S. AIR FORCE/AIRMAN 1ST CLASS BRIEANA E. BOLFING For the F-2, MHI had teamed up with Lockheed Martin to produce a multirole fighter based on the F-16 , with a 60/40 split in manufacturing between Japan and the United States. A similar kind of joint venture with a foreign firm has now been selected for the future fighter. A Japan Air-Self Defense Force F-2B prepares to depart Misawa Air Base, Japan, in June 2018. , U.S. AIR FORCE/AIRMAN 1ST CLASS COLLETTE BROOKS MHI itself has also completed a single example of the X-2 Shinshin experimental aircraft that has been serving as a technology demonstrator for the future fighter program. Originally known as the Advanced Technology Demonstrator-Experimental (ATD-X), the X-2 first flew in April 2016. A twin-engined highly agile aircraft, the X-2 is powered by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) XF5 turbofans, each of which develops around 11,000 pounds of thrust and has thrust-vectoring exhaust paddles for maneuverability. While the F-2 is powered by an F110 engine supplied by General Electric, there is a good chance that the engines for its successor will be provided by IHI, which is developing the XF9 that will offer significantly more thrust than the XF5, which was always intended as an interim engine exclusively for test purposes. The X-2’s configuration includes tapered wings of low aspect ratio, plus twin vertical stabilizers and rudders, all optimized toward agility, although there’s no guarantee that these features will appear on the future fighter that MHI is now under contract to develop. Perhaps more indicative of the eventual F-3 are some of the ambitious technological goals outlined as part of the X-2 research program. These include modern composite structures, stealth shaping, radar-absorbent materials , and digital fly-by-light flight and engine control systems. Among the avionics specified for study are conformal radar antennas, electronic support measures, and electronic countermeasures systems, as well as an infrared search and track system. Intriguingly, reference has also been made to a “self-repairing flight control capability.” This suggests a system to automatically detect failures or battle damage and activate the remaining control surfaces, including possibly the aircraft’s thrust vectoring nozzles, to keep the aircraft under control. Concept artwork of a possible F-3 fighter configuration., JAPANESE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE Before today’s announcement, it had been confirmed that Japan would follow one of three paths to field a new fighter: developing an aircraft entirely domestically, a joint venture with the help of foreign partners, or acquiring an off-the-shelf foreign fighter. Another, more radical proposal envisaged an unmanned fighter as a replacement for the F-2 fleet. The drone fighter proposal was reportedly considered as a cost-saving measure and then dropped earlier this year, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Choosing the second option reflected a pragmatic approach, which will hopefully secure technological support and expertise from a partner with experience in the field while maintaining the domestic defense industry. This latter point might be of particular importance for MHI’s aircraft-building division. The company announced on the same day that it is suspending production of its SpaceJet commercial jetliner as a result of uncertainties in the sector stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. More generally, Japan will be looking to secure significant technology transfer gains to help boost the local industry, and this will likely play a key role in the choice of partner. According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, a decision on the foreign partner for the fighter project will be made before the end of this year. Possible candidates include Lockheed Martin in the United States and BAE Systems in the United Kingdom, which currently builds Typhoon multirole fighters for export as part of the multinational Eurofighter consortium. Other U.S. companies that have previously shown an interest in joining the project include Boeing and Northrop Grumman . Reports in the Japanese media indicate that sharing of stealth technology will be an important requirement of the foreign partner, which might provide an edge for Lockheed Martin. Not only does it have vast experience in producing radar-defeating combat jets but also has an established relationship providing F-35s for Japan and working with MHI to produce them. Lockheed Martin and MHI have partnered on the Final Assembly and Check-Out (FACO) facility for the JASDF’s F-35A variant in Nagoya, Japan. The first four F-35As for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force were completed by Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, Texas before production commenced in Japan. This is the very first jet, known as AX-1., LOCKHEED MARTIN It’s notable too that Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor was once Japan’s first choice as a future fighter, but a ban on its export issued by the U.S. Congress prevented its acquisition even by one of America’s closest allies. Once the Raptor avenue was closed off, Japan also reportedly requested details from Lockheed Martin of a potential F-22/F-35 hybrid . Although Japanese officials seemed to rule out this design earlier this year , and refocus on a truly indigenous product, such a proposal could re-emerge as a contender to meet the F-3 requirement. Another factor that could play a role in selecting a partner is Japan’s burgeoning defense relationship with the United Kingdom, one of the core partner nations in the Eurofighter multinational industry effort, which involves British companies including BAE Systems jet engine maker Rolls-Royce. The United Kingdom is now also working on the Tempest future fighter , with input from Italy and Sweden. There has been discussion in the past about Japan becoming another potential Tempest partner, and Tokyo’s aim to get a new fighter into service by 2035 might tally nicely with the United Kingdom’s plans to field the Tempest as a Typhoon successor in this timeframe. Regardless of what foreign company or companies ultimately end up involved in the Japanese future fighter project, the country has now made a tangible commitment to developing the aircraft. This new stealth fighter project is just one part of a steady building up of Japan’s military capabilities to meet increasing national security threats and challenges, especially from China and North Korea . The country’s defense budget request for the 2021 fiscal year was the biggest on record, at around $55 billion, marking an increase for the ninth consecutive year. It includes around $556 million requested for future fighter research and development, plus $114 million for preliminary work on the integration of its subsystems including radar and mission systems. Developing a new fighter is a considerable challenge, but with MHI now officially at the helm as prime contractor, it will be fascinating to see which foreign industrial partner — or partners — join the program in the coming months.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 2, 2020",Navy Boss Talks ‘Joint Strike Frigate’ Concept After Calls To Build Four Frigates A Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite has raised the possibility of his service running a multi-national frigate program together with allies and partners, in the same general vein as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program , a notional effort he dubbed the “Joint Strike Frigate.” This came just days after Robert O’Brien, President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor, said he saw a need for the U.S. Navy to get more frigates, faster, pointing to the possibility of the service acquiring more of its future Constellation class ships, previously known as the FFG(X) , than it plans to buy at present, at least publicly. Braithwaite made his comments yesterday at an event the U.S. Navy Memorial organization held as part of its SITREP Speaker Series. O’Brien had offered his remarks while speaking to workers at Marinette Marine, a subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, in Marinette, Wisconsin, earlier in the week. “We took our eyes off the ball, especially in the Navy,” Braithwaite said. “We moved into littoral warfare looking for a role for the United States Navy and we forgot about our commitments in deep water and so we’re behind and we’ve got to catch up and we’ve got to catch up fast.” “I have a concept in my head is if we created a Joint Strike Fighter that we could share with NATO allies,” he added. “Why can’t we create a Joint Strike Frigate? Why can’t we take that same platform and offer it to our allies and partners around the world?” Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite talks with US Marines on the UK Royal Navy’s first-in-class aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth earlier this month. The Marine Corps has a contingent of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters on this carrier at present., USN A dozen countries , in addition to the United States, operate one or more variants of the F-35 or are in the process of acquiring them. Other nations have expressed an interest in buying their own Joint Strike Fighter fleets, as well. The U.S. government has actively promoted sales of the F-35, often touting the operational benefits of having allies and partners all fly the same kinds of jets, as well as the cost burden-sharing and industrial cooperation benefits that have come along with the program. Braithwaite seems to have been thinking about how a similar shipbuilding program might help improve interoperability between allies and partners, as well as drive down costs. It’s interesting to note that the Navy already made a point of only considering in-production frigate designs, or derivatives thereof, for its FFG(X) program, ultimately selecting a design Marinette Marine had pitched based on its parent company’s Franco-Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. In addition to the examples in the French and Italian navies, FREMM variants are also in service with the Moroccan and Egyptian navies, both of which are American partners, as well. An artist’s conception of Marinette Marine FREMM-based frigate design for the US Navy., USN Finding ways to keep the costs of buying these frigates, the first of which Braithwaite announced earlier this month would be named USS Constellation , as well operating and maintaining them, as low as possible will be important for the Navy as its looks toward its already questionably ambitious future force structure plans. The service is presently pushing a proposal to increase the size of its overall fleet to over 500 ships , up from its current total of around 293. During his talk, Braithwaite reiterated that this proposal calls for between 60 and 70 “small surface combatants,” a category that will include the Constellation class ships, as well as the Navy’s two subclasses of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The exact split between these classes is unclear. If the service does acquire all 38 LCSs it has said it expects to acquire in the past, as well as 20 Constellations , this would already be 58 ships. There are, however, plans now to retire the first two examples of both the Freedom and Independence class LCSs and it seems very likely that a decision could be made to acquire more of the new frigates to reach the desired number of small surface combatants. The USS Freedom , in the background, sails alongside the USS Independence , in the foreground. These are the lead ships in their respective subclass of Littoral Combat Ships., USN Having international partners for any future Joint Strike Frigate could also lead to an expanded industrial base and additional investments in the shipyard infrastructure that would be necessary to build significant numbers of these ships, and do so quickly. All of this, again, would be important if the Navy hopes to even get close to its small surface combatant or overall 500-ship fleet goals. It could also help cut the gap between American naval shipbuilding capacity and that of China , which continues to grow and churn out even very large capital ships, including aircraft carriers , amphibious assault ships , and destroyers , at a prodigious rate. National Security Advisor O’Brien had talked about a desire to increase frigate production in his remarks at Marinette Marine’s yard in Wisconsin, as well. At present, the Navy expects to receive two Constellation class ships every year once production gets ramped up. It hopes to see work on the first-in-class USS Constellation begin in 2022 and then take delivery of that ship no later than 2026. National Security Advisor O’Brien speaks at Marinette Marine’s yard in Wisconsin on Oct. 26., Marinette Marine “We’re going to need two, three, four frigates built a year to get to the numbers of where we want to be,” O’Brien said. “This yard has the capability to build two or three of them itself.” It’s not clear if O’Brien was talking about the yard’s available capacity while it is still producing the last five Freedom class LCSs for the Navy in the coming years. It’s also worth noting that there have already been reports that the Navy has been looking into possibly hiring a different shipyard to build the second batch of 10 Constellation class frigates. Three Freedom class Littoral Combat Ships in various stages of construction at the Marinette Marine shipyard., Marinette Marine Of course, it remains very much to be seen how the Navy’s plans for the Constellation class and any other future Joint Strike Frigate concept might evolve in the near term. Significant changes to the U.S. military’s plans overall, as well as that of the U.S. government as a whole, could come if President Trump loses the upcoming election to his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden. As it stands now, the White House has still yet to sign off on the 500-fleet Navy plan, also known as Battle Force 2045. This, in turn, has already raised questions about whether O’Brien’s remarks might, in some way, reflect the state of ongoing negotiations over the proposal with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and his office. Whether the Trump Administration is the one to ultimately present it or not, work on the 2022 Fiscal Year defense budget request is underway now and it’s also unclear if the National Security Advisor’s comments might have revealed anything about those plans, as well. As already noted, there remain very real questions about whether the Battle Force 2045 proposal is truly viable, at all, issues that The War Zone has already explored in depth . When it comes to frigates, specifically, the Congressional Budget Office has also raised concerns that the Navy may be significantly underestimating the total cost of the Constellation class ships. The Navy has estimated that it will cost around $8.7 billion to acquire the first 10 of these ships. CBO’s analysts have said that the figure could actually be $12.3 billion, in the end. Still, whether or not the idea of Joint Strike Frigate comes to pass, or if the Navy ultimately acquires dramatically more Constellation class ships than it plans to now, Braithwaite and O’Brien’s comments do underscore how important this category of small surface warships has already become to the Navy’s future plans. Investing in more small surface combatants are definitely one of the best shots the service has at progressing toward the 500-ship fleet goal.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2022",Taiwan Disguises Armored Vehicles As Cranes And Scrapheaps During Urban Warfare Maneuvers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The lengths that Taiwan’s Republic of China Army goes to ensure its armored vehicles might survive a potential invasion from the Chinese mainland were made abundantly clear during the country’s latest series of war games. The recent Combat Readiness Week brought images of tanks and other armored vehicles hidden in urban environments using some ingenious camouflage methods, including hiding them under junk and making them look like civilian construction equipment. While it’s commonplace for military vehicles operating in rural terrain to be liberally adorned with foliage, the same technique can have a place in the cityscape too. A photo released by the Republic of China (ROC) Military News Agency showed several M113 armored personnel carrier variants sheltered under a highway bridge and covered in the types of ferns and ivy that might grow through the cracks in these urban environments. An M113 armored personnel carrier concealed under a bridge., ROC MILITARY NEWS AGENCY More extreme measures to blend into the backdrop of the city included what appeared to be a Clouded Leopard 8×8 infantry fighting vehicle adapted to look like a yellow civilian crane. The effect was achieved using a combination of yellow-painted wooden boards and fabric. Perhaps even more extraordinary are the photos showing at least one main battle tank — presumably an example of the Cold War-era American-made M60A3 Patton, or a locally upgraded CM-11 and CM-12 Brave Tiger — hidden in what looks like a scrapyard. The tank is swathed in a metallic-effect fabric covering that blends in remarkably well with the surrounding scrap metal, some of which also adorns the tank, including obscuring its barrel. A statement from Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman Shih Shun-wen, quoted by Janes , explained that personnel from an unnamed ROC Army armored brigade had been tasked to attach suitable foliage to netting covering their vehicles, as well as to use urban features to provide visual cover. Other ROC Army units confirmed to have taken part in the maneuvers were the 33rd Chemical Warfare Group, which provided both nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) detection vehicles and disinfection vehicles, and the 269th Mechanized Infantry Brigade. The latter moved at night from a mountain base into a civilian area in New Taipei, according to Taiwan News . Army Aviation units included the 601st Aviation Special Forces Brigade, whose AH-64E Apache gunships and recently delivered UH-60M Black Hawk transport helicopters were expected to land next to a major railway station in the city of Hsinchu, before conducting a “hot” refueling and rearming exercise. The MND confirmed that one of the aims of the drill was for the ROC Army to enhance its “concealment, camouflage, deception, and maneuverability capabilities, according to the principle of ‘fight wherever the battle is’.” While this type of deceptive camouflage is pretty unusual nowadays, it has a distinguished history, dating back to World War II, when armored vehicles were “modded” to look like their civilian counterparts, typically commercial trucks. This kind of tactic was used perhaps most famously by the British Eighth Army in the Western Desert. A British Army Crusader tank with its “truck” camouflage erected, in October 1942., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/PUBLIC DOMAIN It’s questionable, of course, just how effective such measures might actually be in hiding these forces. Infrared optics may not be fooled, for instance, at least with some of these camouflage tactics, but regardless, the deception may be enough to delay positive identification, possibly long enough to either get a shot off or withdraw. Even what might seem like fairly superficial measures can, in fact, have a significant payoff in the heat of combat, as evidenced by the U.S. Army’s adoption of a new type of paint to help reduce the infrared signature of its M1 Abrams tanks and other armored vehicles , making them harder to detect. You can read about that coating, and how it could have applications well beyond ground vehicles, here . The five-day series of maneuvers, which began on October 26, 2020, is known as Combat Readiness Week, and also involved the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) and Navy. Taiwan’s various wargames not only ensure training for all branches of the military, but provide a signal of overall readiness to the People’s Republic of China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must eventually be reunited. As such, the type of scenarios practiced typically focus on repelling an invasion by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). At the same time, it is clear that the PLA, too, would expect to take on Taiwanese forces in urban settings and there is plenty of evidence of its units training accordingly . Should Taiwan one day have to face the might of the PLA in an invasion scenario, every single tank and armored vehicle would have to count. While the extreme lengths taken to conceal these vehicles during exercises may look unusual, this kind of camouflage could make the difference in the type of urban warfare scenario that Taiwan’s armed forces are prepared to fight.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 6, 2020",Trump Administration Wants To Sell UAE A Fleet Of 50 F-35s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump’s administration has informed Congress that it plans to sell the United Arab Emirates 50 F-35 stealth fighters. Backed by the U.S. State Department, the proposed deal still faces significant hurdles, largely stemming from concerns about how it might affect Israel’s so-called “qualitative military edge” in the Middle East. There has already been some pushback from legislators to this latest announcement and representatives of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s campaign have also voiced hesitation over how they might handle the deal. Americans go to the polls next week to choose the next President of the United States. New details of the plan to sell the Joint Strike Fighter to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) emerged today, with Global Defence Technology magazine’s Harry Lye being among the first to confirm them . If the deal goes through, the UAE would become only the second country in the region to receive the F-35, after Israel . Talk of an F-35 sale to the UAE is not new, and The War Zone reported on it back in 2017 , but the prospect of it happening was given a major boost by the normalization of relations between the UAE and Israel earlier this year. According to Defense News , the 20-aircraft deal could be worth $10.4 billion. In August 2020, President Trump said of the UAE: “They have the money and they would like to order quite a few F-35s.” However, as we discussed at that time , the transfer of such high-end equipment to the UAE has already been met with serious opposition from both Israeli officials and now also the U.S. Congress. “This technology would significantly change the military balance in the Gulf and affect Israel’s military edge,” Global Defence Technology ’s Lye quoted the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee as saying in response to today’s news, reiterating these concerns. “The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is a game-changing stealth platform boasting advanced strike capability and unique sensor technology . The export of this aircraft requires very careful consideration and Congress must analyze all of the ramifications. Rushing these sales is not in anyone’s interest.” A U.S. Air Force F-35A from the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron taxis to the runway at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, before Exercise Tri-Lightning, June 25, 2019. , US AIR FORCE/STAFF SGT. CHRIS THORNBURY “Israel currently has exclusive access in the region to the F-35, which has guaranteed its military edge over the last several years,” said Democratic Congressman Eliot Engel, again quoted by Harry Lye. “As Congress reviews this sale, it must be clear that changes to the status quo will not put Israel’s military advantage at risk.” The qualitative military edge (QME) mentioned by Congressman Engel is the key to whether the sale of the stealth fighters to the UAE will eventually be signed off. U.S. law ensures that Israel must retain a military advantage over its neighbors, although how the QME is preserved remains open to interpretation. An Israeli Air Force F-35I, known locally as the “ Adir .”, ISRAELI AIR FORCE/AMIT AGRONOV A day before the latest announcement, Anthony Blinken, a foreign policy adviser to Biden, also said that the Candidate’s camp had “concerns about what commitments may or may not have been made to the UAE with regard to the F-35.” Blinken reiterated that, under President Barack Obama’s administration, during which time Biden was Vice President, the F-35 had only been made available to Israel within the region, in order to preserve its QME. “Reports that the [Trump] administration has committed to provide these planes to the UAE is something we would look at very, very carefully, and make sure that the QME is preserved and also very important that Congress play a role,” Blinken added. While the plan may still face Congressional pressure, it seems that the Israeli position may have softened in recent weeks. Ahead of the UAE F-35 announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Benny Gantz issued a joint statement suggesting that Israel would not necessarily stand in the way of such a deal. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu applies the Israeli Air Force symbol onto the “Adir,” officially welcoming it into service. , ISRAELI AIR FORCE/CELIA GARION “The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister both agree that since the U.S. is upgrading Israel’s military capability and maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge, Israel will not oppose the sale of these systems to the UAE,” the statement read. This followed a visit by Ganz to Washington, during which he signed a deal with U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper about U.S. willingness to preserve Israel’s QME for the next four years at least. The talks apparently included potential arms deals covering more fighter jets, likely F-35s and/or F-15 Eagles , as well as V-22 Osprey tiltrotor transports, which have long been on Israel’s shopping list In recent weeks there have been other, seemingly bizarre reports concerning possible U.S. arms sales to Israel, perhaps as a means of ensuring its QME. These included talk of a sale of F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets, although that is nearly impossible as the production line for that stealth jet has long since closed , and restarting it would be prohibitively expensive. Some American lawmakers are also talking about proposing legislation that would allow Israel to buy the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) “bunker-buster.” However, the Israeli military has no suitable aircraft to carry this huge weapon. The United States could potentially ally some of Israel’s concerns through various export control mechanisms, including special limits on the infrastructure surrounding the F-35, an option that The War Zone examined in this previous article . The UAE Air Force and Air Defence is already well equipped with comparatively modern non-stealthy fighters, comprising 77 F-16E/F Block 60 Desert Falcons and 62 Dassault Mirage 2000-9s.

CHRIS DRZAZGOWSKI In the past, the UAE examined options for the purchase of around 60 new fighters, including the Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon, while Russia offered the Sukhoi Su-35 . No decision was made and, in the meantime, other air forces in the region — among them Bahrain , Oman , and Qatar — have all placed multi-billion-dollar orders for new fighters. With Israel apparently increasingly willing to tolerate the sale of F-35s to the UAE the Trump administration and the U.S. State Department will now have to wait for the outcome of the presidential election to see what happens next. Should Trump win another term in office, it already looks like the proposed sale will face plenty of opposition from the U.S. Congress.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2021",The Littoral Combat Ship USS Detroit Is Limping Home To Florida After Breaking Down,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) USS Detroit is making its way slowly back to its homeport in Florida after suffering a significant breakdown while operating in the waters around Latin America. The ship had stopped to conduct scheduled maintenance in Panama earlier this month, though there is no indication that work during that port visit had to do with parts of the ship’s propulsion system that subsequently failed. The incident underscores continuing issues with both of the Littoral Combat Ship subclasses , which have bedeviled the overall program for years and limited the operational utility of these ships, despite the Navy’s best efforts. Defense News was first to report the incident. The Navy confirmed that the so-called “engineering casualty” had occurred, but did not say exactly what had happened. A failure of some kind in the ship’s combining gear, a part of the ship’s drive train, was reportedly the cause of this mishap and it has been a source of problems on multiple occasions in the past. The combining gear links the two main diesel engines on the Freedom class ships to a pair of gas turbines, which can provide additional power for its water jet propulsion system. This combined system is key to the ability of these ships to reach speeds of over 40 knots, which was a core requirement when the ships were under development. On diesel engine power alone, their top speed is only around 10 to 12 knots . It’s not clear how the combining gear failed in this case or when or where exactly the breakdown happened. Detroit had been operating in the U.S. 4th Fleet area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean and areas of the South Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans, in support of U.S. Southern Command’s Enhanced Counter Narcotics Operations effort, which began earlier this year. The USS Sioux City , another Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship, as well as the Independence class LCS USS Gabrielle Giffords , are also presently deployed to the region primarily to support this counter-drug operation. The USS Detroit at speed during her acceptance trials in 2016., USN “USS Detroit (LCS 7) experienced an engineering casualty during routine operations, and a technical evaluation determined that in-port repairs would be required,” the Navy’s statement to Defense News read. “USS Detroit has been a vital and productive asset and will be redeployed as soon as possible.” It’s interesting to note that the Navy had previously released pictures of Detroit in port in Vasco Nunez de Balboa in Panama on Oct. 10, 2020. The ship was reportedly there for a planned maintenance availability period (PMAV). Some of these images show members of the ship’s crew working on one of the ship’s four auxiliary diesel generators, which power its electrical systems, as well as the fuel system. A member of USS Detroit ‘s crew changes an oil filter on a diesel generator while in port in Vasco Nunez de Balboa in Panama on Oct. 10., USN One of Detroit’s sailors performs a fuel oil flush during the planned maintenance availability period in Panama on Oct. 10., USN This is not the first time a Freedom class LCS’s combining gear has failed. In 2015, the USS Milwaukee suffered a problem with this part of its propulsion system, while making its maiden voyage to Naval Station Mayport in Florida, where Detroit is also homeported. The next year, USS Fort Worth had experienced a significant breakdown in its combining gear, as well. The Navy subsequently determined that incident to have been the result of a chain of errors by the crew that resulted in the system running for an extended period without critical lubricating oil. The Independence class LCSs, which are of a distinctly separate design, have also suffered their issues over the years with their propulsion systems. Ships from both subclasses have been involved in various collisions, over the years, as well. The Navy is well aware of the reliability issues across the two fleets, which has contributed to the Navy having conducted very limited operational deployments using any of these ships since the first-in-class USS Freedom , also known as LCS 1, was commissioned more than a decade ago. In 2018, no LCSs from either subclass were deployed operationally anywhere . The USS Freedom , behind, sails alongside the USS Independence , in front., USN “There are things in the near term that I have to deliver, that I’m putting heat on now, and one of them is LCS,” Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, the service’s top officer, told Defense News in an interview earlier this year. “One part is sustainability and reliability. We know enough about that platform and the problems that we have that plague us with regard to reliability and sustainability, and I need them resolved.” “Those platforms have been around since 2008 – we need to get on with it,” he continued. “We’ve done five deployments since I’ve been on the job, we’re going to ramp that up two-and-a-half times over the next couple of years, but we have got to get after it.” In late September, the Navy kicked off its latest initiative to try to help mitigate these issues when it sent the Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport USNS Burlington to the U.S. 4th Fleet area to serve a mothership for Detroit and the other LCSs in the region. As part of this proof-of-concept deployment, Burlington has a Maintenance Expeditionary Team onboard that can help perform PMAV work at sea, meaning the LCSs would not have to head to a port to conduct at least some routine maintenance. The Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport USNS Burlington ., USN Still, even if the Navy can overcome the maintenance-related issues with the LCSs, there remain serious questions about the operational utility of these ships, too. The vessels were originally developed to be modular designs that could use prefabricated mission modules to rapidly shift from one mission set to another. The three planned mission modules are centered on the mine countermeasures , anti-submarine warfare, and anti-surface warfare missions . However, after years of delays and other setbacks in fielding the modules, the service now plans to operate the LCSs in single-mission roles with one of this trio of mission modules effectively permanently installed. The base combat capabilities of the ships in both subclasses have also been the subject of significant criticism over the years. At present, a Navy initiative to give them an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile capability, which could significantly increase their firepower, has resulted in the integration of the RGM-184A Naval Strike Missile (NSM) onto just one ship, the Gabrielle Giffords . Adding the NSMs to the LCS’s arsenal is becoming something of a saga that you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . There is also talk now of adding laser directed energy weapons to at least some of these ships. Beyond all that, both LCS subclasses were originally developed using a process known as concurrency , wherein shipbuilders began construction of the initial ships before designs had been entirely finalized, with plans to insert any modifications and fixes later. This concept, applied to other shipbuilding programs , as well as combat aircraft , was ostensibly meant to help cut costs by getting production started sooner than it would otherwise, but didn’t result in the desired savings. In addition, this has meant that the first two LCSs in each subclass are so significantly different from their sister ships that they have been relegated to purely training and test and evaluation roles and the Navy is now looking to retire them entirely . The Navy operates the LCSs using a dual-crew concept, meaning that there is a blue crew and gold crew that alternate on the ship. The idea here had been to improve readiness, but in practice has often led to certain ships taking on significant training duties to ensure non-deployed crews are certified for future operations. Many of these issues had already been key factors in the Navy’s decision to initiate plans to acquire a new class of more capable frigates. In April, the service announced it had hired Marinette Marine , a subsidiary of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to build the first of these ships, which will be based on its parent company’s Franco-Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate, design. More recently, it was announced that the first of these ships would be named the USS Constellation , a storied moniker that was originally applied to one of the first six frigates built for the fledgling U.S. Navy in the late 18th Century. Despite all these issues, the Navy has continued to buy more LCSs, too. At the time of writing, the service has taken delivery of 21 ships in both subclasses and could eventually receive a total of 38 examples. The future USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul just completed its acceptance trials in August. At the same time, Questions about the actual operational utility of these ships now and in the future are likely to become even more significant in the near term as the Navy works to implement its questionably ambitious plans to increase the size of its overall fleet to more than 500 ships, which you can read more about in these previous War Zone stories . Hopefully, when it comes to USS Detroit , the ship’s engineering casualty will turn out to not have been particularly severe and the ship will at least be able to return to the fleet sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 23, 2021",F-16 Pops Flares Grabbing Trump’s Attention After Plane Strays Into Airspace Over Rally,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet fired off flares to get the attention of another aircraft that had flown into restricted airspace around where President Donald Trump has been holding a campaign rally in Bullhead City, Arizona. The exact circumstances remain unclear, but the other plane subsequently established radio communications with the fighter and was escorted out of the area without further incident. The intercept occurred while Trump was speaking in Bullhead City, which is situated just over the Arizona border, where he arrived today after making an earlier stop in Las Vegas. The F-16’s appearance overhead deploying flares was clearly not planned and came as something of a surprise to the President, as you can see in the video below. Even though they did not know what was going on, the crowd, as well as the President, were clearly thrilled by what they saw. “I love that sound. You don’t know what I went through to get those suckers up there,” Trump said, before attacking unspecified “Democrats” over budgeting, on first hearing the aircraft. “Oh, look at that, look, look, look, they gave the president a little display,” he continues after the flares appear. “At approx. 1400 MDT, NORAD F-16 aircraft investigated a general aviation aircraft that was not in communication with ATC [air traffic control] and entered the Temporary Flight Restriction area surrounding Bullhead City, AZ without proper clearance,” the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said in a pair of subsequent Tweets. “The violating aircraft was non-responsive to initial intercept procedures, but established radio communications after NORAD aircraft deployed signal flares. The aircraft was escorted out of the restricted area by the NORAD aircraft without further incident.” The use of flares by fighter jets to get the attention of other planes or helicopters, including those that might have strayed into this kind of restricted airspace, if they can’t contact them over the radio, visually, or otherwise get them to leave, is not all that common. You can read more about what goes into an intercept like this in this previous War Zone piece , but the use of flares was likely necessary to get the aircraft’s attention fast enough so as to ward it away from where the President was speaking in time to not turn the incident into a deadly one. The restricted airspace around the President offers only a short amount of time to get an aviator that wonders into the area time to leave without the use of force. An annotated map showing the restricted airspace “bubble” around Bullhead, Arizona, on Oct. 28, 2020., via skyvector.com There was actually a similar intercept involving the deployment of flares in Tennessee last week , in the restricted airspace around Nashville, which was the site of the final debate between President Trump and his challenger, former Vice President and Senator Joe Biden. A F-16 escorted another aircraft out of the area, as well, but did not fire flares to get its attention first. Both of those incidents also ended uneventfully. The presence of hardware overhead for Presidential visits outside of Washington has increased markedly in recent years. At many locales, fighters are airborne constantly, supported by tankers, around the clock to provide a combat air patrol (CAP) to enforce a temporary no-fly security zone around the President. During the campaign, there have been E-3 AWACS aircraft also up at multiple destinations to help provide surveillance and additional command and control. In years past, CAPs have not been set up at some destinations, which has resulted in supersonic scrambles by alert fighters in the region to confront threats that pop-up even hundreds of miles away. These incidents have led to property damage and a concerned populous. Having fighter aircraft constantly overhead is extremely expensive and time-consuming, but it offers far quicker response times to potential threats. Even at Trump’s Florida home, Air Force fighters stand vigilant around the clock overhead in case a threat emerges. As the President has moved around the country at breakneck speed for the last weeks of his campaign, a logistical operation the likes of which has likely never been executed by the USAF before has been put into place in order to move him safely where he needs to go and to guarantee his safety from airborne intruders once he is there. We will update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 5, 2020",Squadron Showcases F-15E Strike Eagles Adorned With Villain-Themed Nose Art Ahead Of Halloween,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s not Halloween just yet, but the Air Force’s 492nd Fighter Squadron appears to have gotten into the spirit of the season a bit early. The public affairs office at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom, where the unit is based, posted pictures today of 14 of its F-15E Strike Eagles wearing nose art featuring comic book characters, movie and television show villains, and more. Images of the nose art first appeared on the official RAF Lakenheath Facebook page on Oct. 28, 2020. The 492nd returned to the U.K. base earlier this month after a six-month rotation at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan. Strike Eagles are among the most in-demand combat jets in the Air Force and the rotating contingents in Jordan have been heavily committed to various conflicts in the Middle East over the years, including the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, where they have even shot down Iranian drones . F-15Es flying from Muwaffaq Salti also notably supported the raid that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi last year, firing AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to level the terrorist’s compound at the conclusion of the operation. RAF Lakenheath’s Facebook post indicates that personnel applied the nose art sometime during the deployment, which appears to be becoming something of a trend in the region. Earlier this year, the Air Force released pictures of F-15C Eagles assigned to the 44th Fighter Squadron wearing their own vibrant nose art while deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. “Vote for your favorite 492nd deployment ‘Nose Art’!” the Facebook about the art on the 492nd’s jets reads. “Winning shot will be announced on #F15Friday!” This “F-15 Friday” also happens to be the day before Halloween, which gives this the air of something of a costume contest, as well. So let’s see the entrants. Comic book characters from both the Marvel and DC universes are by far the most numerous. Loki and Harley Quinn , foils for Marvel’s Thor and DC’s Batman , respectively, who often take the role of anti-heroes, as well, are present. One jet also has art depicting Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger , an antagonist to Marvel’s Black Panther and a key figure in Marvel’s 2018 standalone film for that character, where he was portrayed as a tragic villain . USAF USAF USAF There are a number of other comic book villains, as well, including one Strike Eagle with a silhouette of Batman’s iconic opponent the Joker rendered in the style of how the late Heath Ledger famously portrayed him in the 2008 film The Dark Knight . The nose art on another one of the aircraft shows the Green Goblin , a Marvel villain who often battles with Spider Man , but riding a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bomb instead of his typical glider. USAF USAF There is also something of a mashup of Thanos, a supervillain from the Marvel universe who was at the center of the films Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: End Game, which came out in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and Turkish restaurateur Nusret Gökçe, better known by the nickname Salt Bae . Gökçe became an internet sensation a few years, particularly over his unusual style of applying salt to his meat, in which he sprinkles it dramatically. The Thanos nose art shows the purple alien wearing sunglasses, another Salt Bae trademark, and making a similar motion, but dropping bombs, instead. It’s perhaps interesting to note that a French Navy officer assigned to the Combined Intelligence Fusion Cell (CIFC) at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar was also seen wearing a Salt Bae-inspired morale patch , with JDAMs instead of salt, earlier this year. USAF The nose art on two other jets features notable villains, as well. One is of Darth Vader , the iconic dark lord from the Star Wars franchise , while the other is of Rita Repulsa , who repeatedly challenged the Power Rangers in the original run of that show and should be instantly recognizable to Americans who grew up in the 1990s. Ray Finkle, a fictional former kicker for the Miami Dolphins football team with a vendetta against famous real-life quarterback Dan Marino, who assumes the identity of a woman named Lois Einhorn and is the principal antagonist in the 1994 Jim Carey comedy film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective , also makes an appearance on the side of one of the Strike Eagles. USAF USAF USAF A “madhatter,” an idea popularized in Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland , which has since found its way, in various forms, into other popular works of fiction , graces the nose of another one of the 492nd’s jets. There is also a depiction of Vlad the Impaler , a European historical figure known for his cruelty, who may have been an inspiration of sorts for Bram Stoker’s take on the legend of Count Dracula and who has now become inseparably linked with vampire stories. Two of the F-15Es have nose art featuring real-world villains. One has artwork of the infamous Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar , while another appears to refer to former Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán , who is now in prison in the United States. USAF USAF USAF USAF Last, but certainly not least, Joe Exotic, a central figure in the documentary mini-series Tiger King , which Netflix released earlier this year and quickly became a cultural phenomenon , is the subject of the nose art on one of the 492nd’s Strike Eagles. The artwork has a playing card motif that shows Joe as a face card “king” and includes a silhouette of Oklahoma, where Joe Exotic’s now-closed Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park was located. USAF Altogether, the nose art on the 492nd’s F-15Es certainly contains a rogues gallery of characters, real and not.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 3, 2021",Scaled Composites’ Stealthy Test Jet Now Flying With Possible Laser Weapon Modifications,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the most mysterious aircraft that are flying in plain sight today are the Model 401 “Son of Ares” jets from famed cutting-edge aerospace design firm Scaled Composites. The twin stealthy aircraft, nicknamed Phobos and Deimos—you can read all about their lineage and their namesakes in these past War Zone exclusives —have been very busy in recent months. They have been working with a wide variety of aircraft , including the company’s high-flying Proteus test jet . One has been flying out of Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, with a photographer capturing the aircraft covered in mirrors as part of some sort of a bizarre test. Now, one of the two Son of Ares jet has been photographed landing at its birthplace of Mojave Air and Space Port with a puzzling and very prominent new modification to its belly. The photos come to us from Steve Lee, an aviation photographer from Santa Clarita, California with a background in aerospace engineering. He was at Mojave on October 23rd, 2020, when the Model 401 with the U.S. civil registration code N401XP came swooping in while turning final to land at its home base. As you can see in the images below, the aircraft now has a strange new ventral enclosure modification that includes what appears to be a large air-intake arrangement under the nose. It seems that there exists a large radiator-like array inside this intake. A square hole only on one side of the faceted enclosure appears to be where something will be mounted and the structure itself appears to be open to the rear. Some sort of an exhaust pipe is sticking out of the aircraft itself towards the back of the pod-like addition. There is a large ventral bulge in the aircraft’s skin behind the pod and there are aero tufts that work to visualize airflow along the rest of the aircraft’s lower-rear fuselage. It’s also worth noting that the Son of Ares jet was being chased by a Sabreliner when the photographs were taken. Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee Steve Lee It isn’t clear exactly what the major modifications are for, but the potential existence of a large radiator and exhaust, as well as an aperture, points to the possibility that N401XP will operate as a directed energy (laser) testbed in the near future. The previous work that these jets did with Proteus , another unique Scaled Composites aircraft that was packing a strange pod with similar side-mounted apertures at the time, as well as the mirrored-coated test flight of one of the demonstrators, further suggests that the airframes may serve at least partially as some kind of airborne directed energy testbeds. As we noted not long after the Model 401s first appeared , the dihedral on their wings (upswept design) gives extra line of sight to the horizon while banking to systems mounted below. This could be beneficial for directed energy applications, as well as surveillance ones. But above all else, the pod’s features, especially what appears to be extreme cooling capabilities and an auxiliary exhaust, together with an aperture to mount a laser beam pointer/director, even one with a narrow field of view, seems to add up. The power generation requirements and especially the cooling needed to effectively field such a system represent major challenges. This is why such a huge radiator system placed directly in the stream of onrushing air and a separate power generation source, as the arrangement on the Model 401 suggests, makes sense, although this evidence is anything but conclusive at this time. There are a number of airborne laser programs underway currently, including the Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) Advanced Technology Demonstration program. A number of companies are working on this program with the Air Force Research Laboratory, including Northrop Grumman, which is developing its beam control system and the enclosure for the system. All of that has to be small and light-weight enough to fit inside a pod that a tactical aircraft can carry. SHiELD is a defensive system primarily aimed at shooting down incoming missiles that target the host aircraft or others in its vicinity. The ambitious initiative has seen some delays as of late, with the demonstration pushed back two years to 2023. One can see how the concept and the timeline line up with what we are seeing on the Model 401, especially since Northrop Grumman owns Scaled Composites. Still, it isn’t hard proof that this is the program related to this new installation. In addition, it was thought that SHiELD would feature a podded system a fighter could carry. This arrangement is custom to the Model 401, but it could be an R&D effort attempting to downscale technologies so that they can be crammed into a pod eventually. Another ongoing program of record is an initiative to mount a 60-kilowatt laser on an AC-130 gunship by 2022. This program, which is helmed by the Air Force Special Operations Command, and with the Navy also playing a critical role, is likely the nearest real airborne laser capability in the works. The program’s relation to the Navy would line up with Son of Ares demonstrator’s connections to that service and the form factor of the installation shown in the images above would easily fit on an AC-130 gunship. Still, as with SHiELD, we just don’t know for certain if these new modifications are related to that specific program. It is odd that a readily available C-130 wouldn’t be used for a system destined for that aircraft type. In fact, this is exactly what was done in the past. There are other potential airborne laser programs, including those related to countering ballistic missiles during their boost phase for missile defense, which would make sense, as well. But those efforts have apparently hit major snags as of late and their future, at least in the near-term, seems in doubt. Much of the issue has to do with the standoff range and power and beam-forming requirements needed to bring down a missile from a relevant distance. But if a stealthy aircraft was used, maybe it could get far closer to a potential target, which would help alleviate these issues. The side-mounted port on the enclosure would make sense for engaging targets over longer ranges from known locales, such as ballistic missiles. The Missile Defense Agency was looking for an unmanned asset to fly a demonstrator laser for this application nearly four years ago . Maybe they ended up ordering the Son of Ares jets, or at least employed them as surrogates for a stealthy medium-altitude, medium-endurance unmanned aircraft that such a system could be installed on in the future. It is also entirely possible that this modification has nothing to do with directed energy, as well, but we are at a loss as to what else it would be related to do. If the Son of Ares jets are indeed tasked with ushering in a new era in airborne directed energy capabilities, their existence would be far more historic than previously understood.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 29, 2020",Taiwan Can Now Complicate China’s Invasion Plans By Buying Hundreds Of Harpoon Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days after the United States approved three major new arms deals for Taiwan, the U.S. State Department has now sanctioned the sale of up to 400 Boeing-produced Harpoon anti-ship missiles . Should the sale proceed as planned, Taiwan would have a highly survivable counter to any potential naval assault by forces from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which has in the past threatened to invade. On October 26, 2020, the U.S. State Department notified Congress of the possible Foreign Military Sale , officially for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO), since Washington has no formal relations with Taiwan’s government. The deal, valued at around $2.37 billion, still requires Congressional approval, and its exact terms could still be subject to change. The announcement comes around five months after Taiwan publicly declared it was looking to buy ground-launched Harpoons and mobile launchers. Looking at it in detail, the package includes up to 100 Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems (HCDS) and related equipment, including up to 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II surface-launched anti-ship missiles, plus four RTM-84L-4 training rounds, according to the U.S. military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). Also included are 100 HCDS Launcher Transporter Units and 25 radar trucks. In addition, Taiwan would receive various spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and technical documentation, personnel training, and training equipment, plus U.S. government and contractor representatives’ technical assistance, engineering and logistics support services, and other logistics support elements. While the Harpoon may lack the extreme speed or low-observable features of the most advanced anti-ship missiles on offer today, in its Block II form it is still a very capable weapon that offers Taiwan a proven and relatively low-cost answer to coastal defense. Borrowing technology from the Boeing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and the Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER), the Block II missile includes a GPS receiver and advanced flight-control system to navigate its way to its target more precisely even in complex littoral environments. It also features a two-way data link that allows the missile to be retargeted mid-flight. The 500-pound warhead can be used against both maritime targets and those on land, if required. The Royal Canadian Navy ship HMCS Regina fires a Harpoon missile as part of Exercise Rim of the Pacific 2020., ROYAL CANADIAN NAVY/MS DAN BARD Harpoon is radar-guided, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage being it can operate in any weather, but its radar emissions can be detected by the enemy and potentially jammed. Some newer anti-ship missiles are using imaging infrared for terminal guidance , as well as passive RF sensors. This makes the missile more survivable, but also more vulnerable to missing its target due to bad weather and infrared countermeasures. “The United States maintains an abiding interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and considers the security of Taiwan central to the security and stability of the broader Indo-Pacific region,” an official from the U.S. State Department told the Voice of America television and radio network. According to the DSCA, the missiles will “improve [Taiwan’s] capability to meet current and future threats by providing a flexible solution to augment existing surface and air defenses. The recipient will be able to employ a highly reliable and effective system to counter or deter maritime aggressions, coastal blockades, and amphibious assaults.” Beyond the Harpoon’s specific capabilities, a sale of 400 new anti-ship missiles would represent a huge boost to the Republic of China Navy’s land-based coastal defense forces. The country’s military currently employs the indigenous Hsiung Feng II and Hsiung Feng III anti-ship cruise missiles, the latter of which is supersonic, but it’s thought that the local production capacity for these weapons is insufficient to keep pace with the PRC’s prodigious warship output . A Republic of China Navy DAF tractor-trailer equipped to launch both Hsiung Feng II and Hsiung Feng III anti-ship cruise missiles., 玄史生/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS There have also been hints made by Taiwanese officials that the ground-launched Harpoons will be more mobile than the existing Hsiung Feng series, which currently use tractor-trailer-mounted launchers. Although we still don’t know what kinds of trucks the Harpoons will be placed on, the choice of transporters could contribute greatly to their survivability. This would present the PRC’s military planners with a real headache if they attempted to knock out as many as a hundred dispersed Harpoon launchers to protect their own naval assets. Fielding various anti-ship missiles with differing capabilities and performance would also help create a more sophisticated defensive umbrella around Taiwan and provide additional redundancy in the case of electronic warfare jamming or other factors that might compromise one or more of the weapons. When multiple anti-ship missile types are used in coordination against a single target, it greatly complicates that target’s ability to defend itself, as well. As well as seeking significant numbers of land-based Harpoons, Taiwan has also been making other efforts to expand its anti-shipping capabilities, including new minelaying ships and patrol flights by Republic of China Air Force F-16 fighter jets armed with live air-launched Harpoon missiles . Still, adding up to 400 of the latest and most capable Harpoons, along with 100 highly-mobile ground-based launchers to employ them, will give Taiwan an ability to put ships approaching its shores from any direction at risk, and launching multiple missiles at each target could drastically improve their ability to damage or sink enemy vessels. This is especially relevant as China continues to rapidly expand its amphibious capabilities. Considering the land-based Harpoon system can be mounted on flatbed trucks, finding and killing the launchers themselves would likely prove extremely challenging for enemy forces. It’s also worth noting, that targeting information for the Harpoons does not have to come from the system’s own shore-based radar, but it can come from many other sources and, in some cases where the possibility of hitting the wrong target is either an acceptable risk or there are no friendly targets in an area where enemy vessels are operating, nowhere at all . All this increases the potential cost to China of an invasion operation, both in terms of speed of action and in loss of sailors and ships. As such, this large of a land-based Harpoon buy, if it is executed, certainly has deterrent value beyond its tactical value. A Republic of China Air Force F-16 fighter jet takes off armed with live AGM-84 Harpoon missiles, as well as air-to-air missiles., CHIANG YING-YING/AP Regardless of what new capabilities the ground-based Harpoons will offer Taiwan, the proposed sale is almost certain to draw a rebuke from authorities on the mainland. As The War Zone has discussed previously , the other three recently approved arms deals come amid deteriorating relations between Taiwan, the PRC, and the United States. Those other packages included High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) able to fire short-range quasi-ballistic missiles capable of reaching the mainland, AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) missiles, and MS-110 airborne reconnaissance pods. Beijing responded to the announcements of the first three arms packages by stating that it intended to place sanctions on Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. “Beijing’s efforts to retaliate against U.S. and foreign companies for their sales that support Taiwan’s legitimate self-defense requirements are unproductive,” countered U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus in a statement. We have already seen notably belligerent messaging from Beijing, in general, and there has been an uptick in military activities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait that separates the island from the mainland. The People’s Liberation Army has also shown itself increasingly willing to challenge Taiwanese forces in the region of late. All told, it’s clear that the island nation is taking the growing threat posed by the PRC’s naval might extremely seriously. While the wider political impact of the U.S. State Department’s decision to clear the Harpoon Coastal Defense System for sale to Taiwan remains to be seen, the potential fielding of up to 100 mobile anti-ship missile launchers could frustrate any future invasion attempt by the PRC.

The other members of the minehunter’s 27-person crew were reportedly safe and sound. The commercial vessel involved was the Maersk Launceston , a Portuguese-flagged container ship. At the time of writing, there were no reports of injuries on that ship and it’s unclear what damage it might have suffered. In a tweet, Maersk said: “The vessel has activated its emergency response procedures and the crew has been participating in the rescue operation for the seafarers of the naval vessel.” The 870-foot, 50,700-gross-tonnage Maersk Launceston had departed Piraeus and was said to be bound for the port of Çanakkale in Turkey. The ship’s present owner is the Essberger company, based in the German port of Hamburg, which describes itself as a “leading operator of chemical tankers within Europe.” The position of the Maersk Launceston in waters off Piraeus as of the afternoon of October 27, 2020, following the collision., VESSELFINDER.COM SCREENCAP The exact cause of the accident remains unclear, but local media reports described the freighter “passing over” the mine Greek Navy minehunter as the latter was leaving port. The captain of the Maersk Launceston has reportedly been arrested . Photos taken after the impact show the 197-foot Kallisto listing heavily to starboard in the water before being towed to the naval base on the nearby island of Salamis, minus its stern section, as seen in the accompanying video. One of two Hunt class minehunters in service with the Hellenic Navy, the Kallisto was originally built by Vosper Thornycroft for the British Royal Navy as HMS Berkeley and was launched in 1985 before seeing service during mine-clearance operations in the 1991 Gulf War. Together with its sister ship HMS Bicester (now named Evropi ), it was transferred to Greece between 2000 and 2001. A total of 13 Hunt class vessels were built for the British Royal Navy. Six of these ships remain in Royal Navy service. Another two were transferred to the Lithuanian Navy. HMS Berkeley while serving with the British Royal Navy., CROWN COPYRIGHT These vessels were originally designed to perform both minesweeping and mine-hunting duties, meaning they could both find mines and neutralize them, with provisions for a team of divers, unmanned submersible mine-disposal systems, and a mine-hunting sonar system . In Royal Navy service, their minesweeping equipment was subsequently removed, turning them into pure minehunters. When the first Hunt class ships were introduced in the 1980s, they were also the largest warships ever built with fiberglass hulls. Mine countermeasures ships are typically built with non-metallic hulls, in part to help reduce their vulnerability to magnetic mines. This also reduces their acoustic signature, which, in turn, makes them less likely to trigger acoustic mines. Considering the damage inflicted on the Kallisto, it might be considered fortunate that injuries were limited to two crewmembers. The extent of the damage will likely put the Kallisto out of action for good, although certain items can be recovered and used as spares for the Evropi . Should the Hellenic Navy opt for a direct replacement for the Kallisto , the U.K. government has another Hunt class vessel for sale . The former HMS Atherstone is currently laid up at Portsmouth in the United Kingdom and has been offered for sale since December 2017. It’s worth noting that the Greek Navy isn’t the only one to have suffered this kind of mishap recently. A month earlier, a similar accident befell the Russian Navy’s Parchim class corvette Kazanets , which collided with a civilian cargo ship in the Baltic Sea. The damage to the Kazanets was less severe and the Russian warship was able to continue under its own power, although the impact was sufficient to breach the hull of the cargo ship above its waterline. In 2017, the Russian Navy intelligence-gathering ship Liman also sunk in Turkey’s Bosphorus strait, after colliding with a freighter loaded with sheep. The U.S. Navy also suffered two notable collisions that year. In separate incidents, the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Fitzgerald and USS John McCain hit commercial vessels, leaving 17 sailors dead, in total. This morning’s incident in the Aegean emphasizes the dangers inherent in crowded shipping lanes. In this case, it seems the Kallisto ’s structural integrity may have prevented a far worse accident. At the same time, with the hull ripped in two, it’s likely also due to the crew’s efforts to mitigate the damage that the Kallisto remained afloat long enough to be salvaged.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A satellite image reportedly shows six F-16 Viper fighter jets , almost certainly belonging to Turkey, at a dual-use military-commercial airport in north-central Azerbaijan. This, together with other satellite imagery, shows that these jets relocated from another airport further west earlier this month, as the town it was in became the target of Armenian artillery and missiles strikes . These two countries have been embroiled in a major conflict for nearly a month now over the long-disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region A screenshot of the image of Azerbaijan’s Gabala International Airport, as seen through Maxar Technologies’ SecureWatch tool , first emerged on social media on Oct. 25, 2020. There are four F-16s visible in the shot, which is said to be dated Oct. 19, but reports say that the full imagery shows two more Vipers at the airport, as well. A satellite image giving an overall view of Gabala International Airport in Azerbaijan., Google Earth Though it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty, Turkey is almost certainly the operator of these jets. The Turkish Air Force first sent a contingent of six F-16s to Azerbaijan’s Ganja International Airport, ostensibly to take part in an exercise with other Turkish and Azerbaijani forces, on July 31. Ganja is situated just under 75 miles west of Gabala. Reports that the Turkish F-16s were still in the country, along with still unconfirmed claims that they were taking part in the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, had emerged just days after the conflict erupted on Sept. 27. Azerbaijani and Turkish authorities both vehemently denied allegations that a Turkish Viper shot down an Armenian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft two days later. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh has flared up multiple times since the end of a major war in 1994, which left the Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh in de facto control of the region. However, it remains widely recognized as Azerbaijani territory. Imagery that The War Zone previously obtained from Planet Labs did show two Vipers, together with what appeared to be a Turkish CN-235 light transport aircraft, still at Ganja as of Oct. 3. However, Planets Labs imagery of Ganja since then that we have reviewed shows no obvious signs of any aircraft of any kind on the part of the ramp that the F-16s and the CN-235 had frequented in the preceding weeks. A satellite image of Ganja International Airport on Oct. 3., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Additional imagery that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs also shows what appears to be the F-16s, as well as the CN-235 associated with the detachment, at Gabala at least as of Oct. 8 and still there as of Oct. 20. All of this further confirms the shift in the Turkish Vipers’ base of operations. A satellite image of Gabala International Airport on Oct. 8, showing what looks to be the six F-16s and the CN-235., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Another satellite image of Gabala, dated Oct. 20, showing what look to be the F-16s in slightly different positions, but still at the airport., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev reportedly acknowledged that the jets had been relocated earlier this month. Armenian authorities had previously said that they had information that the fighters had moved to Gabala, as well. It would make sense that the F-16s relocated further east some time after Oct. 3 and that much of the other activity at Ganja has since come to a halt. On Oct. 4, the Republic of Artsakh claimed to have struck Ganja, as well as other targets within Azerbaijan, with artillery. At the same time, Azerbaijani authorities claimed that Armenian forces had fired Tochka-U short-range ballistic missiles at the same general area, which officials in Yerevan denied. There were additional reported Armenian strikes on the Ganja area on Oct. 8, 11, and 17, the latter two of which may have involved Scud short-range ballistic missiles. It remains unclear what the F-16s may now be doing at Gabala, or what they had been doing in the preceding weeks. One possibility is that the continued presence of this contingent of F-16s in Azerbaijan is meant to be a deterrent against any major intervention against Azerbaijan proper from Armenia’s foreign partners, such as Russia or Iran. Having the Vipers in Ganja certainly did not dissuade Armenian and Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh forces from attacking that area. For its part, the Kremlin has previously said that it would not intervene directly in the fighting. There are now unconfirmed reports that Russia has used Krasukha electronic warfare systems to knock Azerbaijani drones or supplied them to Armenia for this purpose. Armenia itself has claimed to have brought down multiple Azerbaijani drones, but there has been little in the way of evidence to independently verify these claims. While both sides have are employing ballistic missiles , as well as rocket artillery, howitzers, and anti-tank guided missiles, against each other, Azerbaijan’s fleet of drones has far and away dominated the conflict. Azerbaijan’s unmanned aircraft include the increasingly popular Turkish-made armed Bayraktar TB2s , as well as various Israeli-made loitering munitions , also known as “suicide drones,” such as the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harop . Often grisly footage from cameras on these drones, as well as clips from the ground featuring the ominous whining of the engines of small unmanned aircraft, have become a hallmark of the fighting. Armenia now says it has begun to employ its own loitering munitions, as well. The fighting, overall, shows little sign of slowing down. A ceasefire, brokered by the United States, together with Russia and France, and publicly endorsed by President Donald Trump, went into effect this morning, but both sides almost immediately began accusing each other of violating it. Two previous efforts to bringing the shooting to a halt had also failed on Oct. 10 and 17. A television crew from Euronews had gone out to see whether the truce was holding for themselves and almost got hit by an anti-tank guided missile. You can see the missile go flying past one of the team’s vehicles at around 2:00 in the runtime in the video below. It’s not clear who fired the missile or if it was intended for the journalists or the Azerbaijani troops escorting them, or if it might have just a case of mistaken identity. The reporters thankfully survived the incident without any injuries or even major damage to their vehicles. As for the Turkish F-16s, now at Gabala International Airport, while there remains no evidence that they are actively taking part in the conflict, there is also no indication that they’re about to leave any time soon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We still don’t know much about what exactly caused the collision between a KC-130J and an F-35B , both Marine Corps aircraft taking part in the Weapons Tactics Instructor course out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona, near the Salton Sea in Southern California on September 29th, 2020 . What we do know is the KC-130J crew did an incredible job keeping their cool—listen to the air traffic control audio here —and getting the badly damaged aircraft on the ground, a farmer’s field near the town of Thermal, with all of its occupants alive. The Hercules tanker-transport, which belongs to VMGR-352 ‘Raiders,’ has since been partially disassembled and moved to Jacqueline Cochran Airport in Thermal and our friend and contributor Matt Hartman grabbed some shots of it. This is what the aircraft looked like shortly after it made its emergency landing near Thermal: Fast forward a few weeks and, as you can see, pretty much everything that can be removed from the aircraft has been, with just its fuselage left intact. Still, the damage is severe, especially around its landing gear sponsons. You can see how the skin of the aircraft itself is buckled near the side crew door. There is also a lateral tear in the fuselage ahead of the wing root. This may have been caused by one of the aircraft propellers ripping off its hub and impacting the aircraft. The gash looks very near the propeller-line warning markings on the aircraft.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Apr 15, 2021",France’s Fire-Damaged Nuclear Submarine Will Return To Service After A Nose Job,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Faced by an overall shortage of nuclear attack boats, the French Navy has confirmed that it will graft a new forward section onto the hull of the Rubis -class nuclear-powered attack submarine Perle that was badly damaged in a fire that broke out in dry dock at Toulon, southern France, last summer. Speaking at the Euronaval Online 2020 exhibition earlier this week, the French Minister of Defense, Florence Parly, announced that the submarine would be repaired and returned to service. “I am able to tell you that we can repair Perle and that we will repair the Perle, ” Parly told the Euronaval Online audience during the digital version of the maritime warfare exhibition, which is running from October 19 to 25, 2020. During the repairs, the bow section of the Saphir , a previously retired Rubis class nuclear attack submarine, will be mated to the Perle at the Naval Group submarine shipyard in Cherbourg, northern France. Parly said the work will take 300 people six months to complete. This kind of “nose job” is not unheard of for a badly damaged submarine. After the U.S. Navy’s Los Angeles -class attack boat USS San Francisco collided with an underwater seamount in the central Pacific in 2005, the bow of the USS Honolulu was subsequently grafted onto it, as The War Zone explained here . Prior to retirement in 2019, the Rubis- class nuclear attack submarine Saphir departs Faslane in Scotland for a Joint Warrior exercise., CROWN COPYRIGHT “Naval Group has already carried out this type of complex operation in the past,” said Emmanuel Gaudez, a spokesperson for the shipbuilder, in a statement reported by Naval News . “This is a succession of cutting, welding and connection tasks already carried out by the teams of Naval Group and its partners. “The thick hull cutting and welding work will be entrusted to the Cherbourg site,” he continued. “The other preparatory work that will be necessary on the front of the SSN Saphir will be carried out by the Services teams, in particular those at the Toulon site.” The shipyard plans to start work on repairing the Perle in January 2021, once the submarine arrives in Cherbourg. It expects the work to be completed in time for the Perle to be redelivered to the French Navy in early 2023. The French Navy submarine Perle approaches Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, from the Elizabeth River, to participate in Exercise Auriga 2010., U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 1ST CLASS TODD A. SCHAFFER Gaudez said that the repairs will not interfere with the schedule for the French Navy’s new class of Barracuda attack submarines, which Naval Group is also building. You can read all about these impressive submarines in this previous War Zone article . Perle had suffered extensive damage after a fire broke out onboard, reportedly the result of faulty lighting, while the submarine was undergoing repairs on June 12, 2020. Centered in the forward part of the boat, the blaze continued to burn for more than 14 hours, and hundreds of firefighters were required to extinguish it. There were no weapons or nuclear fuel onboard at the time and the reactor rooms were not affected by the fire. There were no reports of injuries. However, the high temperatures caused by the flames caused irreparable structural damage to steel components in the forward part of the hull, which is what will now be cut away and replaced. The potential damage of a submarine blaze in drydock was previously made abundantly clear when the U.S. Navy’s Los Angeles -class attack boat USS Miami caught fire during an overhaul in 2012 as the result of arson. The submarine was withdrawn from service as a result of the damage. More recently, the U.S. Navy has experienced serious fires onboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard — also now being investigated as a potential act of arson — as well as on the future USS John F. Kennedy , a Ford -class aircraft carrier still under construction, and on Bonhomme Richard’s sister ship, USS Kearsarge . The U.S. Coast Guard, too, has had its share of recent shipboard fires . When it comes to Perle , Minister of Defense Parly spoke of the importance of restoring the French Navy’s operational capacities “while ensuring the safety of the sailors.” Clearly, there is a requirement for all four of the remaining Rubis -class submarines to be operational, especially when, at any given time, two or three of these will likely be in refit, undergoing scheduled maintenance, or working up to train its crew. The first of the Rubis class boats, Saphir , was withdrawn from service in July 2019 and is now available to be cannibalized as part of the repairs. The new Suffren , the first of the successor Barracuda boats, six of which are eventually planned, will not be available until 2021. The French Navy considers six attack submarines necessary to ensure that two or three can be permanently deployed at sea, where their key roles include protecting the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and the Triomphant class of nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines. Among the advances that the new attack submarines will bring is their armament of MdCN cruise missiles, which have now begun test launches from the Suffren . The Missile de Croisière Naval, or Naval Cruise Missile, is a maritime version of the air-launched MBDA SCALP/Storm Shadow and will allow conventional attacks on high-value targets at a range of “several hundred kilometers,” according to French sources. The SCALP/Storm Shadow has a range of more than 155 miles, based on figures provided by the manufacturer. The first test-firing of an MdCN from Suffren took place near the Biscarrosse missile test center on the French Atlantic coast on October 20, 2020. The same weapon is already part of the armory of the French Navy’s FREMM multipurpose frigates and was first used in combat during strikes on Syrian targets believed to be associated with the country’s chemical weapons program, in April 2018. “Until now, France’s submarine force could strike submarines and surface ships. Henceforth, it can destroy heavy land infrastructure at long range,” announced Florence Parly, in a statement marking the MdCN’s test launch. The Barracudas will also retain the ability to employ the MBDA SM39 Exocet subsonic anti-ship missile, which is also carried by the Rubis class boats, as well as the next-generation F21 heavyweight torpedo. In another advance over their predecessors, the Barracudas will be able to carry and deploy small teams of special operations forces. However, until the arrival of the Barracuda class, the French Navy remains reliant upon the Rubis class, a design that dates back to the mid-1970s and which was the country’s first nuclear-powered attack submarine. With a submerged displacement of 2,600 tons, these are the smallest nuclear-powered attack submarines active anywhere in the world. The Rubis- class nuclear attack submarine Améthyste arrives at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, after completing patrol operations in the West Indies. , U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 2ND CLASS KELVIN EDWARDS In fact, back in the 1960s, France had considered building a larger attack submarine, with a displacement of around 4,000 tons submerged, before switching to the smaller Rubis design that was based on the hull form and layout of the diesel-electric Agosta class . Despite reportedly being excessively loud and lacking in performance as originally completed, all six Rubis boats were significantly upgraded under the Améthyste program, which stands for Amélioration tactique, hydrodynamique, silence, transmission, écoute, or Silent Acoustic Transmission Tactical Hydrodynamic Improvement in English. This work was undertaken between 1989 and 1995 and left the boats with a significantly revised hull form and other modifications. Originally entering service between 1983 and 1993, the surviving Rubis boats are being modernized to ensure they can continue in service until 2030, by which time the full fleet of Barracuda s should be available and the earlier submarines can be retired. The French Navy’s efforts to regenerate its attack submarine force demonstrate the continued importance of these deadly and highly adaptable vessels to modern naval warfare. Taking a novel approach to repairing the Perle will help maintain a fleet that’s large enough to ensure that adequate numbers of submarines are available when required.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump’s most iconic Sikorsky S-76B helicopter is now up for sale. Through stripped of the large “TRUMP” in white letters on the tail boom, pictures of the helicopter show it still has its distinctive Trump Organization paint scheme of black-over-white with red cheatlines, as well as its lavish VIP interior with gold trimmings. Toronto, Canada-based Aero Asset , together with Jet Edge Partners in the United States, are selling the helicopter, which still carries the U.S. civil registration code N76DT, a clear reference to its famous owner. The S-76B itself is said to be in Trenton, New Jersey , awaiting its future buyer. Anyone who’s interested will have to call to inquire about the asking price or make an offer. A 2016 story from The New York Times said the helicopter was valued at approximately $875,000, which looks to be about right based on the available comps, but that doesn’t take into account that it was owned by a television star whose now the 45th President of the United States. It was also a star in its own right, being repeatedly featured in The Apprentice , including during the opening titles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fOwR3bo2KfY This particular S-76B came off the line at Sikorsky, which is now a division of Lockheed Martin, in 1989, two years after the type first hit the market. The company had introduced the original S-76A in the late 1970s. N76DT, which also has the serial number 760351, has just under 6,260 flight hours on the airframe. The Sikorsky S-76B, previously owned by Donald Trump, now up for sale., Aero Asset The improved S-76B, an outgrowth of a helicopter Sikorsky originally marketed as the S-76 Mk II, had more powerful engines, as well as improved avionics and other upgrades that allowed for true all-weather operation. S-76 series helicopters, including further improved S-76C variants, have seen some use with militaries and other security forces . However, they have long been a go-to choice for VIPs, including notable business figures, such as Trump, and other celebrities, and even heads of state and royalty, including the Queen of England . Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven others tragically died when the S-76B they were traveling in crashed earlier this year . N76DT still has a pair of Pratt & Whitney PT6B-36A turboshaft engines, which were found on early S-76Bs, instead of the PT6B-36Bs found on some later examples. This helicopter has received other upgrades more recently, as well, including the addition of a Garmin GMX-200 digital multi-function display in the cockpit. N76DT’s cockpit, with the Garmin GMX-200 seen prominently at the center., Aero Asset Of course, the big draw for anyone interested in buying N76DT will be the luxurious interior, which seats six in leather-covered seats with actual gold seatbelts. There is various other gold fittings inside the cabin, a Trump hallmark , as well as various features with African Mahogany veneers. The full list of amenities, according to Aero Asset, is as follows: Six-Place Executive Cabin Interior with Panelling & Soundproofing System Upholstered rear bolster, overhead emergency lighting Floor to ceiling credenza unit in African mahogany veneer with lower zone 4 refreshment, condiment & ice storage drawers Central zone drinks cabinet with 3 decanters Upper zone accommodates Airshow Screen 3-4 Place forward-facing executive divan in Ecru/Almond Leather & African mahogany veneered fold-down table featuring dual cup holders and Ecru/Almond Leather armrests Rear divan seat bottom extension with 3 compartments for miscellaneous storage in African Mahogany Veneer Two (2) Aft-facing Reclining Captain’s Chairs in Ecru/Almond Leather with Tracking & Swivel Function Cabin Door Magazine Rack (R/H Door Only) Cabin Seats covered in Ecru/Almond Leather with Gold Seatbelt Fittings Headliner & Window Panels in Cream Ultra Suede Cabin Doors in Ecru/Almond leather with African Mahogany Panelling and Gold Fittings Scott Groups Custom Dual Tan Saint John Carpet It’s not necessarily surprising that Trump is selling this S-76B, which is one of three he has owned, along with various other aircraft , for years now and appears to be the one he has had the longest. It’s not clear when he acquired this helicopter, but he bought the second S-76B, a 1990 production example, in 2012, which was registered first as N76TE . Trump had that helicopter shipped to the Trump Turnberry Resort in Scotland in 2015, after which it was subsequently re-registered in the United Kingdom with the U.K. civil registration code G-TRMP. In 2014, Trump acquired another 1989 production S-76B, as well, which received the registration code N7TP. Both G-TRMP and N7TP wear distinctive white-red-and-blue livery, something of an inverse of N76DT’s paint scheme, with “TRUMP” written in red letters on the tail boom. Trump drives by one of his other S-76B helicopters, with the UK registration code G-TRMP, at Trump Turnberry Resort in Scotland., AP Sometime between 2015 and 2016, one of these other two S-76Bs got an all-new cabin layout designed by Eric Roth, a famous aircraft interior-designer and president of International Jet Interiors . Roth was also responsible for redoing the inside of Trump’s Boeing 757 , sometimes referred to as Trump Force One. N76DT, the helicopter up for sale now, was at the center of a brief controversy in 2015, as well. Then-candidate Trump had planned to offer free rides to children in the S-76B at the Iowa State Fair as part of his campaign. However, despite saying he would do so at his own risk, officials at the fair refused to allow him to conduct the flights from the fairgrounds. Undeterred, Trump ultimately set up shop in a nearby parking lot . Altogether, N76DT is not just a bespoke flying chariot for any very wealthy buyer, it’s also something of a historical artifact now. So, if you have the means and are interested in picking up this relatively unique helicopter, you can check out the listing on Aero Asset’s website and make them an offer.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Land-based Japanese F-35As trained alongside the U.S. Navy’s first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6) in the western Pacific during “advanced combined operations” earlier this week. The integrated air defense training involving Japanese and American forces comes as Japan works toward its own future carrier capability using the Joint Strike Fighter. According to a press release issued by the public affairs division on the USS America , the maneuvers “were designed to increase the tactical proficiency, lethality and interoperability of the amphibious forces of the America Expeditionary Strike Group and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) in the maritime domain.” The ship is homeported in Japan and is presently conducting operations in the Western Pacific region. “The U.S.-Japan alliance has been the cornerstone of stability and security in the Indo-Pacific for more than sixty years,” said Navy Captain Luke Frost, the commanding officer of USS America . “We have no more capable partner in the world than the Japan Self-Defense Force. Every opportunity we have to continue to train and exercise together improves our interoperability and strengthens our joint integrated capabilities.” “The training proved to be a very significant opportunity for us,” said Japanese Colonel Shinichi Nomura, a flight group commander with the JASDF’s 3rd Wing. “Training with assets of other services is essential to improve interoperability and joint operations capability.” Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-35As fly over the amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA 6) on October 20, 2020., U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST SEAMAN MATTHEW CAVENAILE The U.S.-Japan exercise in the western Pacific saw the participants run through tactics, techniques, and procedures for operating the F-35A in air defense and sea control missions. Operating over water is a routine occurrence for Japan’s fighter jets and one JASDF F-35A was lost in a fatal accident over the Pacific during a sortie from Misawa Air Base in April 2019. To date, the JASDF has received only conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) F-35A variants of the Joint Strike Fighter. Based on the available imagery, at least two of these jets were involved in this recent training event, which took place on October 20, 2020. In the future, however, Japan will receive the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B model, which it intends to take to sea aboard adapted Izumo -class warships . Japan initially referred to these vessels as helicopter destroyers but they’re actually far closer in concept to light carriers. In fact, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Defense later admitted that the Izumo -class helicopter destroyers were always designed with accommodating fixed-wing STOVL jets in mind, as The War Zone outlined in this previous article . Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopter destroyer Izumo (DDH-183), right, alongside U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)., U.S. NAVY/COURTESY OF JMSDF Earlier this year the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of 42 F-35Bs to Japan. These are just part of a much bigger proposed deal that would see Japan acquire a total of 147 Lightning IIs, making it the second-biggest operator of the F-35 after the United States. With these plans in mind, there is a strong likelihood we will see Japanese F-35Bs increase their cooperation with big-deck U.S. Navy assault ships and the Marine F-35Bs they carry, in the future. This kind of combined training could help the Japanese work up their own deck proficiency before going aboard the two modified Izumo -class warships. In Europe right now, U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs are assisting the British Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth as the warship works toward a first operational cruise next year. In the British case, as The War Zone examined in detail here , the Marines are helping boost the numbers of fixed-wing aircraft on deck, while crews exchange experiences of shipborne STOVL operations with their U.K. counterparts. A similar arrangement with Tokyo might involve Japanese F-35Bs first going to sea aboard U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships and working alongside U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs before these same jets go aboard the Izumo -class vessels. The Japanese may be particularly eager to engage with the U.S. Marine Corps. The Marines are presently examining the potential of the “Lightning carrier” concept, which involves amphibious assault ships operating more as light aircraft carriers with large numbers of Joint Strike Fighters, which we previously discussed in depth here . Japan’s pilots may have their own lessons learned and best practices to share based on the experience they are developing now using the F-35A in the naval air defense and sea control roles. The F-35, in particular, also has plenty to offer as a force-multiplier for a warship equipped to deal with the type, thanks to its significant electronic intelligence gathering capabilities , advanced sensors, data fusion, and networking capabilities. In this way, the jet could increase the ability of Japanese and U.S. forces to work together cooperatively during a crisis. U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST SEAMAN MATTHEW CAVENAILE The latest maneuvers also reflect the deepening U.S.-Japanese naval cooperation in the Pacific, where China’s military forces are increasingly flexing their muscles . Last summer, U.S. and Japanese armed forces teamed up with those of Australia for a huge trilateral exercise in the Indo-Pacific region. As well as pointing toward the potential for Japanese F-35s and U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships to work together in the future, this week’s exercise also demonstrates that U.S.-Japan maneuvers in the Pacific are increasing in complexity and potency, especially in view of China’s growing military presence in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 21, 2020",Watch This Finnish Leopard 2 Tank Roll Over Troops During “Tank Terror” Training,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Finland’s Jaeger Brigade has released a video showing conscripts lying down in single-file as a German-made Leopard 2A4 main battle tank drives over them. This is a routine part of the training the unit offers recruits and is ostensibly intended to help them get over any “tank terror” fears before possibly having to stare down one of these armored beasts on the battlefield. The brigade, also known as the Jääkäriprikaati in Finnish, posted the clip on Twitter on Oct. 23, 2020, along with a second one filmed from the perspective of a conscript being “run over.” There is more than enough clearance under the center part of the hull of the 55-ton Leopard 2A4 for a person to lie prone and have the tank drive safely over them. This training event was part of a larger series of drills for a group of conscripts at the Jääkäriprikaati ‘s base in Sodankylä, which is in Finland’s Lapland region and lies just above the Arctic Circle. Sodankylä is home to one of the brigade’s two main units, the Lapland Jaeger Battalion. The Jääkäriprikaati also has an air defense battalion at Rovaniemi, which is just south of the Arctic Circle, and the unit, as a whole, is the northernmost based component of the Finnish Defense Forces. Beyond providing an immediate line of defense in the country’s northern regions, it is also for responsible arctic training and the development and evaluation of arctic warfare tactics, techniques, and procedures. The increasing strategic significance of the Arctic region , as a whole, has only underscored the importance of the brigade’s mission sets and it often trains together with foreign military forces, including elements of the U.S. military . Finnish Leopard 2A4 tanks cross a river during another part of the recent training near Sodankylä., Finnish Defense Forces A Finnish Jaeger fires their weapon during another part of the recent training., Finnish Defense Forces Of course, the concept of “tank terror,” or panssarikauhun in Finnish, also commonly known as “tank shock,” is as old as these armored vehicles and was particularly pronounced when the very first examples emerged on European battlefields during World War I. The general issue is that troops, especially fresh recruits with little or no combat experience, may experience an overwhelming sense of fear when facing these armored behemoths in combat, when adrenaline and emotions are already running high, and be tempted to flee. These concerns aren’t just limited to infantry and armored vehicles. Many air forces employ “ aggressors ” flying jets with paint schemes evoking those that potential adversaries fly, or even actual foreign combat aircraft , if available, to help fighter pilots get over similar fears, or “ buck fever ,” as it is referred to in the United States. Finland isn’t the only country to conduct, or at least have conducted, this kind of training involving tanks, either. For example, as recently as this month, members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the country’s western Xinjiang region went through a similar drill involving both tanks and light tactical vehicles in order to “ enhance [their] psychological capability .” A Chinese tank drives over a soldier during training in the country’s western Xinjiang region in October 2020., China Military A light tactical vehicle drives over Chinese soldiers during recent training in Xinjiang., China Military It’s not clear how effective these kinds of drills are for breaking any innate fears an individual might have about encountering armored or other military vehicles on the battlefield. The training is clearly very heavily controlled, and rightly so, for safety purposes. That being said, no matter how well the training fulfills its stated objective, it almost certainly helps build camaraderie and esprit de corps among those who go through it. Various military units, as well as other security forces elements, around the world, often have similar training events, typically for new recruits, which are intended to provide a similar kind of community building. Some of these are more extreme and potentially dangerous than even having a tank pass over you. Whatever the exact benefits of this kind of “tank terror” training might be, the Finnish conscripts in the video clip that the Jaeger Brigade released certainly seem to have been successful in managing any fear they might have had as the Leopard 2A4 rolled over them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 10, 2020","Air Force Confirms, Then Retracts Statement That One Of Its RC-135W Spy Planes Flew Over Taiwan","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has confirmed that an RC-135W Rivet Joint spy plane made a highly unusual flight over the northern end of the island of Taiwan earlier this week as part of an operational intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission. The United States has also just approved a new round of potential arms sales to the island’s government, including short-range quasi-ballistic missiles capable of reaching the mainland. All of this follows a recent spate of threatening messaging from Beijing aimed at Taipei and its allies in Washington . Update: On Oct. 23, 2020, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Tony Wickman, the Director of Public Affairs for Pacific Air Forces, reached out to The War Zone to say that the original confirmation of the RC-135W flying over Northern Taiwan had been in error. “On Wednesday, my staff responded to your query regarding an RC-135 flight (link to story below) and I must inform you that what we gave you was incorrect,” he said. “I would like to correct the record by stating we did not have any U.S. aircraft in that area on the date and time in question. I apologize for passing bad information to you as you attempted to provide accurate information to your readers.” Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense has also reportedly denied that the Rivet Joint flew over the island. Taiwanese media reports have said that the RC-135W did enter the island’s Air Defense Identification Zone. We have changed the headline for this story to accurately reflect the information we have now. In addition, it is worth noting that online flight tracking software showed the RC-135W Rivet Joint with the serial number 62-4134 flying over northern Taiwan again today . “I can confirm that a RC 135W [sic] Rivet Joint aircraft did fly over the northern portion of Taiwan yesterday as part of a routine mission,” a public officer for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the top Air Force command for operations in the Pacific region, told The War Zone in a statement late on Oct. 21, 2020. “Due to operational security we are not able to discuss the specifics of the mission.” Plane trackers using online flight tracking software had been first to notice the Rivet Joint’s mission earlier that day. The available tracking data is limited, but suggests that the plane flew directly over the island’s capital city, Taipei, at one point. An overview image showing the RC-135W as it appeared on flight tracking software as it flew over northern Taiwan., ADS-B Exchange A close up showing tracks suggesting the RC-135W flew over Taipei during its mission., ADS-B Exchange Flight tracking software also showed that the aircraft in question was an RC-135W with the serial number 62-4134. On Oct. 19, this same Rivet Joint, as well as U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) plane, had been spotted flying a mission in the Bashi Channel, a body of water south of Taiwan that links the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea, as well as off China’s southern coastline. The Bashi Channel has seen a particularly notable uptick in U.S. military activity this year, which the War Zone has been following closely . That Rivet Joints, as well as other U.S. military ISR aircraft, are flying in this strategic part of the Pacific, in general, is hardly surprising. These activities in the region are relatively well known and caused something of a stir earlier this year, as well as an official rebuke from Chinese officials, over the apparent practice of RC-135s using bogus transponder codes, which, of course, does not hide the planes from enemy radars or really do much to conceal their flights, though it does obfuscate their movements on online tracking software. Though certainly uncommon, this is not the first time that an American military aircraft has flown directly over Taiwan this year. In August, online flight tracking software indicated that a Navy EP-3E had flown a very similar route , including passing over Taipei. In June, a Navy C-40 passenger transport aircraft also flew over the island . There have also been several instances in the last two years or so where U.S. military aircraft and ships have transited the Taiwan Strait. The RC-135W overflight, as well as the earlier flights over the island, are unusual and clearly seem designed to send a message to Beijing about America’s commitments to the island’s government. In 1979, the U.S. government formally recognized the regime in Beijing as the legitimate government of China, but Congress also passed the Taiwan Relations Act , reserving the right to support the island’s military and come to its defense in a crisis until its status has been settled for good. The Chinese government’s position is that it is a rogue province that is part of its national territory and that the airspace above it is sovereign national airspace. Beyond this signaling, we don’t know exactly what the Rivet Joint’s mission in this particular case might have been. However, the Air Force’s fleet of airliner-sized RC-135V/Ws are among some of the most capable intelligence-gathering platforms in U.S. military service today, with large signals intelligence suites able to detect and geolocate various kinds of emitters, including radars and communications nodes. With some two dozen intelligence analysts on board on a typical mission, these aircraft can intercept and begin to analyze enemy communications chatter and collect data on an opponent’s “ Electronic Order of Battle ,” including integrated air defenses. You can read more about the Rivet Joints and their capabilities in this past War Zone piece . An overview of what the various members of a typical crew onboard an RC-135V/W during a mission do., USAF Keeping tabs on Chinese military activity on the coast of the mainland facing Taiwan is an important mission, broadly, for the United States, given its aforementioned commitments to Taipei. It’s even more relevant at present given a slew of threatening signals emanating from the regime in Beijing , which routinely says it could take military action should authorities in Taipei seek to formally break away from the mainland. Just this past weekend, unconfirmed reports originating from media outlets in Hong Kong said that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was beefing up its ground-based missile forces near its southeastern coastline, including with the possible deployment of new hypersonic DF-17 missiles . Global Times , a newspaper operated by the Chinese Communist Party, subsequently published a piece based on those initial reports and citing Chinese “experts” who claimed that these deployments were meant to thwart “foreign military intervention” if the PLA were to initiate a “re-unification-by-force” operation. DF-17 missiles on parade in October 2019., China Military This follows months of major PLA exercises , some of which appeared to simulate potential operations against Taiwan , as well as other provocative military activity , including sending aircraft across the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait, which serves as the de facto boundary between the mainland and the island. There have been competing U.S. military exercises , and other military movements , some of which have involved other American allies in the region, this year, as well. This kind of tit-for-tat posturing has continued just in the past 24 hours with the announcement late yesterday that the U.S. government had approved a trio of potential arms sales to Taiwan. The three packages center on possible deliveries of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) missiles, and MS-110 podded reconnaissance systems for combat jets such as Taiwan’s F-16 Viper fighters . The deals, which Taiwan will still have to formally agree to and could be subject to change as part of subsequent negotiations, are valued at more than $1.8 billion, combined, and include a variety of ancillary equipment and services. The AGM-84Hs, a derivative of the Harpoon anti-ship missile , would offer Taiwan important additional capacity to engage threats across the Strait and elsewhere around the island in a crisis, while giving the launching aircraft the ability to stay further away from the PLA’s integrated air defenses. The weapon, which despite its name can engage targets on land or at sea, is also highly-accurate and resistant to electronic warfare jamming due to the use of an imaging infrared seeker to find its target in the terminal phase of flight. A SLAM-ER missile under the wing of a US Navy F/A-18C/D Hornet during a test., USN The MS-110s , which contain an advanced, long-range camera, will give Taiwanese combat jets important new reconnaissance capabilities, including potentially the ability to peer into the mainland to some degree from a standoff position using a slanted flight pattern. The multi-spectral camera system in the MS-110 can collect visual and infrared imagery, as well as fuse them together for greater fidelity. In addition, this means the camera can grab images at night, as well as during the day, and detect objects of interest that might be obscured by smoke and dust, as well as some man-made camouflage. A graphic from an MS-110 brochure showing the pod on an F-16 Viper, as well as the camera itself in the inset., Collins Aerospace However, the HIMARS package may be the most significant of the three. The system is capable of firing various munitions from the common M142 launcher mounted on a 6×6 tactical truck, but the only ones that this proposed deal includes are 64 Army Tactical Missile System (ATAMCS) quasi-ballistic missiles with unitary high-explosive warheads. These missiles have a range of approximately 190 miles and would be easily able to reach coastal areas across the Strait, even from the center of the island. These weapons could be extremely valuable for engaging PLA artillery and ground-based missile systems, command and control nodes, supply dumps, as well as areas where invasion forces might be marshaling. Of course, it’s important to note that the PLA has a massive advantage in raw numbers, as well as various key systems, including ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles, over the Taiwanese military. The PLA’s air and naval branches have also demonstrated their ability to launch strikes from multiple directions at once, including from out in the Pacific to the east , potentially enveloping the island. At the same time, Taiwan is well aware of these realities and has focused heavily on developing and acquiring various capabilities that could help delay a Chinese invasion to buy sufficient time for the U.S. military to stage an effective counter-intervention. For their part, as expected, Chinese officials have already denounced the new proposed arms sales to Taiwan. The deals “seriously damage China’s sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces, and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. “China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has already incited the ire of Chinese authorities on multiple occasions in the past with the approval of other major arms deals for Taiwan, including the sale of Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, which Beijing had long said was a “red line” issue . U.S. officials, including Trump himself, have cultivated a very close relationship with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen who won reelection earlier this year and has pledged to further distance the island’s institutions from the mainland. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen together with other Taiwanese officials ahead of her inauguration ceremony in May 2020., AP There could well be a concern in Beijing that Trump, who is struggling in the polls for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, which will take place in a matter of weeks, might even just signal support for a greater independence push in Taiwan to bolster his domestic political position. The American President and his Administration have been highly critical of the Chinese government at times over the past four years, especially over international trade issues , as well as other geopolitical concerns, such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea . The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , which originated in China, has further soured relations between the two countries. Tsai herself may have her own concerns about possible changes in the island’s relationship with officials in Washington should Trump lose to his challenger, former Vice President and Senator Joe Biden, in November. What does seem clear, is that American actions, such as sending the RC-135W over Taiwan and approving new arms sales to the island’s government, will continue to draw ire and tit-for-tat responses from Chinese authorities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 23, 2020",Tanked Russian Soldiers Plow ‘Tank’ Through Airport Wall,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is no stranger to road rage incidents and other serious roadway encounters , which sometimes even involve military armored vehicles . Now, a video has emerged on social media reportedly showing a very different kind of joyride reportedly involving drunken Russian conscripts in a BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle plowing through a barbed-wire-topped concrete wall at Volgograd International Airport in the southwestern region of the country. The incident at the airport, also known as Gumrak Airfield, reportedly occurred on Oct. 20, 2020, according to a post from Russia’s independent news outlet Baza on the Telegram social media network. The vehicle was said to be on its way to a training ground for an exercise at the time. Baza’s post added that the airport continued to operate as normal after the BMP-3 came charge through the wall, but that the vehicle damaged part of its security system. From the video, which appears to have been shot by a closed-circuit television camera at the airport, the crew, drunk or not, certainly seems to have made a deliberate decision to go through the wall. The driver of the BMP-3, which weighs just over 20 and a half tons, does not appear to attempt to stop in any way after first making contact with the barrier. It’s not clear from the video if the vehicle sustained any damage during the incident. The vehicle’s turret, which houses a 100mm gun, which can also launch anti-tank guided missiles, and a 30mm automatic cannon, is traversed to the rear, a common procedure on tanks and other heavy armored vehicles during non-combat travel. This at least kept the barrels of those weapons from striking the wall. “If the fence does not go to the Russian soldier, then the Russian soldier goes to the fence,” a machine translation of a part of Baza’s Telegram post reads. Additional pictures subsequently emerged on social media showing the breached wall, as well as an individual in a military uniform, said to be the BMP-3’s driver, with various cuts on his face and his hands appearing to be handcuffed behind him. It’s not clear if he sustained these injuries during the incident or his apparent arrest. This appears to be the most “combat,” in any sense of the word, that the airport has seen in decades. During World War II, German forces used the airfield to support their operations during the famously protracted fighting in and around the city, which was then named Stalingrad. Soviet troops recaptured it in late January 1943, an important step in cutting the supply chain for the remaining Nazis in the area. The airport continued to operate as both a military and civilian facility after the war. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Air Force continued to operate L-39 jet trainers there for several years. Today, Gumrak is primarily a commercial airport. It saw an expansion in the mid-to-late 2010s as part of a broader effort to improve infrastructure in the country in the lead up to Russia’s hosting of the World Cup in 2018. Of course, air travel, in general, around the world, has dramatically slowed now due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . “We all miss traveling, but please don’t try this at home,” a Tweet with the video clip that Russia’s Moscow Times newspaper posted on Oct. 22 said, in a clear reference to the pandemic’s impacts. Baza’s Telegram post also said that the video was an “excellent” contender for a new sequel to a Russian movie from 2000 called Demobbed , also known as DMB , an absurdist comedy cult classic in the country about being a conscript in the Army. There have already been four actual sequels, DMB-2 through DMB-5. “Demobbed” is a colloquialism for being “demobilized,” or being released from service after the end of one’s conscription period. Though we don’t know what prompted this particular joyride, there have been many horror stories over the years about brutal hazing and a generally toxic environment within the Russian military for conscripts, especially in the initial phases of induction and basic training. Reports of alcoholism and drug abuse are also common. In a way, this also feels somewhat reminiscent of a bizarre incident in 2018, in which Joshua Philip Yabut, then a Lieutenant in the Virginia Army National Guard, led police on an unusual chase after stealing an M577 armored command vehicle from Fort Picket in Blackstone, Virginia. Yabut, who was under the influence of drugs at the time, was charged with driving under the influence, felony eluding, and unauthorized use of a vehicle, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2019. He was subsequently released with strict conditions , including a court-ordered mental health treatment plan. It remains to be seen what will happen to the Russian conscripts who were involved in this dramatic intrusion onto the grounds of Volgograd International Airport.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have gotten our first close-up look at the F-117 Nighthawks that have forward deployed to MCAS Miramar in San Diego, the arrival of which The War Zone was first to report on. You can read details about their arrival, see video of it, and listen to the air traffic control audio in our previous article . The aircraft pictured looks exceptionally ‘fresh,’ unlike some of the worn coatings we have seen on F-117s that have popped up at remote locales over the last few years. The fresh coating of radar-absorbent material —the highly important outer cloak that helps the Nighthawk attenuate radar returns—apparently includes a bright red-and-black checkered tail-band. Notably absent is the ‘Dark Knights’ moniker seen on one F-117 spotted over the Mojave Desert in 2019. This is likely the unit’s name, official or otherwise, that matches with the KNIGHT callsign they commonly use. High-contrast ‘TR’ tail markings are also present, indicating the aircraft’s home base at Tonopah Test Range Airport . The F-117s carried similar tail markings decades ago after being declassified and before they moved from the remote Nevada base to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. The F-117 in the photos is also adorned with what appears to be a high-visibility Nighthawk emblem near its intake. The Nighthawk logo I am referring to looks like the one below and was used throughout the operational life of the program: militarypatchesandpins.com/F117SFA.org The rest of the aircraft’s markings are bright and clear, as well. The shots come to us from Phil Decker who runs the Air Tales Instagram and Youtube accounts . They underline what The War Zone has been saying for some time, that the tiny flying F-117 force has migrated from a test and evaluation activity to also a more formal aggressor role . We may have even captured a photo opportunity at Tonopah Test Range Airport meant to commemorate the unit’s establishment or another significant historical marker as a prelude to its first deployment. Phil Decker/Air Tales Phil Decker/Air Tales Phil Decker/Air Tales Phil Decker/Air Tales Phil Decker/Air Tales Phil told The War Zone that three F-117s seemed to have arrived at the base, two earlier in the day and another in the evening. Otherwise, one may have snuck out and then returned. While MCAS Miramar has confirmed to The War Zone that the jets are indeed there, we are still working to get a statement from Air Combat Command about why they are deployed to the base, and their broader mission. The War Zone is the only media outlet that has gotten a formal statement as to the F-117’s disposition from the Air Force in recent years, including how many are left and who is flying them. You can check out this official information in this past piece of ours . As such, it would be great to get an update and hopefully confirm the F-117’s new and far more visible role. Finally, just a personal thought. It must have been like Darth Vader arriving on the Death Star when these jets landed at MCAS Miramar midday. The base houses hundreds of aircraft, from F-35Cs to MV-22s, to C-130Js. Many of those units have young enlisted folks working on the flight line who may have never even heard of the F-117 before, or at the very least had no idea they were still operating. With that in mind, it would be one hell of a surprise seeing one of these taxi past and disappear into a hangar without explanation.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 29, 2021",The Navy Just Sent A Drone To Deliver Cargo To One Of Its Ballistic Missile Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this week, a quad-copter-type drone delivered a small payload to the U.S. Navy’s Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Henry M. Jackson as it sailed on the surface of the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The service said that this was a test to explore novel concepts for resupplying Ohio class submarines while they’re out on their nuclear deterrent patrols , but it certainly also brings up thoughts about how some aspects of at-sea replenishment, in general, may look in the future. The replenishment by drone took place on Oct. 19, 2020, according to the Navy. It’s not clear how long the USS Henry M. Jackson has been operating in the Pacific or whether or not it is on a deterrent patrol at present. As of Sept. 1, the boat was in its homeport in Washington State after completing its 100th deterrent patrol the previous month. “Underway replenishment sustains the fleet anywhere/anytime,” a caption for one of the pictures that the Navy released of the event read. “This event was designed to test and evaluate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of U.S. Strategic Command’s expeditionary logistics and enhance the overall readiness of our strategic forces.” The Navy offered no details about the payload, which the drone was carrying slung underneath it, and it is not clearly visible in any of the pictures or the video clip from the event. Some of the pictures do show that personnel launched the drone from a small boat of an unknown type sailing relatively close to the submarine. Whatever the package was, it wasn’t very big. Without knowing the exact capabilities of the drone, it’s hard to say how useful this particular combination might be in an actual operational scenario. USN USN USN However, the core concept seems sound and could have potential, even for just moving small, but critical items, such as medicine, emergency rations, or similarly sized cargoes. A small drone might also carry orders and other important messages, as well as intelligence information and other data on physical media. Last year, the Navy conducted a separate experiment in which a helicopter brought a physical message from one surface ship to another, demonstrating how it might be possible to communicate while maintaining radio silence to avoid detection or in the event of heavy enemy jamming. All of this could be especially relevant for Ohio class ballistic missile submarines, which sail underwater for months at a time during deterrent patrols to avoid detection and help ensure that they can carry out their apocalyptic mission if called upon. They also need to have secure, reliable communications options available at all times to be able to receive vital information, including Emergency Action Messages that might order a nuclear strike, which you read more about in this past War Zone piece . Using vertical take-off and landing capable drones with greater range capabilities and payload capacities would certainly help expand the utility of this concept, as well. All of this could apply to conducting at-sea replenishment of surface vessels or simply shuttling cargoes between one ship and another or forces ashore , too. Of course, this concept isn’t perfect, especially when it comes to submarines, which are particularly vulnerable when running on the surface. If the vessel launching the resupply drone has to be situated relatively close by it could further increase the risk of detection. One solution to this problem might drones that can land on the water and then sink below, where a submarine might be able to recover them. Various such concepts already exist and the secretive and highly specialized guided-missile subvariants of the Ohio class, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , have demonstrated their ability to launch and recover various kinds of unmanned aerial platforms while submerged. An experimental Flying Sea Glider, a drone capable of aerial and underwater operation that the Office of Naval Research developed, an example of a hybrid unmanned platform that the Navy might be able to use to resupply submerged submarines., Joseph Trevithick In addition, if enemy jamming were to be so severe that there would be a desire for alternative communication links, one would have to imagine the control links between the drone and its operator would also be at risk. An unmanned platform capable of operating autonomously to a high degree might help this issue. Drones of any size won’t be the only option the Navy will have in the future for resupplying submarines and other ships at sea, either. In fact, the day after the quadcopter brought its small cargo to the Henry M. Jackson , an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter from Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 37 (HSM-37) brought a load of supplies slung underneath it out to the submarine as another part of this logistical demonstration. USN USN USN USN USN No matter what, new at-sea replenishment options, and more overall capacity to conduct those operations, is only set to be increasingly important to the Navy, in general, especially as it looks to increase operations in the broad expanses of the Pacific and the remote Arctic region . Those demands will only increase if the service proceeds at all toward its new goal of a fleet with some 500 ships and submarines , or more, in total. Unmanned aircraft, as well as surface and undersea unmanned platforms , could help provide some of that necessary extra logistical capacity with a minimum of additional required manpower, too. All told, this recent visit by a cargo-carrying quadcopter to the Henry M. Jackson appears to have been very much a limited experiment. At the same time, it underscores how the Navy’s at-sea replenishment concepts of operation are likely to evolve in the near future.

The inbox here at The War Zone can be pretty interesting on any given morning, but today’s correspondence featured something you definitely don’t see every day—an entire Patriot air defense battery sprawled out on a runway at a small regional airport. Apparently, very few people, if anyone, at Easterwood Airport in College Station, Texas knew exactly what was going on with the sudden deployment of the Army’s preeminent air defense system, either. “Nobody knows anything, they just showed up” one commercial pilot that flies in and out of Easterwood daily told The War Zone. We reached out to the Easterwood Airport’s administration and they had very little knowledge of what exactly was the deal with the Army setting-up shop on their grounds. They mentioned that around 300 soldiers accompanied the radars, command and control elements, and multiple transporter-erector-launchers that make up the Patriot system that is currently arrayed along Taxiway G and Runway 11-29 at the airport. Reader Submission The airport is still open and traffic is coming and going, although it looks a bit like a war zone. Notices to airman (NOTAMs) have been published denoting that the taxiway and runway will be closed for a week. NOTAMs associated with the deployment., FAA Airport officials also mentioned that they were told the battery came from Fort Hood, also in Texas, and gave us a contact number there to inquire with. We called that number and also reached out to Fort Hood’s public affairs team and got an answer to the mystery. Easterwood Airport in College Station, Texas. , Google Earth The public affairs officer for the 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (1-44th ADA), part of the 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Hood, told The War Zone that the unit was executing a relatively rare deployment where they set up shop in an unfamiliar location, just as they would during a crisis. After setting up their gear, which as you can see in the images below is quite extensive, as well as an operations center, they will operate as they would in a wartime-like setting and run drills associated with a real-world deployment, This includes defending against air-breathing threats, such as airplanes and cruise missiles, and high and fast-flying ballistic missiles . It’s worth noting that there are no live missiles being used as part of the training evolution. There will also be an opportunity for ROTC Cadets from nearby Texas A&M University to take part in the exercise and see what one of the Army’s top air defense battalions looks and operates like during an actual deployed operation. Submission As to why this airport was chosen, it isn’t exactly clear. But an operational airport facility like this is likely much more realistic to train for expeditionary operations at than a vacated one. An active airbase may have been considered a bit too familiar and convenient. Air defense batteries are often deployed to airfields overseas. Still, we really can’t remember when such a high-profile deployment has occurred at a small civilian airport in the past. Submission Submission So, there you have it! The folks at the airport are getting a front-row look at a Patriot unit in action and the soldiers that are deployed to Easterwood Airport are getting some high-level training. And once again, while there has been an uptick in homeland air defense training as of late, this Patriot battery is just there to simulate expeditionary operations, although that’s not to say that their services couldn’t be called upon in a crisis to defend key areas of the country. We will update this post when we find out more information as to the true nature of this very peculiar deployment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 22, 2020",F-117s Make Surprise Visit To Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of those who live and travel around Marine Corps Air Station Miramar got one heck of a surprise this afternoon as a pair of F-117 Nighthawks recovered at the sprawling air base situated north of downtown San Diego. The jets’ visit comes as the officially retired F-117 force has drastically expanded its operations, now being used constantly for testing and aggressor duties in a far more visible manner, including during high-profile exercises , such as Red Flag. It isn’t clear exactly what the stealth jets are doing there, but aircraft that are participating in exercises that take place over the massive range complex off the Southern California coast often stage out of Miramar. As part of their expanded operations, F-117s have ventured off the SoCal coast for drills on multiple occasions, as The War Zone was first to report , including working with carrier strike groups that are spinning up for deployment. As far as the possibility of staging out of a forward base, that would be an entirely new development. For over a decade, they have just called Tonopah Test Range Airport , the same place they spent nearly a decade at during their formative and highly classified operational years, home. They remain more active than ever since their retirement at that base. We do know that the F-117s have landed at Edwards AFB at least once in recent months, but that seemed like a diversion due to high-winds at Tonopah, not a scheduled stop, although we have not been able to confirm the exact circumstances surrounding that visit. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jamal Ingram (@spins_321) If indeed they are staging out of Miramar, and this wasn’t an emergency landing or some sort of diversion incident, it would mark a huge change in how the small and highly shy F-117 force is operated. At the same time, it would fit their expanding role as aggressors, which will likely last at least until the F-35A is fielded in a similar manner. F-117A during its operational days. , USAF There have been near-constant exercises and developmental testing going in and over the waters off Southern California in recent months and we also know a major homeland air defense exercise is underway off the California Coast, one that could have possibly introduced the F-117s as low-observable targets for F-15s to chase. But the fact of the matter is that we really have no idea what they are up to. #NORAD will conduct a live-fly air defense exercise off the Pacific Coast near the San Francisco Bay Area today btw 1:30-3:30 Pacific.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 29, 2019",It Looks Like Russia’s Nuclear-Powered Cruise Missile Test Program Is Back In Business,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent satellite imagery suggests that Russia may be working to resume testing of its 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile program in Novaya Zemlya , an archipelago above the Arctic Circle. This highly controversial missile, which is codenamed SSC-X-9 Skyfall by NATO, has suffered a number of mishaps during development work in the past, including a deadly explosion last year . CNN was first to report that work might have resumed at the test site, drawing upon satellite images from Planet Labs that had been analyzed by researchers Michael Duitsman and Jeffrey Lewis at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. Two U.S. officials also told CNN that they were aware that Russia “has been preparing to test missiles as part of its advanced weapons program.” The images of Novaya Zemlya from September 2020 show that new structures have appeared at the Pankovo site, a test facility that experts believe previously hosted the weapon for at least one live flight trial in late 2017. Recent “high levels of activity” suggests that further weapons trials are now planned here. “The activity and new construction are consistent with a resumption of test flights of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile,” Duitsman and Lewis contend. In their own blog post about the developments, the two researchers point to activity at three different locations at the Pankovo site. The work includes the reconstruction of a launch pad that is believed to have been used for previous missile launches. It now appears to have been reconfigured to fire the Burevestnik in a different direction. According to The Barents Observer , in the November 2017 test, the missile headed toward a weapon range at Sukhoy Nos, north of the Matochkin Shar. This area had previously hosted Soviet-era nuclear weapons tests, including “ Tsar Bomba ,” the world’s most powerful nuclear detonation. Second, “large numbers” of shipping containers have appeared at different support areas around the site, one of which the researchers identify as the likely missile checkout building. The arrival of these containers seems also to be linked to increased activity by cargo vessels in local waters. Finally, a new helicopter pad has been built, which would allow for the transporting of crews and payloads around the site. The first known test flight of the Burevestnik at Pankovo reportedly took place in November 2017 and U.S. intelligence sources claimed the missile had crashed in the Barents Sea. Duitsman and Lewis say that at least four Burevestnik tests took place between then and February 2018, but none were considered successful. The limited information to have emerged about the results of those four tests was discussed in more detail here . Russia test-fired four Burevestniks in total between November 2017 and February 2018, according to the new information. The longest test flight reportedly lasted over two minutes and saw the weapon travel a total of 22 miles, while the shortest experiment saw the missile fail within seconds, but it still managed to cover a distance of five miles. The missile reportedly uses a nuclear reactor to power its propulsion system, giving it theoretically unlimited range. In March 2018, Russia released a purported video of a Burevestnik test that showed a launch from what appeared to be the Pankovo test site. President Vladimir Putin also released details of the weapon to the Russian parliament, saying it had “unlimited range” and was “invincible against all existing and prospective missile defense and counter-air defense systems.” However, it appears that the Burevestnik work at Pankovo came to an end the same year and the test site was dismantled. Testing then moved to Nyonoksa, also written Nenoksa, in the northwestern Russian region of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea. In August 2019, what may have been efforts to raise a Burevestnik missile from the seabed near the Nyonoksa test site resulted in an explosion that killed five scientists and injured three more from Russia’s state-run nuclear corporation Rosatom and left a radioactive cloud over the city of Severodvinsk. The Russian Ministry of Defense attributed the accident to the explosion of what it called a liquid-propellant rocket engine and denied that any dangerous substances were released. Rosatom later admitted its employees had been working on an experimental “isotope power source” when it exploded. Whether or not the Burevestnik test effort has simply switched from Nyonoksa back to Pankovo or if testing is occurring at multiple locations is unclear. A map showing the location of the Pankovo test site on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago., GOOGLE EARTH Overall, little is known about the exact design of this nuclear-powered cruise missile, but it’s thought to employ a nuclear-powered ramjet engine. Reportedly, the weapon uses rocket boosters to accelerate it to an optimal speed, after which the fast-moving air blows over the hot reactor, emerging from an exhaust nozzle to generate thrust. Whatever way it works, a fully functional Burevestnik — should it prove technically feasible — offers the advantage of virtually unlimited endurance, making it extremely hard to defend against. On the downside, the missile will carry a potentially hazardous radioactive payload whether it’s flying with a warhead or unarmed. Its emissions could also be hazardous. A capture from the official video released in 2018 showing a Burevestnik test round in its launch canister, plus others under tarpaulins in the background. , RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP It may not be entirely coincidental that renewed work at Pankovo comes as Russia and the United States are negotiating the future of the  New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) that is due to expire in February 2021. The Kremlin has indicated it would be willing to extend the deal for a year without preconditions, while the United States is seeking a freeze in the total number of nuclear warheads on both sides. There are conflicting reports about what the two countries may have agreed to so far. Regardless, Moscow has argued in the past that the Burevestnik does not fall within the New START framework, which is focused on limiting each country’s arsenals of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and heavy bombers. At the same time, the Kremlin had also suggested previously that its nuclear-armed Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, which is launched using a converted ICBM rocket booster, would also not be subject to this agreement, but subsequently changed its position and allowed American officials to inspect at least one of these weapons under the auspices of the treaty. While the exact status of the test program for Russia’s Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile remains unclear, the latest imagery and analysis does at least indicate that work on the missile is very much ongoing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 6, 2020",All Of The Navy’s Arleigh Burke Destroyers Will Get Hypersonic Missiles Top Official Says,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien, has said that that the present plan is to integrate hypersonic missiles onto every one of the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers , dozens of which are in service now, with even more under construction. Depending on the exact kind of hypersonic weapon those ships might receive, this could be an extremely costly and time-consuming undertaking. Defense News was first to report on O’Brien’s remarks, which he gave during a visit to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine on Oct. 21, 2020. At present, the U.S. Navy has 58 Arleigh Burke class ships in service, including Flight I, II, and IIA subvariants. More than a dozen additional ships in this class, including more IIAs, as well as new Flight III types , which will have additional advanced capabilities, are already under construction or on order. “The Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike program will provide hypersonic missile capability to hold targets at risk from longer ranges,” O’Brien said in his prepared remarks, according to Defense News . “This capability will be deployed first on our newer Virginia class submarines and the Zumwalt class destroyers. Eventually, all three flights of the Arleigh Burke class destroyers will field this capability.” The still-in-development Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic missile is the Navy’s portion of a shared development effort with the U.S. Army. This weapon uses a ballistic missile-like rocket booster to loft an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , known as the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), to an optimal altitude and speed. After reaching that point, the C-HGB glides down to its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, within the atmosphere. Army shows video of March 2020 Common-Hypersonic Glide Body flight test @SMDConference : pic.twitter.com/46fDDlGXKF — CSIS Missile Defense (@Missile_Defense) August 4, 2020 A mockup of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body. , US Army The boost-glide vehicle is capable of following a variable trajectory and maneuvering laterally, making it much more unpredictable than re-entry vehicles on traditional ballistic missiles, even those capable of maneuvering on their own. This, in turn, makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to defend themselves in any way, including simply attempting to reposition critical assets or otherwise seek cover, before the weapon hits its mark. Last week, the Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said that the C-HGB had demonstrated extreme accuracy in testing, being able to reliably hit within six inches of the designated target. The Pentagon has previously said that this hypersonic boost-glide vehicle will be able to reach a peak speed of up to Mach 17 and that it will be able to “strike targets hundreds and even thousands of miles away.” The Navy has already publicly said that it plans to first integrate, onto its future Block V Virginia class submarines. Earlier this year, Congress also pushed for adding this weapon to the arsenal of the service’s long-troubled Zumwalt class stealth destroyers. The first-in-class USS Zumwalt , which was initially delivered in 2016, only fired a missile of any kind for the first time this week. It is worth noting that there is the possibility that O’Brien may have been speaking more generally about adding a hypersonic weapon capability to the Arleigh Burkes , rather than integrating the Conventional Prompt Strike missile onto those ships, specifically. It remains unclear what the peak speed of the Navy’s planned super-sized multi-purpose SM-6 Block IB missile, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , might actually be. It’s also not clear if the top-secret Sea Dragon missile is capable of reaching hypersonic speeds. There are also undoubtedly other hypersonic weapons in development in the classified realm , some of which may also be intended to arm these destroyers in the future, as well. Still, O’Brien directly linked the hypersonic “capability” he was talking about for the Arleigh Burkes to what is planned for the Block V Virginia class and the Zumwalt class. In addition, there have already been discussions in the past about possibly refitting some number of older Arleigh Burkes to be able to fire the Conventional Prompt Strike missile, as well as adding this capability from the start to the design of a new Large Surface Combatant in the future. Having dozens of destroyers capable of employing these missiles would only further expand the ability of the Navy to persecute long-range, time-sensitive strikes, especially against highly-defended targets. If Trump’s National Security Advisor was talking about the Conventional Prompt Strike missile, it’s not immediately clear how feasible such a modification program might be. To start with, the existing Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells on the Arleigh Burkes are simply not big enough to accommodate the complete Conventional Prompt Strike missile. The maximum diameter of a weapon that can fit inside these cells is around 21 inches, while the Conventional Prompt Strike’s booster is known to be 34 and a half inches across. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Hopper , a Flight I ship, fires a missile., USN The “strike length” cells in the Arleigh Burke ‘s Mk 41 VLS arrays are designed to accommodate missiles around 20 feet long at most, as well. While the exact length of the Conventional Prompt Strike missile is unknown, the Army says the weapon will fit inside a container that is roughly the same length as an M870 flatbed trailer, which is 40 feet long. This is why the Block V Virginia class submarines will be first to get these missiles, because these boats will feature a new Virginia Payload Module (VPM) with four very large launch tubes. The Navy also notably used an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine , which has tubes able to hold the nuclear-armed Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile, a weapon around 44 feet long, to conduct the first publicly acknowledged at-sea test of a Conventional Prompt Strike missile in 2017. An official US Army infographic depicting the container loaded with the C-HGB-tipped missile as being roughly the same length as an M870 trailer., US Army A graphic showing the general layout of the Virginia Payload Module, including its four large-diameter launch tubes., USN Similar questions had arisen about the logistics of integrating the Conventional Prompt Strike missile onto the Zumwalt class destroyers, as well. Those ships, at least, have space that could potentially be freed up by removing the two 155mm Advanced Guns Systems , which are effectively dead weight since the Navy has no plans at present to buy any ammunition for them. Even if a reasonable conversion program could be developed for the Arleigh Burke s, the Navy would still have to execute it, which would be an enormous undertaking, both in terms of time and resources. Defense News ‘ initial report on this plan rightly noted that there are already severe strains on the shipyard space available for maintenance and conversion work, which has often led to significant delays in getting ships and submarines returned to the fleet . All of this also follows the announcement of a questionably ambitious plan to increase the overall size of the Navy’s combined fleets to more than 500 ships, which would only add to these yards’ workloads. You can read more about this naval force structure proposal, now known as Battle Force 2045, in detail in these previous War Zone stories . In principle, at least, arming all of the Navy’s existing and future Arleigh Burkes with hypersonic missiles would dramatically expand the service’s long-range, precision, time-sensitive strike capabilities. At the same time, it very much remains to be seen if the service will be able to turn this plan into a reality and what hypersonic weapons these destroyers might actually receive in the end.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 17, 2020",Spain To Buy More Eurofighter Typhoons To Replace Aging F/A-18 Hornet Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Spain is the latest European country to move to buy more Eurofighter Typhoon multirole fighter jets to bolster its air force. The manufacturer announced today that it is now in negotiations with the Spanish government for the replacement of 20 Spanish Air Force EF-18 Hornets under what is called Project Halcón, or Project Hawk. The company says it has submitted its offer to the Spanish government and is now in talks “to mature the proposal.” It expects to sign a contract for the 20 new Typhoons in 2021. To supersede these older Hornets, the Eurofighter consortium is offering 20 new Typhoons that will be completed to the “latest standard,” including the Captor-E Mk 1 active electronically- scanned array (AESA) radar, which you can read more about here . The Spanish Air Force has already received all 73 Typhoons from its initial order, which comprised 59 single-seaters and 14 twin-seaters. Three of these have been lost in accidents, but the remaining 70 are all still active, forming a fast-jet fleet alongside U.S.-supplied EF-18 Hornet multirole fighters. A Eurofighter Typhoon from Ala 14 wing over Albacete Air Base in southern Spain., EJÉRCITO DEL AIRE MINISTERIO DE DEFENSA ESPAÑA Operating one American and one European fighter type in parallel is an informal Spanish Air Force policy dating back to the Cold War when types such as the F-4 Phantom II, F-5 Freedom Fighter, Mirage III, and Mirage F1 made up the country’s frontline fighter fleet. The 20 oldest EF-18 Hornets that Madrid is now looking to replace are the oldest in the country’s inventory. They started life as U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18As and are now used to defend the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. Although they have a multirole capability, they are primarily used for air defense. One of the former U.S.-operated F/A-18A+ jets on a mission over the Canary Islands., GIOVANNI COLLA/EJÉRCITO DEL AIRE MINISTERIO DE DEFENSA ESPAÑA These jets are the survivors from a batch of 24 delivered from U.S. stocks between 1995 and 2000. Although they have modernized to the F/A-18A+ standard, which essentially brought them up to a standard comparable with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18C/D, the airframes are old and now require replacement as a matter of priority. This is an important consideration for Spain’s industrial base. The last Spanish Air Force Typhoon from the original order was delivered earlier this year, when the Tranche 3 jet arrived at Albacete-Los Llanos Air Base on January 9. Spanish Typhoons, like those for the other European core customers — Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom — were delivered in three distinct “tranches” with significant differences in terms of avionics and capabilities. Airbus Defence and Space is also currently undertaking a program at Getafe to upgrade the 17 surviving Spanish Tranche 1 aircraft to incorporate later Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 equipment, which would confer a full multirole capability. The company announced re-delivery of the first modernized Typhoon on February 26, 2019, and aims to complete the program in 2023. It’s a different approach to the United Kingdom, for example, which is instead using its Tranche 1 jets for more basic air-to-air and aggressor missions. While Spain is making efforts to ensure its Typhoon fleet remains capable, and to replace the oldest EF-18s, there is still a question over the future of the remaining Hornet fleet, which comprises 52 single-seaters and 12 two-seaters, the remainder from a total of 72 delivered directly from the aircraft’s original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, as new-build airframes between 1986 and 1992. These new-build Hornets were put through an upgrade program in the mid-1990s, which brought them up to a standard that was broadly similar to the F/A-18C/D. The resulting aircraft, which became known as EF-18A+/B+s, featured new mission computers, targeting pods, and AIM-120 AMRAAM capability. A continued process of enhancements under a mid-life upgrade effort has since helped the Hornets keep pace with their rivals, adding the Thales Scorpion helmet-mounted display and a ROVER air-to-ground video datalink for the targeting pod, among others. In the process, the jets have received the revised designations EF-18AM/BM. However, the aircraft are now showing their age, as are similarly configured aircraft around the world. For example, the F/A-18C has been retired from frontline U.S. Navy service . One of the Spanish Air Force’s upgraded EF-18AM jets., RAIMUNDO PÉREZ CABRERA/EJÉRCITO DEL AIRE MINISTERIO DE DEFENSA ESPAÑA Spain may yet buy even more new Typhoons as it looks to replace the entire EF-18 fleet between 2025 and 2030, although exactly how many extra Eurofighters may be required is unclear and the future of this effort will likely be influenced by the progress made on the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which involves France, Germany, and Spain . The FCAS initiative plans to field a sixth-generation stealthy manned fighter and accompanying unmanned platforms by 2040. One possibility that’s been suggested is to replace the remaining Hornets by purchasing three batches of 20 Typhoons, to spread the cost, which will be particularly important as the Spanish economy takes a hit from the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. Whatever happens, it seems Spain has chosen to buy more Typhoons as the next step in modernizing its air force. As such, the country appears to be following a similar path taken by Germany, which has also confirmed its intent to purchase 93 additional Tranche 4 Eurofighters. The German buy will include 38 jets as under the Quadriga program to replace the Luftwaffe’s early Tranche 1 aircraft, plus another 55 to succeed a portion of the Tornado combat jet fleet, 85 examples of which are earmarked for replacement. The German Ministry of Defense hopes to launch the procurement of the new Typhoons in 2025. The German situation is made more complex by the need to replace the remaining Tornados operating in the nuclear strike and electronic warfare roles. This has led to a decision to purchase 30 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets that will be adapted to carry B61-12 freefall nuclear bombs, plus 15 EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, as discussed by The War Zone in this previous article . It’s worth noting that Spain is not among the countries that Boeing highlighted in the past as a potential Super Hornet customer, suggesting that the Typhoon may have a straightforward path to securing more orders from Madrid. On the other hand, if Spain decides to replace the Navy’s EAV-8B+ Matador II short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) jets — equivalent to the U.S. Marine Corps’ AV-8B+ Harrier II — the only option would be the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. This would be able to operate from the deck of the Spanish Navy’s amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I . The high cost of replacing such a small force of just 13 jets might prove prohibitive, but it will have to be addressed before the Matador II is retired from around 2030 to 2034. A Spanish Navy EAV-8B+ Matador II launches from the “ski jump” on the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I ., NATO/PUBLIC DOMAIN Alongside its fighter modernization plans, Spain may be on the verge of selecting a successor to its jet training fleet, too. Airbus Defence and Space recently pitched its new Airbus Future Jet Trainer, or AFJT, to Spain, with a view to replacing the current Spanish Air Force fleets of F-5M Freedom Fighters and CASA C-101 Aviojets around 2027 or 2028. The appearance of the proposed AFJT was somewhat surprising. Not only does the Airbus trainer enter an already crowded marketplace , but Spain has already selected the turboprop-powered Pilatus PC-21 to replace its Aviojets, placing an order for 24 of the Swiss-built machines. Notional Airbus advanced jet trainer consortium concept. , Airbus Like other aircraft in its class, the AFJT is being offered as part of a complete package including live-virtual-constructive (LVC) training and ground-based training systems. The company is also hopeful that orders might follow from other European countries, potentially including Finland and France . Airbus has said the AFJT will be tailored to train pilots for aircraft such as the Typhoon and Hornet, specifically, while it’s also possible that it would be suitable to prepare aircrew for the future FCAS manned fighter. Whether Spain chooses to fund a program for a new jet trainer, as well as additional Typhoons to replace more of its Hornet fleet, remains to be seen. For now, however, the Eurofighter is showing that, despite initial production for the core customers having come to an end, it still very much has a future both in Europe and potentially elsewhere.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the past week or so, there has been an unprecedented surge of domestic aerial activity from the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies in response to protests and rioting following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , Minnesota. This has ranged from helicopters flying very low-level shows-of-force flights over parts of Washington, D.C. to drones and manned surveillance aircraft orbiting over numerous American cities to cargo aircraft bringing large numbers of troops to Andrews Air Force Base right outside the nation’s capital. Increasingly more accessible online flight tracking software has made it easier to observe what military and police aircraft and helicopters are doing, but, especially now, it is not always easy to separate them from more mundane and routine flights that might appear unusual to the untrained eye. A good example of this is a series of missions that one Beechcraft King Air A90 , with the civil registration number N67K, flew over the greater Los Angeles area between May 28 and June 1, 2020. Each one of these flights, which are seen below, involved the plane flying long, regular tracks over certain areas Los Angeles and other nearby cities. To some, it looked like the plane might be flying a surveillance mission. Los Angeles has seen significant protests and rioting , as well as harsh responses from police, in reaction to the killing of George Floyd .

The company’s fleets that are available for those missions include dark grey-painted King Air A90s . However, this particular A90, which is part of a fleet of aircraft that are painted white and have red and blue cheat lines on the fuselage, engine cowlings, and tail, as well as red-tipped wings and tails, is configured for an entirely different type of mission, one that involves dropping loads of sterile flies. The California state government has a contract with Dynamic to provide this service as a means of controlling the population of Mediterranean fruit flies , or Medflies. Two of Dynamic’s fleet of A90s that are involved in California’s Medfly control program., Dynamic Aviation Medflies are native to sub-Saharan Africa, but have spread to California, among other U.S. states, via international trade and travel. These small insects are notably destructive to fruit and vegetable crops, making them a particular concern for the Golden State, which is the largest agricultural producer in the United States and an important source of food for the entire country. In the 1980s, the California state government used helicopters to spray a pesticide called malathion to help control medflies, as well as mosquitos and other pests. A public outcry over potential cancer risks associated with malathion, combined with concerns from residents that the chemical would ruin the finish on their cars , led authorities to end the practice. The state subsequently shifted to the so-called Sterile Insect Technique , or SIT. SIT involves aircraft releasing male insects, which are bred in captivity and then irradiated, making it impossible for them to reproduce, over an affected area. Females then make futile attempts to mate with them. The relatively short life span of most insects means there is then a good chance that they will die before finding a fertile mate. This technique has been in use around the world since the 1950s to combat various types of invasive and disease-spreading insects. It has a long track record of success in controlling, as well as outright eradicating certain species in areas where it has been employed. Dynamic Aviation says it has been conducting SIT flights itself for more than 25 years , including as part of its long-standing contract with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). California’s Medfly Preventative Release Program (PRP), including Dynamic’s specially configured A90s, is run out of Joint Forces Training Base – Los Alamitos (JFTB-Los Alamitos), a California National Guard base in Los Alamitos, California, which is situated just to the southwest of Los Angeles. CDFA manages the program in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Areas covered by the CDFA Medfly Preventative Release Program., CDFA The state imports sterile Medflies in their pupae stage from a production laboratory that the CDFA runs in Hawaii and another one that USDA supports in Guatemala. The pupae arrive in bags mixed with fluorescent pink or orange dye, which then transfers to the flies as they grow. This allows CDFA and USDA personnel to identify the flies and track their spread. The bags also have radiation tags to indicate they have received a sufficient dose to render the flies sterile. Bags of sterile Medfly pupae mixed with fluorescent pink dye., CDFA The flies are then bred in a controlled environment until they have “reached peak sexual maturity,” according to the CDFA website. Then they are chilled and packaged for delivery to Dynamic’s crews. Flies can survive at low temperatures in a state of hibernation, making them infinitely easier to transport. A view inside one of Dynamic’s specially configured A90s, with the fly hopper visible in the foreground., Dynamic Aviation Flies in the hopper., Dynamic Aviation At JFTB-Los Alamitos, personnel then load the flies into hoppers inside the A90s. The aircraft then dispense them over the designated are through chutes that stick out from the bottom of the fuselage. In addition to the special dispensing equipment, these aircraft have an additional navigation system, originally designed for crop dusters, which helps them fly those long, straight routes back and forth over Los Angeles and other communities in the area. They also have cameras underneath the fuselage to confirm that the insects are actually falling from the chutes. A 2009 blog post by Ron Rapp, who worked for Dynamic and flew SIT-configured A90s over southern California, offers a highly detailed breakdown of how these missions go, from start to finish. The piece, which is worth reading in full , notably describes the unique challenges, as well as boredom, that the crews have to contend with, with Rapp writing: “We are required to keep the aircraft within 150′ of the course line, 100’ of the desired altitude, and maintain 140 knots indicated airspeed +0/-5 knots. That’s not hard to do… for a while. But try doing it when you’ve been in the air for seven hours already. Fatigue? Yeah, it gets tiring.” … “Keep in mind most of our operations take place in the Los Angeles basin, the most highly congested airspace in the world. We operate close to terrain, at low altitudes under the LAX [Los Angeles International Airport] localizer, and in all sorts of odd places you don’t normally find airplanes. We need to do that to ensure a proper coverage of medflies. I believe we drop them at the rate of something like 32,500 flies per linear mile.” “The system works well, but it does require a high level of vigilance from the pilots. The Los Angeles airspace was not designed to accommodate our kind of flying, but what we do is important enough that the controllers have maps of our regions and we have an excellent working relationship with them, often operating in Bravo airspace where other aircraft would not be allowed entry.” “When we reach the end of a line (or ‘pass’, as we call it), we reverse course and fly the next line according to the data provided by the CDFA. Most of our regions are flown on north/south or east/west courses, but occasionally terrain will dictate an oddball course, such as out by Lake Elsinore.” Beyond just the aerial application portion of the process, California’s Medfly control program is a major undertaking. The state takes delivery of more than 223 million pupae for processing every week , according to the CDFA website . The entire operation costs $16 million to run each year. It is true that there are also drawbacks to SIT. The releases are species-specific, meaning that they can only work against one type of insect at a time, unlike pesticides. It can also be difficult to ensure the sterilized males go where they’re supposed to and there is an inherent risk that they might not have been sufficiently irradiated to actually prevent them from mating. Still, the results, at least according to CDFA, appear to be worth that cost. Before it began the program, California saw an average of seven and a half major Medlfy infestations annually. The state now sees less than one every year, on average, thanks to the routine dispensing of the sterile flies. So, while it might have looked like N67K was flying surveillance missions over Los Angeles in recent days, especially given the current context, it was actually doing its part to help control these pests and protect the state’s farming sector. We want to thank @FatRomanticSlob for bringing N67K’s recent flights over Los Angeles to our attention.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 5, 2021",Navy Hires Boeing To Develop A Very Fast And Long-Range Strike Missile Demonstrator,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has received a contract to help develop a ramjet-powered high-speed missile demonstrator for the U.S. Navy. The company says that the design will aid the service in identifying requirements for future air-launched missiles, possibly ones able to reach hypersonic speeds, that its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and other combat aircraft within its carrier air wings will be able to employ against targets on land or at sea. The company’s Defense, Space & Security division announced that the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), part of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), had awarded it this contract, worth approximately $30 million, on Oct. 20, 2020. The work will be conducted under what is officially called the Supersonic Propulsion Enabled Advanced Ramjet (SPEAR) program. The goal is to conduct the first flight of the demonstrator in late 2022. “We have a talented team of engineers to meet the challenging technical demands and schedule timeline that the SPEAR program requires,” Steve Mercer, the Program Manager at Boeing for the SPEAR effort, said in a statement. “We look forward to working with Navy experts to advance technologies for the Navy’s future capabilities.” It’s not entirely clear what kind of missile demonstrator the Navy is looking for exactly for the SPEAR program. The acronym includes the word “supersonic,” but Boeing’s press release cites its prior work on the X-51A Waverider , an experimental air-breathing hypersonic vehicle that featured a scramjet engine . Hypersonic speed is generally defined as anything above Mach 5. At the same time, Boeing also highlighted its work on “the Variable Flow Ducted Rocket propulsion system under the Triple Target Terminator program in 2014.” The Triple Target Terminator program , or T-3, which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) led, explored concepts for very-long-range air-launched missiles that would be able to engage hostile aircraft, cruise missiles, and air defense threats on the ground, hence the name. A Variable Flow Ducted Rocket propulsion system is a kind of rocket ramjet, a relatively well-established concept at its core, in which gas produced by burning a source of solid fuel is mixed with compressed air fed into a combustion chamber via a duct or air intake to produce thrust. Advanced designs that allow for varying the flow of gas into the combustion chamber make it possible to throttle the thrust and adjust the speed of the vehicle the ramjet is powering. With this in mind, it’s worth noting that NAWCWD issued a request for information regarding “Solid Fuel Ramjet Propulsion Manufacture/Test” in March, though it is unclear if that contracting notice is related in any way to SPEAR. In addition, Boeing’s press release says that it will “co-develop” the SPEAR demonstrator, but it’s unclear if this means another company is involved in the effort or that the Navy’s own engineers and scientists will be directly assisting with the work. The website of the Naval Aviation Systems Consortium (NASC) lists a contract award to the company relating to the SPEAR program on Aug. 31, valued at just over $32 million, but for the demonstrator’s airframe only. NASC “has been formed to support the technology needs of the Naval Air Warfare Centers (NAWCs) and the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) through the use of Other Transaction (OT) Authority,” according to the site. There is no mention of this award in the Pentagon’s daily contracting announcement for Aug. 31, which is supposed to include any deal valued at more than $7 million. The SPEAR contract that Boeing has just announced also does not appear in today’s notice , so it’s unclear when the Navy formally awarded these two contracts and whether or not they are, in fact, the same one. The War Zone has already reached out to Boeing for more information about its involvement in the SPEAR effort. Whatever the company’s role in the project is or isn’t, the press release certainly indicates that it will be a stepping stone to the development of future anti-ship and land-attack missiles that will be integrated onto aircraft in the Navy’s carrier air wings. This includes the services F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , another Boeing product, a significant number of which eventually slated to go through the Block III upgrade program , which will add a host of advanced features that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . At the same time, the clear indication is that any operational weapons that follow-on from the SPEAR effort could be added to the arsenal of the service’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighters , as well. An F/A-18E Super Hornet, at left, and an F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, at right, share space on the flight deck of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln during tests in 2018., USN “The contract award comes after the Department of Defense requested information from the defense industry to help the Navy determine technical requirements of future carrier-based land and sea strike weapons systems,” Boeing’s press release said. “The SPEAR flight demonstrator will provide the F/A-18 Super Hornet and carrier strike group with significant improvements in range and survivability against advanced threat defensive systems,” Mercer, the firm’s SPEAR program manager, added. Very-long-range, high-speed strike weapons could be very valuable for the Navy’s carrier air wings, especially as potential near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia, continue to develop and field increasingly longer-range and otherwise more capable surface-to-air missile systems and associated radars and other sensors . Aircraft carriers and their associated strike groups and air wings are also increasingly at risk from various anti-access and area-denial capabilities , further underscoring the need for weapons with greater range and that are able to prosecute targets faster to help ensure their survival. At present, the primary air-launched stand-off anti-ship and land-attack missiles available to them are the AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile, the AGM-84H/K Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM-ER), and the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), all of which are subsonic. The service is in the process of developing the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), which will have at some surface strike capabilities and will also serve as the basis for a Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) for the U.S. Air Force. However, the exact speed and range of this weapon are unclear. The Navy is also developing a powered cruise missile derivative of its AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) glide bomb. Boeing’s SPEAR announcement comes as the U.S. military as a whole is pursuing a wide array of new hypersonic strike weapons, including unpowered boost-glide vehicles and air-breathing missiles . The Air Force is working toward its own “Expendable Hypersonic Multi-Mission Air-Breathing Demonstrator” as part of a program called Mayhem , which is linked to work on advanced turbine-based combined cycle engines. That service is also working closely with DARPA on the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) project and its own Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) effort. Lockheed Martin, which is leading the development of the HAWC missile, has proposed a follow-on design for use by the Navy in the past. In August, the Air Force had said it was looking at designs from Boeing, as well as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, to meet a requirement for “a solid-rocket boosted, air-breathing, hypersonic conventional cruise missile, air-launched from existing fighter/bomber aircraft.” It’s not clear if that announcement was related to HACM or not, but the following month, Boeing released a computer-generated promotional video featuring a B-1 bomber firing what the company described as a notional hypersonic missile. The company has subsequently released a more detailed still rendering featuring this conceptual missile that, at least visually, appears to be an air-breathing design. Boeing All told, it’s hardly surprising that the Navy is also in the process of pursuing its own high-speed strike missiles to arm its carrier aircraft. There’s no reason to believe that the weapons that emerge from SPEAR won’t be suitable for integration onto land-based platforms, such as the service’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, as well. Whatever SPEAR’s final design looks like, it’s an important step forward for the Navy in providing this capability to its combat aircraft fleets in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what was said to be the largest such test in decades, employees at Sandia National Laboratories recently used rockets to propel a tractor-trailer truck down a track and into a prototype of a new semi-trailer designed to securely move nuclear warheads around the country. This destructive testing is part of the qualification process of the new Mobile Guardian Transporter, or MGT, and the data will also be used to help model accident scenarios involving trucks carrying America’s deadliest weapons . Sandia revealed the test , which it said occurred sometime over the summer at its rocket sled track facility in New Mexico, earlier this month. Development of the MGT first began in 2015 and construction of the initial prototype, which was destroyed in this experiment, was completed by March of this year. The MGTs will replace the existing Safeguards Transporters, or SGTs, that the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) Office of Secure Transportation (OST) uses to truck nuclear weapons and other sensitive nuclear material by road around the country. You can read all about the SGTs and OST in this past War Zone feature . “I was glad to see the rockets fired; I was glad to see it was successful,” Jim Redmond, the Senior Manager of the MGT program, said in a statement. “It was tense. The entire team, including partners from LANL [Los Alamos National Laboratory] and Lawrence Livermore [National Laboratory], were excited and relieved. There’s a lot of pride among the team, as well as the government sponsors, that we are greatly increasing our understanding of accident environments.” A picture from the destructive test of the Mobile Guardian Transporter prototype earlier this year. The rocket-propelled tractor-trailer truck is seen hurtling toward it in the background., NNSA The last time researchers and engineers at Sandia performed any kind of similar experiment was around 20 years when they slammed another truck into a fixed barrier. An official press release did not say what design was tested in that previous instance, but it was likely an SGT, examples of which OST first began receiving in the 1990s “About two decades ago, Sandia crashed a truck into an immovable barrier, but this is the first time we’ve done a test in this configuration, where we took a truck at full capacity and propelled it down the track and hit our test article sitting idly at the end of it,” Redmond explained. “In two decades, you can imagine how much technology has advanced in terms of our ability to measure responses of the trailer and its contents.” Another image NNSA released showing the rocket-propelled tractor-trailer truck flying toward the MGT prototype during the 2020 destructive test., NNSA It’s not hard to see the value of this kind of destructive testing for a vehicle like this. It’s important to know how any car or truck might respond in various accident scenarios, but it’s even more critical when you know it will be carrying nuclear bombs or other radioactive payloads. It’s important to note that modern nuclear weapons do use insensitive conventional explosives, which are highly resistant to going off accidentally due to shock or fire , to trigger an actual atomic reaction. However, an accident on the road involving one of these trucks still runs the risk of damaging the weapons and sending nuclear material, explosives, and other potentially hazardous material flying. The same general concerns apply if the truck is simply carrying a load of nuclear material by itself. “The transportation mission is a critical component of an effective nuclear deterrent,” Redmond, the MGT program manager, added. “It provides needed assurance to the American public and our allies of the safety and security of our stockpile. You’ve got to be able to ship nuclear assets safely and securely or you don’t have a deterrence program.” When it comes to the MGT, its payloads aren’t the only things that could become hazards in the event of an accident, either. We don’t know the exact features of this trailer design, which Sandia says is entirely new and not derived from the present SGT. However, we do know that the SGTs have walls that can dispense a sticky, adhesive-like foam to immobilize any unauthorized individual from trying to steal the cargo inside. A grainy video still showing the inside of an SGT undergoing maintenance. , Department of Energy capture The SGT’s predecessor, the Safe Secure Trailer (SST), had tear gas to further deter intruders and explosive bolts to shear away the rear axles and make it physically impossible to tow the trailer away. A 2017 story from the Los Angeles Times says that the SGTs have a system that delivers electric shocks to anyone trying to gain entry illicitly, but makes no mention of the tear gas or the explosive bolts, and it’s unclear if those were retained in that design. Regardless, the sticky foam and other potential elements of the trailer’s defensive suite could present additional hazards in the event of an accident. In 1991, some of the defensive systems on an SST accidentally went off as it traveled along a highway in North Dakota, reportedly causing the foam to leak from the main compartment, among other things. The exact chemical composition of the foam and how toxic it might be is unclear, but a HAZMAT team from Sandia National Laboratories subsequently went out to the site to safely dispose of it. The video below shows U.S. Marines demonstrating various less-than-lethal capabilities, including a sticky foam that may be similar to what is used in the SGT trailers. While this destructive test is certainly an important milestone for the MGT program, Sandia says that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has imposed new challenges and hardships on the project team, and it’s not clear when these vehicles may begin to actually enter service. Previously, the goal was to have the first examples on the road by 2023. The new trailers are also expected to remain in service beyond 2050. The future MGTs, as well as the existing SGTs, are, of course, just one part of the overall security infrastructure surrounding the movement of nuclear weapons and related material by road in the United States, which you can read about more in this past War Zone feature . Pictures of the destructive test indicate that the same heavily modified and armored Peterbilt tractor trucks that pull the SGTs today will be used with the new MGTs, as well. Armed personnel from the NNSA’s OST guard the vehicles throughout their trips and are accompanied by security guards in other vehicles. If a major contingency arises, NNSA can also deploy elements of its Special Response Force to help secure the truck’s sensitive cargo. One of NNSA’s specially modified Peterbilt tractor trucks pulling an SGT. , Department of Energy via Los Angeles Times Members of NNSA’s Special Response Force train to protect an SGT., GAO It’s also important to note that there have been concerns in the past about low morale and toxic work culture within OST. A deep investigative report that the Los Angeles Times published in 2017, and that is still worth reading in full , highlighted years of reports of serious disciplinary and safety infractions, including numerous alcohol-related incidents and the pervasiveness of the office’s personnel carrying unauthorized weapons. When it comes to the MGT’s design, at least, Sandia has now clearly taken rather dramatic steps to help ensure that it is reliable, safe, and secure to use for transporting the most destructive weapons in the U.S. military’s arsenal and other highly sensitive nuclear materials.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The US Moves Nukes in Booby Trapped Tractor Trailers Straight Out Of An Action Movie,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On July 25, 1991, drivers traveling south along Highway 83 past Bismark, North Dakota came across an odd sight, a seemingly innocuous tractor trailer truck stopped along the road, guarded by police and heavily armed federal agents and leaking smoking goop. What local residents didn’t necessarily know – and the Department of Energy wouldn’t tell them at the time – was that they had seen a specialized truck for discreetly carrying nuclear weapons and other radioactive cargoes . These tractor trailers are booby trapped with countermeasures such as immobilizing foam and self-destruct systems, which all sound right out of a Hollywood blockbuster. They belong to the Office of Secure Transportation (OST), which has a checkered record of safety and disciplinary issues. OST traces its history specifically to 1975, when the Energy Research and Development Administration created the Transportation Safeguards Division. This eventually became OST, now part of the larger National Nuclear Security Administration, who continues to be in charge of moving America’s most dangerous weapons and other hazardous nuclear material “of strategic amounts” safely around the country. Before that, there were a variety of different organizations that handled disparate nuclear transportation operations. “There are several things going on where the truck is and we’re looking at that area,” was the cryptic response Ben McCarty, a Department of Energy spokesperson, gave the Bismark Tribune when they asked for answers following the 1991 incident. “We have operational responsibility for the vehicles and we’re checking it thoroughly.” Given the sensitivity of the cargo, which remains classified, McCarty no doubt wouldn’t or couldn’t divulge much else. According to a heavily redacted declassified version of the official incident report, he was also speaking in such vague language in no small part because no one exactly knew what had happened initially. Martin Pfeiffer , a PhD candidate at the University of New Mexico researching nuclear weapons , obtained a copy of the record and graciously posted it online . The Department of Energy’s internal review says all that was immediately clear to the guards at the scene was that the truck’s elaborate protective features had gone off inadvertently. Everyone was in such a hurry to get the classified cargo out of the area that they sealed everything up, got it mobile, and rushed it off to nearby Minot Air Force Base for further evaluation. OST teams train to rapidly extract their cargo, which can include nuclear warheads, from any potentially hazardous situation. An official Department of Energy video, seen below, actually shows personnel almost comically throwing mock nuclear warheads from a truck during a training exercise in their haste to get it to safety. Of course, the design of these devices is such that they are supposed to survive plane crashes and other hazards, so the danger in this tactic is probably less serious than it might appear. The specialized tractor trailers are only one part component of OST convoys, as well. These will also include additional unmarked support vehicles, usually a combination of dark sport utility vehicles or vans outfitted with satellite communications equipment and modified suspensions, cargo pods, and heavy duty bumpers, that carry additional security and support personnel with other weapons and equipment to help respond to emergencies. NNSA via Cryptome.org The exact specifications of the trailers themselves are highly classified, but thanks to the details included in the declassified review, an in-depth investigative report on the OST by the Los Angeles Times in March 2017, and other official documents, we have a good idea of its basic configuration. The very real feature list reads like a cross between one of James Bond’s cars and a G.I. Joe play set. Together with their unique trucks, OST’s personnel are “a little bit 007, with maybe a dash of Rambo, but maybe the smarts and technology of a Tom Clancy hero,” George Knapp, a reporter and local TV news icon with Las Vegas’ CBS Channel 8, told viewers. “OST won’t say what kind of firepower each convoy carries, but it is considerable. There are high tech surprises inside the vehicles.” The Safe Secure Trailer, or SST, was the initial design, which was involved in the 1991 incident in North Dakota, and had “enhanced structural supports and a highly reliable tie-down system to protect cargo from impact; heightened thermal resistance to protect the cargo in case of fire; [and] deterrents to protect the unauthorized removal of cargo,” according to one Department of Energy report . The included dispensers on the interior walls that release a sticky, adhesive-like foam that would immobilize intruders, an emergency braking system to halt the vehicle, a set of explosive bolts to sheer the axles and prevent thieves from towing it away, and a means of filling the rear compartment with choking tear gas. The empty SST, which looks like a standard dry freight semi-trailer on the outside, weights 40,000 pounds. The maximum loaded weight is 55,000 pounds, including nearly two pounds of explosives. Inside, the cargo itself would sit within another armored container that further impedes any attempts to steal the contents. A specially modified and armored Marmon Motors tractor towed the whole arrangement and contained additional communications and tracking equipment to keep the driver and guards on board in constant, secure contact with the rest of the vehicles in the convoys, OST headquarters, and other federal and state authorities. The cab contained controls to activate the various deterrent countermeasures remotely. Department of Energy via Martin Pfeiffer It’s likely that what witnesses saw was the foam leaking from the trailer’s walls and the tear gas seeping out of the cargo compartment. The OST security force commander later gave a similar description of the situation to the Department of Energy reviewers. The foam is reportedly of limited toxicity, but we can’t comment on this without knowing what’s in it. According to public news reports, first responders built a dam of gravel around the pool, a common procedure for containing hazardous materials. Still, possibly due to concerns about latent radioactivity, a HAZMAT team from Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico subsequently arrived to properly secure and dispose of the material. A Marmon tractor towing either an Safe Secure Trailer or a SafeGuards Transporter., Department of Energy Thankfully, the incident appeared to be minor and did not pose a public health threat. Still, the investigation collected a series of relatively damning notes about shoddy quality control in the basic design and manufacture of the trailers in the first place. In particular, after poring over the incident, investigators found a fault in one part, called the MA-157, which had gone unnoticed since the first trailers rolled off the conversion line more than a decade earlier. Censors redacted what this part is exactly, but it appears to be part of the circuitry that controlled the defensive countermeasures. “Potential spurious output by the MA-157 units was an unknown failure mode prior to the testing and analysis that followed the July 25, 1991, premature activation,” the subsequent review explained. “This premature output could be a function of the age of these units.” OST began receiving the SSTs in the 1970s. However, this explanation seemed unlikely. Department of Energy via Martin Pfeiffer “The original drawings of the MA-157s contain errors (such as a resistor values), which were not detected until the July 26, 1991, activation,” the report continued. “The problem stems from inadequate configuration control, verification of accuracy, etc. during the design process.” These inaccurate drawings meant that even if the original components had arrived assembled as intended, maintenance crews had likely been inadvertently repairing and reinstalling them wrong ever since. It might’ve seemed a wonder that there hadn’t been more accidents, except that there had been, even just in 1991. A month before the breakdown in North Dakota, another convoy driving through Kansas saw two of its three SSTs suffer a malfunction in their emergency braking system. One of these trailers was the same one that broke down near Bismark. On July 26, 1991, the day after the incident under review, the braking units in yet another trailer went off prematurely. Technicians linked that failure to a missing resistor in the MA-157. Department of Energy via Martin Pfeiffer The Department of Energy concluded that the root cause of the incident was “less than adequate” quality assurance and risk assessments in the development and design of the SST’s electrical components. The unclassified recommendations included the need for a full review of the state of the existing trailers, higher and more consistent maintenance standards, and processes to prevent these sorts of mistakes in the future. It ultimately cost the Department of Energy $800,000 to recover the cargo from the trailer, clean it out and refurbish it, and dispose of the apparently hazardous waste material from the three phase recovery process. Afterwards, the SST went back into service. We don’t know how many of the investigations final recommendations the Department of Energy implemented or how thorough the processes were in the end. In the 1990s, OST did begin getting new trailers to replace the aging SSTs. These new trailers were dubbed Safeguards Transporters, or SGTs. New tractors were also added. A grainy video still showing the interior of an SGT during maintenance. , Department of Energy capture From what we know, the SGTs have many of the same features as the older SSTs, which are still there “to deter, surprise, and delay even the most aggressive adversary,” according to the official OST film presentation. A system to deliver electric shocks appears to have replaced the older tear gas countermeasures, but the foam-filled walls are still a component of the newer design, according to the Los Angeles Times report. There are likely other systems we don’t know about as well. As with the SSTs, the outward appearance of the trailers, as well as their new Peterbilt armored tractors, are designed to be unassuming and not draw much attention. Sandia National Laboratories converted the first Peterbilt in 2000 and they were a good addition, since Marmon went out of business in 1997 and those tractors are a rare sight these days. The new trucks were significantly more comfortable for long haul operations, with an extra foot of headroom, more modern air conditioning systems, and other improvements. The first armored Peterbilt conversion in 2000., Sandia National Laboratories Unfortunately, the problems with the SSTs seem to underscore serious and persistent issues within OST itself and may be coming up again with the newer SGTs. According to the Los Angeles Times , more than half of the 42 trailers OST has in operation are more than 15 years old and all of them have exceeded the Department of Energy’s own life expectancy estimates for the system. The department is running a $670 million project to develop a replacement trailer, called the Mobile Guardian, but doesn’t expect it to be in operation until 2023. Beyond old equipment and poor oversight in its upkeep, the Los Angeles Times piece delves deeper into issues of neglected budgets, low morale, toxic leadership, and high turnover and it’s worth reading in full . Department of Energy via LA Times The expose painted a dismal picture of an overworked and underpaid organization where over a third of the personnel would put in more than 900 hours of overtime each year, equal to more than 35 extra days on the job. Couriers and agents spend most of that time on the road on long, boring drives unable to stop for protracted periods or even leave their vehicles in many circumstances. If they get pulled over by local law enforcement for some reason, the truck drivers aren’t even allowed to speak to the police without the security force commander being present during the conversation. Underscoring these issues, in 2010, the Department of Energy’s Inspector General cataloged 16 alcohol-related incidents within OST in the preceding three years, including an incident of public intoxication where a courier was arrested and another where two employees ended up in police custody after getting into a drunken bar brawl. The report uncovered New Mexico court records showing the office’s top executive had gotten a DUI after police came across him parked on a sidewalk apparently drinking in the car with a blood alcohol level of 0.15 percent. OST agents maneuver during a training exercise., NNSA A sleep deprived, irritable, heavy drinking workforce is not a good thing in most circumstances, but it seems especially worrisome when it comes to OST’s mission. According to an earlier report by Mother Jones in 2012, the office had also uncovered the widespread use of “unauthorized firearms,” possibly privately owned personal guns, and at least one instance where an agent had bought weapons and other gear on behalf of the organization only to illegally resell the items. OST has generally rejected these criticisms, pointing out that its personnel have never lost a cargo for any reason. The organization has only suffered one severe accident , in 1996, when a truck towing an SGT skidded off any icy road in Nebraska and flipped over. There are, of course, the incidents in the 1990s and another in 2004, where a truck spilled less than a pint of uranyl nitrate, also known as liquified yellow cake uranium, along Interstate 26 in North Carolina. Still, it is the very idea of moving nuclear weapons around on the ground in the first place that seems as if it may ultimately warrant a review. Underneath all the safeguards and other custom features of its high-tech trailers, OST is still relying on a truck. In 1987, OST stopped operations of a similarly bland-looking train that ran a route between the Pantex nuclear weapon assembly facility in Texas and various military depots around the country. The Department of Energy also has and continues to employ contract cargo aircraft for some transportation operations, as well as coordinating with the U.S. military for other specialized airlift missions. NNSA via Cryptome.org “Transportation is the Achilles’ heel of nuclear security and everyone knows that,” Bruce Blair, founder of Global Zero, a nonprofit group advocating for complete nuclear disarmament and a former U.S. Air Force missileer, told the Los Angeles Times for their investigation. “The danger is not a traffic accident – even a fiery crash is not supposed to explode a warhead – but a heist.” “In an age of terrorism, you’re taking a big risk any time you decide to move nuclear material into the public space over long distances via ground transport,” he continued. “Bad things happen.” From the experience with the SSTs, though, it seems that a breakdown could have serious implications. It exposes the teams to unnecessary risks by stopping their movement suddenly and unexpectedly. The Los Angeles Times review did not appear to uncover any reports about persistent maintenance issues or serious malfunctions with the newer SGTs, even if they were aging and potentially vulnerable to unspecified newer threats. The improved countermeasures meant that “the trucks will kill you” if you tried to rob one, an unnamed scientist told the newspaper. Hopefully, the Department of Energy is making progress to address the other long-standing management issues within the OST, as well as to replace the secure transporters before serious problems emerge.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Brazil’s Upgraded Tiger IIs Might Be The Most Capable F-5s In The World,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Brazil has finally completed a comprehensive program of enhancements for its fleet of veteran Northrop F-5 Tiger II jets, which are, remarkably, the country’s main fighter equipment. Although first delivered in 1975, the upgraded jets will be tasked with defending Brazilian airspace at least until the air force’s Saab F-39 Gripen multirole fighters gain full operating capability, presently scheduled to occur in 2025. The upgrade cycle came to an end on October 14, 2020, when the final example — two-seater serial FAB 4810 — was handed over to the Brazilian Air Force at the Gavião Peixoto facility, in São Paulo state, run by the domestic aviation company Embraer. The jet, previously flown by Jordan , and acquired by Brazil second-hand, was the last of 49 examples that have been brought up to the latest F-5M standard. It will re-enter service with 1º/14º Grupo de Aviação, the “Pampa” Squadron, based at Canoas in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. While there has been no shortage of programs designed to enhance the F-5E/F Tiger II — which first flew in prototype form on August 11, 1972 — the Brazilian effort, run by Embraer, has arguably produced the most capable F-5s of all. The last of the upgraded Brazilian Tiger IIs, two-seater serial FAB 4810, at the Gavião Peixoto facility., FAB Brazil purchased 68 F-5s from the United States, with the first Peace Amazon contract signed in 1973. The U.S.-supplied fleet ultimately included 58 single-seat F-5E Tiger IIs, four two-seat F-5Fs, as well as six two-seat F-5B Freedom Fighter trainers. The older F-5Bs were supplied pending availability of the more advanced F-5F, which didn’t arrive until 1988, alongside a final batch of F-5Es, all of which were ex-U.S. Air Force aggressor machines. Brazil only received six two-seat F-5B Freedom Fighters but the last of them served until 1996., FAB In the early 2000s, the Brazilian Air Force commenced work with Embraer and a local subsidiary of Israel’s Elbit Systems, AEL Sistemas, on a program to upgrade the surviving F-5E/F fleet to F-5M standard. In 2005, Embraer and AEL Sistemas received a $285-million contract to modernize 43 existing single-seat F-5Es. To this total was soon added three two-seat F-5Fs. After rework, the F-5E and F-5F were designated as F-5EM and F-5FM respectively. Collectively referred to as F-5Ms, these enhanced aircraft all came out of the Gavião Peixoto plant with a host of advanced avionics retrofitted. At the center of this package is a Leonardo Grifo F radar, an advanced mechanically-scanned pulse-Doppler radar with multi-aircraft targeting capability, as well as a data link developed domestically by Embraer that allows information to be exchanged with other F-5Ms within the same formation. The jets also have a revised cockpit together with new avionics, including inertial/GPS navigation, three liquid-crystal displays, a new head-up display (HUD), and the “hands-on throttle and stick” (HOTAS) controls concept. The new glass cockpit is compatible with night-vision goggles (NVGs) and the pilot is also provided with an Elbit/AEL Targo helmet-mounted display , allowing off-boresight target designation . A Brazilian F-5 pilot gives the thumbs-up ahead of a sortie., FAB New self-protection systems include chaff/flare launchers, a new radar warning receiver, and wiring for the use of Rafael’s Sky Shield electronic warfare pod. The jets’ airframes underwent repairs intended to add another 15 years of service life, as well. A fixed refueling probe is now fitted as standard and allows the fighters’ range to be extended via air-to-air refueling, including now by the air force’s new Embraer KC-390 tanker-transport. In terms of armament, the F-5M can employ the Israeli-made Rafael Derby beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) and the same company’s short-range Python 4 and 5 infrared-guided AAMs. A single Pontiac M39A2 20mm-caliber cannon is retained in the nose of the single-seat jets. An unarmed single-seat F-5Em on a nighttime flight line. , SGT JOHNSON/FAB For air-to-ground missions, the jet can now be armed with laser-guided bombs, too. In addition, weapons trials have also been conducted of an indigenous long-range air-launched cruise missile, the MICLA-BR , carried under the F-5’s fuselage. This is an air-launched version of the MTC-300 (or AV-TM 300) surface-to-surface missile, with a range of 186 miles and inertial/GPS guidance plus an image correlation system for terminal navigation. It is an impressive array of additional capabilities when compared to the original 1970s-era F-5E/F. However, the Brazilian Tiger II modernization program did not run entirely smoothly. The first upgraded jet was a prototype F-5FM two-seater and rolled out at Embraer’s São José dos Campos headquarters in São Paulo state in December 2004. The initial modernized single-seat F-5EM was delivered to the Brazilian Air Force in September 2005. Plans had originally called for the air force to receive a total of 46 serial-production upgraded aircraft — including three two-seaters — by 2007, but as of March 2008, only 23 upgraded Tigers had been delivered. Single-seater F-5EM serial FAB 4873 plugged into the tanker during the CRUZEX 2018 multinational exercise., SGT BIANCA/FAB In late 2007, and after a previous plan to acquire ex-Royal Saudi Air Force F-5s had been abandoned, the Brazilian government reached a deal with Jordanian Aeronautical Systems to acquire 11 former Royal Jordanian Air Force F-5E/Fs as attrition replacements, and it was expected that at least some of these would be similarly upgraded. The eight F-5Es and three F-5Fs from Jordan arrived in São Paulo aboard an An-124 transport aircraft in August 2008, but, in the end, only three of the two-seaters were upgraded, providing for an overall total of 49 jets. The ex-Jordanian single-seaters were instead used as a source of spare parts. Upgrade work on the last of the F-5s from Brazil’s original fleet, as opposed to the former Jordanian ones, was completed in 2013. Two of the two-seaters have since been lost, in accidents that occurred in July 2016 and May 2018, making Brazil’s decision to subsequently induct three of the ex-Jordanian two-seaters into the modernization program even more vital. Brazil’s F-5s have now outlived the former French Air Force Mirage 2000s that were acquired as interim fighters, but the country’s successor to the Tiger II is now on the horizon. The first F-39E Gripen fighter has been shipped to Brazil and made its maiden flight in that country on September 24, 2020. It is now completing test flights before an official presentation in the capital Brasília, planned for October 23. https://youtube.com/watch?v=X_PbuYlETBY Brazil ordered 36 Gripens from Saab under the F-X2 program, which includes the significant transfer of technology to the Brazilian industry. Even with the planned replacement of the F-5s with new Gripens, undertaking such a comprehensive range of enhancements for the existing Tiger II fleet has provided Embraer and AEL Sistemas with invaluable experience with cutting-edge fighter technology. Moreover, and despite the age of the basic F-5, Brazil’s advanced Tiger II will familiarize pilots and maintainers with advanced avionics and armaments ahead of the induction of the new-generation Gripen fighter in the years to come. The conclusion of the Tiger II upgrade also goes to show just how much valuable service can be squeezed out of the basic airframe — one that traces its origins back to the 1950s.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",U-2 Spy Plane Got New Target Recognition Capabilities In First-Ever In-Flight Software Update,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, has offered new details about how the Air Force successfully made changes to the software onboard a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane in flight for the first time ever. The first update the plane’s systems received was to add code to help track future changes, which produced a log that also includes a depiction of the iconic Star Wars droid R2-D2 saying “Hello Dr. Roper! What’s next?” Sci-fi references notwithstanding, this achievement, a first-of-its-kind milestone for the U.S. military on any type of aircraft, at least publicly, is a big deal and could have game-changing impacts on aerial operations in the future, including with regards to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities and electronic warfare . The system apparently quickly got an answer to the “what’s next?” question as well, when a second update brought “improved automatic target recognition algorithms” to the U-2S, according to Roper. Roper Tweeted out details about the patches, as well as a screenshot of the changelog file, on Oct. 19, 2020. The day before he had announced that the updates had occurred, but had not said what they consisted of at that time. He also recently took a flight himself in a two-seat TU-2S trainer , underscoring this recent focus on the iconic spy plane, the initial versions of which first began flying under the auspices of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1956. On Oct. 6, the Air Force had previously revealed that a U-2S from the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in California had flown a training mission carrying new software, called Kubernetes . This “open-source container-orchestration system,” which Google originally developed and that the Cloud Native Computing Foundation now maintains, is designed to support the automated installation, modification, and updating of applications on a computer. The recent in-flight updates to the Dragon Lady were done through Kubernetes and were conducted with the help of the U-2 Federal Laboratory . “The successful combination of the U-2’s legacy computer system with the modern Kubernetes software was a critical milestone for the development of software containerization on existing Air Force weapon systems,” Nicolas Chaillan, the Air Force Chief Software Officer, said after that milestone was achieved. “This is a milestone achievement that paves the way for rapid experimentation as we continuously work to bring the future faster and increase battlespace awareness for our Airmen,” Air Force Colonel Heather Fox, head of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, added in her own statement. “The integration of Kubernetes onto the U-2 capitalizes on the aircraft’s high altitude line of sight and makes it even more survivable in a contested environment. We look forward to working with other platforms across the DoD to export this incredible capability.” Dr. Jeannine Abiva, U-2 Federal Laboratory Director of Advanced Mathematics and Algorithm Development (left) and Dr. Jesse Angle, U-2 Federal Laboratory Technical Director, work on a computer Sept. 21, 2020, at Beale Air Force Base, California., USAF Being able to update software on devices remotely may not seem like a huge deal to people who regularly get prompted to download patches on their smartphones and personal computers. However, the ability to send new code to military aircraft in flight that could make improvements to mission and flight systems is a far more complex and potentially risky proposition. If something goes wrong, key software on the plane may no longer work, preventing it from completing its mission or worse . If the process works and works reliably, it could open-up all-new possibilities. The second update that Roper says this particular U-2S received is a perfect example of this. Automated target recognition, whether its spotting objects of interest on radar, or visually or detecting notable electronic emissions, relies heavily on an existing information library of signatures to compare against. Did an adversary just field a previously unseen major weapon ? Are they using a heretofore unknown radar or communications system? A targeting system may not be able to automatically spot them until it gets an update, which, traditionally, would have to occur on the ground. What the Air Force is looking at the possibility of doing now is pushing that new information straight to aircraft in flight as soon as it’s available, potentially while they’re actually on missions, instead of having to wait for a good time to install these patches back at base. This would allow for actionable intelligence to being leveraged in real-time, maximizing the capabilities of the platform when they are needed most. This doesn’t just apply to targeting systems, either. In-flight software updating via something like Kubernetes will be essential for realizing something referred to as Cognitive Electronic Warfare. You can read more about this concept in detail in this past War Zone piece . As I previously wrote : “At its most basic, this concept revolves around the idea of being able to detect and categorize the signals that an opponent is using, for whatever purpose, and then use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to help further automate the process of developing countermeasures and counter-countermeasures. A computer system, especially one with an ever-growing library of electronic signature data collected from a wide array of sources, could parse through that information much faster than a human, or even a team of humans depending on the volume of available intelligence, rapidly identifying items of interest for further analysis and exploitation. It may even be able to start doing some of that follow-on work by itself after isolating the important data.” … “…Cognitive EW capabilities could be placed in traditional intelligence processing centers to automate and otherwise help speed up the analysis of new electronic signatures, as well as the creation of new electronic warfare systems or the improvement of existing ones. The increasing use of open-architecture and modular systems that allow for the rapid integration of additional and upgraded capabilities for various pieces of equipment, as well as the introduction of advanced high-bandwidth, long-range communications and data-sharing networks , will make it easier and easier to get those updates to assets in the field on short notice.” With all this in mind, being able to tweak the algorithms in artificial intelligence-driven systems inside aircraft, including autonomous unmanned aircraft , literally on the fly, could have even further ranging impacts on future U.S. military aerial combat operations. For example, it could be possible eventually to alter how a fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) flies and fights on very short notice in response to the appearance of new enemy air defenses and other systems, as well as changes to their tactics, techniques, and procedures. The Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie unmanned aircraft, which the Air Force is using to explore loyal wingman and other semi-autonomous and autonomous drone capabilities, is exactly the kind of platform that could benefit greatly from being able to receive software updates in flight., USAF There’s no reason, really, why this would have to be limited to aerial operations, necessarily, either. Naval and ground forces, which operate increasingly computerized and networked systems , as well as more and more unmanned platforms , could see the same kind of benefits from this kind of reliable, long-range, on-demand software updating capability. From the enemy’s perspective, this all presents the prospect of an opponent that is capable of adapting much faster and more accurately than before and is capable of not only developing, but also implementing, highly-tailored counter-countermeasures very quickly. It’s important to note that the Kubernetes-enabled systems on this one particular U-2S used in these recent tests represent a capability that is still very much in the experimental phase. At the same time, the potential benefits are significant and obvious and the Air Force is clearly committed to see what else this new software and the ability to remotely update systems offers for the Dragon Lady, as well as other platforms. There will also be a need for robust and secure networks to help transfer all this information. The Air Force is already in the midst of a separate, broader effort to make revolutionary changes to its communications and data-sharing capabilities, as well, as part of the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program. A joint-service ABMS demonstration earlier this year had a number of other very notable components , which you can read about more in the War Zone ‘s previous coverage of that event . All told, the real answer to the change log’s “what’s next?” prompt seems to be “a lot.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Drones"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 15, 2020",The Navy’s Stealth Destroyer Has Fired A Missile For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first-in-class stealth destroyer USS Zumwalt has live-fired a Standard Missile 2, or SM-2 , for the first time ever. The Zumwalt class ships, also known by the hull number for the lead ship, DDG-1000, are set to be equipped with a unique variant of the SM-2, also known as the SM-2 Block IIIAZ. The need for this particular missile is tied to several controversial design decisions the Pentagon and the Navy have made over the years to these ships, including those having to do with their radars, which may now be in line to be replaced, something The War Zone was first to report on last week. Zumwalt fired the SM-2 from one of its Mk 57 Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrays while on the Naval Air Weapons Center Weapons Division Sea Test Range off the coast of Southern California, near Point Mugu, according to an official Navy release . The service said that the missile successfully intercepted a surrogate for an anti-ship cruise missile, but did not offer any additional details at this mock target. The Navy uses various target drones to simulate subsonic and supersonic cruise missiles . “Today’s successful test not only demonstrates the ship’s capability to fire missiles and conduct self-defense, it is also a significant step toward more advanced combat system testing and operations for our Navy’s most technically innovative warship,” Navy Captain Matt Schroeder, the DDG-1000 program manager, said in a statement. “The USS Zumwalt crew and Surface Development Squadron One are working hand-in-hand with the acquisition community to advance this ship’s operational capability.” “Today’s successful firing event is a critical milestone in the maturation of this incredible ship class and represents the culmination of a tremendous amount of hard work and partnership of Zumwalt ’s talented crew and the engineers, designers, and programmers helping us to bring her capabilities to the Fleet,” Navy Captain Gary Cave, the destroyer’s commanding officer, added in his own statement. “It is a day we’ve been looking forward to and demonstrates the strides we are taking to add combat capability to our surface force.” As it stands now, the SM-2 Block IIIAZ is set to be one of the primary weapons available to the Zumwalt for air and missile defense, in addition to the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) , a smaller missile that can be quad-packed into any of the 80 VLS cells that line the periphery of the ship. The Mk 57 VLS arrays on the Zumwalt class ships are also designed to fire the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk (TACTOM) land-attack cruise missile. There has been talk about eventually integrating the anti-ship Block V Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) and variants of the increasingly capable SM-6 missile onto these destroyers, as well. The USS Zumwalt ., USN The basic SM-2 Block IIIA variant also has a limited anti-ship capability , but it’s not clear if the Block IIIAZ subvariant has the same functionality. The Block IIIAZs, which the Navy first included plans to buy in its Fiscal Year 2017 budget proposal, have “hardware and software changes to be compatible with the new (non-AEGIS) DDG 1000 radar, combat system, X-band link and Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination,” according to one budget document . These missiles also feature a Joint Universal Weapon Link (JUWL), according to a report by the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which also says the weapon’s primary function when employed from the Zumwalt will be “to defeat air threats at longer ranges” than the ESSM. As the Navy’s 2017 Fiscal Year budget request entry notes, the mission systems architecture on the Zumwalt class destroyers, a proprietary Linux-based arrangement known as the Total Shipboard Computing Environment (TSCE), is unique within the Navy. It is not related in any way to the Aegis system found on Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Ticonderoga class cruisers , which effectively prohibited the DDG-1000s from firing missiles from the Standard Missile family prior to the development of the SM-2 Block IIIAZ. The ship was also originally supposed to have a complex and very capable pairing of two different radars, known as the Dual Band Radar (DBR), to support the employment of various missiles, but these plans were subsequently scaled back as part of a broader and controversial cost-cutting effort. The design of the Zumwalt class destroyers now includes just the AN/SPY-3 radar in lieu of the DBR, though the Navy is now looking at potential replacements and adding Aegis-like capability to the ships, all of which you can read about more in the War Zone ‘s previous piece where we broke that news. At the same time, while it’s certainly a notable milestone that Zumwalt has now live-fired an SM-2 Block IIIAZ missile, it also speaks to the extremely limited capabilities, especially combat capabilities, that this ship still has more than four years after its initial delivery from Bath Iron Works in 2016. That same year, Congress blocked the Navy from formally accepting the ship until its combat systems were deemed officially activated, something a milestone the service only hit in April of this year. The USS Zumwalt in 2016., USN Even then, Zumwalt did not fire one of 30mm Bushmaster II automatic cannons for the first time until May . The DDG-1000s have two of these weapons in place of a pair of 57mm cannons that were present in the original design plan, another controversial cost-cutting decision. It’s not clear when, or even if, the destroyer will fire either of its 155mm Advanced Gun Systems, either. In 2016, the Navy decided against buying Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles (LRLAP), each one of which was set cost an almost preposterous amount, for these weapons, leaving them without anything to shoot. Recent tests have pointed to the possible use of these guns to fire a new Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP), but it remains to be seen if that will actually happen. Other cost-cutting measures have led to the installation of protruding antennas that degrade the stealth shape of the ship’s deckhouse. All of this, in turn, has raised questions repeatedly about the actual utility of the Zumwalt class of ships, which the Navy is only buying three of. The total program cost for these three ships and their underlying technologies sits at over $26B today. The second and third ships, the USS Michael Monsoor and the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson, are still in the process of being fitted out and all three of the destroyers may well see further alterations in their designs before they go out in their first operational cruises. The Navy presently expects the Zumwalt to reach initial operational capability sometime in 2021. The trio of ships will all be assigned to Surface Development Squadron One , a primarily experimental unit focused on developing and evaluating surface warfare tactics, techniques, and procedures, including working together with unmanned vessels . As such, whatever operational role the three ships may have in the future is still yet to be fully understood. All told, this recent live-fire test of an SM-2 is an important milestone for Zumwalt toward getting the ship closer to any sort of operational status, but can only also highlight the costly saga of the DDG-1000s and how there is still much progress the Navy needs to make before these ships can realize anything close to their full potential.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 6, 2020",Video Of Chinese Missile Carrier Jet Hauling What Appears To Be A Hypersonic Weapon Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged out of China showing what appears to be an H-6N missile carrier aircraft with a massive weapon slung underneath it. The unique wedge-shaped profile of the missile’s forward section points to the possibility that the missile is a hypersonic weapon system. In particular, the form factor looks similar to the one found on China’s ground-launched DF-17 hypersonic weapon, which uses a ballistic missile to boost an unpowered DF-ZF hypersonic boost-glide vehicle to a velocity well over Mach 5 before the vehicle continues on maneuvering path through the atmosphere to its target. You can read our previous post on the DF-17 here . China’s work on air-launched adaptations of their ground-launched ballistic missiles is not necessarily new. An air-launched DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile is thought to have been in development for some time. The pursuit of an air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon by China should be expected, as well, but this could be the first time we are actually seeing it. The H-6N is specifically designed to carry outsized loads, from high-speed drone aircraft to anti-ship ballistic missiles, as well as more traditional cruise missiles. It is an advanced outgrowth of the H-6K, which itself is a fully reimagined and updated version of a design that tracks its lineage directly back to the Tu-16 Badger of Soviet origin. You can read all about this unique H-6 variant and its strategic implications in this past piece of ours . It is entirely logical that China would develop an air-launched hypersonic weapon that leverages an existing ground-launched design. The most obvious and only known choice would be the aforementioned DF-17 that Beijing touted so heavily at its recent high-profile military parade. Although it is supposedly operational, the exact status of this weapon and its capabilities remains unknown, but China sure wants the world to think that it is a fully functioning hypersonic weapon. Regardless, using it, or at least parts of it, such as the DF-ZF vehicle, for an air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon makes sense. DF-17s at the 70th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party parade. , Chinese Internet That’s not to say that this solves the mystery of what exactly we are seeing here. Like the U.S. , China has a number of hypersonic weapons programs underway and has tested many hypersonic vehicle shapes that could be leveraged for different weapons applications. Work on an air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile is also a certainty. So, this could be an entirely new configuration that features a new hypersonic vehicle, we just don’t know for certain at this time. There is also the possibility that this is a more traditional ballistic missile that uses a maneuvering warhead, like the one found on the DF-21D and DF-26, but the imagery seems to point away from the possibility based on the peculiar nose arrangement on the missile. Better quality footage and photos in the future could alter that line of thinking though. DF-21D test firing. , China Media Being able to lug a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle hundreds or thousands of miles from Chinese territory would put bases that were previously outside the range of those weapons under threat from a so-far indefinable capability . Andersen Air Force Base on Guam and Wake Island , in particular, come to mind, but such a weapon could be used on many other highly defended adversary locales throughout the hemisphere. Hypersonic weapons are also being developed to counter adversary armadas , as well. Such a capability would assume China is a step ahead of the U.S. in that regard, which is debatable. As it sits now, this video serves as a reminder that a hypersonic arms race is very real and very active. While the U.S. has an alphabet soup of hypersonic programs under development, and more that are classified, China is not standing still, either. Like the Air Force’s own first hypersonic weapon , the bomber-launched AGM-183 ARRW , the People’s Liberation Army would benefit greatly from being able to put any target at risk within thousands of miles of its shores via a currently impossible to defend against and highly-precise air-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. If this one video is any indication, they may be actively trying to keep pace with U.S. developments in that regard. Otherwise, the video shows the aircraft carrying a ballistic missile, which, depending on its application, has its own major strategic implications.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Jan 25, 2021",Britain Banks On Tempest Future Fighter Program As Its Next Great Hope In Combat Airpower,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A group of leading British defense aerospace companies, helmed by BAE Systems, has laid out the latest details regarding the ambitious Tempest next-generation fighter program , against a compelling backdrop of potential benefits to the United Kingdom. A new study detailing the economic contribution of the Tempest program predicts that it could support an average of 20,000 jobs every year between 2026 and 2050, plus it would contribute at least £25.3 billion, or nearly $32.7 billion at the present rate of exchange, to the British economy in the first 30 years of the project. It will also play a critical role in securing skills within the domestic military aerospace industrial sector. BAE Systems heads up Team Tempest, which is a technology and defense partnership. It also includes Italian defense contractor Leonardo , European missile consortium MBDA , British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce , and the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as hundreds of other high-tech companies, as part of a growing industrial base. The latest details about the project’s progress were laid out alongside the preliminary results of an independent analysis by PwC, a private consulting firm commissioned by BAE Systems. This outlines the potential economic contribution from the initial stages of the Tempest program, covering the period up to 2050, the full details of which will be published later this year. Team Tempest says the full analysis will help to inform a new business case that is expected to assess three options for the U.K. According to a report in the Financial Times , these are expected to include continuing with Tempest, becoming a partner in an international fighter program, or to purchase an off-the-shelf solution. A decision on funding the next phase of Tempest will be announced after the government makes its preference known. An infographic outlining the basic goals behind the Tempest program., Leonardo Tempest was launched in 2018 in a bid to produce a sixth-generation “system of systems” air combat capability, with a new stealthy six-generation fighter as the centerpiece. A similar French-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program, which European aviation consortium Airbus is leading, is currently in an 18-month initial risk-reduction phase that is intended to lead to demonstrator flights as soon as 2026. According to BAE Systems, there are currently 1,800 people employed in Team Tempest across the U.K. industrial base and the country’s Ministry of Defense, with this number set to increase to 2,500 next year. In 2019, the team expanded to add Sweden’s Saab and Italy’s Leonardo in a bid to share costs and bring a wider knowledge base into the project. The United Kingdom has already committed £2 billion, or almost $2.6 billion at the current rate of exchange, to Team Tempest, which aims to see manufacturing begin by 2025, with a “combat air system” reaching Initial Operating Capability by 2035, if the government elects to press ahead with Tempest. “Tempest is an exciting and ambitious multi-decade program that will help to preserve our national security whilst at the same time driving significant economic benefits for the U.K.,” commented Michael Christie, Director, Combat Air Acquisition Program, for BAE Systems. “The initial analysis revealed today demonstrates that Tempest is critical to ensuring the U.K. can sustain its world-leading Combat Air Sector, preserving the sovereign capability that is essential to retaining military freedom of action for the U.K.” A Tempest mock-up that was unveiled at Farnborough International Air Show in 2018., BAE Systems A Combat Air Strategy The U.K Combat Air Strategy, launched in 2018 alongside Team Tempest, is designed to underpin Britain’s combat air industry, which is also led by BAE Systems. This would help to preserve sovereign capability and critical skills needed for independent military “freedom of action” and national security. Unfortunately, the forthcoming five-year defense spending review has been delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , and the unprecedented situation is expected to place even greater strain on the British defense budget. However, this has in turn led to a greater emphasis on maintaining a domestic capability in this sector and securing national jobs. Launched under the Future Combat Air System Technology Initiative (FCAS TI), not to be confused with the Airbus-led FCAS program, an initial concept phase, planned to be complete by the end of this year, was designed to build an understanding of potential costs and viability. Since the initial announcement in 2018, seven further companies have signed agreements to progress opportunities to work on Team Tempest, including Bombardier Belfast , Collins Aerospace, GE Aviation UK, GKN Aerospace, Martin-Baker , QinetiQ, and Thales . Britain has also enjoyed significant involvement in the Eurofighter Typhoon program alongside Germany, Spain, and Italy, but this program is beginning to wind down. While BAE Systems has enjoyed Britain’s Tier 1 status as a partner in the F-35 Lightning II program, which is led by Lockheed Martin, it is widely acknowledged that this has failed to support U.K. industrial expertise with regard to the development of advanced combat air systems, as well. Tempest is designed to re-energize this important part of the British manufacturing and technology industry. BAE Systems Revolutionary technology Team Tempest is using new technologies with the aim of making revolutionary strides in the way combat aircraft are developed and fielded and respond to increasingly high-tech and complex threats. Initial concepts have matured and have been evaluated, including testing cutting-edge “wearable cockpit” technologies, which could replace physical controls in current aircraft cockpits with Augmented and Virtual Reality displays projected directly inside the visor of a helmet, and able to be configured to suit any mission. “Concepts including human-autonomy teaming are also being developed, where a ‘ virtual co-pilot ‘ could take on some of the pilot’s responsibilities. The virtual co-pilot concept is still being developed, but could, for example, take the form of an ‘avatar’ built into the cockpit to interact with the pilot,” according to BAE Systems. The company has also been trialing “psycho-physiological” technologies, including eye-tracking, to study the operator’s physical and cognitive processes to better understand aircrew exertion, stress, workload, and fatigue. BAE Systems says its test pilots are now trialing these technologies in controlled test flight conditions in a Typhoon aircraft. “The results of the trials will inform further development to better understand a pilot’s cognitive behavior and processes relating to brain activity, psychological rhythms, and eye movement to inform further development,” the company has said. Tempest is designed as a series of air vehicles built around a next-generation fighter., MBDA Leonardo has disclosed that it is developing new radar technology for Tempest. The Multi-Function Radio Frequency System (MRFS) is designed to collect and process unprecedented amounts of data, which it says is equivalent to “the internet traffic of a large city.” MRFS is supposedly designed to work beyond the boundaries of a traditional radar, with digital technology providing the operator with a clear view of the battlespace and of potential targets, “helping it win the information war.” The Italian-headquartered firm says it has already built complete sub-systems using the new technology and has successfully tested them at the company’s site in Edinburgh, Scotland. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce engineers are evaluating advanced engine technology for Tempest. The company says the engine will burn hotter than previous systems, thereby increasing efficiency. Thermal management of the Tempest fighter will be critical, and the company is working with Leonardo to help deal with the heat generated by the plethora of onboard sensors and avionics by directing this back into the engines for cooling. Rolls-Royce’s Phil Townley says the hotter the engine, the more efficient it becomes. “We get less carbon dioxide and bring emissions down.” Team Tempest is also looking at how the use of synthetic aviation fuel can bring down exhaust temperatures and also contribute to a more sustainable future. Rolls-Royce Behind Tempest lies an ethos of flexibility, capability, affordability, and upgradeability. While it will have a combat aircraft at its core, it will be a connected network of capabilities — a mix of piloted and unpiloted platforms. The exact scope of this is still to be revealed, but it could include follow-on efforts to the current Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) program, and other RAF swarming drone initiatives, both of which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . For weapons manufacturer MBDA, it says Tempest could include “electro-magnetic effects and laser weapons.” The company’s Mike Mew says it aims to make integration of new weapons far easier. It could be “as simple as plugging a USB stick into your computer.” This type of approach is a theme that runs through the core of Tempest, with an ambitious desire to break out of the cycle of large defense programs. “Each generation has been more complex and cumbersome, we need to break out of that,” Mew says, adding that instead of months of integration work and huge cost, quicker fielding will mean funds can be spent elsewhere on software and capability. BAE Systems Changing the current model Team Tempest aims to halve the time from project go-ahead to initial operating capability. BAE’s Michael Christie says the use of model-based engineering gives a far greater chance of success in collapsing timescales, as does the increased use of advanced software. Christie says that BAE Systems is similarly ambitious when it comes to exporting Tempest. He foresees that it could become one of the company’s most successful programs. He points to how combat aviation has traditionally accounted for as much as 80% of the defense export sector for the United Kingdom. However, it is at home that Tempest faces a significant challenge. Ultimately designed as a replacement for the Eurofighter Typhoon , it’s difficult to see how it can be procured for the Royal Air Force in sufficient numbers alongside a full buy of 138 F-35s . Even with a reduction in what the RAF refers to as the Lightning Force, developing Tempest will be reliant on international partnerships to spread the fiscal load. The United Kingdom will simply not have the funds to go it alone, despite the clear benefit to industry. The existing partnerships with Sweden and Italy are valuable, but more will need to join . For Tempest to succeed and flourish, the Lightning Force may have its wings clipped, but many will still question whether such an ambitious program is achievable. Even though Tempest promises to be “affordable,” developing new fighters is far from being a cheap business. For the RAF it could mean backing British industry, possibly at the expense of U.S. relations regarding F-35. Buying American has been a recurring theme in recent major airpower procurement programs — not least the F-35, P-8 Poseidon , and E-7 Wedgetail . There is also the question of timelines. It can take decades to see a new fighter enter production. By the time Tempest is sitting on flight lines, if it indeed makes it that far, will purchasing an all-new advanced manned tactical combat aircraft be a good procurement decision? Will it even be relevant? While the last two years of concept work may not have afforded many tangible signs of advance, Team Tempest has made good progress in identifying what this project needs to be. These aspects include everything from advanced cockpit designs to efficient production lines, which are hoped to expedite production once final designs are solidified. The desire to not fall into the trap of obsolescence fuels a need for the final specifications of Tempest to be locked down as late as practicable, and able to adapt to a world where technology and software are advancing at an exponential rate. An artist’s rendition of a Tempest working alongside swarming UAVs., BAE Systems Actually realizing the ambition behind the program represents a very different set of problems. Fundamentally changing the way fighter aircraft are designed, built, and fielded is great in theory, but the reality may be very different. Certifying such a raft of advanced systems in one of the world’s most highly regulated sectors will be both costly and time-consuming. For Tempest, if the British government decides to continue down this path, a decision to move some of the advanced new systems into flight testing could come as soon as next year. A Boeing 757 is to be converted by Leonardo U.K. to serve as an avionics and systems testbed, which could fly by 2023 or 2024, according to the company. It would act in a similar manner as the “Catfish” 757 that serves as an integrated avionics testbed for the U.S. Air Force’s F-22 Raptor . This would present the next clear sign of progress for Tempest. A step ahead from model-based design, computer-aided design simulations, and hyperbole, to actual hardware in the sky—an important move forward in taking what is still just a concept, and making it a reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2020",Turkey Has Reportedly Test Fired Its S-400 Air Defense System For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports, following the appearance of videos on social media, suggest that Turkey has begun live-fire testing of its controversial Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system . Doing so risks provoking the wrath of traditional allies, especially the United States, which has threatened new sanctions in the past if Turkish authorities were to take this step. Video footage emerged on social media earlier today of the reported “comprehensive test” of the S-400 system in the country’s Sinop province on the Black Sea coast. Though unconfirmed, they show narrow columns of smoke snaking into the sky over that region that do appear to be broadly consistent with S-400 missile launches that we’ve seen in the past. The start of the air defense missile tests was subsequently reported by various outlets including the Associated Press , which noted that Turkish TV channel Haber , which AP describes as being close to the government in Ankara, had claimed to have confirmed the details. Russia’s state-run TASS news agency subsequently quoted an unnamed source “in military and diplomatic circles,” stating that the Turkish S-400 tests involved three missiles being launched, all of which successfully engaged their designated targets. The reported missile test also seems to follow a pattern of recently reported movements of S-400 system components within Sinop province. A number of videos have appeared in the last week or so claiming to show S-400 vehicles, apparently including transport-erector-launchers, on the move in the area, perhaps headed toward the test site. It’s also been reported that, in addition to the S-400 batteries, 10 British-made Banshee target drones were transported to Sinop for the tests. Early last week, Turkey also issued a Notice to Airmen, or NOTAM, alerting pilots to potential hazards in the area. This is standard procedure for a weapons test of this kind and this particular notice indicated that Sinop Airport would be closed to inbound and outbound traffic between October 6 and October 16, due to “missile fire,” though it did not specifically mention the S-400 system. The first videos purporting to show the S-400 launches appeared online on the 16th. According to previous reports, which were neither confirmed nor denied by the Turkish Ministry of Defense, the Turkish Armed Forces did not plan to “activate” the S-400 batteries, but would instead undertake tests of the equipment and the readiness of military personnel. In the past, the United States has threatened to impose sanctions on Ankara if the missile systems were formally put into service, and this may be an attempt to circumvent that. Turkey first announced that it had agreed to buy S-400s from Russia in 2017, after years of failed attempts to acquire other long-range surface-to-air missile systems, including the American Patriot system . Turkey began to receive its first four S-400 batteries in July 2019 and had previously indicated that the system would become operational in April 2020. Trucks associated with the S-400 air defense system arrive at Murted Air Base in Turkey, in July 2019., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE After Turkish authorities first declared that their plans to purchase the S-400s, the United States asserted that Turkey’s possession of these systems would threaten the security of the wider F-35 Joint Strike Fighter enterprise. U.S. officials, as well as representatives of other NATO nations, argued that not only would the S-400 be incompatible with NATO air defense equipment in a time of crisis, but that Russia could leverage the deal with Turkey to gain insight into potentially sensitive information about the F-35. Turkey’s steadfast refusal to cancel the S-400 deal has already resulted in punitive measures from Washington, including the ejection of Turkey from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. A live-fire test, if confirmed, could certainly prompt calls for new sanctions. While a live-fire test hadn’t been completed until now, Turkey had put the S-400 through its paces, including checking the function of the system’s various radars, last year, as discussed in greater detail in this past War Zone piece . These trials reportedly also involved participation from Turkish Air Force F-16 and F-4E fighter jets, as well as at least one helicopter. A diagram showing various typical components used within an S-400 battalion., RIA NOVOSTI As The War Zone also discussed in the past , Russia reportedly included NATO-compatible identification-friend-or-foe equipment within the S-400 as exported to Turkey, but this doesn’t seem to have alleviated U.S. and NATO concerns about the system being in Ankara’s hands. Relations between Turkey and the United States, as well as between Turkish authorities and other NATO allies, are already strained over Ankara’s support to Azerbaijan , which is currently engaged in fighting Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh . Turkey’s allies have also been critical of its involvement in conflicts in both Syria and Libya , as well as recent standoff with Greece and other Mediterranean countries over access to oil and gas reserves. This latter crisis recently prompted a strongly worded response from the U.S. Department of State, which said the United States “deplores Turkey’s […] announcement of renewed Turkish survey activity in areas over which Greece asserts jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean.” The Department of State said Turkey’s action “unilaterally raises tensions in the region and deliberately complicates the resumption of crucial exploratory talks between our NATO Allies Greece and Turkey.” If confirmed, these S-400 tests appear to be another example of a broader strategy of asserting Turkey’s independent foreign policy aspirations and increasing its geopolitical influence from the Black Sea through to the eastern Mediterranean, one that has already caused significant friction with its traditional allies.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 19, 2020",Navy’s Troubled Stealth Destroyers May Have Radars Replaced Before Ever Sailing On A Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is in the process of exploring options to replace Raytheon’s AN/SPY-3 radar on its three still not yet operational Zumwalt class destroyers . The only option we know definitively to be under consideration is a variant of the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar , or EASR, but the Navy has indicated that there are others. EASR is another Raytheon product that is already slated to go onto a number of the service’s new ships, including all future Ford class aircraft carriers from CVN-79 on and the forthcoming Constellation class frigates, previously known as FFG(X) . Combined with the stealthy destroyers’ other advanced and largely unique combat systems, a new, more powerful radar could significantly expand their capabilities, which were grossly watered-down years ago as part of cost-cutting efforts. A spokesperson for Naval Sea Systems Command confirmed to The War Zone that “the Navy is exploring several alternatives to sustain air and surface search capability aboard the Zumwalt class ships” on Oct. 15, 2020. That same statement said that “no decision has been made at this time” as to how the service will necessarily proceed. The first-in-class USS Zumwalt has already received its combat systems, but the second and third ships in the class, the USS Michael Monsoor and the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson are in the process of being fitted out. As such, all three could need to have their existing removed in order to recieve new ones. As originally designed , the Zumwalt class destroyers, also often referred to by the hull number of the first-in-class USS Zumwalt , DDG-1000, were to have a Dual Band Radar (DBR) installation. This would have combined two separate radar systems, the AN/SPY-3, an X-band active electronically scanned array (AESA) type, with the Lockheed Martin AN/SPY-4, an S-band volume search radar. In an air and missile defense scenario, the idea was that the AN/SPY-3 would be used for horizon search, to provide high-fidelity target tracks and otherwise help direct those weapons to impact, while the AN/SPY-4 would offer long-range search, tracking, ballistic missile discrimination, and some additional abilities to communicate with intercepting missiles. The two radars would perform these functions simultaneously, with their information fused together, offering an impressive combined capability. The Zumwalts also feature a unique advanced command and control software and computing architecture, which you can read about more here . It was designed to make great use of the DBR configuration. However, in 2010, the Pentagon made the decision to eliminate the AN/SPY-4, the larger of the two radar arrays, from the Zumwalt design, one of many cost-cutting measures that degraded the ship’s overall capabilities . Instead, software was added to work with the AN/SPY-3 to allow it to perform the volume search function, as well. While the latter radar can now be used to cover some of the AN/SPY-4’s tasks, it has nowhere near the performance that was supposed to come from the two radars operating in tandem. David Heath/USN The deckhouse for the first-in-class USS Zumwalt on a barge at Norfolk Naval Station in 2012, while the ship was still under construction. The light gray-colored rectangular area with what appears to be a peeling dark gray protective cover seen at the forward corner is where one of the two fixed-face AN/SPY-3 antenna arrays are now installed. A larger, more square-shaped indentation is visible below it and is where the AN/SPY-4’s companion array was originally supposed to be been situated. , USN It is worth noting that whether or not the DBR would have ultimately met the Navy’s expectations is unclear. This paired radar system was also slated to go onto the Ford class aircraft carriers, but has suffered from repeated technical issues and other delays, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . As it stands now, only the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford will have the DBR , while all the subsequent ships in the class will feature Raytheon’s AN/SPY-6(V)3, the fixed-face version of the company’s modular Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), instead. The AN/SPY-6(V)3, or another variant of the EASR, is certainly one of the most obvious choices as a replacement for the AN/SPY-3 on the Zumwalts . Rich Calabrese, Lockheed Martin’s Director of Surface Navy Mission Systems, recently told The War Zone that the Navy was considering doing just that as part of a larger interview that we will be publishing in the near term on that company’s Aegis Combat System and what the future holds for it. “They’re looking at a back fit of an EASR radar, back to a DDG-1000 replacing the current radar,” Calabrese said. “That would be a pretty straightforward approach.” Derived from the AN/SPY-6(V)1 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) developed for the Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers, EASR, though smaller, is made up of the same modular Radar Modular Assemblies (RMA). The AMDR has four arrays, each with 37 RMAs, with the AN/SPY-6(V)3 has three nine-RMA arrays. Workers install one of the arrays associated with the AN/SPY-6(V)1 radar, which contains 37 Radar Module Assemblies, on a ground-based test fixture at the Combat Systems Engineering Development Site (CSEDS) in Moorestown, New Jersey, better known as the “Cruiser in the Cornfield.”, USN Each two-foot-by-two-foot-by-two-foot cube-shaped RMA is essentially its own AESA radar. This allows them to perform individual functions independently or work together to focus on a single task, providing immense flexibility and high-fidelity over a great range. In addition, the modularity that the RMAs offer means that EASR arrays are inherently scalable, as shown in the Raytheon product video below, and more easily configured to fit different physical space and power requirements. The DDG-1000s were built with huge spaces, that now sit vacant, for the AN/SPY-4 radars, and have immense power generating capabilities. The RMAs can be removed or installed individually, as well, reducing the time and costs associated with carrying out certain preventive maintenance tasks and other repairs. This means more reliability, upgradability, and up-time for the radar system as a whole. EASR, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , is already becoming extremely popular within the Navy. In addition to the rest of the Ford class, the AN/SPY-6(V)3 will also be a key sensor on the future Constellation class frigates, previously known as FFG(X) . A version of the radar with a single nine-RMA array on a rotating mount, designated the AN/SPY-6(V)2, will also go onto the future USS Bougainville , the first ship in a new subclass of the America class amphibious assault ship, as well as the forthcoming Richard M. McCool Jr. , a San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious ship. The upcoming Flight II San Antonio class ships will also have this radar. Versions of this radar are slated to be back-fitted onto other members of the America and San Antoni o classes, as well as other existing ships as time goes on. In July, the Navy announced that it was buying an AN/SPY-6(V)2 for installation on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis . An AN/SPY-6(V)2 radar rotating on a pedestal during ground-based testing a Wallops Island in Virginia., Raytheon Another option for the Zumwalts might be the AN/SPY-6(V)4, another fixed-face member of this family that occupies a space between the AMDR and the existing EASR variants in terms of overall capability. This version has four arrays, just like the (V)1, but each with 24 RMAs, instead of 37. Raytheon developed this radar for the Navy to refit Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. The Navy has said that that is looking at multiple alternatives and Raytheon’s competitors, chiefly Lockheed Martin, could very well be offering their own radars for the Zumwalts , as well. Lockheed Martin has already proposed using a version of its AN/SPY-7(V)1 Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) as a replacement for the aging variants of the AN/SPY-1 on the Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruisers . The LRDR is presently slated to be the primary radar used at the future Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense site in Hawaii. This radar was also set to be a component of Japan’s Aegis Ashore systems , before that country canceled work on those sites entirely earlier this year. Lockheed Martin also says that variants of this radar will go onto future Royal Canadian Navy frigates, which will be based on the BAE Systems Type 26 design , as well as Navantia’s future F110 class frigates for the Spanish Navy. A photo from Lockheed Martin’s Solid State Radar (SSR) Integration Site in New Jersey, where it has been testing technology related to the Long Range Discrimination Radar., Lockheed Martin Whatever new radar the Navy picks could re-open a world of possibilities for the Zumwalts and could come along with other updates. As it stands now, among their many one-off design elements, these ships do not have the Aegis Combat System that is common across the Navy’s surface combatant fleet. The ship’s combat system is unique and runs on its own proprietary Linux-based software and advanced computing environment, known as the Total Shipboard Computing Environment (TSCE). Supporting an entirely separate combat system—adapting it for new weapons, hardware, and capabilities over time—is an incredibly complex and costly proposition. Switching over to Aegis for the ship’s tactical applications, along with the new radar, could be part of an initiative to solve that glaring problem and it would make the DDG-1000s far more supportable over time. Lockheed Martin’s Calabrese specifically said his company has explored potential ways to give the Zumwalts at least an Aegis-like capability if the Navy were interested, especially as part of the decision to add new radars to the ships. “The DDG-1000 is the oddball out. We have ideas on how, again, leveraging the virtual Aegis Weapon System, you could bring Aegis capability to a DDG-1000,” he explained. “We’ve developed some concepts for [that approach] and that would be ready to introduce should the Navy have interest in doing that. But yeah, currently that’s the sort of the odd duck out,” he continued. “I look at DDG-1000 as an opportunity for further commonality because it is currently the ‘one-off’ of the combat systems in terms of being able to take advantage of synergies across the programs.” Exactly what the Navy expects its three Zumwalts to do will likely be an important factor in whatever course of action the service eventually decides to pursue. The ships are presently assigned to Surface Development Squadron One , a unit focused on exploring future surface warfare concepts of operation, and their actual operational role may be limited in the end. The extremely small size of the class makes it a very low-density, high-end asset to begin with. The Navy has already publicly gone back and forth over the years about the exact missions it wants these advanced warships to be able to carry out. USN While a replacement radar could give the ships a boost in capability, other limitations remain. For one, the Navy still has no formal plans to acquire any ammunition for the two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) on the Zumwalts , after deciding not to buy stocks of the exorbitantly priced Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) in 2016. There are indications that the service may now be looking to modify these guns to fire new Hyper Velocity Projectiles , but whether or not that will actually happen, remains unclear. The first-in-class USS Zumwalt only fired its 30mm automatic cannons , meant for close-in defense and which were controversially installed in place of more powerful 57mm cannons—another cost-saving measure—for the first time in May. These issues, along with the fact that Navy has resorted to bolting many types of antennas to its stealthy deckhouse—yet another cost-saving move—that diminishes the whole reason behind its elaborate design, underscores how big of a boondoggle the program has become. Now the ship’s radars may get ripped out and replaced, and its combat system possibly as well, all before the ships ever set sail on an operational mission. All this has already come at a cost of over $26 billion for just three vessels . While lessons need to be learned from this fiscal disaster, the fact that the Navy is getting serious about actually squeezing the most that it can out of these ships it has already invested so heavily in is encouraging, even if it means spending a bit more money to see that it happens.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 9, 2021",Japan Just Launched Its First “Big Whale” Lithium-Ion Battery Powered Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After around a decade of research and development, Japan is now close to putting into service the first of a new type of diesel-electric submarine, driven by an innovative propulsion system using lithium-ion batteries . While the two most recent examples of Japan’s Soryu class are fitted with a similar powerplant, the Taigei , which means Big Whale in Japanese, is the first of a class to feature it from the outset. Currently, only Japan is known to have operational submarines with lithium-ion batteries. The Taigei was launched on October 14, 2020, at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) shipyard in the city of Kobe, in the western prefecture of Hyogo. The event was attended by Japan’s Minister of Defense Nobuo Kishi and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) chief Hiroshi Yamamura. Reports suggest that construction of the boat cost around $710 million. The new submarine is 275 feet 7 inches long and with a surfaced displacement of around 3,000 tons, it is also the largest post-World War II submarine Japan has built. The existing Soryu class design has a surfaced displacement of approximately 2,900 tons. The Taigei can accommodate up to 70 crew. At the launch, the JMSDF also noted that the new sub will offer a “suitable environment for female submariners,” after the first woman entered the Japanese submariners’ academy earlier in 2020 . However, by far the most innovative part of Taigei’s design is its advanced diesel-electric powerplant, which as noted, makes use of lithium-ion batteries. The last two boats in the previous Soryu class were completed with a similar configuration, which is claimed to provide increased endurance at high speeds when submerged. Charging is also said to be quicker and battery life longer compared to lead-acid batteries, which have to be repeatedly recharged by running the diesel engines. Besides, the lithium-ion cells are less bulky and have reduced maintenance requirements. On the other hand, lithium-ion batteries are more costly than the lead-acid alternative. In the past, the JMSDF provided a construction cost of $488 million for a standard Soryu -class boat, as opposed to $608 million for the first of the lithium-ion subvariants. Back in early 2017, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway looked at the benefits of lithium-ion batteries, which not only offer advantages over traditional lead-acid cells, but could challenge Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology for use in new-build submarines overall. At that time, it already appeared that Japan was seeking to entirely replace AIP technology, which comes in multiple forms, with a new propulsion arrangement centered around lithium-ion batteries that would still retain the same advantages. A key consideration was further reducing the submarine’s acoustic signature by eliminating the many moving parts typically found in AIP systems, which are already generally very quiet. In principle, this would result in an exceptionally quiet boat, making it very hard for opponents to detect and track, but with the added advantage of being able to accelerate much more rapidly while submerged than existing AIP submarines. Those factors indicate that the JMSDF could be prioritizing dash speed and stealth as a means to counter the PLAN’s burgeoning nuclear-powered and AIP-driven submarines. On the other hand, potential problems with lithium-ion batteries include the fact they can be prone to combusting, generating a lot of heat, plus toxic fumes and conductive dust, all of which raise the risk of potentially deadly fires and other accidents. As such, there is a need for an additional degree of safety to be built into the submarine’s basic design. It certainly seems that the JMSDF has greater confidence that the new propulsion system will live up to its promise and that any safety concerns have been addressed. The later Soryu boats incorporate a specialized automated fire-extinguishing system and it can be assumed that something similar is used in the Taigei too. JMSDF submarine Soryu is pulled away from a submarine tender off Guam. The last two boats in its class are already equipped with lithium-ion batteries., U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 3RD CLASS RANDALL W. RAMASWAMY Taigei will also be used to further prove this propulsion concept, in general. In December 2018, the Japanese government published a white paper entitled National Defense Program Guidelines for Fiscal Year 2019 and Beyond that said the submarine would be used primarily for testing of the new technology. This could help explain the dramatic acceleration of Taigei ’s development and construction. MHI had announced plans to build a new type of diesel-electric submarine in June 2019, initially known as the 29SS class. At that point , construction was anticipated to begin between 2025 and 2028, followed by the launch of the first vessel around 2031. After completing its fitting out and at-sea trials, plans now call for the Taigei to deploy operationally with the JMSDF in March 2022 in its testing-focused role. The Taigei and the other future submarines in its class are just one part of Japan’s broader efforts to bolster its defenses in response to growing regional security concerns. This includes the increasing threat posed by China’s military, especially its fast-growing navy , as well as by an ever-more capable North Korea, which recently unveiled a slew of new weapons , including new intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. With an eye on a spike in activity by the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in both the East China Sea and the South China Sea , as well as further out into the Pacific, Tokyo’s defense plans include expansion of its submarine fleet to 22 vessels by the early 2020s. Currently, the JMSDF operates nine 2,750-ton-displacement Oyashio -class submarines and 11 2,900-ton-displacement Soryu -class boats, the most recent — and the first with lithium-ion batteries — being commissioned into service in March 2020 . A 12th member of the Soryu class, named Toryu , is undergoing tests before formally joining the fleet. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Oyashio -class submarine Mocishio during the Rim of the Pacific 2010 exercise north of Hawaii. , U.S. NAVY/CHRISTOPHER MCCORD Beyond this 22-boat submarine fleet, Japan plans to add at least another two Taigei -class submarines, one of which was included in the defense ministry’s latest budget request. It’s all part of a military spending program that encompasses big-ticket items ranging from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to hypersonic missiles . Japan’s Ministry of Defense has requested an annual budget increase for the last eight years now, reaching $55 billion for the next fiscal year, starting in April 2021. As well as spearheading a maritime force that should help secure critical sea lanes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, there’s a possibility Japan’s new class of submarines might also attract foreign interest. An offer of the previous Soryu -class boats to Australia was unsuccessful , but Tokyo has reshaped its national defense policy to include major arms exports. With an established lead in lithium-ion battery technology, the Taigei class, or its subsystems, could prove attractive. In the meantime, the propulsion concept is gaining traction elsewhere, including in South Korea . Whether this type of battery propulsion finds a place on other navies’ submarines remains to be seen, but it’s clear that they are here to stay, with the JMSDF undersea force, at least, now well on its way to a lithium-ion-powered future.

We Have The Audio.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Around a month and a half ago, The War Zone reported on an unusual incident in the skies near Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, in which the pilots of multiple airliners reported seeing “a guy in a jetpack” while on approach to land. A few weeks ago, we followed up on that story and the ongoing investigation into those sightings, based on new information we had obtained from the FAA. Now, we have audio between pilots and air traffic controllers regarding an all-new sighting of what was at least loosely described as jetpack-wearing individual in the same general area. The crew of China Airlines Flight 006, a Boeing 777 heading to LAX from Taipei, Taiwan, reported the encounter to air traffic controllers at around 1:45 PM local time today. The FAA has confirmed it was alerted and that it passed details along to local law enforcement. The FBI is already working on the case involving the first sighting, so they will undoubtedly be interested in this one, too. “A China Airlines crew reported seeing what appeared to be someone in a jet pack at an approximate altitude of 6,000 feet, about seven miles northwest of Los Angeles International Airport,” the FAA said in a statement to CNBC . “The FAA alerted local law enforcement and will look into the report.” The War Zone has obtained audio of the actual exchanges between Flight 006 as well as other aircraft in the area, and the tower at LAX. The initial discussion between the China Airlines crew and air traffic control went as follows: China Airlines 006: “We just saw a bright object at 6,000.” LAX Tower: “006 heavy can you say that one more time please?” China Airlines 006: “We saw a flying object like a [this part is hard to decipher, but it sounded like] flight suit jetpack at 6,000. “ LAX Tower: “Was it a UAV or was it a jetpack?” China Airlines 006: “Like a jetpack. Too shiny. It’s too far.” LAX Tower: “006 heavy, roger, thank you… Emirates 215 heavy there was a jetpack reported about 13 miles ahead.” The LAX air traffic controller subsequently reached out to another aircraft, using the callsign Idaho 30, to see if they could investigate, while also rerouting traffic around the area where the object was spotted. Idaho is a callsign commonly associated with law enforcement aircraft and helicopters , but what we don’t know what type it was in this case or what agency it belonged to. These exchanges went as follows: LAX Tower: “Idaho 30, and there was a jetpack reported about 7 miles west of your, there’s no way you can check that out can you?” Idaho 30: “30 affirmative.” … LAX Tower: “It was reported by a heavy Boeing 777 about seven miles southwest of you the location.” Idaho 30: “Affirmative.” The air traffic controller then reroutes traffic around the area where the object was spotted, which was apparently northern Los Angels. She continues to vector Idaho 30 into the exact area where it was seen to investigate. A few minutes later Idaho 30 chimes in. Idaho 30: “Idaho 30 not seeing anything.” LAX Tower: “Idaho 30, roger that, thanks for your help and you can just continue your descent into your destination.” A number of minutes pass and the air traffic controller mentions the jetpack incident again while talking with Alaska Airlines Flight 1864. This exchange also further confirms that Idaho 30 was a law enforcement aircraft or helicopter. LAX Tower: “Alaska 1864, about 15 minutes ago there was a jetpack reported about 5 miles ahead, around 6,000, but I had some law enforcement come out and check it out and they didn’t see anything, so, use caution though.” Alaska 1864: “Thanks, 1864, we’ll be looking.” You can listen to the full recording below: While we don’t know exactly what the pilots saw in this case, as The War Zone highlighted after the reported encounter on August 30, there are very real and quite capable jetpack-like designs out there for those able to afford them. This includes Yves “Jetman” Rossi’s jet-powered wingsuit. Of course, there is also the possibility that pilots who reported this new sighting were simply mistaken or that the air traffic controller misconstrued their statement regarding an unidentified flying object, although this is less likely as we now have an official FAA statement on the matter. Whatever the crew of China Airlines Flight 006 saw, the FAA, FBI, and local law enforcement are already looking into it, as will The War Zone . We will update this story with any more information about this latest sighting that becomes available. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2021",China Conducts Test Of Massive Suicide Drone Swarm Launched From A Box On A Truck,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China recently conducted a test involving a swarm of loitering munitions, also often referred to as suicide drones , deployed from a box-like array of tubular launchers on a light tactical vehicle and from helicopters. This underscores how the drone swarm threat, broadly, is becoming ever-more real and will present increasingly serious challenges for military forces around the world in future conflicts. The China Academy of Electronics and Information Technology (CAEIT) reportedly carried out the test in September . CAEIT is a subsidiary of the state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), which carried out a record-breaking drone swarm experiment in June 2017 , involving nearly 120 small fixed-wing unmanned aircraft. Four months later, CAEIT conducted its own larger experiment with 200 fixed-wing drones. Chinese companies have also demonstrated impressive swarms using quad-copter-type drones for large public displays. We don’t know the name or designation of the drones CAEIT used in its September test, or that of the complete system being employed. However, video footage, seen below, shows that the unmanned aircraft are very similar in form and function to more recent models of China Poly Defense’s CH-901 loitering munition. When the tube-launched CH-901 first emerged in 2016 , it featured a pair of pop-out wings, as well as a folding v-tail. More recently, that design has evolved and replaced the v-tail with another set of pop-out wings and folding twin-tail arrangement, similar to the drones we see in the CAEIT test video. Of course, designs featuring two pairs of folding wings are very common for tube-launched drones and loitering munitions, including the Switchblade suicide drone from U.S. manufacturer AeroVironment . The unmanned aircraft CAEIT employed in its experiment is also reminiscent of American defense contractor Raytheon’s Coyote . The Coyote comparison also extends to launch options CAEIT demonstrated in its recent test. The 48-tube ground-based launcher, which is mounted on a modified 6×6 version of the Dongfeng Mengshi light tactical vehicle, is similar in some respects to multi-tube trail-mounted launchers that the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research used to launch Coyotes as part of its Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) effort, as seen in the video below. Poly Defense has also shown at least a mock-up of an array of tubular launchers for the CH-901. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo A 12-tube launcher for the CH-901., Chinese internet It’s worth noting that any of these box-like launchers could also be installed on ships, as well as deployed in a static position on the ground. CAEIT’s test also involved at least one drone launched from a tube mounted on a Bell 206L helicopter , as well as one that popped out of a tube dropped from a what appears to be a Robinson R-series helicopter . A portion of the 206L’s tail boom was blurred out in the video footage for unclear reasons. Coyote is notably capable of being air-launched, as well. The U.S. Navy has also experimented with dropping swarms of Perdix drones , which also feature two pairs of folding wings, but are much smaller, from F/A-18E/F Super Hornets . A screen capture showing a Bell 206L helicopter launching a small drone during CAEIT’s test in September., CAEIT capture Another part of the video footage showing what looks to be a Robinson R-series helicopter dropping a tube with a small drone inside., CAEIT capture The rest of the CAEIT video footage shows up to 11 of the drones flying in formation as a swarm, as well as an individual directing their movements using a touch screen on a tablet-like device. We also see views from the electro-optical cameras on the drones observing areas on the ground and then zeroing in on mock targets. It’s not clear if these drones have any kind of low-light-capable or infrared cameras that would allow them to operate at night. Some reports have suggested that the drone swarm seen in the CAEIT video represents an actual operational capability that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) now has, but whether or not this is the case is unclear. The overall system, especially the ground-based mobile launcher, certainly looks very mature and, as already noted, CETC and its subsidiaries have been actively working on swarming technology for years now. https://youtube.com/watch?v=p1eWmE3draU All of this seems to underscore that, if the PLA doesn’t have an operational drone swarm capability, is getting ever closer to fielding one. A swarm that can be deployed from multiple platforms, on the surface and in the air, potentially approaching a target area from multiple directions, would give the complete system immense flexibility and resiliency. Swarms are inherently difficult for opponents to defend against and one of their most obvious applications is to blind, confuse, and overwhelm enemy air defenses. This very real threat is something The War Zone has been sounding the alarm on for some time now and which you can read about more here and here . As our own Tyler Rogoway previously wrote : “Being networked together, and being autonomous in nature after being loaded with a target area location, along with other mission parameters, these swarms will be extremely hard to defend against using even the best SHORAD [short-range air defense] systems in development today. It’s the saturation nature of the attack, the size of the attackers, and the fact that they work as a coordinated swarm, employing dynamic tactics to see as many in their company survive long enough to make their suicidal attack, that makes them so deadly… Just the knowledge that such an attack is possible would be psychologically stressful and demoralizing for troops on the ground. “ The idea that a single truck could deploy 48 drones in a matter of seconds, which could swarm a target area over the horizon, is a reminder that there is no defense for such an attack at this time. Lasers, miniature interceptors, and even other forms of directed energy and electronic warfare are still limited in their ability to counter drones at all, let alone massive swarms of them. The solution likely lies, at least in part, in other drones, as we wrote in 2017: “Although it may sound like a page out a science fiction novel, the only thing that could probably counter such a dense swarming attack on ground forces or a garrisoned force would be for those forces to have their own counter-swarm swarms at the ready. This would result in dozens or even hundreds of mini kamikaze dogfights in the sky—a life and death suicide struggle among diminutive hive-minded flying robots.” Such a capability is now in the process of being developed , but the fact that it is 2020 and we are still just beginning to grapple with this issue is another reminder of just how flagrantly deficient the Pentagon’s foresight was on the matter. Loitering munitions have also demonstrated the ability to have a devastating impact on an opponent, even when just used en masse rather than as part of a truly networked swarm. This reality has been especially visible, as seen in the video below, during the ongoing fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region. You can read about more about this in The War Zone’s recent coverage of that conflict . The danger that small drones, even home-brew types non-state actors are capable of building, pose to nation-state militaries is only becoming more and more apparent. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a1FTJYdfvA “I argue all the time with my Air Force friends that the future of flight is vertical and it’s unmanned,” U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said earlier this year . “I’m not talking about large unmanned platforms, which are the size of a conventional fighter jet that we can see and deal with, as we would any other platform.” “I’m talking about the one you can go out and buy at Costco right now in the United States for a thousand dollars, four quad, rotorcraft or something like that that can be launched and flown,” he continued. “And with very simple modifications, it can make made into something that can drop a weapon like a hand grenade or something else .” A swarm of small explosive-laden drones could represent an even more serious threat across an entire area of a battlefield and is a capability that other countries, beyond China, including Turkey , have been developing in recent years, as well. Though the video of CAEIT’s test showed the drones conducting kinetic strikes, they may also be able to carry small electronic warfare packages to carry out non-kinetic attacks or act as decoys, as well. Italian defense contractor Leonardo just recently demonstrated such a capability for the U.K. Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army is also looking at developing a family of swarming drones that can be air-launched. A complete swarm could potentially include drones in various configurations, mixing and matching capabilities for maximum effect. They could also be networked together with other units and assets to support more complex operations. Swarms will only continue to offer increasingly more significant benefits to commanders on the battlefield as time goes on, making them even more attractive. This capability could potentially be employed off the battlefield, as well, for asymmetric attacks on VIPs or sensitive facilities outside the context of a formal conflict. This could include harassing military forces in the lead up to or on the sidelines of a more serious confrontation, a risk highlighted by drone incursions over areas where the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense battery on Guam operates last year, something The War Zone was first to report . No matter what, as China’s CAEIT demonstrated in its recent test, drone swarms technology is very real already and it’s only a matter of time before it becomes more integrated with existing concepts of operation, if this isn’t the case for the PLA already.

"Joseph Trevithick, Thomas Newdick, Tyler Rogoway","Posted on Aug 9, 2021",Of Course Japan Rejected A Plan For A New Unmanned Fighter Because It Makes No Sense,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An unmanned fighter was among the options Japan considered as the country prepares to embark on a project to replace its fleet of indigenous Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets. The drone fighter proposal was reportedly suggested as a cost-saving measure, by Liberal Democratic Party politician Taro Kono, who stood down as Japan’s defense chief last month. Japan’s Kyodo News agency was first to report that Tokyo had considered developing a new unmanned combat air vehicle earlier this year. Its sources indicated that Japan’s Ministry of Defense has since scrapped the drone idea. The story notes that the plan was abandoned following the government’s decision not to deploy the U.S.-developed Aegis Ashore land-based air defense system, but exactly how, or if, the two are directly connected is unclear. Kyodo described the proposed unmanned aircraft as a “fighter,” suggesting that Japanese officials were exploring plans for a high-performance advanced unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). However, the outlet offered no specific details about the requirements for this drone. It’s worth noting that Japan currently lacks an unmanned aerial vehicle even in the same general class as the MQ-9 Reaper armed drone . Japan does have plans to acquire three examples of the RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 30 drone, but separate questions have been raised about the future of that effort after the U.S. Air Force proposed retiring its own Global Hawk Block 30 fleet. A U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk, assigned to the 319th Operations Group, Detachment 1, Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, lands at Yokota Air Base, Japan, May 30, 2020, for a rotational deployment., U.S. AIR FORCE/CAPT. AARON CHURCH This is not the first time that a Japanese drone fighter has been suggested . It’s not entirely clear why the proposal was rejected in this case, either. Details of any such planned unmanned platform remain extremely scarce. The original decision to at least look at the viability of an unmanned fighter was based on a plan to reduce the costs involved in developing a new warplane. This could have been an ambitious aspiration, however, depending on the particular capabilities that the proposed drone was supposed to offer. The Japanese tried unsuccessfully for years to acquire a fleet of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. The country’s authorities have not given up a desire for an aircraft with similarly advanced capabilities, either developed entirely domestically or with the help of foreign partners. This could have influenced the requirements for the proposed unmanned alternative. There was also reported skepticism that the country would be able to indigenously develop the required autonomous technologies. An F-22 Raptor from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, July 17, 2018., U.S. AIR FORCE/YASUO OSAKABE In addition, Japan has already invested around $332 million in developing the stealthy X-2 Shinshin demonstrator, one example of which has been built and test-flown . The fact that the X-2 combines a stealthy airframe with twin thrust-vectoring low-bypass turbofans suggested that a significant degree of agility was a key concern for Japan’s future fighter. It also reflects the X-2’s origins as a potential starting place for pursuing an indigenous alternative to the Raptor. Concept artwork of a follow-on, production-ready design to the Shinshin — informally dubbed F-3 — have also included similarities with the F-22, as well as with proposed sixth-generation U.S. fighter studies.

This includes more than 100 F-35As primarily to replace its fleet of aging F-4EJ Phantom II aircraft, plus 42 short take-off and vertical landing F-35Bs to equip its Izumo -class carriers .

DEANA HEITZMAN Beyond that, Japan is also investing heavily in around half of its fleet of around 200 F-15J air superiority fighter jets, which are planned to be upgraded to the so-called Japanese Super Interceptor (JSI) standard after U.S. government approval was granted in October 2019. As The War Zone discussed at the time , the F-15J upgrade will include new active electronically scanned array radars, improved mission computers, updated electronic warfare suites , and more. Japan Air Self-Defense Force pilots race to two F-15J Eagles during a scramble demonstration at Chitose Air Base, Japan, April 14, 2017., U.S. AIR FORCE/TECH. SGT. BENJAMIN W. STRATTON All of this existing investment in manned aircraft efforts may have impacted the final decision to abandon the UCAV option. An advanced unmanned aircraft would certainly have been in some degree of competition for funding as time went on. In contrast to regional rivals China and Russia , and even its allies, Japan has appeared more reluctant to embark on the development of unmanned combat air vehicles, which don’t have a clear role to play within the country’s primarily defensive military posture, at least when it comes to fast jet capabilities. It’s not clear if a strong lobby for manned versus unmanned aircraft exists within Japan’s Defense Ministry, as it does in other countries , which may have influenced the decision to reject the UCAV proposal. Whether or not the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will receive an F-3 or a manned fighter co-developed with a foreign nation, also remains to be seen. Developing and fielding a manned stealth fighter has historically shown to be a costly and time-consuming proposition, which seems to be what prompted this recent consideration of the UCAV option in the Japanese Ministry of Defense. While partnering with a foreign country could help defray some of those costs, they could still be onerous for Japan. Japanese authorities have talked in the past about spending as much as $50 billion over an indeterminate amount of time on developing and buying a new manned stealth fighter. Japan’s problems with the fourth-generation F-2 itself means the country has to be well aware of these potential pitfalls. A derivative of the F-16 Viper, the F-2 was vastly more expensive than contemporary versions of that jet, owing in part to the Japanese plane’s active electronically-scanned array radar, the first operational unit of its kind, and the small production volume. The expected industrial offsets largely failed to materialize, as well. Japan Air Self-Defense Force Mitsubishi F-2As and U.S. Air Force F-16s on the flight line during Red Flag-Alaska 19-2 at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. , U.S. AIR FORCE/SENIOR AIRMAN DANIEL SNIDER It may turn out that the most cost-effective route for Japan would be to simply expand on the high-low capability mix offered by the F-35s and F-15JSIs that it is working to acquire already. Both of these aircraft remain in production and are widely supported. There are also various upgrade programs in the works for both types that could make them even more attractive options down the line as far as new purchases go. In reality, cost-effective lower and middle-end stealthy UCAVs will be available off-the-shelf in the not so distant future and will be primarily designed to be teamed with Japan’s existing fast jet assets in the loyal wingman role. They could also be used in some roles autonomously, as well. But considering air defense and anti-surface warfare are the two primary roles of the JASDF’s tactical jet fleet, and especially the F-2, keeping a human in the cockpit, for now, isn’t just a good idea, when it comes to the air defense mission, it really is a necessity. The homeland air sovereignty mission remains one that will be best executed by manned platforms for the foreseeable future. Japan is dealing with the burden of having to perform an extremely high number of air defense scrambles throughout the year, often to intercept Russian and Chinese aircraft near Japanese territory, some of which is disputed. In 2019 alone, Japan had to scramble nearly one thousand times , almost all of which were to intercept peer adversary aircraft. Such a high number of scrambles would place a substantial strain on any country’s tactical fighter fleet and executing these missions is not the place of an unmanned system. A drone can potentially have major advantages in the anti-surface warfare role, but that would be in lieu of other capabilities that the country needs. There are other answers to the anti-surface warfare role as well, including acquiring less complex high-endurance unmanned maritime patrol aircraft and longer-range anti-ship missiles, along with better joint force integration and networking. While the F-2s may focus on this role today, also being capable of the full gamut of air-to-air combat is highly beneficial and a future multi-role platform will be equally as prized, especially as a smaller fleet of JASDF F-15s gets saturated with additional missions . Boeing Australia’s loyal wingman drone would be an excellent augmentation of Japan’s manned fighter capabilities, but it would not replace them outright., Boeing Australia During wartime, the flexibility of multi-role tactical jets could prove essential in defending the island chain and an indigenous or imported loyal wingman drone could drastically help in this mission and a number of others, but replacing manned fighters in this defensive air-to-air role isn’t realistic at this time for Japan. This is especially true when you factor in the opportunity cost of an entire fast jet fleet. Even the long-range advantages that some advanced UCAVs possess are less of a necessity for Japan considering the country’s unique geographical, geopolitical, and strategic realities, as well as its prevailing defensive military posture. In the end, Japan may be best off in developing its own loyal wingman drone to complement its existing fighters and those it can buy off-the-shelf. It is a far less ambitious task than developing a new high-end fighter or even an advanced UCAV, but one that will have many similar industrial and force multiplication benefits and such an exercise can lead to the fielding of more advanced UCAVs in the future as the technology evolves. As it sits now, the JASDF hopes to replace the F-2 with whatever comes next around 2035.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Aug 4, 2018",The Military’s Puzzling Plan To Have SpaceX Deliver A C-17’s Worth Of Cargo Anywhere In An Hour (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army General Stephen R. Lyons , commander of U.S. Transportation Command ( TRANSCOM ), recently stated that new space technologies being developed by industry partners could soon be able to deliver large loads of cargo to anywhere on the planet in just one hour. Lyons made the comments while speaking at the National Defense Transportation Association’s virtual Fall Meeting on October 7. TRANSCOM has forged a partnership with both SpaceX and Exploration Architecture Corporation (XArc) to pursue rapid delivery concepts. XArc is a consulting firm offering expertise in space station and spaceport design, planetary surface systems, and other technology development programs aimed at space exploration and commercialization. TRANSCOM provides transportation services and solutions to every branch of the armed forces, as well as various other defense and governmental organizations. By providing a vast logistical network that spans every transportation domain, TRANSCOM boasts that it offers “the most responsive strategic mobility capability the world has ever seen.” Lyons told attendees at the National Defense Transportation Association’s virtual meeting that the new rapid delivery architecture SpaceX and XArc are working on could be in place as soon as next year: “Think about moving the equivalent of a C-17 payload anywhere on the globe in less than an hour. Think about that speed associated with the movement of transportation of cargo and people. There is a lot of potential here and I’m really excited about the team that’s working with SpaceX on an opportunity, even perhaps, as early as [20]21, to be conducting a proof of principle. I had no sense for how fast SpaceX was moving, but I’ve received their update and I can tell you they are moving very rapidly in this area.” A slide from Lyons’s virtual presentation., TRANSCOM According to a USAF fact sheet , the C-17 Globemaster has a top speed of around 520 mph and a maximum payload of around 82 tons, although normal payloads are around roughly 60 tons or less. In comparison, a rocket that can deliver cargo to anywhere in the world in 60 minutes would require an average speed of around 9,000 miles per hour. A TRANSCOM press release says that the unprecedented types of point-to-point space launches Lyons is describing will require the DoD to examine every “legal, diplomatic, statutory, and regulatory issues that must be addressed to enable the normalization of high-frequency, point-to-point, commercial space launches.” To that end, the command has signed Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) with its industry partners in order to facilitate this radical new form of transportation. DOD Many of the details of TRANSCOM’s vision for these space-launch cargo deliveries are still unknown and it’s likely those details are what the CRADAs will explore. For example, it’s unknown if these launches will consist of an entire stack landing vertically or a cargo capsule being dropped from suborbital space. The TRANSCOM press release announcing this CRADA also does not mention how much each of these launches will cost, but an average SpaceX Falcon 9 launch costs anywhere from $50 million to $62 million. That’s still less than the cost of an average NASA launch , but drastically more than a C-17 flight. The C-17’s cost per flight hours varies depending on how it is calculated, but taking a $30,000 per hour figure, 18 hours of flight time to get halfway around the world would cost roughly $540,000, which is around 1/100th the cost of a SpaceX launch. With this in mind, some budgetary experts have already cast doubts on TRANSCOM’s plans, noting that it will likely be decades before the concept of space-based cargo deliveries could be cost-effective. https://youtube.com/watch?v=D4w_4O4J_7o Other experts have questioned the concept altogether, noting that point-to-point space launches will usher in a new host of issues that must be addressed before this concept gets off the ground. Victoria Samson at the Secure World Foundation told Breaking Defense ‘s Theresa Hitchens that TRANSCOM’s plans open up a regulatory can of worms: It seems like it would provide a host of traffic management questions, as well as spaceport issues. Where would these craft be taking off/landing? Will we have spaceport bases in allied territory, and if not, how does this benefit our troops overseas if we still have to move them through ground transportation systems? It isn’t exactly clear what kind of scenarios would require this type of high-cost rapid transport, either. One could imagine using the system for moving very time-sensitive equipment and supplies to forward operating locations, but even if the cost is far less than an actual SpaceX orbital launch, it would still likely be a huge investment every time it is used. The exact infrastructure requirements are also unknown as is just how such heavy loads will be delivered safely. Suborbital flights would drastically increase the available payload of a system like Falcon 9, as opposed to its orbital insertion mission, but safely landing tens of tons of cargo in some sort of a cost-effective manner remains a question mark, albeit one that will be really interesting to see solved. This certainly isn’t the first time the U.S. military has fancied the ability to move things around the globe, including people, far faster than existing airlift concepts can provide. In 2018, now-retired Air Force General Carlton Everhart, then-head of that service’s Air Mobility Command (AMC), which is part of TRANSCOM, made similar comments about space-based logistics after having sat down with SpaceX, as well as Virgin Orbit . “Think about this. Thirty minutes, 150 metric tons, [and] less than the cost of a C-5 [cargo plane] ,” Everhart said. “I said, I need to get me some of that. How do I do that?” Those remarks prompted many of the same questions that still exist now. Those same issues have dogged similar efforts that have come and gone since the 1960s, including the abortive Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion (SUSTAIN) effort, which received support from the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office and U.S. Marine Corps in the 2000s and was said to be “doable” by the end of the 2010s. You can read more about that project and other efforts in the context of Everhart’s 2018 comments in this past War Zone piece . A briefing slide from circa 2009 describing “conclusions” from a study the University of North Dakota did regarding the SUSTAIN concept. By the end of that year, the program was effectively canceled., DOD Still, SpaceX is no stranger to giving the DoD what it wants. It has previously teamed up with the U.S. Air Force to offer datalink services through their Starlink satellite constellations for the USAF’s burgeoning Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). ABMS is designed to link U.S. forces and allies across all domains, enabling real-time data fusion and sharing on an unprecedented level. Dr. Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, has previously stated that data is now an essential warfighting resource as valuable as jet fuel, and is “the key to next-gen warfare.” SpaceX was recently awarded around 40% of the U.S. Space Force’s launch service contracts through 2024 and another $149 million to develop early warning satellites for the Space Development Agency (SDA). While Lyons’s comments about the potential for planet-wide deliveries in one hour may sound like an exaggeration, it does follows along with other recent comments made by other military brass. Just last year, retired Air Force Lieutenant General Steven Kwast claimed that existing cutting-edge technology makes it possible to “deliver any human being from any place on planet Earth to any other place in less than an hour .” While TRANSCOM hasn’t mentioned delivering personnel using rockets, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has stated that the company’s Starship rocket will soon enable point-to-point travel – for those willing to withstand the Gs such a trip would exert on the body. Kwast’s comments remain peculiar, but using rockets for rapid transport across the globe could point in the direction of his claims. Still, we are not talking about a man rating for the system at this time, at least according to TRANSCOM. This development is only the most recent in a strengthening partnership between the DoD and industry partners like SpaceX and other commercial spaceflight firms . As space continues to play an increasingly vital role for the militaries of the 21st century, and as it becomes increasingly contested , it’s likely we will begin to see more radical developments like this one that has the potential, at least in theory, to change military logistics and other aspects of warfare forever. UPDATE: Our friend @lfx160219 over on Twitter sent us these two Air Force slides about this initiative. We cannot attest to how accurate they are as of now, but it looks like a Starship derivative being used in a suborbital to vertical landing mode. Hard to imagine this working in areas without some infrastructure to support it. So, one would imagine a hub and spoke model for delivering the goods ‘the last tactical mile’ via traditional airlift. This method would still get the materiel into a theater very quickly though. USAF USAF Contact the author: Brett@thedrive.com Brett Tingley Air C-17 Transports"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2020",StormBreaker Mini Glide Bomb That Can Hit Moving Targets In Any Weather Is Ready For War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has approved Raytheon’s GBU-53/B StormBreaker glide bomb , also known as the Small Diameter Bomber II (SDB II), for use on its F-15E Strike Eagles . This means that the service will now be able to send these impressive weapons downrange for use by F-15E squadrons, which are among some the most in-demand American combat aviation units . The type’s predecessor, the GBU-39/B SDB I , which is only capable of hitting fixed targets, has become a staple for F-15Es flying combat patrols . A follow-on ‘Laser SDB,’ which cannot strike moving targets in all weather conditions and has other limitations, is also fielded. Raytheon announced the milestone for the StormBreaker program on Oct. 13, 2020. The Air Force had planned to declare initial operational capability with the GBU-53/B on the F-15E in August, but that had been delayed to correct issues with the weapon’s software and guidance system, as well as address safety concerns associated with the bomb’s folding tail fins, all of which you can read about more in this previous War Zone piece on the weapon. “The weapon has proven itself in many complex test scenarios, against a variety of targets in extreme environmental conditions, and is now ready to fly,” Cristy Stagg, the StormBreaker Program Director at Raytheon Missiles & Defense, said in a press release. “With its multimode seeker and datalink, StormBreaker will make adverse weather irrelevant.” A GBU-53/B StormBreaker under an F-15E Strike Eagle during a test., Raytheon The GBU-53/B, originally known as the Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II), has a tri-mode guidance system able to find targets using imaging infrared or millimeter-wave radar, or using semi-active laser homing to hit a designated aimpoint. Depending on the altitude of the launching aircraft, the weapon can also glide up to 69 miles on its own using a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system, after which could strike a specific coordinate or begin searching for a target. As Raytheon’s Stagg noted, this offers immense flexibility, giving this single weapon the ability to engage both stationary and moving targets, even at night or in bad weather. “The SDB II StormBreaker is ready for operational use after undergoing extensive development and flight testing,” Air Force Colonel Jason Rusco, the SDB II Program Manager and Miniature Munitions Division Senior Materiel Leader within the Air Force’s Armament Directorate, said in a separate statement . “The fielding milestone is the culmination of years of incredible work conducted by our joint military and industry teams. This capability is unmatched and is a game-changer for national defense.” Pairing StormBreaker with the F-15E promises to be an even more lethal combination. The GBU-53/Bs diminutive size means that a single Strike Eagle will be able to carry up to 28 of these weapons, in total, using special racks that allow the aircraft to carry up to four of the bombs on a single pylon. In addition, while the F-15E is the first aircraft cleared to employ the GBU-53/B, it won’t be the only platform able to carry these weapons. The Navy conducted its first guided launch of one of these weapons from an F/A-18E/F Super Hornet earlier this year , as seen in the video below. There are also plans to integrate StormBreaker onto all three variants of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Those jets will be able to carry these weapons internally, allowing them to employ them while operating in the most stealthy configuration. The addition of StormBreaker into the F-35’s arsenal will greatly expand the type’s flexibility and lethality. Other aircraft will follow as the weapon opens up new engagement possibilities for everything from slow-flying drones to stealth bombers. “StormBreaker delivers an unprecedented capability to pilots in the field,” Paul Ferraro, Vice President of Raytheon Missiles & Defense’s Air Power business division. “The weapon gives airmen a significant advantage – the ability to strike maritime or land-based maneuvering targets at range in adverse weather.” Air Force F-15E crews will now be the first to be able to take advantage of the immense capabilities that GBU-53/B offers on future combat operations.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Navy submarines could operate in the near future from a cavernous Norwegian naval base built under a mountain. A reported deal to re-open the once-secret facility comes amid concerns about increased Russian submarine activity in the nearby Barents Sea and the Arctic region. There has also been a notable uptick in American military activity in these same areas, including an unusually public port visit by the secretive first-in-class submarine USS Seawolf to Norway in August. Norway’s state broadcaster NRK was first to report on the potential rehabilitation of the Royal Norwegian Navy’s former base at Olavsvern, near the city of Tromso, for use by American submarines on Oct. 10, 2020. Active Norwegian naval operations at this facility, which is now privately owned and operated , came to an end in 2002 and it was officially decommissioned in 2009. NRK said that American military officials have made a number of visits to the site recently and a lease deal allowing for U.S. naval operations to begin there could be signed within the next week. A map showing the general location of Olavsvern in Norway., Google Maps A satellite image showing what is visible of Olavsvern above ground., Google Earth At present, Norway allows U.S. submarines to sail into the Malangen fjord near Tromso to conduct personnel transfers and get fresh supplies. However, under this arrangement, small boats have to take passengers and cargo to and from the submarines, limiting the kind of support that can be provided to the American vessels. Olavsvern would not only offer an actual physical facility for American submarines to operate from in this strategic part of the world, but a robust one with 32,000 square feet of deep-water docking space, including a full dry dock for maintenance, underneath the mountain. A 3,000-foot-long entrance tunnel, with a large blast door at the front, leads in and out of these berths. The entire base, some areas of which are nearly 900 feet underground, covers some 270,000 square feet, in total, and includes barracks, storage, and maintenance facilities above and below the surface. Olavsvern Group Olavsvern Group Olavsvern Group Olavsvern Group Olavsvern Group Olavsvern Group Work on the base began on Olavsvern in 1964 , at which time it was seen as a vital future facility to support naval operations in the Barents Sea and surrounding areas in the event of a major conflict with the Soviet Union. Building the base, which is situated less than 300 miles from Russia, deep underground offered added defense against an initial onslaught if war were to break out. Building the base, plans for which were initially a closely-guarded secret, was an immense undertaking for Norway and was completed with significant financial assistance from the NATO Alliance. It ultimately took 30 years for the facility to be completely finished, by which time the Soviet Union had collapsed. Of course, it’s worth noting that Norway is hardly the only country to have built large subterranean military facilities , including underground naval bases capable of accommodating submarines, as well as other warships. China’s Yulin Naval Base on Hainan Island in the South China Sea is one of the best known examples, which you can read about in more detail in this War Zone piece . However, the Norwegian government subsequently determined that the base was extraneous to its post-Cold War needs. Two years after formally shuttering it in 2009, authorities in that country put it up for sale on the open market, with an asking price of around $17.5 million . The eventually winning bid from Olavsvern Group Limited was just under $6.5 million . This was a fraction of the cost to build the base in the first place, which was reportedly some $500 million , in the end, a figure that may not fully account for inflation after construction began in the 1960s. The main entrance to the underground portions of Olavsvern locked shut in 2008., Norwegian Armed Forces To add insult to injury, one of the first entities that Olavsvern Group rented the base to after that was an operator of underwater seismic survey ships that was linked to Russia’s partially-state-owned energy company Gazprom. It’s not immediately clear how long that arrangement lasted, but it would have been increasingly politically untenable as Norway, among others, hit Russia with sanctions after the Kremlin illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. Whatever the case, in 2019, Norwegian firm WilNor Governmental Services Limited acquired a controlling stake in the Olavsvern Group and subsequently announced its intention to make the base available to the Norwegian military, as well as those of Norway’s allies. Four years earlier, WilNor had received a wide-ranging contract from the Norwegian Defense Logistics Organization to provide logistics support to the Norwegian Armed Forces. This deal with WilNor could make it relatively easy for Norwegian authorities to reopen Olavsvern and make it available to American submarines, as well as other ships. How long it might actually take for the U.S. Navy to begin operations there and what improvements or additions the facilities might need to support nuclear-powered submarines is unclear. Whether or not American submarines will actually be able to fit inside the base, or will simply dock outside, with internal areas simply providing operations and storage space, remains to be seen, as well. NRK ‘s report also indicated that Norwegian officials may be looking to offer Olavsvern as an alternative to above-ground berthing in ports in and around Tromso. In September, shortly after USS Seawolf ‘s unusually public appearance the Malangen fjord, authorities in Norway announced plans to expand facilities in that city to accommodate American submarines. Local authorities have reportedly voiced concerns about the potential safety risks of having nuclear-powered submarines in their ports. USS Seawolf during its visit to Norway in August 2020., USN “The decision to use Grøtsund harbor [near Tromso] was made after consultation with the American authorities,” Norwegian Minister of Defense Frank Bakke-Jensen told NRK . He declined to confirm or deny any plans for the U.S. Navy to use Olavsvern and had also previously told the state broadcaster that the Defense Ministry reserved the right to overrule any local objections to basing arrangements. “When it comes to Olavsvern, there is currently talk of storing equipment for the Norwegian army and HV [Heimevernet; the Norwegian Home Guard],” he added. NRK further reported that the U.S. Navy did not appear to be interested in giving up its ability to use above-ground facilities in the area, though it was open to using the underground naval base, as well. “The U.S. and Norway have a great relationship, and our ability to use facilities in and around Tromso would provide a strategic location for our visits,” a U.S. defense official had told Breaking Defense in September. “It would give us flexibility for not only the U.S. but allied countries to exercise in the High North.” The Navy is particularly interested in ways to expand its presence in the Barents Sea and the Arctic amid growing Russian activity in the region, which includes a significant uptick in Russian Navy submarine operations and the notable physical expansion of a constellation of air and other bases across Russia’s territory in the far north. The Barents Sea is a major transit point for Russian submarines and other warships heading from their bases in the northwestern part of the country toward the Atlantic via the so-called Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom (GIUK) gap. The U.S. military’s interest in the ability to operate from naval and other facilities in this general region is only likely to increase in the near future, in general, as well. The U.S. Marine Corps actually already uses another underground bunker complex in Norway, near the city of Trondheim, to store vehicles and other equipment to support rapid deployments. A picture from 1997 of a marshaling area outside of a bunker complex near Trondheim, Norway, that the Marine Corps uses to preposition vehicles and equipment., DOD Marine Corps Humvees inside an underground garage in the bunker complex near Trondheim, Norway, in 2015., DOD This broad area has seen a large amount of military activity, in general, both on the Russian and NATO sides , in recent years. Norwegian authorities have also accused Russian forces of conducting mock attacks on its territory, including simulated strikes on a secretive radar facility in Vardo , on multiple occasions as part of exercises. Depending on how discussions between U.S. and Norwegian officials proceed now, American submarines operating out of the caves at Olavsvern could become a new addition to the strategic equation in this region.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 9, 2020","Air Force Says New Hypersonic Missile Will Hit Targets 1,000 Miles Away In Under 12 Minutes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle warhead in its forthcoming AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid-Response Weapon hypersonic missile will fly at an average speed of between 5,000 and 6,000 miles per hour. This would be roughly between Mach 6.5 and Mach 8. At that speed, it will take only 10 to 12 minutes to strike targets 1,000 miles away. Air Force Major General Andrew Gebara, Air Force Global Strike Command’s (AFGSC) Director of Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, disclosed the information in an interview with Air Force Magazine . Expected to be the first hypersonic weapon to become operational with the U.S. military, the Air-launched Rapid-Response Weapon, or ARRW, which is pronounced “arrow,” will be carried by the command’s B-52H strategic bombers. “This thing is going to be able to go, in 10-12 minutes, almost 1,000 miles,” Gebara said in the interview, which you can read in full here . “It’s amazing.” This appears to be the first time that the Air Force has officially commented on ARRW’s speed with any specificity. Before now, it was understood that the weapon would be capable of hypersonic speeds, which are simply defined as anything above Mach 5. To attain hypersonic speeds, the missile consists of a solid-fuel rocket booster, fitted with pop-out tail fins, and an unpowered boost-glide vehicle. After being propelled to a specific speed and altitude atop the rocket booster, the wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicle continues to its target at hypersonic speed. A computer-generated rendering of the AGM-183A prior to deploying its unpowered boost-glide vehicle, USAF It’s also worth noting that General Gebara might have been talking about the average speed of ARRW’s boost-glide vehicle warhead. In the past, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had said that the boost-glide vehicle being developed for its Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program could potentially hit a peak speed of Mach 20. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor on both of these programs and ARRW’s boost-glide vehicle is understood to be derived from the TBG one. During flight tests in 2010 and 2011, DARPA’s Hypersonic Test Vehicle 2 (HTV-2), another wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicle, reached peak speeds of Mach 20. The Pentagon has also said that the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), a conical design that the U.S. Army and Navy are developing together, has demonstrated its ability to reach a peak speed of Mach 17. More information about ARRW’s speed may begin to emerge as live-fire flight testing begins. Presently, the first launches of AGM-183A prototypes are set to take place in October 2021. Lockheed Martin first received the contract to develop the AGM-183A in 2018. A first captive-carry test flight of an ARRW test round took place aboard a B-52H at Edwards Air Force Base in California in June 2019, and a last such test occurred in August 2020 . The Air Force plans to buy at least eight prototype ARRWs, some of which could potentially be used to field a limited operational arsenal of these weapons in the coming years. The service’s present goal is to reach initial operational capability with the weapon in September 2022. However, the program is already running behind schedule and this timeline might not be met. It has seen costs spiral by nearly 40 percent and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, has warned there could be further delays. Of course, that the B-52 will become the service’s principal platform for the carriage of air-launched hypersonic weapons should come as no surprise, as we at The War Zone have discussed before . The Stratofortress is particularly well suited to fulfilling this role compared to other existing American combat aircraft. Gebara also confirmed that the B-52 will be able to carry two ARRWs on each of its two underwing pylons. A four-missile load-out is something that we previously anticipated here . A B-52H carries an AGM-183A aloft during the first captive-carry test on June 12, 2019., USAF Regardless of which platform carries the ARRW, it’s clear that it will provide the Air Force with a significantly enhanced short or no-notice strike capability, especially against time-critical or otherwise high-value and highly defended targets — providing the next phase of test work proves successful. Combined with its speed and level atmospheric flight profile, the boost-glide vehicle will be able to maneuver in flight, making it even tougher for hostile air defenses to defeat. We explained more about the advances offered by hypersonic weapons in this previous article . We also now know ARRW has a range of at least 1,000 miles, which will allow its launch platform to remain outside the reach of hostile defenses, at least in most cases. It’s an area in which the United States is now concentrating its efforts in a bid to match similar developments in both China and Russia . It is certainly interesting to hear a leading Air Force official muse about the speed of the service’s new hypersonic missile, and the weapon’s ability to strike targets hundreds of miles away in mere minutes makes it clear why the service is so keen to get it into service quickly. However, there are plenty more hurdles to overcome before it becomes an operational part of the U.S. Air Force inventory.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the extraordinary display of North Korean military might on show in Kim Il Sung Square was justifiably the focus of much attention last weekend, over in the Balkans the Serbian Armed Forces put on a military showcase that was dramatic in its own way, during the country’s Joint Action 2020 maneuvers. The tactical exercise that took place on October 10, 2020, included a mixture of new and Cold War-era equipment, originating from China, Russia, and Western Europe. While not among the latest weaponry fielded by Serbia, the combination of the French-designed Gazelle attack helicopter and the Soviet-era 9M14M Malyutka missile made for an impressive show of force, as a quartet of the helicopters hovered in formation before unleashing their anti-tank guided missiles in unison, as seen in the accompanying video below. After streaking away from the Gazelles, the four Malyutka missiles scored direct hits to knock out targets on the plateau at the Pešter training range in southwestern Serbia. With these objectives hit, and smoke rising over the simulated battlefield, the helicopters launched another salvo of four missiles to finish the job, destroying whatever is left of the targets. The full sequence can be seen from around the 9:32-minute mark. The video then moves to a nearby part of the range, where we witness a single Malyutka absolutely obliterate a wooden “house,” sending debris flying into the air like matchwood, prior to the launch of an assault by armored and mechanized infantry units. Youtube Gif Serbia’s remaining Gazelles are relics from the era of the still-unified Yugoslavia, in which these single-engine helicopters were built under license in Mostar, in what is now Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here, Yugoslavia’s SOKO aviation company, which is now defunct, undertook the manufacture of SA341H and improved SA342L Gazelles, in sub-variants that comprised utility, scout, and attack variants, the latter two known as the HERA and GAMA models, respectively. The locally developed GAMA variant, despite its advancing years, is one of the most heavy-hitting Gazelle models ever to see service, with provisions for up to four 9M14M Malyutka anti-tank missiles, known to NATO as the AT-3 Sagger, and two 9M32M Strela-2M (SA-7 Grail) anti-aircraft missiles. The helicopters serve with the 714th Anti-armor Helicopter Squadron , the “Shadows,” based at Lađevci in central Serbia. Surprisingly, these veteran helicopters continue in service despite Serbia receiving both Russian-made Mi-35Ms armed with more modern 9M120 Ataka (AT-9 Spiral-2) anti-tank guided missiles, plus Airbus Helicopters’ H145Ms that can be armed with various guns and rockets. Soko SA341 Gazelle Gama., Srđan Popović-wikicommons The AT-3 Swatter missile has been license-produced in Serbia, as the Malyutka-2T5. It’s now an obsolescent design that first made its name in Egyptian hands during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Just two feet 10 inches long, the 9M14M carries a 6.6-pound hollow-charge warhead for the anti-armor role. It has a 3.1-mile maximum range and makes use of wire guidance, the operator tracking the missile using a flare, which is seen to good effect in the accompanying video. The full Joint Action 2020 video from the Serbian Ministry of Defense is well worth watching in its entirety. Among the equipment appearing for the first time at this event were the country’s new Russian-supplied Pantsir-S1 self-propelled surface-to-air missile/anti-aircraft artillery systems and the locally developed PASARS-16, a mobile air defense system that is now gaining hybrid missile/artillery armament.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New massive intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles were the clear stars of North Korea’s recent military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the one-party dictatorship’s Workers’ Party of Korea. However, a number of major conventional weapons developments were also on display, as you can read in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on the event. This included prototypes of a new main battle tank that appeared similar, at least visually, to more modern tanks, such as Russia’s T-14 Armata and China’s Type 99 , though its actual capabilities and basic performance are unclear. At least nine of the tanks, a designation for which does not appear to have yet emerged, were part of the procession through Kim Il Sung Square in the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Oct. 10, 2020. All of them were wearing what looked to be a tan-and-brown desert camouflage scheme, which would not be particularly useful on the Korean Peninsula. The paint job seems more intended to further evoke comparisons to more modern Russia , Chinese , and western designs , which often do feature desert-focused camouflage. Examples of North Korea’s new prototype tank on parade on Oct. 10, 2020., North Korean state media North Korean state media Virtually no hard information exists about this tank so far, but a number of key details are readily visible. It notably has seven wheels on each side, meaning that it is longer than North Korea’s other indigenous tank designs, including the most recent new type, the Songun-ho , which first emerged publicly in 2010 . A 2015 U.S. Army Threat Tactics Report on North Korea that the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act describes that existing tank, also known as the Songun-915, as combining “technologies of the Soviet/Russian T-62 , T-72, T-80, and T-90 , and the Chinese-produced Type 88 main battle tank.” However, despite continual updates and additions, it is clearly a dated design with the 1960s-era T-62 at its core, as its most evidenced by its dome-shaped turret. A North Korean Songun-ho tank during a previous military parade., North Korean state media capture The tank that appeared over the weekend has a distinctly new hull shape, at least outwardly, from those older tanks. Visually, it is similar, in broad strokes, to that of the T-14, including the presence of slat armor grills on either side of the rear of the hull where the engine is located. Slat armor is primarily intended to defeat infantry anti-tank rockets, causing their high-explosive anti-tank warheads (HEAT) warheads to detonate at a sub-optimal moment and reducing the amount of damage they are likely to produce. There are additional skirts hanging under the sides of the hull on either side to provide some additional protection for the road wheels, as well. A close-up of the side of North Korea’s new tank, showing the slat armor grills at the rear, as well as the side skirts in front of the road wheels., North Korean state media capture A Russian T-14., liya Pitalev/Sputnik via AP A Chinese Type 99 tank, another design that North Korea’s new tank looks broadly visually reminiscent of., Max Smith via Wikimedia The turret has a distinct and more angular shape from previous North Korean tanks and has slat armor at the rear, as well. The main gun appears to be a 125mm type, likely the same weapon used on the Songun-ho and the later version of that tank’s predecessor, the Pokpung-ho . The guns on those tanks are understood to be derived in some way from the Russian 2A46 . On the right side of the turret, there is a two-tube anti-tank guided missile launcher. This launcher appears somewhat similar to ones that North Korea has mounted on the top of the turrets of its existing tanks in the past and that may be used to fire “Firebird” missiles, derived from the Soviet-era 9K111. North Korean Pokpung-ho tanks with two-tube anti-tank missile launchers mounted on top of the left side of the turret take part in a previous parade., AP The new tank’s turret is otherwise covered in various boxes, typically associated with optics and range-finders, and has smoke grenade launchers at the rear. Most notably, however, is the addition of what appears to at least be meant to stand in for an active protection system (APS) consisting of four banks of three tubular launchers, positioned on the front corners and the left and right sides of the turret. An enclosure, which typically houses a radar sensor in similar APS systems, is positioned above each one. This configuration overall is generally similar to that of the Russian Afghanit APS on the T-14. If the North Korean system is meant to function in the same way, it means that the sensors detect incoming anti-tank guided missiles or infantry anti-tank rockets and then fire interceptors from the tubular launchers at the appropriate moment, neutralizing the threat. A close up of the turret on North Korea’s new tank showing what appears to be an APS, among other features., North Korean state media capture A close-up of the turret on a T-14 showing the tubular countermeasures launchers along the base of the turret associated with the Afghanit APS , liya Pitalev/Sputnik via AP However, the positioning of the countermeasures launchers on North Korea’s new tank raises questions about how much coverage this particular system offers, especially against more advanced top-attack anti-tank missiles, such as the American FGM-148 Javelin . Even the side-saddle missile launcher looks like it blocks some of the system’s coverage on one of its sides. The reality is that, while the Soviet Union developed the first APS in the late 1970s, the technology behind the miniaturized radars and other sensors, as well as and interceptors found in more modern systems is complex and may still be beyond the reach of North Korea at present. As such, it’s very possible that what we’re seeing on these prototype tanks is aspirational and just a mock-up of a system that North Korea is now in the process of developing. It is certainly something that the regime in Pyongyang would be interested in adding to its tanks. Countries around the world are pursuing similar efforts to integrate, or trying to integrate, APSs to their tanks and other heavy armored vehicles as anti-tank guided missiles, as well as infantry anti-tank rockets, continue to become more capable and those threats increasingly proliferate . Despite the comparison to other tanks, such the T-14 , and especially the latest version of the U.S. Army’s M1 Abrams tank , it is hard to imagine that the North Korean design is anywhere near as advanced. Unlike, the T-14, for example, this North Korean tank still has a manned turret and wouldn’t feature the Russian vehicle’s complex remote vision system, seen in the video below, for its crew of three, who all sit together in the front hull. When it comes to sensor, communications, and networking capabilities, in particular, this tank won’t even approach that of either the T-14 or the Chinese Type 99, let alone the M1A2 SEPv3. The various boxes seen on the examples on parade could well be empty, meant to only reflect systems that North Korea hopes to integrate into the design as time goes on. In addition, just having angular lines akin to those on the American tank also does not mean the North Korean one has anywhere near the same kind of complex composite passive armor , which includes layers of ceramics and depleted uranium, either. The armor packages for the Abrams, which have been continually improved upon over the years, are so advanced and sensitive that the development of the initial “ special armor ” configuration for the tank was originally conducted within a top-secret Special Access Program nicknamed Green Grape. Since the side skirts obscure the road wheels, it not possible to tell for sure, but it seems very plausible that the underlying chassis over this new North Korean tank still owes much to old Soviet designs, as well. The Pokpung-ho, and subsequent Songun-Ho, both use an extended version of the chassis of the previous Chonma-ho , which was itself derived from the Soviet T-62. It’s not hard to believe that the North Koreans built on that proven design, with which they now have great experience with, in developing this latest tank rather than starting entirely from scratch. With all this in mind, the vehicle that North Korea put on parade is most likely to reflect what the country envisions as a “future tank” and not what they are fielding as an operationally useful design today. All this being said, whatever its capabilities and performance, it is important to note that this new tank does highlight how North Korea’s heavy machinery industries have been able to continue their work, with or without foreign assistance, in the face of international sanctions , especially from the United States . Even if a final version of this tank turns out to be heavily based on technical information acquired abroad and is full of foreign-made systems, sourced legally or illicitly , that would underscore the ability of the regime in Pyongyang to obtain the resources necessary to continue expanding and advancing the technological capabilities of its war machine. North Korea is also known to be a relatively prolific arms exporter itself , in spite of the international community’s attempts to curtail this trade. This means that this new tank, or portions of its design, may one day find its way into the arsenal of other countries that cannot afford or otherwise acquire more modern designs on the open market. With North Korea itself calling these prototypes, it remains to be seen when, and if, they might actually enter any kind of widespread operational service and how capable those units would actually be when they roll off the production line. Still, they do show North Korea’s armor aspirations and the Hermit Kingdom has proven to be successful in rapidly developing new military capabilities under Kim Jong Un. So, what may be a collection of ideas and placeholders for future technologies today, could be an operational land combat vehicle in a few years’ time, in one form or another. The War Zone will definitely keep a close eye out for any new information that may come out now about Pyonyang’s new experimental main battle tanks.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 20, 2020",All The Ways The F-35 Tried To Kill Its Pilot Prior To Eglin AFB Crash,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The pilot of the U.S. Air Force F-35A stealth fighter that crashed at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida this past summer struggled with an extraordinary catalog of problems before he ejected from the jet. Though high-landing speed was determined to be the key culprit, issues with the pilot’s helmet, the aircraft’s oxygen system, and the software behind the jet’s fly-by-wire flight control system all contributed to the accident, according to a recently released official report. The F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron, the “Gorillas,” part of the 33rd Fighter Wing, crashed upon landing at the Florida base on May 19, 2020, after a routine night-training sortie. It was the second crash of a stealth fighter operating out of the base in less than a week, following the loss of an F-22 Raptor on May 15, and the two accidents led to a “safety pause” on flying operations at the base. In its conclusion to the report, the Accident Investigation Board President, Colonel Bryan T. Callahan, makes it clear that no fewer than six factors led to the loss of the F-35. The key factor to come out of the investigation was the fact that the pilot was attempting to land the Lightning II at an excessive speed. However, the tail was also unresponsive due to a problem with the flight-control logic that wasn’t widely known up to that point. There are other disturbing issues outlined in the final report, among them numerous errors made by the pilot — a qualified instructor who was flying as lead for the two-ship training sortie — in the run-up to the crash. The aviator was fatigued, in part due to issues with the jet’s “on-demand” oxygen system, leading to “cognitive degradation,” while a misaligned helmet-mounted display meant that he was distracted at a critical point, as well. After ejecting, the pilot sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to the 96th Medical Group Hospital for evaluation and monitoring. Weapons load crew from the 33rd Fighter Wing prepare an F-35A at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. AIR FORCE/SENIOR AIRMAN CASSIDY WOODY Exactly how the third F-35 crash unfolded is worth looking at in more detail, with a close examination of the accident report. At the controls of the F-35A in question, serial 12-005053, the mishap pilot (MP) maintained a steady speed of 202 knots on the approach — this was correct for this phase of flight, but would be a major contributor in the accident later on. Meanwhile, problems were beginning to make themselves known, distracting the pilot from the task at hand. First, the pilot noticed that his helmet-mounted display (HMD) seemed to be misaligned in relation to the horizon. The F-35 does not have a traditional fixed head-up display (HUD), as found on a typical legacy fighter, but instead projects that data directly onto the helmet’s visor. The Joint Strike Fighter has had issues in the past with its HMD, including with the alignment and clarity of the information presented. “The MP was fixated on the faulty symbology of the HMD at a critical phase of flight to the exclusion of a crosscheck of either AOA or airspeed,” the report noted. As well as the misalignment, the pilot was struggling with what seemed like excessive brightness, making it more difficult to focus. This was a result of the “green glow” phenomenon in the cockpit, created by the HMD’s projection brightness, and now made worse since it was combined with local humidity. “The [pilot] reported having to squint through the green glow in order to pick up on the environmental cues in the runway environment,” the report stated. After checking the virtual head-up display against data from the instrument landing system, he then adjusted his aim point and glideslope as the jet neared the runway threshold. A representation of an aligned HMD., U.S. AIR FORCE A misaligned HMD with left-to-right crosswind, “Green Glow,” and aim point in the “black abyss.”, U.S. AIR FORCE Available data indicated to the pilot that the fighter’s glide path was too high, and the jet’s attitude needed correcting, being too nose-down for a landing. In his efforts to correct this, the misaligned display readings became even more confusing. The accident report identified the HMD misalignment as the “critical confounding item that ultimately resulted in over-saturation” of the pilot. It records the fact that the pilot had previously experienced misalignment with the HMD, and maintainers had addressed these issues on the ground, but, without modifications, there was no way of checking alignment once in the aircraft. In addition, the pilot had never experienced this HMD error before at night, let alone during a critical stage of flight, such as a landing. Furthermore, the report reveals, “simulator profiles train F-35 crews to fly HMD-out approaches, but do not emphasize HMD-misaligned approaches.” The report also notes that the onboard oxygen system in the F-35 differs from those used in other Air Force jets, meaning that “many pilots across the F-35 platform […] report feeling more fatigued than normal, when compared to their prior legacy aircraft.” When asked by investigators to rate his level of mental fatigue on a scale of one to ten, the pilot reported “a four out of ten” on a routine basis, but on the night of the mishap he reported a “six out of ten.” The report also raised the issue of emerging research into an F-35A physiological consideration called “work of breathing” — the physiological toll taken on a pilot’s cognitive capacities as a result of breathing through the jet’s unique oxygen system. These facts, specifically highlighted by the accident investigation board, are worrying, especially given the number of U.S. military aircraft incidents in recent years that have been connected in one way or another to oxygen systems . The pilot maintained the same speed throughout the approach and landing, meaning the jet touched down on Eglin’s runway 30 around 50 knots faster than normal. At the same time, when it touched down, the jet was approximately eight degrees shallower than it should have been — an angle of attack of 5.2 degrees. The incorrect landing attitude as seen through the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System (DAS)., U.S. AIR FORCE While a speed of 202 knots was appropriate for the approach to the airfield, the pilot should have disengaged the speed hold, reducing velocity for the landing. Leaving the speed hold engaged was a prohibited maneuver, although there are no “audible warnings” that this was dangerous. As the jet continued down the runway at this higher than approved speed, the pilot had to push the stick forward to bring the jet’s nose down, which had the result of what was almost a three-point landing — when the wheels on all three landing gear legs touch down simultaneously. The nose gear, which would normally be the last to contact the ground runway, now bounced, throwing the F-35’s nose up violently. As the pilot attempted to push the stick forward again in an effort to bring the fighter to a stop, the pitch oscillations became “increasingly violent.” A rapid succession of stick movements from the pilot then followed, in an effort to recover and set a landing attitude. As the report states, “the MP’s stick inputs quickly fell out of synch with the aircraft pitch oscillations and aircraft control cycles.” These multiple inputs overburdened the jet’s computerized flight-control system in which a glitch subsequently meant that the trailing edges of the horizontal stabilizers were deflected down and locked, which in turn pushed the nose down. When questioned, neither the mishap pilot nor other experienced F-35 instructor or test pilots were familiar with “some of the details of the control logic,” the report explained. It also highlighted how the complexity of the jet’s flight-control logic is such that it’s impossible to train pilots on every possible scenario. “F-35A simulator models do not accurately represent the aircraft flight dynamics seen in this scenario,” it stated. Furthermore, the simulator allows for high-speed landings and the aircraft can be consistently recovered in the simulator, even after bouncing. At least two members of the accident investigation team were able to successfully land the jet in the simulator when replicating the speed and attitude of the Eglin mishap. You can read all about the extremely complex software and subsystems that make-up fly-by-wire flight control systems and how the pilot is just a voting member of those systems in this War Zone article. USAF The pilot’s final effort to recover the jet saw him hold the stick aft, which would normally bring the nose back up, and then select full afterburner on the jet’s F135 engine in an attempt to abort the landing and get back in the air for another landing attempt. Take-off, however, was made impossible by the fully deflected stabilizers, which kept the nose down. Only five seconds passed between when the tires hit the tarmac and the pilot’s ejection, which he initiated as the aircraft continued to bounce down the runway. The jet, which the accident report valued at $175,983,949, “rolled, caught fire, and was completely destroyed,” leaving debris strewn across the runway, making it a Class A accident, the most severe category. Class A mishaps involve incidents that result in more than $2 million in damage, a fatality or a permanently disabled servicemember, or any combination thereof. A 33rd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron crew chief marshals an F-35A at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. AIR FORCE/STAFF SGT. PETER THOMPSON We often hear a lot about how the F-35 is an easier aircraft to fly than previous-generation fighters. One test pilot went as far as to say it was “the easiest aircraft I’ve ever flown in my life.” Comments from the pilot involved in the May 19, 2020, accident present a different picture. The aviator reflected that he was not only fatigued at the time of the crash, and had been suffering increasingly poor sleep, but also that he found the F-35 to be significantly more tiring to operate than his previous aircraft, the F-15E Strike Eagle. In an interview for Air & Space Magazine , one F-15E-turned-F-35 pilot provides an interesting comparison between flying the two jets. “The transition from a fourth-gen fighter to a fifth-gen fighter was like learning how to drive an automatic car from a manual. The F-35 actually handles a lot like the F-15E, with the difference being, the F-35 is a high angle-of-attack fighter with advanced control logic. Those of us not used to low-speed, high-AOA performance from our previous aircraft must practice and adapt to those flight regimes.” The accident report also notes that the pilot had additional tangential distractions on his mind that added to the here-and-now worry about the HMD. A day earlier, for example, the pilot was notified of exposure to the COVID-19 virus and was awaiting a colleague’s test results to determine his susceptibility. In the report, the pilot notes other more immediate distractions too, including a poorly lit runway area that meant he had to “point into the black abyss” to get his jet back onto the runway. At the same time, this was compounded by the aforementioned green glow issue. For all the advances that it brings with it, the F-35 program has presented its fair share of challenges and its path to the front line has been anything but smooth. The loss of this example from the 58th Fighter Squadron last summer is a reminder of the complexities inherent in the jet — and the fact that flying fast jets will always involve a degree of risk. The cold reality is that automation and technological advances that make tactical aircraft easier to fly also make them harder to fully understand and to operate effectively when things all don’t work perfectly as advertised. An over-reliance on simulators for training has its compounding pitfalls, as well, just as fleet pilots have warned of . This is especially true when those simulators inadequately reflect what would actually happen in the air, as was the case in this mishap. When it comes to manned tactical aviation, experience in the cockpit remains absolutely essential, especially when flying an aircraft that we are still trying to understand nearly a decade and a half after it first took to the skies.

"Joseph Trevithick, Thomas Newdick, Tyler Rogoway","Posted on Mar 23, 2024",Boom Rolls Out Its XB-1 “Baby Boom” Supersonic Demonstrator Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boom Supersonic has officially unveiled its XB-1 supersonic demonstrator aircraft, which has also been referred to as the “Baby Boom.” The company plans to begin flying the jet next year as part of work on a larger, 55-seat supersonic airliner design known as Overture. The Colorado-headquartered aviation firm rolled out the XB-1 , which carries the U.S. civil registration code N990XB, in a virtual event due to the COVID-19 pandemic on Oct. 7, 2020. The company first said it was developing this demonstrator in November 2016, some eight months after announcing its plans for Overture . “Boom continues to make progress towards our founding mission—making the world dramatically more accessible,” Blake Scholl, Boom founder and CEO, said in a press release . “XB-1 is an important milestone towards the development of our commercial airliner, Overture, making sustainable supersonic flight mainstream and fostering human connection.” A video of the full rollout enter can be found below: The 71-foot long XB-1 features an elongated delta-wing planform with a wingspan of 17 feet that “balances low-speed stability at takeoff and landing with high-speed efficiency,” according to Boom’s press release. The aircraft makes heavy use of carbon-composite materials in its construction, which will maintain their “strength and rigidity, even under the high temperatures and stresses of supersonic flight.” The demonstrator is meant to be a one-third-scale prototype of the future Overture airliner. Three General Electric J85-15 turbojets, providing more than 12,000 pounds of thrust, in total, will power the jet, which is expected to have a top speed of around Mach 2.2. These engines are variants of the same engine used in the U.S. Air Force’s T-38 Talon jet trainer , among other aircraft. Boom also says that aircraft has “one of the highest-efficiency civil supersonic engine intakes ever tested” to go along with these powerplants. Boom Supersonic The intakes, along with the exhausts, reportedly have variable geometry. This could contribute to Boom’s claim that the final Overture airliner could be “30 times quieter than Concorde .” The aircraft’s advanced aerodynamic shape will also impact the kinds of sonic booms it produces and how those are perceived by individuals on the ground. Overall, the XB-1 has a very long and slender shape to its fuselage, as have most supersonic commercial aircraft designs historically. Its long nose presents a real obstruction to the pilot’s vision, which other designs, such as the Anglo-French Concorde, got around by using a complex forward section that physically “drooped” down during landing. The Baby Boom will have an advanced x-ray-like remote vision system that will allow the pilot to “see” through the nose, a concept that Lockheed Martin is also employing on its X-59 Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) testbed that it is building for NASA. Boom hopes to make waves in the air travel sector with Overture, which could also have a top speed of Mach 2.2 and a cruising speed of just under Mach 2. With an expected maximum range of 4,500 nautical miles, the company says it has identified more than 500 viable commercial routes , including runs between New York and London, which the Concorde also famously flew. The noise pollution caused by sonic booms is still an issue, as it was with Concorde, so the company envisions the aircraft traveling at subsonic speeds over populated landmasses. The trick will be ensuring that Overture is low-cost and reliable enough to make it a practical alternative to existing subsonic airliners. “On an available premium-seat-mile basis, Overture is meaningfully less costly to operate than subsonic widebody aircraft,” Boom’s website says, but does not give a hard cost per flight hour to operate the aircraft. Boom does state that they are targeting a seat cost to be around that of a business class international ticket on existing airliners. An artist’s conception of Boom’s Overture airliner., Boom Supersonic Boom says that the airliner has a projected unit cost of around $200 million each, not including a customer’s desired interior configuration and other unspecified optional extras. This would make it cheaper than many subsonic widebody airliners now on the market, but those aircraft can also carry substantially more passengers. For example, in 2018, Airbus said that the average price of one of its popular A330-200s was approximately $238.5 million, but that aircraft has a maximum seating capacity of 406, nearly four times that of Overture as presently planned. Boeing says that the average price of one of its 767-300ER airliners is around $217.9 million, but again, those planes can seat nearly 300 passengers, depending on the internal configuration. There has already been not insubstantial interest in the Overture, though, with Boom saying it has commitments to buy up to 76 of the jets from five airlines, including Virgin and Japan Airlines (JAL). Virgin Group has been a major investor in Boom for years now, as well. The Spaceship Company, a Virgin Galactic subsidiary, was previously reported to be preparing to assist in building and testing the airliners. In all reality, the private jet market could draw huge demand for an aircraft like Overture. For someone who has everything, or big businesses where time is literally money, buying back some of that time through faster air travel is already the norm, not the exception. Going from transonic cruise to over Mach 2 is one heck of a proposition. Even though Boom’s price tag is over twice that of the most capable business jets, it won’t stop many from pursuing it that have the means. An aircraft like this is also positioned to become the ultimate status symbol. Supersonic airliner-type aircraft could have military applications, as well, as The War Zone explored in depth when discussing the Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet, a potential competitor in this space for Boom. In September, Boom actually received a contract from the U.S. Air Force, in part to explore supersonic executive transport aircraft concepts. That service also recently hired hypersonic aerospace startup Hermeus Corporation and Exosonic , another aviation firm focused on supersonic aircraft development, to conduct similar work. An artist’s conception of a Boom Supersonic Overture in US Air Force service, painted in the same scheme as its existing 747-based VC-25A Air Force One aircraft, as a supersonic executive jet., Boom Supersonic Boom has previously announced an ambitious timeline for testing the XB-1 and the continued development of the Overture. The goal now is to complete ground testing of the Baby Boom demonstrator and then begin flight tests next year. In 2022, the company hopes to have completed construction of a new manufacturing plant for the Overture, which will then roll out the first of those airliners three years later. There have already been some delays with both the XB-1 and Overture programs. Boom had hoped to begin flight testing of the XB-1 before the end of this year, but pushed that back to make improvements to the aircraft’s stability augmentation system to improve safety margins for landing and taking off at high speeds. As of 2017, the plan had been for the first Overture airliner to enter service in 2023. Still, with the XB-1 demonstrator now complete, it will definitely be exciting to see how testing progresses in the months ahead.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 30, 2020",Everything We Just Learned About The Navy’s Dubious Path To A 500 Ship Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has revealed new details about extremely ambitious plans to increase the size of the U.S. Navy’s fleets to more than 500 ships and submarines, including unmanned types , within the next 25 years. He also offered some specifics about how the Pentagon hopes to pay for this dramatic increase in force structure, including a significant increase in the Navy’s base budget starting as early as the next Fiscal Year. Esper provided the new information on what is now being called Battle Force 2045 in a virtual talk he gave from the offices of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) think tank in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 6, 2020. Some details about the Navy’s future force structure and shipbuilding plans had already emerged in September, which you can read about in more detail in this recent War Zone piece . The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has been working for months to help shape the plans for the Navy’s force structure in the decades to come. OSD’s Battle Force 2045 proposal incorporates recommendations from studies that the Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Hudson Institute think tank conducted. A full look at the plan is expected to be publicly released next Spring as part of the formal 2022 Fiscal Year defense budget request. As of early 2020, the Navy had around 293 ships . There is also a Congressionally mandated goal of a fleet with at least 355 ships . However, Esper has now said that the Battle Force 2045 structure will call for a total naval force with more than 500 ships, including between eight and 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, 60 to 70 small surface combatants, 70 and 80 attack submarines, 50 to 60 amphibious warfare ships, and 70 to 90 logistics ships. This is broadly in line with draft proposals from CAPE and the Hudson Institute. USN Both of those studies described a Navy with nine aircraft carriers. The force structures CAPE and Hudson included 70 and 56 small surface combatants, respectively, and both called for an increase in the size of the service’s submarine force, which presently has 55 boats, in total. Those proposals also called for between 15 and 19 traditional amphibious warfare ships, such as amphibious assault ships and dock landing ships , and 20 to 26 of a new class of Light Amphibious Warships (LAW) that the Navy and Marine Corps are already exploring. These studies included significant increases in logistics and other support vessels, as well. The carrier figures are particularly interesting given that the Navy has 11 flattops right now – the 10 Nimitz class ships and the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford – and anything less would represent a cut in the total number of these vessels. Congress has also stipulated that the service always be working toward having at least 12 operational carriers . The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman , at rear, sails with the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , in the foreground., USN Esper added that the Navy would “continue to examine options for light carriers that support short-takeoff or vertical landing aircraft” and that the service could ultimately aquire up to six such ships, which could be based on the aviation-focused America class amphibious assault ship design. This is notable given that the Navy had publicly said that it had deferred a study of light carrier concepts indefinitely in May. This could also simply involve using the existing Americas , as well as other amphibious assault ships, as small “ Lightning Carriers ” with larger than average compliments of U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, a concept the Navy and Marines have already been exploring . The Secretary of Defense did not offer details about what might be included in the “small surface combatant” category, but presently the Navy’s only ships meeting this description are the Freedom and Independence classes of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The service is working to acquire a new class of guided-missile frigates, presently referred to as FFG(X), which will be based on from Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri’s European Multi-Purpose Frigate design , also commonly referred to simply by the Franco-Italian acronym FREMM. The USS Freedom , at rear, and the USS Independence , the lead ships of the two LCS subclasses., USN When it comes to submarines, Esper said that the increase in the total number of boats will come from extending the life of seven Los Angeles class attack submarines by refueling their nuclear reactors, as well as the development of a new type of advanced attack submarine, known presently as the SSN(X) . The Navy has said that it is looking to acquiring something akin to the advanced Seawolf class design under this latter program. In addition, the Secretary of Defense reiterated the service’s previously established goal of increasing production of the more multi-mission-focused Virginia class attack submarine from two boats per year to three. “If we do nothing else, the Navy must begin building three Virginia class submarines a year as soon as possible,” Esper said. The Virginia class attack submarine USS Minnesota while under construction., USN These increases in traditional vessels offer a “credible path” to the 355 ship goal, according to Esper. However, to get the total size of the Battle Force up to over 500 will require the inclusion of between 140 and 240 unmanned surface and undersea vehicles in that total, something the Navy does not presently do. The growing importance of unmanned platforms to the service’s future plans, which you can read about in these previous War Zone pieces , has already prompted calls from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to add them to the official fleet totals for both current accounting and future planning purposes. To make all this work, Esper said that the plan is to increase the percentage of the Navy’s overall budget set aside for shipbuilding to 13 percent. In the 2020 Fiscal Year, the money for ships accounted for just over 11.5 percent of the service’s approved budget from Congress. This dropped to less than 10 percent in the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request. Legislators have yet to pass a budget for this fiscal cycle, which began on Oct. 1. A summary of the Navy’s approved budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year compared to its request for the 2021 Fiscal Year., USN This 13 percent figure had first emerged last month in a print version of a speech Esper gave at the Rand think tank. However, the actual speech did not include this figure, raising questions about whether or not it was accurate. As Defense News reported at the time , even a two percent increase in shipbuilding funds over the 2021 Fiscal Year budget request would translate to more than $4 billion extra dollars to buy more ships. In his latest remarks on this topic from CSBA’s offices, Esper also called on Congress to approve getting rid of older ships and to grant the Pentagon authority to transfer unused funds straight to shipbuilding accounts without the need for specific authorization. He also issued an appeal to legislators to pass the 2021 Fiscal Year budget without delay and avoid relying on short-term spending bills, commonly known as Continuing Resolutions , which make long-term planning difficult. As was the case after the initial details about the Navy’s future plans for a fleet of more than 500 ships first emerged, it remains very much to be seen whether this proposal will become a reality. Congress has been notably reticent to the idea of including unmanned platforms in the Battle Force totals, or even just building them at all, and routinely resists proposals to retire existing warships, or otherwise trim back their expected service life, to free up funds to buy newer ones. With this in mind, extending the life of existing warships had been part of the Navy’s plans to reach the existing 355-ship goal as recently as last year . Available shipyard capacity to build new ships and submarines, as well as maintain a growing fleet, remains very much an issue, as well. The shift from building one Virginia class submarine each year to two notably caused strain on the yards where those boats are built, at least initially, raising questions about what might happen when production increases to three annually. Those are also the same yards that will also be needed to construct the Navy’s future Columbia class ballistic missile submarines. An artist’s conception of the future first-in-class USS Columbia ., USN If nothing else, there is also a basic cost question. Esper indicated that at least some of the increased shipbuilding funds could come from savings the Pentagon has found elsewhere in the budget, but again canceling or scaling back other projects or retiring older weapon systems across the U.S. military will require the consent of Congress. In addition, there’s no guarantee, especially in the midst of a major recession in the United States and global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic , that defense spending will continue to rise in a way that will support a major increase in the size of the Navy’s Battle Force. In fact, there’s evidence already that it could well be headed in the opposite direction . Sustaining such a naval force will require major additional funding, as well. One estimate from the Congressional Budget Office regarding a plan the Navy released last year to reach a 355-ship fleet pegged the annual cost of just operating and maintaining all of those vessels at $40 billion. For context, the Navy’s total “O&M” budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year was $68 billion and the portion set aside specifically for ship operations was $19.7 billion. All told, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Navy seem to be intent on setting a goal of having a total fleet with more than 500 ships in the coming decades. However, from everything we know so far, there are serious hurdles they will need to overcome first in getting anywhere near to realizing their vision.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 29, 2020",Here’s Who’s Bought Those Retired Singapore Air Force KC-135R Tankers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Meta Aerospace has revealed that it is the buyer of four former Republic of Singapore Air Force KC-135R Stratotankers , which it says will provide private aerial refueling services to the U.S. military. This makes it only the second commercial firm to acquire boom-equipped tankers, the first being Omega Air Refueling . FlightGlobal was first to confirm that the defense contractor, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C., had acquired the quartet of ex-Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) KC-135Rs, that the service retired last year. The first of these aircraft, which now carries the U.S. civil registration code N573MA, is now at March Air Reserve Base, an Air Force Reserve base in California, after having left Singapore earlier this week. The company said that it expects the other three aircraft to touch down in the United States by the end of November. N573MA, one of the ex-RSAF KC-135Rs, leaves Singapore’s Changi International Airport earlier this week., Hans Jacobs “With its extensive defence-as-a-service offerings and air mobility experience, this addition of four KC-135R aircraft enables Meta to deliver turnkey aerial refuelling services to meet our US government customer’s requirements,” the firm told FlightGlobal . Meta’s website also says that it “delivers turnkey air-to-air refueling (AAR) solutions to meet defense customers’ under-resourced refueling requirements.” In addition, the Meta Aerospace site says that it has partnered in its private aerial refueling endeavors with Consolidated Air Support Systems (CASS), another aerospace contractor headquartered in Temecula, California. CASS’ Allied Defense Services International (ADSI) division provides tanker-related training services, among others, to various air forces. Posts on Twitter had indicated that CASS-ADSI had posted job listings looking for boom operators recently on Linkedin, but there do not appear to be any active job listings on that site for that company at the time of writing. Meta Aerospace’s purchase of these four KC-135Rs comes as U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), by way of the U.S. Air Force, continues to explore options for hiring private contractors to provide aerial refueling support for non-combat activities, including test and evaluation, training, and general long-distance movement of aircraft, especially fighter jets, from one location to another. Having companies fly tankers acquired on the foreign surplus market is one of five options the Air Force previously identified in a report to Congress, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Omega Air has already been providing non-combat tanker support to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps since 2001, but the bulk of its fleet is configured to support aircraft that use the probe-and-drogue refueling method, which those services, among others, use. The Air Force primarily uses the boom refueling method and TRANSCOM will need to hire firms operating these types of tankers if it hopes to provide these services across the U.S. military, as a whole. The ex-RSAF KC-135Rs do also have underwing probe-and-drogue refueling pods, which could make them more flexible in meeting the command’s requirements, as well. As it stands now, TRANSCOM, through the Air Force, is eventually expecting to award contracts to one or more companies to provide up 5,000 flight hours of aerial refueling support each year. Previous draft contracting documents have suggested that this number could grow to 10,000 flight hours . The Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC) has also said there are 25,000 “non-supported flying hours” when it comes to tanking requirements just for test and training activities, according to Air Force Magazine . The strain on the Air Force’s own tanker fleets could grow further in the near term as the service looks to retire its older KC-135Rs and KC-10A Extenders . Delays and difficulties with the new KC-46A Pegasus , especially its Remote Vision System (RVS) that the aircraft’s boom operators use to link up with receiving aircraft, may further exacerbate these issues, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . An Air Force KC-10A Extender refuels a KC-46A Pegasus, while a KC-135R Stratotanker flies in the foreground., USAF Boeing, the KC-46A’s manufacturer, is in the process of overhauling the design of the RVS entirely. The Air Force has said it will not use these tankers for day-to-day refueling missions, even in many non-combat roles, until that system is fixed. Quality control also remains a major issue with the KC-46As. Just today, a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing revealed that the delivery of a Pegasus to the New Hampshire Air National Guard’s 157th Air Refueling Wing was halted due to an electrical issue, that Boeing is now working to fix. The company has also had to stop deliveries of KC-46As on multiple occasions in recent years due to the repeated discovery of foreign object debris in completed aircraft. All told, competition for what look set to be lucrative private aerial refueling deals with the U.S. military appears to be heating up with Meta Aerospace and CASS-ADSI joining the still very small ranks of companies operating boom-equipped tankers. Special thanks again to Hans Jacobs for sharing his awesome pictures of N573MA leaving Singapore with us.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 2, 2020",Kim Jong Un Just Showed The World The War Machine He Built While Feinting Diplomacy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Saturday, October 10th, 2020, North Korea put on its first publicized military parade in years. Taking place at night in and over a revamped Kim Il Sung Square and celebrating the 75th anniversary of the country’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, the spectacle was unlike any we have seen before. It represented an almost laughable, but terrifying juxtaposition of perceptions. For a country that is supposedly reeling from years of sanctions, with its dire economic situation only made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, what was displayed was entirely the opposite. A dizzying array of new advanced weaponry was unveiled to the world, more than we have ever seen before. Even the perception of North Korea as a dark country as a result of never-ending energy deficits was slashed with bright and colorful lights, including warplanes zooming overhead decorated with neon-colors. All this has come after years of Kim feinting a new era of diplomacy to his gullible adversaries who have become drunk on wishful thinking. It cannot be underestimated what we just saw. Many will say that it is all for show— some of it is—but the realities of recent history run quite counter to the assumption that the weapons shown are hollow effigies of the real McCoy. In fact, such a view has become laughably dated and downright inaccurate. When it comes to weapons development, under the Kim Jung Un regime, the proof has very much been in the pudding. The level of candor regarding his military technology ambitions has been striking in its honesty and accuracy. Those who chronically underestimated North Korea are living in the past. The Hermit Kingdom has proven to be amazingly resourceful under Kim Jong Un and has delivered capabilities many hung their careers on claiming could only be obtained far in the future. This is something The War Zone warned about years ago , and we were proven to be all too correct, unfortunately. NK State Media Screencap Let’s get to what was shown. We need to start with the two big strategic developments. A handful of absolutely massive new intercontinental ballistic missiles were rolled through Kim Il Sung Square. This would be the third iteration of the ICBM concept for the North Koreans, having already unveiled and tested the Hwasong HS-14 and HS-15 in 2017 . This new missile looks to be a significant outgrowth of the already monstrous HS-15, which is suspected of being able to reach pretty much anywhere in the United States, although its terminal delivery capabilities remain a puzzle, as is the case for the HS-14 and other longer-range ballistic missiles in Pyongyang’s arsenal that are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. It isn’t clear if this is just a longer-ranged, more advanced evolution of the prior design, or if this is intended to deliver a heavier payload, as well, namely multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) . NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap Beyond this new weapon’s capabilities, the biggest question is where did North Korea get the transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) to haul around such a giant ICBM. The previous TEL for the HS-15 had nine axles, this one has 11. The previous TEL is thought to have been acquired from China and modified. It isn’t clear if these have a similar chain of custody or if North Korea is actually manufacturing its own massive TELs now, which almost seems likely at this point if this is missile it wants to produce going forward. There is the question of just how mobile an 11 axle TEL carrying this wide of a missile really is. These would likely be used to roll out of hardened and hidden shelters to predetermined firing points that don’t have obstacles that could block their path. In other words, they wouldn’t just roam freely. Although we need a bit more time to research it to claim this unequivocally, we do believe this is one of, if not the largest road-mobile liquid-fueled missiles on earth. All of the other Hwasong series missiles have been liquid-fueled, but it is possible that this is a hybrid missile, with a top stage being solid fuel, as well. North Korea has made considerable advances in solid fuel rocket propulsion in recent years. The strategic implications of this weapon are large for a number of reasons. Its existence points to a need for flight testing, which could see those types of provocative activities return to our reality. More than that, they underscore just how hard North Korea has continued to work on its strategic programs long after a new era in diplomacy was declared. Nearly three years is a long time. This is a manifestation of what they have been up to while the love affair between Trump and Kim has been ongoing even though the regime has never shown one iota of intention of giving up its nuclear stockpile or the delivery systems that underpin it. Arguably just as impactful as the new ICBM is the reveal of the Pukguksong-4 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The inclusion of these weapons is another indication that North Korea has shifted considerable resources to developing some type of submarine-borne second-strike deterrent . We have seen the reworked Soviet-era sub they are adapting for this role, at least as an interim solution, and the country has tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile during this period of diplomatic detente. NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap It’s also worth noting that the solid fuel Pukguksong-2 SLBM was supposedly adapted to create the KN-15 road-mobile short to medium-range ballistic missile. There is no reason to think they won’t adapt this more advanced variant to a ground-launched form, also. Solid fuel ballistic missiles are far harder to counter prior to launch as they take no time to fuel before being fired. The KN-15 was also on display during the parade. NK State Media Screencap Developments on the tactical side of North Korea’s missile equation are just as stunning. North Korea paraded a host of its new generation of very large rocket artillery systems. These border on the tactical ballistic missile definition, to some degree, and are meant to rain warheads down deep inside South Korean territory during the opening stages of a conflict. North Korea’s rapid development and fielding of these jumbo rocket artillery systems have changed the risk equation for South Korea. Whereas areas not too far from the DMZ, including part of Seoul, were at risk of artillery bombardment in the past, that zone now pushes far deeper to the south as a result of these systems, all of which are new or developed relatively recently. These systems are also less costly and challenging for North Korea to build compared to their strategic counterparts, so serial production can be realized on a far greater scale. While capabilities range in relation to size, up to a supersized ATCMs-like a quasi-ballistic missile, to 600mm guided rockets, to smaller diameter, long-range artillery rockets, the message is clear: the game has changed when it comes to the threat posed by North Korean artillery. NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap KCNA As with the TEL for the new ICBM, it’s also interesting to note how many different tracked and wheeled chassis North Korea is using for these rocket artillery systems and tactical ballistic missiles. If these are domestically-produced designs, it could further speak to a significant of the country’s automotive and heavy machinery industries. North Korea also showed off some new air defense systems, including one that appears to be built for point defense and similar to the Russian Tor system . Larger S-300-like missile TELs were also present, likely related to the KN-06 family of SAM s. Modernization of North Korea’s air defense systems has been elevated in recent years at it remains one of the country’s weakest military capability sets. As it sits now, North Korea is highly vulnerable to enemy air operations. The U.S. and South Korea train daily on how to quickly dismantle what exists of the North Korean air defense network, but the advent of new indigenous systems complicates those war plans, at least to some degree. NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap Now to armor. North Korea really stunned in this regard, unveiling a number of new armored vehicles, the most impressive of which is a brand new main battle tank. As you can see, the design is quite modern in outward appearance, with integrated systems embedded into its design, not just tacked on after the fact. These including anti-tank missile launchers mounted on the sides of the turret. The tank alone is worth its own analysis piece. It is quite remarkable North Korea was able to come up with this, although what chassis and drivetrain lie beneath its skin is a big question. NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap Another unveil was this wheeled armored vehicle that appears to feature an eight-round loitering munition launcher. This type of weapon is changing the battlefield as it can fly out to a target area, briefly surveil it, and then strike a target of opportunity with pinpoint precision. Israel largely pioneered this technology with their Spike NLOS series of weapons. North Korea seems to have taken note. Such a system is extremely relevant for combat operations along the DMZ. NK State Media Screencap An 8×8 wheeled mobile gun system also made an appearance. This is an entirely new capability for North Korea and allows for higher-speed mobility for a large direct-fire weapon compared to its tracked counterparts. Similar arrangements have become popular around the world, including in the U.S. with the M1128 Stryker Mobile Gun System. NK State Media Screencap There is also an 8×8 armored vehicle that is designed to host anti-tank guided missiles , which is new. The two together would provide a highly agile anti-armor capability. NK State Media Screencap North Korean soldiers themselves have received a number of new uniforms, many of them modernized to including digital camouflage, such as this caped look: NK State Media Screencap We also got to see these guys in what appear to be hybrid ghillie suits. NK State Media Screencap North Korean chemical weapons troops looking ripped right from a dystopian science fiction movie. NK State Media Screencap The black-clad troops appear to be some sort of federal unit. NK State Media Screencap North Korean special operations forces are seen here with suppressors and more modern accouterments. NK State Media Screencap As always, North Korea’s massive helical ammunition magazines were on full display, now serving with multiple units. NK State Media Screencap The aerial side was especially unique. Although nothing new was displayed, the North Korean Air Force equipped its most modern aircraft with LED lights to make them glow and did massive flare dumps over the square. NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap NK State Media Screencap The two main tactical types that took part in the display were the MiG-29 and Su-25, but what has to be underlined here is that we saw seven MiG-29s flying at one time. That may sound comical, but the reality is that North Korea’s MiG-29s, which are decades old as it is, are a highly limited resource for the North Korean Air Force. They are primarily tasked with protecting Pyongyang and depending on the source, anywhere from a dozen to two dozen are still anywhere near to flying form, with only a fraction of those being actually mission capable at any given time. The most we have ever seen in the air at one time was six , so even the addition of one airframe is worth noting. The aerial display itself was quite remarkable. Incorporating LED light strips on combat aircraft is not an established practice. It may seem easy, but it really isn’t. Securing them in such a way that they won’t damage the aircraft if they come loose, especially considering how few of these planes North Korea has, would have been a critical task. The production of the flying segment, with the video leading up to it and in the air, likely filmed during previous practice flights and then cut into the performance, was remarkably high-grade. NK State Media Screencap There was much more to see, including many tears and longing looks of admiration from the troops, attending officials, and the crow towards Kim Jong Un. Many existing systems also made an appearance, BM-25 Musudan ballistic missiles, anti-ship coastal defense systems , and others. One that puzzled us was this TEL with elongated tubes. Is this a new long-range anti-ship or land-attack cruise missile system, some type of long-range SAM? We don’t know at this time. NK State Media Screencap While some will argue that we don’t know how many of these systems North Korea actually has, that really isn’t the point. They have developed these new capabilities at considerable cost. There is little reason to do that beyond some abstract propaganda value, without having at least some intention into putting it into larger production to some degree, or at least learning from its development and testing. The truth is this kind of debate is antiquated. As we mentioned earlier, North Korea under Kim Jong Un has been far more straight forward with its military technology ambitions than in the past. The ballistic missiles displayed in recent years have proven to be real. By and large, the ground vehicles have, as well. With this in mind, it is somewhat astonishing to see just how far the country has gotten when it comes to conventional modernization and new strategic capabilities under such extreme circumstances. https://youtube.com/watch?v=v4cGa7arCuQ Even putting on this scale of display alone, a remarkable investment in resources during especially challenging economic times, says a lot. While the citizens of North Korea are suffering, Kim’s military apparatus appears to be thriving. And even though the testing of long-range ballistic missiles may have subsided during this hollow excursion into detente between North Korea, the United States, and South Korea, the regime has only accelerated further development of its strategic systems and refined its ability to manufacture them in a serial nature. These kinds of displays of military might are often a vision of where North Korea wants to be in the near term. Kim knows full well that the second the U.S. comes to its senses, either by a change in Presidents through the election or if Trump finally sours to Kim’s ridiculous platitudes, his country will have a far more mature strategic arsenal to deploy and test, as well as an updated conventional one. Unsurprisingly, it looks more and more like this was the plan all along.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2020",Here’s The Full List Of Kit Offered To Finland If It Chooses F-35 Or Super Hornet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department of Defense has announced details of two U.S. offers for Finland’s ongoing HX fighter competition. The first is for the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II , while the second is a two-type package for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler . The Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued notices that the U.S. State Department had approved the pair of potential Foreign Military Sales packages on Oct. 9, 2020. This does not mean that Finland has accepted either offer. The two U.S. manufacturers are among the five firms participating in the HX competition, which aims to replace the Finnish Air Force’s (Ilmavoimat’s) current fleet of upgraded F/A-18C/D ‘legacy’ Hornets — 55 single-seaters and seven two-seaters — by 2030. Helsinki will make a final decision between these proposals, as well as offers from three European plane-makers: France’s Dassault, with the Rafale ; the multinational Eurofighter consortium, offering the Typhoon , in a bid led by the United Kingdom; and Sweden, with the Saab JAS 39E/F Gripen . The Saab offering also includes the same company’s GlobalEye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft. It’s noteworthy that of the two American offers, that from Boeing exceeds the 10-billion-Euro price cap (approximately $12.8 billion) that Finland has placed on the HX tender, but Foreign Military Sales packages of these kinds can include more ancillary items and services than the recipient might eventually procure. That the HX program is central to Finnish defense planning was made clear in August 2020, when it was announced that the 2021 budget proposal for the Finnish Ministry of Defence would amount to 4.87 billion Euros, or 54% more than the current budget, despite the fiscal uncertainties raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The increase is to a large extent due to the funding proposed to procure multirole fighters,” the Ministry of Defence confirmed . A Finnish Air Force F/A-18C tops up from a U.S. Air Force KC-135R Stratotanker during the BALTOPS 2020 exercise., U.S. AIR FORCE The F-35 package for Finland has a total estimated cost of $12.5 billion and is based around the supply of 64 conventional take-off and landing F-35A variants. Also included are the following air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground precision-guided munitions, subsystems, and components: Sixty-six (66) Pratt & Whitney F-135 engines (64 installed and 2 spares); five hundred (500) GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) All-Up Round (AUR); twelve (12) GBU-53/B SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV); twelve (12) GBU-53/B SDB II Captive Carry Vehicles (CCV); one hundred fifty (150) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II+ (Plus) Tactical Missiles; thirty-two (32) Sidewinder AIM-9X Block II+ (Plus) Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs); thirty (30) AIM-9X Block II+ (Plus) Sidewinder Tactical Guidance Units; eight (8) AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder CATM Guidance Units; one hundred (100) AGM-154C-1 Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW-C1) Tactical Missiles; two hundred (200) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) AGM-158B-2 Missiles; two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM-ER Separation Test Vehicles; two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM-ER Instrumented Test Vehicles; two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM-ER Jettison Test Vehicles; two (2) AGM-158B-2 Inert JASSM w/Intelligent Telemetry Instrumentation Kits; two (2) AGM-158 Dummy Air Training Missiles; one hundred twenty (120) KMU-556 JDAM Guidance Kits for GBU-31; three hundred (300) FMU-139D/B Fuzes; two (2) KMU-556(D-2)/B Trainer JDAM Guidance Kits for GBU-31; thirty (30) KMU-557 JDAM Guidance Kits for GBU-31; one hundred fifty (150) KMU-572 JDAM Guidance Kits for GBU-38/54; one hundred twenty (120) BLU-117, General Purpose Bombs; thirty-two (32) BLU-109, General Purpose Bomb; one hundred fifty (150) BLU-111, General Purpose Bomb; six (6) MK-82, Inert Bomb; one (1) FMU-139D/B (D-1) Inert Fuze. Perhaps surprisingly, no AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles are included, although the Finnish Air Force is already well-stocked with these weapons, having ordered additional examples as part of the Mid-Life Upgrade 2 (MLU 2) for the Hornet fleet, that was undertaken between 2012 and 2016. Other weapons found in this proposed sale that were added the Hornets as part of MLU 2 effort are the JDAM, JSOW, and JASSM . An F-35A from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, on the flight line at Dover AFB, Delaware, on February 18, 2020, after returning from participating in the HX Challenge., U.S. AIR FORCE/SENIOR AIRMAN CHRISTOPHER QUAIL Also included in the complete package are: Electronic Warfare Systems; Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence/Communications, Navigational, and Identification (C4I/CNI); Autonomic Logistics Global Support System (ALGS); Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN); Air System Training Devices; Weapons Employment Capability and other Subsystems, Features, and Capabilities; F-35 unique infrared flares; reprogramming center access; F-35 Performance Based Logistics; software development/integration; aircraft ferry and tanker support; Detector Laser DSU-38A/B, Detector Laser DSU-38A(D-2)/B, KMU-572(D-2)/B Trainer (JDAM), 40 inch Wing Release Lanyard; GBU-53/B SDB II Weapon Load Crew Trainers (WLCT); GBU-53/B SDB II Practical Explosive Ordnance Disposal System Trainers (PEST); AGM-154C-1 JSOW Captive Flight Vehicles; AGM-154C-1 JSOW Dummy Air Training Missiles; AGM-154C-1 JSOW mission planning, integration support and testing, munitions storage security and training, weapon operational flight program software development; integration of the Joint Strike Missile; weapons containers; aircraft and munitions support and test equipment; communications equipment; provisioning, spares and repair parts; weapons repair and return support; personnel training and training equipment; weapon systems software, publications and technical documents; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services; and other related elements of logistical and program support. Meanwhile, the Boeing package , which is formally billed as being for the F/A-18E/F, despite including the EA-18G, has an estimated price tag of $14.7 billion. It is based around 50 single-seat F/A-18E and eight dual-seat F/A-18F Super Hornets, plus 14 EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft. Last year, Dan Gillian, the head of Boeing’s F/A-18E/F and EA-18G programs told The War Zone that the combination of Super Hornets and Growlers made the company’s offer to Finland particularly strong. “We think that’s a great combination for Finland given the threat environment they operate in,” he said, referring to the Nordic country’s increasingly tense relationship with Russia. Alongside these jets, Boeing’s proposal includes: One hundred sixty-six (166) F414-GE-400 engines (144 installed and 22 spares); five hundred (500) GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) All-Up Round (AUR); twelve (12) GBU-53/B SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV); twelve (12) GBU-53/B SDB II Captive Carry Reliability Trainers; one hundred fifty (150) AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Tactical Missiles; thirty-two (32) AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs); thirty (30) AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Tactical Guidance Units; eight (8) AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder CATM Guidance Units; one hundred sixty (160) AGM-154C-1 Joint Stand Off Weapons (JSOW); two hundred (200) AGM-158B-2B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range All Up Rounds (JASSM ER AUR); two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM Separation Test Vehicles (STV); two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM Instrumented Test Vehicles (ITV); two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM Jettison Test Vehicles (JTV); two (2) AGM-158B-2 Inert Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) with Telemetry Instrumental Kits; two (2) AGM-158B-2 JASSM Maintenance Training Missiles (DATM); one hundred twenty (120) BLU-117B/B 2000LB GP Bombs; one hundred twenty (120) KMU-556F/B Bomb Tail Kits (JDAM); three hundred (300) FMU-139D/B Fuzes; two (2) KMU-556(D-2)/B Trainers (JDAM); thirty (30) BLU-109C/B 2000LB Bombs; thirty (30) KMU-557F/B Bomb Tail Kits (JDAM); two (2) BLU-109(D-1)/B 2000LB Bombs; one hundred two (102) BLU-111B/B 500LB General Purpose Bombs; one hundred two (102) KMU-572F/B JDAM Bomb Tail Kits; six (6) MK-82-0,1 500LB, General Purpose Bombs, Inert; fifty-one (51) BLU-110B/B 1000LB General Purpose Bombs; fifty (50) KMU-559F/B Bomb Tail Kits; fifty-eight (58) M61A2 20MM Gun Systems; thirty-two (32) Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR); thirty-two (32) Sniper Targeting Pods; fourteen (14) Advanced Electronic Attack Kit for EA-18G; sixty-five (65) AN/ALR-67(V)3 Electric Warfare Countermeasures Receiving Sets; sixty-five (65) AN/ALQ-214 Integrated Countermeasures Systems; seventy-four (74) Multifunctional Information Distribution Systems – Joint Tactical Radio Systems (MIDS JTRS); eighty-nine (89) Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS); three hundred seventy-seven (377) LAU-127E/A Guided Missile Launchers; seventy-four (74) AN/AYK-29 Distributed Targeting Processor – Networked (DTP-N); twenty-five (25) Infrared Search and Track (IRST) Systems; and eight (8) Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band (NGJ-MB) sets.

Finland has made it clear that the above notification procedure is necessary in order to authorize the possible sale of either the F-35 or F/A-18E/F and does not constitute a procurement decision. The Finnish government has been at pains to emphasize clarity and fairness throughout the HX competition, for which a tendering phase began in spring 2018. Back then, the Finnish Defence Forces’ Logistics Command sent a preliminary invitation to negotiate and a request for quotations (RFQ). Responses to the RFQ were received in January 2019, after which the first phase of negotiations could begin. Then, around a year ago, on October 31, 2019, the Logistics Command sent a Revised Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the HX Programme to the five competing companies. The last call for responses was January 31, 2020. According to the Logistics Command: “This call for tenders is a continuation of the negotiations that have already taken place. With the more detailed call for tenders, each tenderer is requested to compile the information provided in its initial tender and negotiations into a clear, updated and improved package.” As to what Finland is looking for in its next multirole fighter, the government has been explicit in its selection criteria, which are based on five considerations: military capability, security of supply, industrial cooperation, procurement and life-cycle costs, and security and defense policy implications. At the end of the second phase of negotiations, sometime before the end of 2020, a request for the best and final offer is expected to be sent out. This final offer will have taken into account the conclusions from the so-called HX Challenge that took place at Finland’s Pirkkala Air Base near Tampere from January 9 to February 26, 2020. This “testing and evaluation event” saw each of the five candidate jets undergo a seven-day test period under typical Finnish conditions. “The HX Challenge is the first stage of the capability assessment,” explained Colonel Juha-Pekka Keränen, the Finnish Air Force’s HX Programme Director. “The aim of the testing and evaluation event is to verify that each candidate’s systems and performance values match the data reported by the manufacturers.” “The second phase of the capability assessment will make use of the data and performance values established during the HX Challenge. Carried out with virtual simulators, this phase focuses on determining the success of a flight of four aircraft in the scenarios itemized in the call for tenders.” “The third phase will demonstrate the operational efficiency of each candidate’s comprehensive HX solution by playing and simulating a long-term war game. The data obtained in the first two phases of the capability assessment will be utilized in the war game, which will feature the HX solutions as a part of Finland’s defense system.” A decision on the winning fighter is due in 2021, and the aircraft selected is expected to continue in service into the 2060s. With the Joint Strike Fighter having so far emerged successfully from each of the fighter competitions that it’s been judged in, it might be the F-35’s contest to lose. On the other hand, its experience with the existing F/A-18C/D fleet would make a switch to the Super Hornet for Finland more straightforward, reducing costs for infrastructure and training, and allowing a more rapid transition. Finland, which is outside NATO, has a long history of taking a different approach to its defense procurement and the HX competition might yet throw up a surprise.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 5, 2020",India’s First Indigenous Air-Launched Radar-Killing Missile Is Headed For Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India has joined a select group of nations to indigenously develop, and now test, an air-launched radar-busting anti-radiation missile that should provide a significant boost to its air force’s air defense-suppression capabilities. The latest test launch of the weapon, which has now been named Rudram-1, took place today. In a trial that the country’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) ran, the Rudram-1 was launched from an Indian Air Force (IAF) Su-30MKI Flanker multi-role fighter on October 9, 2020. The launch took place over the integrated test range at Balasore in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of the eastern state of Odisha. In a statement, the Indian Ministry of Defence said the Rudram-1 struck a radar-emitting target located on Wheeler Island with “pinpoint accuracy,” while Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the DRDO on what he called a “remarkable achievement.” The Rudram-1, which was previously known as the New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile (NGARM), is India’s first indigenously developed anti-radiation missile. Work on the radar-killing weapon apparently began in 2012. Previously, the IAF has relied upon foreign-made anti-radiation missiles, primarily provided by Russia. The application of a name, Rudram-1, has been taken by Indian defense observers to mean that the missile is now on the verge of frontline service. The Su-30MKI launches the Rudram-1 missile over the Balasore test range., INDIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENCE Anti-radiation missiles like the Rudram-1 are intended to destroy enemy radars, air defense systems, and communication networks, denying them the ability to engage aerial targets. This is typically described as “knocking down the door” in the first phase of an offensive aerial campaign. Like most weapons in its class, the Rudram-1 features a passive-homing guidance system, in which the onboard radar seeker homes in on a radiation-emitting target. “The passive homing head can detect, classify and engage targets over a wide band of frequencies as programmed,” the defense ministry said in a statement. “The missile is a potent weapon for IAF for suppression of enemy air defense effectively from large standoff ranges.” According to Indian media reports, the new missile has a speed of Mach 2 and a range of up to 155 miles. The weapon is supposedly suitable for launch from aircraft flying at altitudes anywhere between 1,640 and 49,000 feet. If the range figure is correct, this could mean the Rudram-1 has a significantly greater reach than the AGM-88E AARGM (Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile), which is the latest U.S.-made missile of its kind to enter service. Thought to be capable of striking targets at around 80 miles, the AARGM flies at a similar speed to the Rudram-1. It’s noteworthy, too, that the U.S. is now working on a version of the AARGM that will fly longer still, a program that The War Zone talks about in detail here . The Russian-made Kh-31P, known to NATO as AS-17 Krypton , and which currently equips IAF Su-30MKI jets, has a reported range of around 68 miles, although it flies a good deal faster, capable of reaching around Mach 3.5. On the other hand, some commentators in India are attributing a considerably shorter range to the new weapon, of between 62 and almost 93 miles. Seconds after launch, the Rudram-1 speeds away toward its target., INDIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENCE A report in the Hindustan Times indicates that the new missile can be locked on to a target before or after launch. A lock-on after launch (LOAL) mode would be useful especially for hitting targets at greater standoff range, offering the possibility of a pre-emptive attack on enemy radar installations from a much safer distance. That same source gives the range of the Rudram-1’s seeker as 62 miles, which suggests that any target beyond this radius would have to be engaged using the LOAL mode. This, however, relies on the emitter’s type and its general location being known in advance, and that the hostile radar is switched on for at least some of the time during the engagement. The missile would fly out to the target using its GPS-aided inertial navigation system before its passive seeker took over. The Indian Ministry of Defence says that, once testing is completed, the Rudram-1 will be added to the Su-30MKI’s armory. It’s not known if there are plans to add it subsequently to other aircraft, too, but the Flanker is clearly the platform of choice for new weaponry, including the Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, and the air-launched version of the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile. It’s also an important addition to India arsenal given that regional rival Pakistan received the MAR-1 anti-radiation missile that was developed by the Mectron company of Brazil. Following the signature of an acquisition contract in 2008, the missile was integrated with the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF’s) upgraded Mirage III /V ground-attack fighters, but apparently not on the JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter. As well as demonstrating a new capability to Pakistan, the test of the missile could be a signal to China, with which India is currently locked in a border dispute in Ladakh , a Himalayan border area in the Kashmir region. It’s perhaps no coincidence that the test of the Rudram-1 comes in the wake of China deploying air defense assets to that region. After all, the Rudram-1 is not the first indigenous weapon to be tested by India in recent weeks. It follows hot on the heels of a very long-range supersonic anti-submarine missile , and a hypersonic scramjet-powered vehicle . Other weapons tested of late comprise an extended-range version of the Brahmos cruise missile, a laser-guided anti-tank missile , and the nuclear-capable Shaurya ballistic missile. Clearly, India is not only extremely active on a host of advanced missile programs but is also especially keen to publicize its successes in a field in which it’s still a relative newcomer.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 17, 2020",The Secretive Inventor Of The Navy’s Bizarre ‘UFO Patents’ Finally Talks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last six months, The War Zone has been deeply reporting on a set of bizarre patents assigned to the U.S. Navy. The patents, which are all the product of a single inventor, truly sound like the stuff of science fiction and include high-temperature superconductors, gravitational wave generators, compact fusion reactors, and high-energy electromagnetic field generators. Most radical of all is the “ hybrid aerospace-underwater craft ” claimed to be able to “engineer the fabric of our reality at the most fundamental level” by seemingly bending the laws of physics as we know them. Together, these patents seem to be the building blocks of a vehicle with truly out-of-this-world, UFO-like performance. As part of our reporting, we have been working to better understand the mind behind this mysterious intellectual property. Now, the elusive Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais has spoken to The War Zone . Despite the patents sounding extremely far-fetched, official documents show that the Chief Technology Officer of the U.S. Naval Aviation Enterprise personally attested to the reality of these inventions and their importance to national security and peer-state competition in appeals with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Meanwhile, the scientists and physicists we have talked to have made it clear that they find the claims largely absurd and not grounded in scientific fact. At the same time, there is, in fact, many decades of government research into similar technologies that are very much alike in concept to some of Pais’s work. As such, while these are obscure ideas and remain on the edge of science, they are not exactly brand new. All of this has led many to wonder what exactly is going on with these patents and a multitude of questions remain unanswered. Are the Salvatore Pais patents simply proactive, hoping to get ahead of the game for when or if these technologies actually become feasible? Are they part of a misinformation campaign designed to lead America’s adversaries on a fruitless wild goose chase? Could they be an attempt by the Navy to try to emulate seemingly unexplained craft with incredible capabilities that its personnel have encountered? Could the Navy really be on the verge of changing human technological progress as we know it? Or maybe they even represent a breakthrough that has already occurred. Then again, could they be just the flimsy product of a persuasive and imaginative inventor and his gullible Navy bosses? The one person who would actually know the answer to these questions and more is Dr. Pais himself. New Details Emerge Dr. Pais recently published a new academic paper in the IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science journal detailing his work on his Plasma Compression Fusion Device. That device, the patent for which The War Zone has previously reported on , is a compact fusion reactor claimed to be capable of creating a net energy gain, a breakthrough that would revolutionize energy production if truly feasible. Like all of Dr. Pais’s other patents and publications, the paper claims that this revolutionary new fusion reactor employs “controlled motion of electrically charged matter through accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin subjected to smooth, yet rapid acceleration–deceleration–acceleration transients, to generate extremely high energy/high-intensity electromagnetic (EM) fields.” In the case of this reactor, those EM fields are claimed to both heat the plasma within the core and also confine and compress it, enabling energy production levels currently out of reach. In the author section of the paper, it is stated that Dr. Pais has “advanced knowledge of theory, analysis, and modern experimental and computational methods in aerodynamics, along with an understanding of air-vehicle and missile design, especially in the domain of hypersonic power plant and vehicle design” as well as “expertise in electrooptics and emerging quantum technologies, particularly the laser power generation arena, and high-energy electromagnetic field generation, besides condensed matter physics, such as the emerging breakthrough field of room temperature superconductivity, as related to advanced field propulsion.” The paper also contains a headshot of Dr. Pais, which confirms that a picture purporting to be Pais found on a Chinese news blog that we included in our previous reporting was indeed him after all. That image’s provenance remains unknown. A biography of Pais listed in his most recent publication in IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science. , IEEE.ORG The IEEE publication states that Dr. Pais is no longer with NAVAIR/NAWCAD, but now works at the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP). According to its website , SSP covers the “entire spectrum of activities from research, development, building of hardware, training of crews, and construction of facilities, through the continued operational support” of America’s Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and Ohio class and future Columbia class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). In 2018, SSP announced it was developing a new “Prompt Global Strike Weapon,” now known as the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike, which consists of a hypersonic glide body on top of a rocket booster that submarines or surface ships that could launch and that could potentially reach any target on Earth within an hour, depending on the location of the launch platform. It remains unclear whether any of Dr. Pais’s prior work at NAWCAD has migrated to his new position at SSP. From the sound of our correspondence, and by what we know about SSP’s scope, it seems like this is very much a separate field of study. His transfer to this other research arm of the Navy is also puzzling. If Dr. Pais’s patents were relevant, feasible, and if some of them were in actual testing as the Naval Air System’s Chief Technology Officer assured the USPTO, why would that effort be stymied by a transfer to another unit? It’s also worth noting the well-established trend of the U.S. military making use of the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 to file patents unavailable for public viewing, under which the Navy has been the most prolific filer since 2017. It seems particularly notable that Pais’s patents, which according to top Navy officials were of major national security interest , were filed publicly, though the reason why remains elusive. Data compiled by the Federation of American Scientists showing annual totals of inventions filed under the Invention Secrecy Act., FAS.org “The Pais Effect” The War Zone has reached out to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) and the U.S. Navy Office of Information to request more information about Dr. Salvatore Pais’s patents and a formal interview with Dr. Pais. So far we have been denied such opportunities. However, Dr. Pais did respond to a few questions directly by email recently and his replies only add to the curiosity and mystery surrounding these alleged wondrous technological breakthroughs. We asked Dr. Pais to clarify his background, as little information and much confusion surrounds the identity of the man himself. Dr. Pais would only state what is already public record, that he is “a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, received all my degrees at that school — BS ’90; MS ’93; Ph.D. ’98 – all in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering”, then adding that “More than this I cannot comment, thank you for your consideration.” When The War Zone asked if Dr. Pais could comment on his patents or his research in general, he sent the following reply: The fact that my work on the design of a Compact Fusion Reactor was accepted for publication in such a prestigious journal as IEEE TPS, should speak volumes as to its importance and credibility – and should eliminate (or at least alleviate) all misconceptions you (or any other person) may have in regard to the veracity (or possibility) of my advanced physics concepts. Mr. Tingley, do realize that my work culminates in the enablement of the Pais Effect (original physical concept). The Pais Effect comprises the generation of extremely high electromagnetic energy fluxes (and hence high local energy densities) generated by controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma states) subjected to accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin, via rapid acceleration transients. Such high energy EM radiation can locally interact with the Vacuum Energy State (VES) – the VES being the Fifth State of Matter (Fifth Essence – Quintessence), in other words the fundamental structure (foundational framework), from which Everything else (Spacetime included) in our Quantum Reality, emerges. The Engineering of the Pais Effect can give rise to the Enablement of Macroscopic Quantum Coherence, which if you have closely been following my work, you understand the importance of. I must stress that all this work (patents, patent applications and technical papers) was conducted as a NAVAIR/ NAWCAD employee, and that my current position with Navy SSP has absolutely no bearing or in any way, shape or form has anything to do with this advanced physics work. Thank you for your interest in my physics concepts, and try to keep an open mind in regard to my work. Respectfully, Sal Salvatore Cezar Pais, Ph.D. A.D. MMXIX The email from Dr. Pais makes it clear that the inventor stands fully behind the science underlying these inventions, as radical as they sound. As we have explored in previous articles on Dr. Pais’s work, all of the patents stem from what the inventor is now calling the “Pais Effect,” the “controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma states) subjected to accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin, via rapid acceleration transients.” Despite Dr. Pais’s insistence that the Pais Effect is indeed a real phenomenon and the assurance that NAVAIR’s Chief Technology Officer gave the USPTO, we have been unable to find a single scientist or engineer who can corroborate the claims made in Dr. Pais’s patents. Nevertheless, in another correspondence, Dr. Pais assured The War Zone that “as far as the doubting SMEs [subject matter experts] are concerned, my work shall be proven correct one fine day…”. Subject Matter Experts Have Their Doubts To help contextualize Dr. Pais’s most recent patent and academic publication for the plasma compression fusion device , The War Zone spoke with Carl Willis, a nuclear engineer and reactor supervisor at the University of New Mexico who also serves as Senior Research Engineer for Verus Research, a company that is working on an advanced dense plasma focus fusion neutron source for the Army, a technology Willis says Verus does not view as “a competitive approach to a fusion power plant, or a competitor in any meaningful sense toward anything Dr. Pais is working on for that matter.” According to Willis, Dr. Pais’s most recent work represents “a classic case of pathological science.” Willis says the literature for the plasma compression fusion device contains invented jargon, nonsensical statements, weak or absent evidence of an informed theoretical basis, an “overabundance of nebulous adjectives and adverbs instead of meaningful quantities in technical writing,” and “lots of statements made in passing that seem to contradict basic and accepted physics.” Willis says that Dr. Pais “references subjects that have consistently been plagued with pathological science and popular misunderstanding for decades, such as vacuum energy.  It’s hard not to suspect he’s either drinking the kool-aid himself, or just chumming the waters for the kind of people who do.” Still, even Willis notes that “this case is mildly unusual in that the author has a Ph. D. and is employed by the government, his patents are assigned to the government, and the paper is slated to appear in a rather widely-read IEEE outlet.  However, these facts in no way temper my view that this is all basically nonsense–it just raises additional questions about the cui bono of this particular case.” To help answer those questions, we spoke with Dr. Charles Collett, an assistant professor of Physics at Muhlenberg College who specializes in experimental low-temperature research on the quantum state of molecular magnets. Like most physicists we’ve spoken to about the Pais patents, Collett remains skeptical. While he admits that the theoretical basis for the so-called Pais Effect “is not outlandish, and indeed any charged matter that is undergoing a large amount of acceleration will produce this,” Collett notes that there are likely “significant engineering challenges in creating a device” capable of producing such high electromagnetic forces. Collett concluded by adding that “the claims of macroscopic quantum coherence seem dubious,” and that he “cannot see how that interaction could lead to any of the claimed effects.” “Overall, my impression is that while there may (or may not) be an interesting engineering feat in the patents, the rest of the claims are extraordinary,” Collett continued, “and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” Extraordinary Claims As we continue to report on the extraordinary claims of Dr. Salvatore Pais and the inventions he has patented on behalf of the Navy, we continue to find scientists who suggest that the intended audience of these patents may not, in fact, be the scientific or aerospace communities as these patents and their supporting publications contain what most would call pseudoscience and empty jargon. Still, as we noted earlier, there are decades of research into similar approaches at breakthrough propulsion technologies or so-called “space time metric engineering”, much of it U.S. government-funded . In fact, the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (CFUSAI) formed by President George W. Bush and the United States Congress in 2001 concluded that “in the longer-term, breakthrough energy sources that go beyond our current understanding of physical laws, such as nuclear fusion and anti-matter, must be credibly investigated in order for us to practically pursue human exploration of the solar system and beyond” and adds that “these energy sources should be the topic of a focused basic research effort.” Maybe the research and patents of Dr. Salvatore Pais are a beginning attempt at the realization of this very long term goal. Then again, as a number of subject matter experts have suggested, they may represent something misleading, misguided, or misappropriated. Regardless, even with so many questions outstanding, we do know one thing for sure: Pais himself is clearly a true believer in his work.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 27, 2020",F/A-18 Super Hornets Are Flying Middle East Combat Missions With New Infrared Sensor Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Super Hornet is set to officially receive one of its biggest sensor upgrades ever next year with the addition of an infrared search and track pod. The system, which is integrated into the Super Hornet’s centerline fuel tank, will give the jet the ability to detect and engage low-observable (stealthy) and small radar cross-section targets at well beyond visual range, along with a slew of other capabilities. You can read all about the sensor and the Navy’s plans for it in more detail than anywhere else in this past War Zone interview with the head of the Navy’s Super Hornet program. Now, that system has appeared on deployment for the first time, over the tumultuous skies of the Middle East, a year before it is supposed to be operational. The images below were posted by the Department of Defense. They show a pair of F/A-18F Super Hornets from VFA-94 “Mighty Shrikes” flying over Central Command’s area of responsibility “in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.” The “Mighty Shrikes” are attached to Carrier Air Wing 17, which is deployed aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN 68), which is presently plowing the waters of the Persian Gulf. The jets are armed with live AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, ATFLIR targeting pods, and GBU-38/B JDAMs and GBU-54/B Laser JDAMs . As such, it is interesting to note that the IRST pod is being flown on these combat missions. USN USN It isn’t clear what version of the Navy’s IRST pod we are seeing. The earlier Block I iteration of the system has been in testing for some time. It is likely that this is the version of the system shown in these photos. It would make some sense to deploy the earlier version of the pod on an operational cruise to better understand how the final production version will slot into the Air Wing when it comes online in about one year’s time. It would also give the Air Wing a capability it currently lacks, providing another tool to spot targets that are very hard to detect on radar, and an air-to-air sensor system that is not impacted by electronic warfare at all. Both attributes would be highly beneficial considering Iran is very active when it comes to both of these warfighting capabilities. In particular, the country’s rapid development and successful use of hard-to-detect low-flying cruise missiles and drones pose a major threat to American and allied assets in the region. Just ask Saudi Arabia . It’s also worth mentioning that Nimitz got its own set of new long-range infrared ‘eyes’ for this deployment. That sensor, which you can read more about here, is more for general surveillance and target identification, not for detecting and engaging enemy aircraft over long distances. Regardless, the Super Hornet’s IRST has officially hit the fleet, even in a limited operational test basis. It will be highly interesting to learn more about its deployment. We have already reached out to the Navy for more info on this historic deployment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",RAF Tests Swarm Loaded With BriteCloud Electronic Warfare Decoys To Overwhelm Air Defenses,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Italian defense contractor Leonardo says that it has conducted a successful demonstration in cooperation with the U.K. Royal Air Force of an autonomous swarm of unmanned aircraft, each carrying a variant of its BriteCloud expendable active decoy as an electronic warfare payload. Using the BriteClouds, which contain electronic warfare jammers, the drones were able to launch a mock non-kinetic attack on radars acting as surrogates for a notional enemy integrated air defense network. Leonardo announced it had carried out the swarm demonstration, which it conducted together with the Royal Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), as well as private unmanned technology firms Callen-Lenz and Blue Bear , on Oct. 7, 2020. The latter two firms, as well as Boeing, are working on prototype semi-autonomous “ loyal wingman ” type drones for the RAF, which that service also refers to as “remote carriers,” as part of Project Mosquito , which is itself a component of the larger Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) program. “During the demonstration, a number of Callen Lenz drones were equipped with a modified Leonardo BriteCloud decoy, allowing each drone to individually deliver a highly-sophisticated jamming effect,” according to Leonardo’s press release. “They were tested against ground-based radar systems representing the enemy air defence emplacement. A powerful demonstration was given, with the swarm of BriteCloud-equipped drones overwhelming the threat radar systems with electronic noise.” For reasons that are unclear, Leonardo has since removed its press release from its website, though an archived copy of the page remains available through Google. The company also deleted an official Tweet with an infographic, a copy of which is seen below, regarding BriteCloud and this demonstration. Leonardo Leonardo did not offer any details about the unmanned aircraft used in the demonstration. Artist’s conceptions of a drone swarm strike that the company released along with the announcement, seen at the top of this story and in the infographic above, showed a tailless fixed-wing design with a single, rear-mounted pusher propeller and fixed undercarriage. However, there is no indication one way or another if this in any way reflects the Callen-Lenz design employed in the recent test. The standard BriteCloud is what is known as a Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) jammer that first detects incoming radar pulses from hostile platforms, including aircraft, ships, and ground-based air defense systems, as well as active radar guidance systems on incoming missiles. It then mimics those signals in return, creating the appearance of a false target. As Leonardo said in its own press release, this effect can “confuse and overwhelm” radars and lure missiles away from friendly aircraft. BriteCloud, which can be launched from any dispenser capable of firing standard 55mm decoy flares or chaff cartridges, first entered RAF service in 2018 on the now-retired Tornado GR4 combat jet. Last year, the service began tests of the decoy on its Eurofighter Typhoons and indicated that it could also eventually integrate them on its F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . Unlike a plane dropping expendable BriteClouds, in the recent demonstration, Leonardo noted that “the decoy packages were programmed and navigated to work collaboratively to cause maximum confusion.” Placing the jammers inside drones offers the ability to help space them out for optimal coverage across a wide area. The entire swarm provides immense additional flexibility by being able to rapidly shift its focus from one area to another to respond to new developments in the battlespace. Above all else, they allow BriteCloud to employ its bag of tricks over longer periods of time and even execute multiple electronic attacks instead of just one. At the same time, the off-the-shelf electronic warfare expendables are just that, expendable. If you lose one and its drone platform, it isn’t a big deal as they are meant to be expendable in the first place. As such, they are the very definition of attritable. This term refers to designs that could be recovered and reused, but that are also cheap enough for commanders to be willing to commit them to higher-risk missions where there is a significant chance of them getting knocked down. The RAF is not the only one to be looking at drone swarms, or otherwise networking munitions and other expendable stores together to reduce duplication of effort and otherwise improve the efficacy of strikes and other missions. The U.S. Air Force is in the midst of its own networked munition program, called Golden Horde, and the Army recently revealed plans to develop swarms of air-launched drones carrying electronic warfare systems and other payloads, efforts that you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The general idea of using an autonomous swarm of drones to blind, confuse, and overwhelm an enemy’s integrated air defense network, or other sensor and communication nodes, is hardly new, either and is one of the most common missions envisioned for such a group of unmanned aircraft. Carrying out such missions in the open stages of conflict would make good sense as they would help clear paths for other manned and unmanned aircraft, including more vulnerable, non-stealthy types, to conduct follow-on kinetic strikes or carry out other tasks, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Depending on the size and capability of the basic drones in the swarm, its possible that entire autonomous grouping could carry out multiple missions itself simultaneously, including ISR and kinetic strike. Stand-in expendable decoys, such as BriteCloud, could be combined with other non-kinetic options, such as existing and emerging standoff decoys and expendable electronic warfare systems, as well. Last year, European missile consortium MBDA, of which Leonardo is a part, notably unveiled plans for a SPEAR-EW version of its SPEAR-3 miniature cruise missile. SPEAR-EW will carry an electronic warfare jammer, one that may well utilize technology from BriteCloud, instead of an explosive warhead. There has already been talk of networking SPEAR-EWs and SPEAR-3s together to carry strikes as their own kind of autonomous swarm. You can read more about SPEAR-EW and the concepts of operation surrounding it in more detail in this past War Zone piece . An artist’s conception of SPEAR-EW., MBDA This test also speaks to where the RAF in the United Kingdom is at developmentally when it comes to its drone swarm efforts, which it first unveiled plans for last year. The service established a dedicated unit to explore both loyal wingman and swarm concepts, 216 Squadron , this year, but the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed its expansion . This demonstration of integrating BriteCloud into lower-end drones would certainly seem to offer a very viable path to a useful drone swarm capability for the RAF in the near term. It could be then combined it with higher-end, heavier unmanned aircraft capabilities as part of a broader swam strategy in the future, as well. If nothing else, Leonardo’s demonstration in cooperation with the RAF highlights how drone swarms capable of carrying out a multitude of mission sets are moving ever closer to becoming a key component for future combat operations.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery shows at least two F-16 Viper fighter jets , almost certainly belonging to the Turkish Air Force , at Ganja International Airport in Azerbaijan earlier this month. This is the first hard evidence that at least some of these jets were in that country after fighting erupted between it and its neighbor Armenia over the long-disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region . The War Zone obtained the image of Ganja International Airport, dated Oct. 3, 2020, showing the pair of F-16s, as well as what could be a CN-235 light transport aircraft , from Planet Labs. The airport is situated in the western part of Azerbaijan, less than 50 miles north from Nagorno-Karabakh.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Christiaan Triebert, of The New York Times’ Visual Investigations team was among the first to spot the jets in this imagery, providing initial analysis in a thread on Twitter . Triebert said that the region has been a particular point of interest for the Visual Investigations team, as it has been for other news outlets, experts, and observers, since a new major conflict broke out between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh on Sept. 27, 2020. Since 1994, the Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh has held de facto control over Nagorno-Karabakh, despite the area being widely recognized as Azerbaijani territory. Fighting has flared up at times in the intervening decades. A Turkish Air Force F-16C Viper fighter jet., Turkish Armed Forces The issue of the possible presence of Turkish F-16s at Ganja and their potential involvement in this conflict first arose on Sept. 29, 2020, when Shushan Stepanyan, the Press Secretary of the Minister of Defense of Armenia, claimed that one of these jets flying from that airport had shot down an Armenian Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack jet. Turkish and Azerbaijani officials categorically denied this and said that no Turkish Vipers were conducting combat operations in the region. Armenia’s shootdown claim remains unconfirmed, but the Planet Labs image from Oct. 3 all but confirms that Turkish F-16s were at Ganja at least as of that date. While it’s not possible to say with absolute certainty who the operator of the F-16s in the imagery is, it’s hard to see how they could belong to anyone else but Turkey. Other Planet Labs imagery that The War Zone examined shows what appear to be F-16s on the exact same ramp at the airport starting in early August. The Turkish Air Force publicly deployed a contingent of Vipers to Ganja, ostensibly as part of a bilateral training exercise with Azerbaijani forces, on July 31. Those drills followed another bout of clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakha and were seen by some as signal from officials in Ankara aimed squarely at their counterparts in Yerevan. That exercise, dubbed TurAz Qartali-2020, was supposed to wrap up on Aug. 10. However, additional imagery from Planet Labs shows six F-16s, as well as what looks to be a CN-235, still on the ramp at Ganja on Sept. 10. Lower-resolution imagery available in Planet Labs archives dated between August 10th, through Sept. 10th, and on to Oct. 3rd shows the persistent presence of what look to be combat jets in the same portion of the same area of the airport. A satellite image showing six F-16 Viper fighter jets and what looks to be a CN-235 light transport aircraft at Ganja International Airport on Sept. 10, 2020., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The clear indication is that this detachment of F-16s remained in Azerbaijan far after the end of TurAz Qartali-2020. The CN-235, another type of aircraft that Turkey operates and that Azerbaijan does not, is likely acting in a support role for the F-16 force deployed to the country. A Turkish Air Force CN-235., Anna Zvereva via Wikimedia There have been suggestions that the aircraft seen in the Oct. 3 imagery are not actually F-16s, but this seems highly unlikely and in the case of the high-resolution image, impossible. In February 2020, Azerbaijan did announce it was buying Leonardo M-346 advanced jet trainers from Italy, which some claim could possibly be mistaken for F-16s in satellite imagery, but there is no indication that any of those aircraft have been delivered. The F-16 also has a distinct size and shape that is hard to confuse with the aircraft in the Azerbaijani Air Force’s combat jets fleets, which include Soviet-era MiG-21 Fishbed and MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters, as well as its own Su-25s. Despite their presence at Ganja, it remains unclear how the F-16s are or are not participating in the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been steadily escalating since it began last week. If they are not, the question becomes what possible role could they have and why has the deployment been kept secret? Azerbaijan has already been waging a devastating air war against Armenian and Armenian-backed forces using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, as well as Israeli-made loitering munitions , especially the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harop . A video circulating on social media also suggests that Azerbaijan has fired at least one of its Israeli-made LORA short-range ballistic missiles at a target along the border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Other clips indicate that Armenian forces had similarly launched at least one Soviet-era Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile at Azerbaijani positions. So far, Armenia has not employed its more advanced Russian-made Iskander-E quasi-ballistic missiles. Artillery, including howitzer and rocket artillery systems, has also been a major factor in the fighting. Both sides accuse each other of indiscriminate strikes on civilian population centers, including the city of Ganja , where the airport the F-16s are based at is situated, in the region. It’s also not clear how confirmation of the presence of Turkish F-16s at Ganja, despite that country’s denials, may impact the conflict going forward. If proof emerges that these jets have been taking part in the fighting, it would represent a major escalation, but it may not necessarily trigger further involvement from Armenia’s own regional partners, including Russia or Iran. Just today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country was under no obligation to intervene until there was danger of an Azerbaijani invasion of undisputed Armenian territory. This statement implicitly means that the Kremlin continues to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as Azerbaijani territory. It will be very interesting to see if that proclamation sticks. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said today that his country won’t stand for the presence of foreign fighters in Nagorno-Karabakh, an apparent reference to Turkey’s reported facilitation of the movement of Syrian militants into the region to fight on behalf of Azerbaijan. In the past, he has also called for an end to any foreign involvement in the fighting and called for both sides to bring a halt to the latest conflict and negotiate a resolution “within the framework of international law.” For its part, Turkey continues to express its unequivocal support for Azerbaijan’s offensive, which appears to be aimed at recapturing all, or at least most of the dispute region. What we do know now is that, at least as of Oct. 3, Turkey had F-16s deployed to Azerbaijan, where they are well-positioned to take part in the conflict, if they haven’t been doing so already.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2020",Russia Says This Is Our First Glimpse Of Its Zircon Hypersonic Cruise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense has announced what it says is the first test launch of its Zircon hypersonic cruise missile against a naval target. The first-in-class Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov fired the weapon during an event that may have been timed to coincide with the birthday of President Vladimir Putin. The missile test took place on October 6, 2020, and the defense ministry released a brief video of the launch the following day, the president’s 68th birthday. According to TV Zvezda , the official television network of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Zircon, also sometimes transliterated as Tsirkon, achieved a speed of “more than Mach 8” before striking a target located 280 miles away in the Barents Sea during the test. An official Kremlin account confirmed that Putin had been informed of the test launch the day after in a video conference with the Chief of the General Staff, First Deputy Minister of Defense Valery Gerasimov. The Russian defense chief told Putin that the missile achieved a maximum altitude of 17.4 miles and hit its target after a flight time of four and a half minutes. Gerasimov added that the Zircon, officially part of the 3K22 “weapons complex,” is expected to equip additional submarines and surface ships of the Russian Navy. It’s also worth noting that a notice to airmen (NOTAM) was issued for this area of the White Sea covering the period October 5 to October 9, consistent with the test. This alerts pilots to potential hazards in the area and is standard procedure for a weapons test of this kind. The footage that the Ministry of Defense subsequently released shows a missile fired from the 16-cell 3S14 vertical launch system (VLS) on the foredeck of the Northern Fleet’s 5,400-ton-displacement Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov , underway in the White Sea on the northwest coast of Russia. Another view shows the weapon pulling up, apparently stabilized by vectoring rockets, and then tilting to an angle less than 90 degrees. As the missile disappears into the cloud, the video ends. While the video is presented as a first look at the new missile, there have been some suggestions it may have been edited by splicing together a combination of footage showing one or more other weapons, and not just the Zircon. Experts and observers have questioned whether the close-up scene of the missile ejected from its tube may show a previous, in-service weapon, to maintain the Zircon’s secrecy. A screen capture from the latest Zircon video shows a cylindrical missile ejected from the 3S14 VLS on the frigate Admiral Gorshkov. , Russian Ministry of Defense capture Seconds after launch, the missile climbs away from the frigate., Russian Ministry of Defense capture Some have also suggested the missile in the video, despite the official description, may actually be an older design, such as the Oniks anti-ship missile. The 3S14 VLS on the Project 22350 warships can also be loaded with the supersonic Oniks , as well as the subsonic Kalibr land-attack cruise missile. The video of the latest at-sea test doesn’t provide that many more clues about the appearance of the Zircon itself or exactly how it operates. In the past, Russian media have used graphics showing the weapon as a “waverider”-type hypersonic missile. This is the same principle used in the U.S. Air Force’s experimental X-51 Waverider, in which supersonic shockwaves are used to maintain the flight vehicle’s lift and stability. This would suggest the possibility of a conventional rocket motor bringing the Zircon to the required speed and altitude, before an air-breathing high-speed engine, such as a scramjet, takes over. There have also been unconfirmed reports that the Zircon may employ “plasma stealth” technology, in which it’s shrouded from hostile radar by a cloud of radar-absorbing ionized particles. It’s an exotic concept that’s discussed in greater detail in this past War Zone feature . Claims of plasma stealth technology in relation to Russian weapon systems are not new and they should be taken as highly speculative at best. One of a number of graphics circulating on the internet purporting to show the Zircon., VIA AINONLINE Supposedly, this is also not the first reported at-sea launch of the Zircon missile. In February 2020, state-run news outlet TASS claimed that an initial at-sea test launch had taken place in the Barents Sea early the previous month, again from the frigate Admiral Gorshkov . On this occasion, the weapon apparently engaged a simulated ground target, located in the Northern Urals, rather than a naval one. The reported January test saw the missile fly somewhat further too, apparently in excess of 311 miles. No photos or videos of the missile were released to accompany the test. This is the first time the Russian Ministry of Defense has spoken specifically about the missile’s top speed. That the weapon reportedly hit Mach 8 would put its performance close to previous estimates and other official statements. Speaking in February 2019, President Putin had said that the weapon would have a top speed of around Mach 9 and a range of approximately 620 miles. Otherwise, details about Zircon remain limited. The existence of the missile, which NPO Mashinostroyenia has been developing, has been known since at least early 2016 when it was identified as a component planned for the upgrade of the Russian Navy’s Kirov -class nuclear-powered battlecruiser fleet. Development of the weapon almost certainly started some time before that, likely in the early 2010s. In June 2017, multiple reports, citing Russian state media, said that the Kremlin’s forces had tested a prototype Zircon a year ahead of schedule . This was then expected to be followed by a first at-sea trial of the weapon onboard the Admiral Gorshkov before the end of 2019. An old image that has been floating around online for years now purportedly showing a Zircon missile, but which may actually showing something else., KRSK.kp.ru via Wikimedia However, by January 2020 it seemed that the program might be running into difficulties when a leading Russian Navy official cited unspecified “childhood diseases” in its development effort. Beyond the Project 22350 frigates, Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko announced in November 2019 that the Zircon will also be integrated on the Pacific Fleet’s Project 1155 Udaloy -class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov and the Project 949A Oscar II -class submarine Irkutsk . In theory, any other ship capable of accommodating a 3S14 vertical launch system could potentially fire the Zircon in the future, too. Meanwhile, Putin himself said that the first-in-class Project 20385 corvette Gremyashchiy , also assigned to the Pacific Fleet, “will certainly have Zirkon,” during a visit to Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea in October 2019. On the same occasion, Putin revealed that the missile would be able to strike land targets, as well as those at sea. Tests against targets of both types have now been completed. Adding Zircon to various ships and submarines could significantly increase the overall capabilities of the Russian Navy. In this previous article , The War Zone looked at the game-changing potential of hypersonic weapons like the Zircon and noted that how, just flying at Mach 5, with a range of approximately 250 miles, the missile might provide a targeted American warship with very little time to respond with weapons or other countermeasures — providing these were fast enough to catch it. Presuming it was the success that the Russian Defense Ministry suggests, when taken at face value, the latest at-sea test of the Zircon indicates the enigmatic missile is now on a more steady path toward operational use. Exactly when that will happen remains unclear and the earlier problems still underscore the enduring challenges of fielding practical hypersonic weaponry. The reality is, we still don’t really know what the state of this weapon’s development is. Considering how challenging pulling off an operational air-breathing hypersonic weapon capability is, especially one tasked with the anti-ship role, it would be stunning if the development of this weapon is truly as far along as Russia claims it to be.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 15, 2018",Work Begins On Starlink-Like Constellation Of Small Hypersonic Missile-Tracking Satellites,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has hired L3Harris and SpaceX to build small satellites with powerful infrared sensors capable of spotting and tracking ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons . These satellites could become part of a large and broader early warning constellation with hundreds of space-based sensors and communications nodes watching for incoming threats, monitoring their flight, and potentially providing targeting data to missile defense assets . The Pentagon announced that the Space Development Agency (SDA) had awarded the contracts to L3Harris and SpaceX, worth around $193.5 million and just over $149 million, respectively, on Oct. 5, 2020. Each company will be responsible for building four satellites, each with a wide field of view (WFOV) overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensor, in support of work on what SDA calls Tranche 0 of the Tracking Layer of the planned overarching early warning constellation. “SDA is developing the low-cost proliferated WFOV space vehicles that provide the missile warning and the tracking information for national defense authorities, as well as tracking and cueing data for missile defense elements,” Mark Lewis, the Acting Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, said in a statement to C4ISRNET . “This capability [the Tracking Layer] encompasses space-based sensing, as well as algorithms, novel processing schemes, data fusion across sensors and orbital regimes, and tactical data products able to be delivered to the appropriate user,” according to SDA’s website. This Layer’s Tranche 0 could eventually grow to 20 satellites and this portion of the larger constellation may eventually have as many as 200 space-based sensors. DOD SpaceX’s satellite will be derived from that company’s Starlink design , which was originally designed as part of an effort to provide increased access to broadband internet for commercial and military purposes. An as-yet-unknown subcontractor will be providing the OPIR sensor. L3Harris is developing both its satellite and sensor in-house. The company has not yet released details about the design of either one. SDA’s goal is to launch the first Tranche 0 satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in 2022 and then have moved on to the Tranche 1 stage by 2024, where the Tracking Layer will be able to provide persistent monitoring for missile and hypersonic threats over specific regions of interest. The hope is that there will be enough satellites in orbit by 2026 to provide global early warning coverage. An artist’s conception of a SpaceX Starlink satellite deploying its solar array after arriving in space., SpaceX The idea is that the Tracking Layer will also be more responsive, flexible, and resilient to the ever-more real prospect of an enemy anti-satellite attack by using this large, distributed constellation of small satellites. At present, the U.S. military’s space-based early warning capability comes from a relatively limited number of larger satellites, such as the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) constellation, which you can read about in more detail here . SBIRS notably provided an advance alert that Iranian ballistic missiles were headed toward bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq in January, giving those individuals time to seek cover. SBIRS’ sensors are also known to be powerful enough to spot infrared events that are much smaller than a ballistic missile blasting off, such as the launch of smaller missiles, large explosions, and even artillery fire. The Tracking Layer isn’t the only planned distributed space-based sensor program in the works, either. It’s “going to combine with activities in the Missile Defense Agency as they build toward their Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) medium field of view (MFOV) space vehicles,” Acting Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Lewis added in his statement to C4ISRNET . SDA’s planned space-based early warning architecture will also include a so-called Transport Layer, which will consist of hundreds of satellites with communications and data-sharing systems. “The idea is it connects to the National Defense Space Architecture—the NDSA transport layer—via optical intersatellite links,” Lewis explained. “And that will enable low latency dissemination for missile warning indications. It will provide track directly to the joint warfighters.” An infographic showing a notional National Defense Space Architecture, including the planned Tracking and Transport layers., DOD These “optical intersatellite links” have not been described in detail, but sound very much like a laser communications system . Work on laser-based communications in space, and for sending data to and from space-based systems and terrestrial nodes, has been going on for decades and a number of systems have already demonstrated the capability on an experimental level. Laser communications offer improved performance and reliability over traditional systems, especially over very long distances. In addition, using laser light rather than radio waves to transmit these signals makes these systems impervious to radio frequency jamming or spoofing and immune to intercept by traditional signals and electronic intelligence systems. In August, York Space Systems and Lockheed Martin received their own contracts from SDA, worth $94 million and $188 million, respectively, for the first Transport Layer satellites. Tranche 0 of the Transport Layer is expected to consist of 20 satellites, as well. SDA has also talked about developing more layers to provide additional early warning coverage, as well as other support, again in a distributed manner that would be more survivable in face of anti-satellite attacks. These could include a Custody Layer, focused on tracking mobile threats, such as ballistic missile transporter-erector-launchers, on the ground, and a Navigation Layer offering an alternative to the GPS constellation as part of a concept commonly referred to as Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). An additional Deterrence Layer could also provide outward coverage of potential threats further out in space , an area of growing concern for the U.S. military. Maintaining these large, distributed constellations would also require rapid space launch capabilities, an area that the U.S. military has been heavily investing in already and that you can read more about in these previous War Zone pieces . There is also the potential to use other space-based systems, including small space stations , to provide on-orbit repairs and other services in the future. With potential American adversaries, ranging from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea , continuing to expand their ballistic missile arsenals and introduce new systems, including hypersonic weapons , the importance of early warning capabilities is only set to keep growing in the near term. Russia, in particular, as well as China , are also pursuing a variety of anti-satellite capabilities, including potential on-orbit interceptors launched from small “ killer satellites ,” which challenge the U.S. military’s existing space-based infrastructure. A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency infographic showing the various ways one satellite might disable or destroy another beyond a simple a kinetic attack., DIA Questions and concerns about the feasibility and practicality of the planned National Defense Space Architecture have already cropped up. In many ways, the basic concept as it stands now is reminiscent of the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor constellation that was to be part of the infamously abortive Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), better known by the derisive nickname Star Wars. That effort, which formally began in 1983, was ultimately abandoned amid ballooning costs and technical issues. While there have been significant technological developments in the intervening decades that could help make the new layered system a reality, there remain a number of hurdles. The difficulty in tracking hypersonic threats after launch when they “go cold” and are difficult for infrared sensors to find, let alone track, is one particularly obvious challenge. This issue is already present when it comes to tracking traditional ballistic missiles , which also have a smaller thermal signature in the mid-course portion of their flight. The U.S. military has been working on a Midcourse Tracking Sensor project to help address this problem, but it remains to be seen when that system will be available for widespread use and if it will be small enough to fit on the satellites SDA is looking at for its Tracking Layer. There has already been separate criticism of the idea that small, commercial derivative satellites will be able to suitably support military requirements, in general. “Launching hundreds of cheap satellites into theater as a substitute for the complex architectures where we provide key capabilities to the warfighter will result in failure on America’s worst day if relied upon alone. The analysis shows that,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said in 2019 . “Increasing the number of satellites helps. But numbers alone are not enough. The study also found that space missions that are not well aligned with commercial, low-Earth orbit satellite are actually better off staying where they are or making other changes to protect themselves.” Former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., USAF When it comes to emerging hypersonic threats, even if U.S. military early-warning satellites can spot and track them, there is also a real debate about whether it ever be truly feasible to try and intercept them. “There is no defense against hypersonic … you’re not gonna defend against it,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley told members of Congress at a hearing this past March. “Those things are going so fast you’re not gonna get it. You gotta shoot the archer. You gotta go deep, downtown and you gotta get it on the offense.” There is also simply a matter of cost. While using distributed constellations of small, relatively low-cost satellites, the total numbers SDA is looking at for its various layers could still very well be fairly expensive to establish and maintain. To support the idea of rapidly replacing lost satellites in a conflict, there will also need to be sufficient stockpiles of spare systems in reserve and on-call launch services ready to put them into space on short notice. For some sense scale, fully replacing the loss of just a tenth of a constellation consisting of 1,000 satellites would mean putting 100 new satellites into orbit. At the same time, it is also worth noting that SpaceX has demonstrated the ability to launch dozens of Starlink satellites at a time. All told, it will be very interesting to see how SDA’s plans for the overarching National Defense Space Architecture continue to evolve now that work on the first tracking and transport satellites is underway.

There are 15 American and British F-35Bs embarked on the carrier, another major milestone in the ship’s history that you can read about more in this recent War Zone piece , and there are also 11 helicopters spread across the entire flotilla. “The new UK Carrier Strike Group is the embodiment of British maritime power and sits at the heart of a modernized and emboldened Royal Navy,” Royal Navy Commodore Steve Moorhouse, commander of the Carrier Strike Group, said. “Protected by a ring of advanced destroyers, frigates, helicopters, and submarines, and equipped with fifth-generation fighters, HMS Queen Elizabeth is able to strike from the sea at a time and place of our choosing; and with our NATO allies at our side, we will be ready to fight and win in the most demanding circumstances. Carrier Strike offers Britain choice and flexibility on the global stage; it reassures our friends and allies and presents a powerful deterrent to would-be adversaries.” CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT CROWN COPYRIGHT The Royal Navy describes the Carrier Strike Group as “the largest and most powerful European-led maritime force in almost 20 years.” It’s certainly an impressive task group, including two of the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers — HMS Diamond and HMS Defender .

This program has suffered notable delays and the first such aircraft will not be available to the carrier until next year, with a limited capability at first. Full operational capability with the Crowsnest is not expected until May 2023. As well as the missing AEW&C component — for the time being, at least — there’s the issue of escort capacity. As currently configured, the Carrier Strike Group is employing fully a third of the Royal Navy’s Type 45 fleet to perform this function. Critics may questions what happens to the Royal Navy’s overall capacity to conduct operations if any significant number of those ships are not available . It also suggests it would be almost impossible to operate two of these strike groups simultaneously. Meanwhile, the Type 23s are perhaps less of an issue, since they are available in greater numbers, but those ships are aging and far less capable. They are supposed to be replaced by the forthcoming Type 26s and the Type 31s, but those ships are still years away from entering service. The availability of Royal Navy escort vessels and the presence of US and Dutch warships in the current Carrier Strike Group points to the fact that the United Kingdom will likely look to allies to address this capacity issue, just as it has done with the U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs now on HMS Queen Elizabeth’s deck. The Royal Navy will have a prime opportunity to explore these issues in Joint Warrior, NATO’s largest annual exercise, which began on October 5, 2020, and will involve almost two weeks of maneuvers in the waters off the northwest and northeast coasts of Scotland. The exercise involves 11 nations (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,  France, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom, and the United States), providing a total of over 6,000 personnel, 81 aircraft, 28 ships, and two submarines. Ahead of the exercise, F-35Bs from the carrier struck targets on a bombing range off the Scottish coast. Joint Warrior itself has already included a simulated attack on the Carrier Strike Group by adversary aircraft, including contractor-operated Dassault Falcon bizjets from Cobham, plus Hawk T1 training jets from the Royal Navy’s 736 Naval Air Squadron, a specialist aggressor unit, whose aircraft are temporarily detached to Aberdeen International Airport in Scotland. While Joint Warrior will be the high point of HMS Queen Elizabeth’s latest period at sea, it’s all part of the build-up to the milestone first operational cruise planned for 2021, when a similar Carrier Strike Group will voyage to the Pacific region in what will be a much more ambitious undertaking. Beyond that, however, the Royal Navy will need to address remaining capability and capacity gaps — including AEW&C cover and escort availability — in order to get the most out of its new carriers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 9, 2020",India Has Tested A Very Long Range Supersonic Anti-Submarine Missile For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India says that it has successfully tested a new supersonic anti-submarine missile . This missile carries a lightweight torpedo as its warhead and releases it over the designated target area, after which that weapon operates as normal and uses its own guidance system to seek out the enemy submarine. Dubbed the Supersonic Missile Assisted Release of Torpedo, or SMART, this could give Indian warships, and potentially shore-based units, a valuable additional stand-off tool in the face of growing submarine threats from adversaries, especially China . The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), Indian Ministry of Defense’s top research and development arm, announced the SMART test on Oct. 5, 2020. A ground-based, truck-mounted launcher was used to fire the weapon from Wheeler Island, just off the coast of northeast India in the Bay of Bengal. “All the mission objectives including the flight upto [sic] the range and altitude, separation of the nose cone, release of Torpedo and deployment of Velocity Reduction Mechanism (VRM) [a parachute] have been met perfectly,” an official DRDO statement read. “The tracking stations (Radars, Electro Optical Systems) along the coast and telemetry stations including down range ships monitored all the events.” Development of SMART began in 2016 and the goal is reportedly for the missile to have a maximum range of 650 kilometers, or just under 404 miles. It’s unclear how far the weapon flew in this particular test. The missile’s warhead is Torpedo Advanced Light (TAL), also known as the Shyena. TAL, which is an acoustic homing torpedo, reportedly has an endurance of approximately six minutes , which translates to an operational range of around 10 miles at a maximum speed of 33 knots, giving it some additional time in which to find its target after hitting the water. A TAL (at top) and another picture (at bottom) showing on the torpedoes being fired from a shipboard launcher during a test., DRDO It’s important to note that anti-submarine missiles, as well as rockets, with torpedoes as warheads, are not new. For instance, the U.S. Navy fields the RUM-139 Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (VL-ARSOC), which is fired from standard Mk 41 Vertical Launch System cells and carries a Mk 54 lightweight torpedo. Another example is the Russian RPK-6, a Soviet-era design that NATO also calls the SS-N-16 Stallion, which is curiously fired first into the water from a torpedo tube before blasting off into the sky, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . There are also already at least one supersonic design, Japan’s Type 07 vertically-launched anti-submarine rocket, in service. A RUM-139 VL-ASROC., USN A test of the Japanese Type 07., Japanese Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency However, where India’s SMART differs most from any of these designs, is in its range. The Japanese Type 07 reportedly has a range of over 30 kilometers, or more than 18 miles. VL-ASROC’s stated range is approximately 22 kilometers, or just under 14 miles. The RPK-6 has a substantially greater maximum range compared to these weapons of some 60 miles, but that’s still a fraction of the distance DRDO is hoping that its weapon will be able to fly. The test missile could be “a game-changer technology demonstration in the Anti-Submarine Warfare,” according to the official press release. If the weapon works as advertised and with sufficient surveillance capacity and networking to back it up, it will give any ship able to carry it a dramatically longer-range anti-submarine capability. Other ships, as well anti-submarine helicopters operating from them, such as the Indian Navy’s future MH-60R Seahawks , could potentially feed targeting information to vessels armed with SMART after finding enemy submarines, giving them additional flexibility to engage those threats rapidly. Other platforms, including maritime patrol aircraft, such as India’s P-8I Poseidons , a variant of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon , could also help in spotting and tracking targets. An Indian Navy P-8I Poseidon. , Clemens Vasters via Wikimedia With a range of just over 400 miles, SMART also has the potential to be used in a ground-launched role against submarines detected attempting to get close to important coastal areas. Some reports have already indicated that DRDO is exploring land-based applications, but it is not clear if the launcher used in the recent test is indicative in any way of a potential operational system. The launch system used to fire the SMART missile in the recent test., DRDO Getting the Indian Navy a longer-range anti-submarine weapon that is both more flexible and more responsive makes good sense given the growing submarine threat it faces from China and, to a lesser extent, Pakistan. India is facing the prospect of increasing Chinese naval and commercial maritime activity in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, in general. When it comes to submarines, China is notably continuing to steadily expand the size and overall capability of its submarine forces , especially with the addition of larger, more capable boats better suited to longer-range blue water operations. This includes nuclear and advanced conventionally-powered designs with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems, which are quieter and therefore harder to detect than China’s older diesel-electric submarines. One of China’s Type 093 Shang class submarines, the most modern nuclear-powered attack boats presently in the People’s Liberation Army Navy., via Sinodefense.com Pakistan has two Agosta-70 class submarines and three more Agosta-90B types, all of which were originally made in France. Tests were being carried out a few years ago on a nuclear-capable submarine-launched land-attack cruise missile that the Agosta-90Bs could fire, which would make them an important component of the country’s second-strike nuclear deterrent capability, as well. A Pakistani Agosta-90B class submarine., AP On top of this, Pakistan announced plans to buy eight new Type 039 submarines from China in 2015. These boats, none of which have yet been delivered, will reportedly be improved variants of that design with AIP systems. The Pakistani Navy is set to receive the first of these in 2023. All of this comes as India has suffered its own trials and tribulations with its submarine fleets in recent years. In 2017, it emerged that all eight of India’s Sindhughosh class boats, a variant of the Russian Kilo class and the Indian Navy’s most numerous submarine type, had only one working periscope each, instead of two as designed. The ones that were working had no low-light-level or night-vision capability. There has been work since then to install new periscopes from U.S. defense contractor L3 Communications. However, last year, the INS Sindhukesari suffered a fire while it was in the process of this refit, sidelining it for at least a month. India’s first nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, INS Arihant , also suffered a mishap in which a hatch was mistakenly left open that left it out of commission for nearly a year. India’s second Arighat class submarine, the INS Arighat , which key to its own second-strike nuclear deterrent capability, is presently undergoing sea trials and is set to be commissioned before the end of the year. Since 2007, the Indian Navy has also been working to select a new conventionally-powered attack submarine design as part of its Project-75 or P75I tender. That effort is looking to acquire a total of six new submarines and could be worth up to $7 billion in total. In January, Indian authorities announced that they had short-listed two domestic shipyards to work with the winner of the competition to build the boats in the country. Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, France’s Naval Group, Spain’s Navantia, Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering have all submitted bids. Now, with SMART, India looks to be taking important steps to significantly bolster its anti-submarine capabilities, as well. As the future battlespace becomes more networked overall, the concept embodied in this weapon will become more relevant and other countries, including the United States, could well find themselves pursuing similar endeavors.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 12, 2020",Russian Flight Test Center Flew A “Cabriolet” Su-57 Fighter Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The path to getting a fighter jet, or any other military aircraft, into service is a long and arduous one, involving many hours of testing in the air and on the ground to measure each performance parameter and check every characteristic. One of the more unusual tests that a fighter can be put through is flying without a canopy , to better assess the stresses and strains on the aircraft and pilot during an emergency egress procedure. This is essentially what happens in the cockpit in the few seconds between the canopy being jettisoned and the ejection seat blasting the pilot away to safety. This, it seems, is a type of test that Su-57 Felon bort number “058” took part in, as revealed in a documentary video produced to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the establishment of the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center at Akhtubinsk, in southern Russia’s Astrakhan region. Also known as T-50-8, this aircraft made its maiden flight from Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East on November 17, 2016. Although this was the eighth prototype, it was actually the seventh to fly, as T-50-7 was completed solely for static tests on the ground. The full video, seen below, was posted on the Russian Ministry of Defense’s YouTube channel last week and the “cabriolet version” of the Su-57 advanced combat jet appears around the 1:10-minute mark. The video is also worth watching for the rest of its content, which includes a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S Flanker fighter launching a very-long-range R-37M air-to-air missile. You can read more about that in this recent article . The footage clearly shows the test pilot, apparently wearing a non-standard protective flight suit, at the controls of the Su-57 at altitude over Russia, presumably operating from the Akhtubinsk test center. The cockpit windscreen remains in place, while the rear portion has been removed entirely, including the framework. The Felon’s single pilot is normally provided with a K-36D-5 ejection seat, PPK-7 flight suit, and ZSh-10 helmet, all of which were developed by the Zvezda company specifically for the jet. You can read all about the Su-57’s unique feature-set and design philosophy in this previous War Zone feature . The test flight recalls a famous sortie flown in the United Kingdom during the development of the Panavia Tornado strike aircraft by British Aerospace (BAe) test pilot Keith Hartley in 1988. According to BAE Systems, the successor company to BAe, that “cockpit habitability trial” was conducted for “testing the emergency escape procedures of the jet.” As a two-seat jet, the Tornado was flown on that occasion with the rear position unoccupied and the navigator’s ejection seat removed. The Tornado trial was flown at a speed of around 500 knots. Reportedly, Hartley discovered that above 500 knots, the pilot’s life was made distinctly uncomfortable by kinetically heated air hitting the back of the cockpit and then being deflected back toward them. It is noteworthy that while this type of test mission is no longer flown in the United States, there are occasions when a U.S. military jet is flown without its canopy as the result of an inflight mishap. You can read more about such events in these past War Zone stories , respectively . Hartley flew the Tornado trial in 1988, six years after the aircraft first entered service. While we don’t have a date for the Su-57 mission, the jet is not yet in frontline service, although examples have already flown some kind of “combat evaluation” in Syria. While the first production Su-57 was lost in a December 2019 crash , the second aircraft was still under construction as of August 2020 . The crash last year was attributed to a failure of the flight-control system and the pilot was able to safely eject. Those first two production aircraft are part of an order for 76 examples announced by Moscow in May 2019, with deliveries due to be completed by 2028. In the meantime, the closest the Russian Aerospace Forces have got to operational Su-57s are those pre-production prototypes flown by the Akhtubinsk test center, which is tasked with state evaluation of military aircraft, ensuring they meet requirements before being formally commissioned into service. As the Su-57 heads toward frontline service with the Russian Aerospace Forces, further trials of the jet and its associated weaponry will undoubtedly ramp up. As long as the ejection system works, as has already been demonstrated, it seems unlikely, that we will see another Felon test sortie that looks quite as bizarre as this one.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 15, 2020",Watch This C-17 Crew Experience Sinister-Looking St. Elmo’s Fire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Air Force’s 99 Squadron has released a brief and creepy-looking video showing a weather phenomenon known as St. Elmo’s fire developing on the nose cone of one of its C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft during a recent nighttime flight near the equator. St. Elmo’s fire involves the creation of plasma in the air, which can look like fire. In this case, the flashes also briefly give the pitch-black sky an ominous red tinge the feel reminiscent of a horror movie or a sci-fi film, such as The Final Countdown , which involves the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Nimitz traveling back in time after passing through an electrical-storm-like warp hole . The clip appeared on the 99 Squadron’s official Twitter account on Oct. 5, 2020. The C-17 in question was reportedly flying through the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) at the time. Also known as the doldrums, this is a region near the equator that shifts depending on the season and is famously known for long periods without any kind of windy weather, which presents a real hazard to sailing ships that do not have some form of backup propulsion. It is also known for helping to produce thunderstorms and other extreme weather conditions. One of 99 Squadron’s C-17s., USAF “This is what the office looks like to a @99Sqn C-17 crew navigating their way through the ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone) at night!” a Tweet accompanying the video read. “The electrical weather phenomenon of St Elmo’s Fire isn’t dangerous, but it usually means you’re surrounded by storms!” St. Elmo’s fire occurs when the electrical field around a pointed object is sufficiently charged to ionize the air around it, turning it into plasma . This results in a blue or violet glow and is often accompanied by lightning-like bursts of electricity, leading often to it being incorrectly called “ball lightning,” which is a separate and unexplained phenomenon . The glow is often followed by a hissing or buzzing sound. There is no apparent sound in the 99 Squadron video. Descriptions of and references to what appears to have been instances of St. Elmo’s fire can be found as far back as antiquity, but the name refers to the Christian patron saint of sailors, St. Erasmus of Formia , or St. Elmo, and dates to the 16th century. While the phenomenon is well known to form around the nose cones of planes flying in areas of the sky with a high degree of electrical activity, it can also appear at the tips of pointed structures on the ground or on ships, such as masts, where mariners often took it as a divine omen. Another example of St. Elmo’s fire occurring outside of an aircraft, in this case a U.S. Air Force KC-10A Extender tanker, while in flight., DOD https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lgv-3ITbOm4 Historically, it has been taken as a good sign, indicating the presence of St. Elmo watching over a ship and its crew, but that doesn’t change how foreboding it often looks, especially in this case. Thankfully, as the Tweet from 99 Squadron noted, this phenomenon is harmless by itself. The crew of this C-17 appears to have been able to safely navigate any thunderstorms or more extreme weather nearby and was simply treated to the light show happening in front of their cockpit.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 3, 2021",Russian Air-To-Air Missile Tests Signal Potential New Capabilities For Flanker and Felon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent videos from Russia indicate that the country may be on the verge of introducing significant new air-to-air missile capabilities to its most advanced combat jets. One clip shows a Su-57 Felon advanced combat jet carrying one, or perhaps two, new variants of the R-77 medium-range air-to-air missile family, while another shows a Su-35S fighter jet, the latest variant of the Flanker series, test-firing a very-long-range R-37M long-range air-to-air missile. The footage of the Su-57 with the K-77s was contained within a recently released official documentary commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the founding of the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center at Akhtubinsk. The video of the Su-35S firing the R-37M emerged in an official Russian Ministry of Defense video marking the same occasion late last week. This center is responsible for the state evaluation of military aircraft, including determining which air-launched weapons are cleared for frontline service. In the first documentary, seen below in full, four Su-57 fighters are seen flying in formation at one point. One of the jets is carrying external weapons, including what may be two new versions of the medium-range R-77, which has the NATO reporting name AA-12 Adder. The second aircraft in the formation appears to be carrying an improved version of the R-77, the K-77M, also known as Izdeliye 180, under its left wing, while under the right wing it may carry an example of the ramjet-powered Izdeliye 180-PD. The lack of the basic R-77’s characteristic “lattice” fins at the rear of both the missiles indicates that they are different versions of the weapon, but exactly which models the Su-57 is carrying is not entirely clear. Russia first began the development of the original active-radar-guided R-77, also known as the Izdeliye 170, back in the early 1980s as a counterpart to the U.S. AIM-120 AMRAAM. It did not enter service before the collapse of that Soviet Union, only becoming part of Russia’s arsenal in 1994. An improved R-77-1, Izdeliye 170-1, was subsequently introduced on Russian Flanker fighters and has been noted on combat operations during the air force’s operations in Syria . This weapon offers improved resistance to countermeasures, a more sensitive seeker, and aerodynamic refinements — the lattice fins at the rear are retained. A Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S intercepts a U.S. Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. The fighter is armed with R-77-1 missiles, plus an infrared-guided R-27T furthest outboard., U.S. NAVAL FORCES EUROPE-AFRICA While the R-77-1 was viewed as an interim upgrade, the K-77M is the next stage in the development of the missile, with conventional control fins allowing internal carriage in the Su-57’s weapons bay. Doing away with the old grid fins not only permits internal carriage but also reduces the missile’s aerodynamic drag and radar cross-section. Other changes include a new dual-pulse rocket motor and a further enhanced radar seeker. The dual-pulse engine ensures that thrust output is maintained throughout the missile’s flight profile, allowing improved high-altitude maneuvering, extended range, and enhanced endgame performance. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the K-77M offers double the range of the R-77; that would imply a range of up to 100 miles for the new weapon. A cropped view of the second Su-57 in the formation, apparently armed with new variants of the R-77 missile., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP Vympel has claimed the K-77M will be superior to the AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM and equal to subsequent AMRAAM developments — presumably, the AIM-120D. The manufacturer has also claimed the new weapon is capable of engaging anti-aircraft missiles fired at the launch aircraft, even missiles approaching from the rear. It’s important to note that although the K-77M was designed for the outset to be carried inside the Su-57’s internal weapons bay, Russian doctrine evidently sees a requirement for external stores in at least some situations. In a high-threat environment, fighting against a peer foe, it would be expected that the Felon carries its weapons internally, to reduce its radar cross-section. However, in less-contested environments, or in the latter stages of a conflict, after enemy air defenses have been suppressed, additional stores could be carried underwing. These might include external fuel tanks and other stores that might not fit in the weapons bays. Russia is developing other air-to-air missiles that the Su-57 could carry internally, as well. This includes the Vympel K-74M2, or Izdeliye 760, intended for deployment from the aircraft’s internal “quick launch” weapons bays. This may, or may not be, the previously unseen compact weapon, pictures of which first emerged in November 2019. You can read more about these developments in these past War Zone stories , respectively. For external carriage on the Su-57, and offering yet greater range than the K-77M, there is the secretive Izdeliye 180-PD, in which the suffix stands for Priamotochnyi Dvigatel, or ramjet engine in Russian. This is pitched as a Russian counterpart to the pan-European MBDA Meteor air-to-air missile and utilizes a combined rocket-ramjet powerplant. Reportedly developed as a private venture by Vympel, it’s unclear if the weapon has been ordered by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Deployment of a rocket-ramjet air-to-air missile would be a significant boost for the Russian Aerospace Forces. In contrast to a normal rocket motor, this type of propulsion allows the missile’s engine to be throttled during different phases of flight, ensuring a high-energy state during the terminal attack phase. You can read more about the specific advantages of ramjet missiles in this War Zone article . Previous images of the ramjet-powered Adder have been limited to mock-ups at arms exhibitions and unofficial artist’s impressions. As such, the available video evidence is insufficient to determine whether the Su-57 is carrying an example of the Izdeliye 180-PD and one K-77M, or two K-77Ms, or potentially other derivatives of the weapon. Evidence in favor of the Izdeliye 180-PD includes what appears to be a ramjet air intake under the weapon furthest from the camera. However, the quality of the video is such that this could be a distorted view of one of the stabilizing fins on the missile’s center section. R-37M for Su-35S The other video footage that emerged recently, seen below, shows apparent trials of the very-long-range R-37M launched from a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S fighter, with the bort number “52 Red.” Previously, the R-37M was only known to be carried operationally by the MiG-31 Foxhound heavy interceptor and the weapon itself was very rarely seen. The missile is seen launched from a mid-wing pylon under the right wing of the Flanker, apparently using a trapeze-type ejector. According to Russian accounts , the Su-35S can carry a maximum of four R-37Ms: two under the wings and another pair below the fuselage. The Su-35S carrying an R-37M missile under its right wing, moments before launch., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP The R-37M accelerates away., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP The heavyweight R-37M — known to NATO as the AA-13 Axehead — has a long and protracted history. A product of the prolific Vympel design house, which is responsible for all current Russian air-to-air missile (AAM) families — the program dates back to the early 1990s when it began life as the R-37, intended to arm the Foxhound in its much-improved MiG-31M version. An example of the original K-37, also known by the in-house designation izdeliye 610, was first launched from a MiG-31M in 1993, destroying an aerial target at a range of 142 miles. While K-37 tests were successfully completed early the following year, the demise of the Soviet Union meant the improved MiG-31M was canceled as a cost-saving measure, together with its planned armament. However, with subsequent plans to upgrade in-service Foxhounds to MiG-31BM standard , the K-37 program was revisited at the beginning of the 2000s. Development now focused on the enhanced K-37M/R-37M, or Izdeliye 610M. The revised missile was first launched from a MiG-31 in 2011 and completed its service trials in early 2014 before entering production. As well as the MiG-31BM that is its primary launch platform, the 13-foot-long R-37M has long been associated with the Su-35, but it seems it was first launched from a Flanker variant this year. In April 2020, a report from the Russian newspaper Izvestia stated that Su-35S fighters had begun captive-carry flights with the R-37M, with test launches to begin later this year. The weapon has also been marketed as an option for the MiG-35 Fulcrum fighter, although this aircraft has yet to enter frontline service in Russia or anywhere else, as you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Clearly, the R-37M is intended to engage targets at a prodigious range and, in the past, Western analysts have suspected the weapon was tailored to defeat airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft and other high-value assets. However, since the R-37M was developed to serve as the primary armament of the MiG-31 interceptor, it should be capable of engaging a wide range of targets, including low-flying cruise missiles. By way of comparison, the MiG-31’s original R-33 AAM can destroy targets out to a range of 68 miles. The furthest-flying version of the U.S. AMRAAM, the AIM-120D , is thought to have a range of up to 100 miles, although official performance numbers are classified. In the past, Western observers have suggested that an ultra-long-range version of the R-37M would be developed, with a jettisonable rocket booster increasing the range up to almost 250 miles, although there’s no evidence of this, and it may result from confusion with the rival Novator K-100 missile, or Izdeliye 172S. Nearly 20 feet long, this weapon attracted no little interest when shown in public in the early 1990s and ultimately lost out to the K-37. According to data from the manufacturer, the R-37M, at least in its RVV-BD export form, can defeat “some types” of aerial targets at a range of up to 124 miles. The qualification here suggests that only larger, and probably less agile, aircraft can be engaged at the outer edges of the missile’s flight envelope. As ever, with such “sales brochure figures,” it should be remembered that these likely reflect missile performance in the optimum conditions, and in reality, they will vary greatly depending on the type of engagement and the energy and altitude state of the launching aircraft. The missile is powered by a dual-pulse solid-propellant rocket motor. It flies toward its target guided by an onboard dual-band active radar seeker, while an inertial navigation system receives mid-course updates from the launch aircraft. During the terminal phase of the engagement, the seeker can lock on to a target with a 54-square-foot radar cross-section at 25 miles or more, the manufacturer claims. Like the R-33 that preceded it, the R-37M is said to be capable of being armed with a nuclear warhead for destroying larger formations of aircraft or missiles. Exactly why the Russian Aerospace Forces are choosing to integrate the R-37M with the Su-35S at this point is unclear. It could be that with the MiG-31 increasingly taking on new roles — including air-to-ground missile strike and anti-satellite — the Flanker is expected to play a greater role in long-range air defense. It’s also possible that the work is being driven by hopes of securing export orders of the R-37M to new or existing Flanker operators. In the future, it’s expected that the R-37M will arm the Su-57, too. Taken together, the videos do demonstrate that Russia is currently working hard to expand the armories of both its current and future fighters, including air-to-air missiles that should be able to out-range current Western counterparts.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 3, 2020",Navy Establishes First Squadron To Operate Its Carrier-Based MQ-25 Stingray Tanker Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A year from now, the U.S. Navy will have officially established the first squadron that will operate its future MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based unmanned tankers from Boeing. The service does not expect to begin test flying more refined MQ-25 prototypes from actual carriers until the end of next year, at the earliest. As such, this unit will be focused on training personnel to be as ready as possible to operate and maintain those drones when they begin arriving in the coming years. The Navy first began the formal processing of standing up Unmanned Carrier Launched Multi-Role Squadron 10, abbreviated VUQ-10, in August, according to an official internal notice. That document says the official establishment date is Oct. 1, 2021, and that the unit will be located at Naval Base Ventura Country in California, which includes Naval Air Station Point Mugu. A detachment of Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19 (VUP-19), the Navy’s first MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drone unit, also calls Point Mugu home. USN USN USN The notice also says that VUQ-10 will be assigned to the Navy’s Airborne Command & Control Logistics Wing (ACCLOGWING), which presently oversees the service’s E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound fleets. The Wing’s website already says that it is involved in the Stingray drone program through the MQ-25 Fleet Integration Team (FIT). From ACCLOGWING, the rest of VUQ-10’s chain of command then goes first to Naval Air Forces Pacific and then U.S. Pacific Fleet. This appears to be purely for administrative purposes. The Navy has said in the past that the Nimitz -class carriers USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS George H.W. Bush , both of which are homeported in Norfolk, Virginia on the East Coast of the United States, would be the first to receive the necessary equipment to operate the MQ-25s. USN VUQ-10’s official role will be as the so-called Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for the MQ-25, making it responsible for training crews to operate the drones, as well as ground personnel to maintain them. Standing up the FRS now will “allow personnel time to attain advanced qualifications ahead of aircraft delivery,” according to the Navy notice. That being said, depending on the overall size of the MQ-25 fleet, initially, detachments from VUQ-10 may also have an operational role. “To conduct, through self-sustaining detachments, long-range aerial refueling support to joint force maritime component commanders, carrier strike groups, and naval task forces as directed by numbered fleet commanders,” is the unit’s official mission, per the official document regarding its establishment. It seems likely that the squadron will also be heavily involved in the development of new tactics, techniques, and procedures around the operation of the drones and their place in the Navy’s future carrier air wings. Being based at Point Mugu would give the unit easy access to the Navy’s expansive training off the coast of Southern California, where carriers and other vessels, as well as the service’s own aircraft and those from other branches of the U.S. military, regularly train. The Navy has said that it expects to buy at least 72 Stingrays , for a total cost of around $13 billion, and that it hopes to reach initial operational capability with the type in 2024. At present, Boeing is under contract to build four Engineering Development Model (EDM) prototypes, the first of which it hopes to deliver next year. For more than a year now, the company has already been conducting various ground and flight tests using a demonstrator drone, known as T1 . Boeing employees attach a probe-and-drogue refueling pod to the T1 demonstrator drone that company has been using to support the development of the MQ-25., Boeing The primary mission of the Stingrays will be to providing aerial refueling support to carrier air wings, a role presently filled by F/A-18E/F Super Hornets carrying buddy refueling stores. The MQ-25 will allow those manned fighter jets to focus on other missions and otherwise reducing the strain on those aircraft. The drones are also expected to significantly increase the overall reach of the carrier’s fixed wing strike aircraft. USN There is already discussion, however, about using these unmanned aircraft in other roles beyond tanking, including for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The Navy has also said that it expects drones, including designs beyond the MQ-25, to become an increasingly larger and more important part of carrier air wings in the future. VUQ-10 will play an important role in laying the groundwork for future unmanned operations from carrier decks, broadly. The squadron, and the personnel that will be assigned to it, now looks set to blaze the trail for the MQ-25s, as well as subsequent carrier-based unmanned aircraft, which are set to fundamentally change the character of the Navy’s future carrier air wings. Correction: The original version of this story said that the effective formal establishment date for VUQ-10 was Oct. 1, 2020. The date is actually Oct. 1, 2021.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 20, 2020",Air Force C-17 Launched A Pallet Of Mock Cruise Missiles During Recent Arsenal Plane Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft simulated the launch of multiple AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile cruise missiles via a palletized system during a recent major demonstration exercise. This is the latest in a series of experiments to evaluate the possibility of using cargo aircraft as so-called “ arsenal planes ” to provide additional strike capacity, especially during a high-end conflict. The Air Force Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) office within the Air Force Research Laboratory announced on September 30, 2020, that it had conducted the test as part of the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) Onramp #2 event, which had wrapped up earlier that month. The 412th Test Wing led the palletized munition test flight, in cooperation with Air Mobility Command, which provided the C-17A from one of its units at McChord Air Force Base in Washington State. It’s not clear where the simulated launch actually took place, but the ABMS Onramp #2 included demonstrations at the ranges surrounding Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, and in the Gulf of Mexico. A  combined operations center and intelligence fusion cell at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland helped coordinate the various activities. A C-17A Globemaster III assigned to the 62nd Airlift Wing based at McChord Air Force Base, similar to the one used in the recent arsenal plane experiment., USAF The overall goal of the event was to explore how the various communications and data sharing networks and related systems under development as part of the ABMS program could help link together various sensors and weapon systems. Cruise missile defense was a major focus area, with the event including a first-of-its-kind demonstration of a U.S. Army howitzer shooting down a target drone acting as a surrogate cruise missile using a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) after receiving targeting information from off-board sources. Increased network connectivity is also extremely important for the arsenal plane concept, as cargo aircraft do not generally have means of identifying targets at stand-off ranges and then gathering the necessary information to engage them all on their own. Other platforms would almost certainly be responsible for feeding that information to airlifters operating in this role. Transports, such as the C-17, would then use their large load carrying capacity, combined with palletized launch systems, to offer means of rapidly engaging a large number of targets across a broad area. Being able to quickly convert airlifters to and from an arsenal plane configuration would also give the Air Force a very flexible and relatively low-cost means of generating large amounts of extra strike capacity, especially compared to procuring additional heavy bombers. “A Palletized Munitions capability could enable various airlift aircraft to employ a range of weapons en masse via a self-contained, roll-on/roll-off palletized system, and may offer an alternative way for the Air Force to bring more mass to the fight,” Dr. Dean Evans, the Palletized Munitions Experimentation Program Manager at SDPE, said in a statement after the test during the ABMS Onramp event. “The successful demo represents a key step in SDPE’s Palletized Munitions Experimentation Campaign, which will determine if the Palletized Munitions concept is feasible and provides a competitive advantage for the warfighter.” The stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family of land-attack cruise missiles would be especially capable and combat-proven weapons to combine with the arsenal plane concept. The standard A model has a range of around 230 miles, while the extended range B variant can hit targets out to around 575 miles or more. The Air Force is in the process of acquiring an extreme-range D version now, as well, that will have a range in excess of 1,000 miles. Integrating these weapons into the service’s palletized munitions systems could also serve as a stepping stone to adding the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), a derivative of the JASSM, to the mix, further expanding the capabilities of future arsenal planes. Air Force personnel load inert AGM-158 JASSMs onto a B-52 bomber., USAF It first emerged in April that AFRL was exploring palletized munitions concepts, or what it referred to as a “ bomb bay in a box .” The following month, the Air Force revealed that it had conducted at least five test flights of prototype and surrogate systems since January. At least one of these tests involved the release of a previously unseen multi-purpose expendable air vehicle dubbed the Cargo Launch Expendable Air Vehicles with Extended Range (CLEAVER). Initially described a long-range stand-off precision-guided munition, it is possible that CLEAVER could be used to carry other payloads to carry out other missions, such as acting as a decoy using an electronic warfare package . A pair of CLEAVER munitions on a palletized launch system fall from the back of an Air Force Special Operations Command MC-130J Command II special operations transport-tanker aircraft during another arsenal plane test earlier in 2020., USAF The Air Force is separately working on a program, known as Golden Horde , to increase the networking capabilities of its munitions, themselves, with the goal of enabling them to operate as autonomous swarms. There is another initiative, called Gray Wolf , that has been exploring technology that could be used in the development of low-cost cruise missiles. Both of these efforts would be very applicable to the arsenal plane concept, as well. A test article developed under the Gray Wolf program, which was focused on exploring technologies applicable to low-cost cruise missiles., USAF C-17s and other airlifters acting as arsenal planes could also provide additional close air support or other strike capabilities in lower-risk environments using precision-guided bombs or other shorter-range weapons. The range of these aircraft would enable them to loiter for extended periods over portions of the battlefield, as well. The Air Force had already revealed that C-17 had flown just this kind of mission during the ABMS Onramp event, as well, dropping loads of palletized Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-guided bombs. “This concept, once fully mature, is for the munitions to behave just as if they were dropped from a bomber aircraft,” Air Force General Jacqueline Van Ovost, the head of Air Mobility Command, said during the Air Force Association’s main annual convention, held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in September. “They separate from the airplane, they ignite their motors, fly to pre-designated waypoints using different flight altitudes, and then they strike their targets.” “Our ability to flex to use this airplane [the C-17] in multiple ways is what really brings this richness to operations. While we’re flying regular cargo deployments and distributions, there are still lots of legs where we’re flying airplanes where you have the capacity to do so,” she continued. “We haven’t really looked at the full concept to see how many it would take, and this is not taking the place of any of the Global Strike capabilities. This is just the capability we want to have, should we need it, and if we pull it into an [operations] plan, that’s great.” This is certainly not the first time that the Air Force has explored the arsenal plane concept or looked into using airlifters as impromptu bombers, as you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is capable already of employing the huge GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) bomb using its MC-130H Combat Talon II and MC-130J Commando II special operations transport-tankers. However, this is a highly specialized weapon that has been, to date, employed only once, in Afghanistan in 2017 .  AFSOC’s AC-130 gunships are now guided weapons trucks in their own right, as well. “It’s a little different from what special operations is doing,” General Van Ovost had said last month of the present arsenal plane and palletized munitions efforts. All told, the Air Force looks to be moving quickly to explore these concepts anew and it will be very interesting to see how these projects continue to evolve in the near term. If they are pursued to an operational capability, they could drastically increase the USAF’s ability to carry large numbers of heavy weapons into the fight over long ranges, which is absurdly relevant considering the challenges faced with a potential fight against a peer-state, especially in the vast Pacific theater.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 10, 2020",Video Points To Azerbaijan’s First Use Of Israeli-Made Ballistic Missile Against Armenia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged online suggesting that Azerbaijan has employed one of its Israeli-made LORA short-range ballistic missiles to cut a bridge between Armenia and the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh . If confirmed, this would be the first use of this weapon in combat anywhere in the world and represent a significant escalation in the nearly week-old conflict between the two countries over this long-disputed region. The clip of the missile reportedly hitting the bridge near the Armenian border village of Asagi Sus first appeared on social media on Oct. 2, 2020. This development comes amid a new and particularly serious burst of fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, which first erupted on Sept. 27. You can learn all about this emerging conflict in the War Zone ‘s previous coverage of the crisis . Since a ceasefire deal ended a war over the region in 1994, the territory, which is widely recognized to be part of Azerbaijan, has been under the de facto control of the Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh. There have been numerous skirmishes and bouts of more significant fighting in the intervening decades. In the new footage from Asagi Sus, which appears to have been captured via a close circuit television (CCTV) system of some kind, the missile is visible briefly before it impacts. It looks to be similar, if not identical in shape and size to Israel Aerospace Industries’ LORA, which stands for Long Range Attack. Azerbaijan received as many as 50 LORA missiles, along with trucks equipped with four-round containerized launchers, between 2017 and 2018, according to the Stockholm Internal Peace Research Institute’s databases . Rob Lee, a PhD student in the Department of War Studies at King’s College London who researches Russian defense policy and related issues, Tweeted out that using LORA for this kind of precision strike would have made good sense given its reported ability to reliably hit within 10 meters, or just under 33 feet, of the designated target. Azerbaijan’s Soviet-era Tochka-U short-range ballistic missiles are not nearly as precise, nor are its very long-range rocket artillery systems. LORA’s ability to carry a 1,000-pound-class unitary high-explosive warhead would also make it powerful enough to severely damage or destroy a target such as a bridge. The other precision-guided weapons Azerbaijan has employed so far in the conflict are small glide bombs dropped from its Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed drones and various Israeli-made loitering munitions , none of which have this kind of destructive capability. Beyond taking out bridges, LORA could offer Azerbaijan a means to block tunnels or simply crater narrow roads in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is already hard to traverse in many places for vehicles, especially heavy armor. As such, these missiles could have a very valuable strategic role in preventing the movement of reinforcements and other supplies to the front lines. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, in the black suit, stands in front of a truck-mounted launcher for the LORA ballistic missile., Government of Azerbaijan At the same time, the use of these ballistic missiles would also represent a notable escalation in the conflict that could draw an in-kind response from Armenia. Azerbaijani authorities have already accused Armenian forces of employing their own Tochka-Us in the conflict. Armenia’s Ministry of Defense denied those accusations and warned Azerbaijan against provoking a real missile strike . Armenia’s armed forces notably have more modern Russian-made Iskander-E quasi-ballistic missiles, in addition to their Soviet-era Tochka-U and Scud short-range-range ballistic missiles. An Armenian Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile on its transporter-erector-launcher., Jonj7490 via Wikimedia There were reports that some of Armenia’s Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile systems had shot down incoming missiles headed toward the country’s capital Yerevan on the night of Oct. 1-2, leading to speculation that Azerbaijan might have fired ballistic missiles at the city. The Armenian Ministry of Defense subsequently claimed that the S-300s had downed three unspecified Azerbaijani drones, not missiles. No matter how the use of ballistic missiles in the current Nagorno-Karabakh conflict does or does not evolve, there already is and continues to be a very real air war, which Azerbaijan’s TB2 drones and loitering munitions have so far dominated. These unmanned aircraft have scored dozens of hits so far on a wide array of assets belong to Armenian forces and those the Republic of Artsakh, including air defense systems, tanks and other armored vehicles, and more. The ominous hum of the small engine on the Israeli-made Harop loitering munition, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , has become a persistent feature of the fighting. Azerbaijani authorities have certainly sought to capitalize on the potentially demoralizing impact of these explosive-laden drones constantly zipping around the battlefield. The country’s Border Guard so far has released at least two very brief propaganda videos simply featuring the Harop and the sound of its engine along with the message “Karabakh is Azerbaijan!.” The Border Guard has also released a music video in which the Harop is featured prominently, along with other weapons, including the country’s Russian-made TOS-1A thermobaric artillery rocket launchers. The over-the-top patriotic video features singers Narmin Karimbayova, a former The Voice of Azerbaijan contestant, and Ceyhun Zeynalov, as well as the band Nur Group. Two years ago, Karimbayova and Nur Group also performed in a similar production two years ago, which also offered a then-rare look at Azerbaijan’s Harops. Armenian and Republic of Artsakh forces claim to have shot down dozens of Azerbaijani drones, but it has been extremely difficult to independently verify these claims. Videos are circulating on social media reportedly showing Azerbaijani An-2 biplane aircraft being shot down over the region, as well. It’s not clear how these aircraft being used in the conflict, but they could be used to insert specialized personnel or conduct small aerial supply drops in hard to reach areas. These aircraft, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , can fly very low and slow and have a relatively small radar signature given their fabric-covered wings. On the Armenian side, there continue to be so far unsubstantiated claims that a Turkish F-16 fighter jet shot down one of that country’s Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft. There are also competing reports that two Armenian Su-25s have been lost, so far, after hitting mountainsides during low-level operations in the region. How the conflict, overall, may continue to develop, no matter what weapons are being used, remains to be seen. Russia, one of Armenia’s chief international partners, has issued a joint call for a ceasefire together with France and the United States. The three countries are members of what is known as the Minsk Group, which the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) formed in the early 1990s to help bring an end to the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh that was raging at that time. Armenia has welcomed that call , but has demanded that Turkey first end its support for Azerbaijan. Turkey denies being actively involved in the fighting, but there are mounting reports that the Turkish government has facilitated the movement of Syrian militants into the country to bolster Azerbaijani forces. Azerbaijan has called for the full restoration of its control over the region as a prerequisite for a ceasefire and Turkey has said it fully supports that position. What is clear is that the fighting shows no signs of slowing down yet and may be entering a new, more serious phase if ballistic missiles, such as Azerbaijan’s LORAs, begin seeing more widespread use in the conflict.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 31, 2020",The President Contracting COVID-19 Is A Major National Security Crisis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Commander In Chief has tested positive for SARS-COV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, this is a bad moment for the country, especially in terms of the potential national security implications of this situation, one that is largely unheard of. While Presidents have been incapacitated in the past, the highly infectious and wily nature of this disease means that incapacitation is further complicated by isolation and the possibility that the same deadly virus spreads throughout the highest rungs of power in Washington. It is in this uncharted territory that America’s increasingly belligerent adversaries could decide to act, taking advantage of weaknesses in the U.S. military and foreign policy decision-making chain of command. The statement from the President’s physician is shown below. While it claims that President Trump will continue carrying out his duties “without disruption” during this period of isolation and hopefully recovery, it is nearly impossible to see how this would be feasible. White House At the very heart of the matter is continuity of government , and in particular, the command and control of America’s nuclear deterrent. The President is followed 24/7 by a U.S. military official carrying the nuclear ‘football,’ a Halliburton briefcase containing a remote command interface used to order the release of nuclear weapons and connect the President to the National Command Authority . You can read all about this arrangement in this past piece of ours . The ‘football’ is always just seconds away from the President as the time required to make some strategic and potentially world-ending decisions during a nuclear crisis can be measured in minutes, not hours. An Air Force officer walks off Marine One with the ‘football.’, AP The President must be of clear mind to make these snap judgments, which can be impacted greatly by something like COVID-19, especially if it affects the President’s health in extreme ways as it has hundreds of thousands of Americans, over 200,000 of which have died. Beyond the President’s ability to fill his role within the National Command Authority, other circumstances that do not necessitate dealing with an incoming nuclear attack would make it nearly impossible for him to lead effectively and in a sustainable manner while diagnosed with COVID-19. A huge part of continuity of government operations, in particular those related to the resilience of the President and his cabinet, have to do with being able to be quickly whisked away in a crisis to a safer location that is equipped with advanced command and control capabilities. HMX-1, the Marine squadron that flies Marine One , is on standby at Naval Support Facility Anacostia, located just three miles from the White House, ready to scoop-up the President and move them to a number of alternative operating locations, including Raven Rock , Mount Weather, Camp David , Air Force One , or an E-4B Advanced Airborne Command Post , among others. E-4B at Andrews AFB. , AP In this particular case, this would require the President carrying a highly infectious disease to fly in enclosed aircraft and to operate in facilities that are by their very nature ‘buttoned up’ in order to keep the pandemic from taking the entire facility offline, which would be an unthinkable weakness in America’s security. You can read all about the extreme measures that have been put in place at these highly-secure hardened command centers in the age of COVID-19 in this past War Zone exclusive . As such, bringing an infected President into such an environment would compromise its very mission and set up a ticking clock, since it could eventually be unable to execute that mission for some time due to contamination and illness among its staff. The reality is that even for far less extreme crises and emergency situations, the same issues apply. During a less severe incident, the President would occupy the Situation Room, which is not a highly hardened facility, but it is notoriously cramped and crammed with the Executive Branch’s key decision-makers and military leadership. During an event where the White House would need to elevate its security posture, the President, their cabinet, and their family will descend into the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC). This is an actual bunker buried beneath the White House. You can read all about the PEOC and its expansion in this past post of ours . In the case of the PEOC, you are living inside a tight, fully enclosed environment, with the top leadership of the country working shoulder to shoulder. It is tight quarters on a normal day. It would be an absolute nightmare during a pandemic that has penetrated into the White House. PEOC during 9/11. , White House Archives All of this bleeds into the realm of the U.S. government’s worst fears and darkest emergency planning, but what is important to understand is that under these conditions, it is not a flexible regime. These facilities and measures underpin the very credibility of our nuclear deterrent. If they were weakened or made unavailable, America’s ability to deter a nefarious act before it would occur is degraded significantly. It is truly a game with the highest imaginable stakes. This stark reality sits adjacent to the very real possibility that many in the White House could be infected at this very moment, some of which have been highly present on Capitol Hill as of late in support of various initiatives, including the nomination of Supreme Court Justice candidate Amy Coney Barrett. These folks, including Barrett, have been meeting with many lawmakers in recent days. Other White House staffers have been meeting with Speaker Pelosi, who is third in the line of succession for the Presidency, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and more. So, you can see how the President, who is the most surveilled for the virus of pretty much anyone in the country, could just be the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Trump at a rally in Duluth on September 30th., AP Even Vice President Mike Pence, who would assume the President’s duties under this situation, isn’t in the clear. Reports state he was in the Oval Office with Trump just two days ago and has had many other contacts with White House staffers since then. If Pence was infected, the entire issue becomes far, far direr. We can only hope this is not the case. Still, if Pence isn’t infected, what do you do with the Vice President going forward? Do you sequester them at a secure location until the possible wave of infections within the Executive Branch clears? It really becomes an existential question for the administration, one that is far more complex than when Reagan was shot or other instances where the same debilitating impact on POTUS couldn’t be invisibly transmitted to VPOTUS, even by a third party. Of course, all of this comes as America is in the process of the most bizarre election in modern history. One that the pandemic has already cast a dark shadow upon. Like Trump, Joe Biden is in the very high-risk pool statistically for this disease. Trump and Biden shared a stage just two days ago, where they were projecting loudly without masks. Although they were separated, we don’t know at this time the exact risk of infection under such circumstances, but you can bet Biden is getting tested, as well. What would come of the election if both men were infected? These are questions that seem ripped from a political thriller, not reality, but these are indeed the strange circumstances we are living through today. Trump and Biden at the first Presidential Debate on Tuesday evening. , AP With foreign adversaries, especially peer states like China, already pushing the boundaries in highly tense regions, it isn’t any leap of the imagination to see how they would leverage the current uncertainty to their advantage. What time is better than now? This is the prevailing logic of America’s foes. As a result, be prepared to see unique strategic military posturing in the coming days by the U.S. military, especially in contested regions . At the same time, we must be aware that aside from the handful of people that follow global military patterns very carefully, everything will look like something ominous and new, even though it may be business as usual. In other words, expect a large serving of hyperbole, fear-mongering, and poor analysis on strategic events in the days to come. With all that being said, we have entered into yet another body of uncharted political and strategic waters, one in which the usual continuity of government and strategic command and control measures may be a square peg for a round hole. In fact, without significant alteration, they may work counter to the stability that they were designed to instill, even under the direst of circumstances. Ideally, Pence is uninfected and Trump will willingly pass strategic decision making to him. This can be done while Pence is sequestered in a safe and highly controlled environment, at least until the President has beat the illness and can return to a normal work habit where he doesn’t endanger others just by going about his business. If this is not the case, some very tough decisions are going to be needed to be made, and fast. But even if it is, choices as to how the White House will operate in the immediate term so as to limit the spread of the virus will be critical in also reducing the extent of the national security fallout from this troubling news.

No fewer than 13 companies will compete for their share of a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars in total to help develop various technologies that could go into “ loyal wingman ” type unmanned aircraft and autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles as part of the U.S. Air Force Skyborg program. The service is meanwhile seeking to begin work on a drone using Skyborg’s AI technologies before the end of the year. The contract awards are for the Skyborg Prototyping, Experimentation and Autonomy Development portion of the project, or SPEAD, work under which is expected to continue until 2026. As well as working on Skyborg “missionized prototypes,” the latest contracts encompass subsequent experimentation and development of autonomous capabilities, including operational trials. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) issued this second round of awards under the indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, which has a shared funding ceiling of $400 million, on September 29, 2020. The following vendors are now among those competing for individual task orders under the overarching Skyborg contract: • AeroVironment Inc., Simi Valley, California • Autonodyne LLC, Boston, Massachusetts • BAE System Controls Inc., Arlington, Virginia • Blue Force Technologies Inc., Morrisville, North Carolina • Fregata System Inc., St. Louis, Missouri • Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Fort Worth, Texas • NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Torrance, California • Sierra Technical Services, Tehachapi, California • Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas These companies join Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, and Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems, which had been the first to receive awards under the larger Skyborg contract in July. This all follows a formal call for proposals issued in May. “This second phase of awards establishes a diverse and competitive vendor pool by adding several non-traditional and traditional contractors we saw as important additions to the effort,” explained Air Force Brigadier General Dale White, the Program Executive Officer for Fighters and Advanced Aircraft and one of the Skyborg program leaders. The next milestone for Skyborg, which was first unveiled publicly in March 2019, will include air vehicle prototype designs, which the Air Force expects to begin developing later this year. Kratos’ XQ-58 Valkyrie is one leading contender for supplying an airframe for the Skyborg program. , USAF The idea of having multiple contractors has been baked into the Skyborg program from the outset and the AFLCMC has said it wants to “award as many IDIQ contracts as practicable, and to include additional contractors over time.” Compared to modern manned fighter jets, for example, the threshold to entry in the development of attritable drones is significantly lower. This factor should ultimately be reflected in a drone, or family of drones, that comes in at a comparatively low cost. By their nature, the Skyborg systems should be affordable enough that commanders are willing to use them in higher-risk scenarios from which they might not return. The Skyborg program is also beginning to show possible parallels with the Air Force’s much-discussed “Digital Century Series” concept for the development of future combat aircraft, which you can read about in more detail in this War Zone piece . Like that initiative, the service says that the second phase of Skyborg awards demonstrates “continuous efforts to identify applicable technology and expeditiously inject it into the program to meet warfighter needs.” The high priority assigned to the Skyborg program was confirmed in late 2019 when it was earmarked as one of the first three so-called Vanguard programs under the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) 2030 initiative. The other two were Golden Horde , which will demonstrate autonomous weapons, such as missiles, that are networked together so that they can work collaboratively as a team, and the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3), which is expected to “enhance space-based Positioning, Navigation and Timing across the ground, space and user equipment segments.” Crucially, these Vanguard developmental efforts are all planned to field systems rapidly . This is exactly what the Air Force needs from Skyborg, with plans to field an initial version of the system operationally in 2023. The U.S. Air Force wants Skyborg to provide the technologies for a highly autonomous, low-cost, teamed aircraft that can fly in contested environments including campaigns against near-peer adversaries. Rather than being a single platform, the program’s goal is to yield a family of interrelated unmanned aerial vehicle technologies to support a range of Air Force missions. There’s also a suggestion that, as autonomous technology matures, the Skyborg program will introduce new capabilities even faster and cheaper than in its initial iterations. USAF Inside one of the Skyborg autonomous attritable aircraft, we can expect to see resilient communications and navigation systems, as well as flight-control software to ensure that it can still complete its mission even if denied access to GPS navigation or otherwise subjected to jamming. In addition to that, the drone’s autonomy means it is expected to perform the simpler parts of the mission — take-off and landing, etc — independently. Earlier this year the Air Force gave an idea of how Skyborg would also be able to operate in networked groups “tethered” to manned aircraft or operate fully autonomously. You can read more about how the Skyborg is intended to fit into a wider aerial combat ecosystem in this previous War Zone feature. USAF In terms of how it will operate alongside manned aircraft in a “team,” the Air Force has confirmed that the Skyborg will not have a role in “lethal decision-making,” but will provide information to human pilots to aid decision-making and boost situational awareness. Making use of onboard sensors and algorithms, a Skyborg-equipped UAV could provide data to the pilots of manned aircraft that might relate to air and ground threats, as well as presenting options for attacking or evading enemy aircraft. The Air Force expects the Skyborg to make use of open-architecture and modular systems that won’t just enable new technology and capabilities to be inserted, but also ensure that the system as a whole can be scalable and be introduced to various platforms. Despite some previous concept artwork, it’s unclear exactly what the Skyborg host vehicles might look like. In the past the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) said it aimed to first test Skyborg on a loyal wingman-type attritable drone. Elements of the system could then potentially progress to a fighter jet-sized unmanned combat air vehicle. Given the companies involved so far, there will certainly be multiple competing air vehicle design concepts. Concept art of a notional loyal wingman-type drone from an AFRL Skyborg video., USAF Beyond that, there’s potential for the same systems to migrate into manned aircraft. The concept of an artificial-intelligence-driven virtual co-pilot is something the Air Force is exploring under its R2D2 program . Similar efforts are underway elsewhere within the U.S. military , as well. Speaking back in March 2019, Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, said he wanted to see “real, operational demonstrations” of Skyborg architecture “within a couple of years.” With that in mind, together with this latest contract announcement, we might not have to wait long until we see the Air Force’s autonomous attritable aircraft technology under test.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 4, 2020",Navy P-8 Poseidon Flies Mission Armed With Harpoon Missiles In Asia-Pacific Show Of Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft has been spotted flying a mission from Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa armed with live AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles . Reports suggest the aircraft may have been operating south of Taiwan, in what looks like a signal to an increasingly belligerent Chinese military in the region. Photos of the armed P-8A, with the Bureau Number 169337 and wearing the markings of Patrol Squadron One (VP-1), operating from Kadena, appeared on social media yesterday, September 30th, 2020. Photographer RODN Kadena took the pictures of the plane apparently leaving the base on the same day. Currently, the AGM-84D is one of the P-8A’s two core armament options, alongside the Mk 54 air-launched lightweight torpedo for anti-submarine warfare. The Harpoon gives the Poseidons the ability to challenge enemy naval movements, either in support of offensive operations or in order to defend friendly forces. It’s unclear exactly where the Poseidon flew with its live-missile payload. On September 30, the SCS Probing Initiative did make a post on Twitter showing what it said was a P-8A, using the transponder code AE67C2,  flying in the Bashi Channel south of Taiwan. The SCS Probing Initiative operates out of China’s Peking University. It uses open-source data to monitor maritime and air activities in the South China Sea and other areas of the Pacific, with a particularly heavy focus on the movements of U.S. military aircraft. Data from ADS-B Exchange also shows an unknown aircraft with this transponder code flying in that area on that day. It does not provide any information to confirm that this was a P-8A. There is no information in this database on the activities of the Poseidon with the Bureau Number 169337 since it made a flight to Kadena on September 2. The flight track in the Bashi Channel on September 30 that the SCS Probing Initiative says was a P-8A., ADS-B EXCHANGE A Vietnam-based Chinese military-watcher who goes by @duandang on Twitter also noted that they had received information about a P-8A armed with Harpoon missiles that had flown to the South China Sea from Kadena on the same date. However, they said they were unable to confirm whether or not this occurred. It would not necessarily be surprising for the P-8A and its live Harpoons to have flown to this region. Stretching from the southern end of Taiwan to the northern tip of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, the Bashi Channel is a strategically important link between the Philippine Sea and the hotly contested South China Sea, for both military and commercial ships. This area has recently been the focus of increased activity by U.S. military aircraft, including the Navy’s P-8A and P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft. U.S. Air Force and Navy intelligence-gathering platforms have made regular trips there, as well. This makes good sense, since, in recent months, the Bashi Channel also has hosted a number of high-profile naval exercises by the People’s Liberation Army Navy. This includes a major drill that included the participation by the PLAN’s latest aircraft carrier, the Shandong . All of this activity has also come amid steadily rising tensions between Beijing and authorities on the island of Taiwan, with the former regularly threatening to use military force if the latter attempts to declare full independence. With that in mind, the appearance of the Harpoon-armed Poseidon in the area notably follows aerial patrol missions flown in August 2020 by the Republic of China Air Force’s F-16A Viper fighters similarly armed with live AGM-84s, as well. At the time, it was reported that these missions were launched amid fears of imminent Chinese military exercises designed to simulate the capture of Taiwanese-administered islands in the South China Sea. You can read more about those missions here . Earlier in the year, U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18C/D Hornets also flew training missions carrying live Harpoons from Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni on Japan’s home island of Honshu. This was also seen at the time as a demonstration to potential adversaries, such as China, of U.S. military sea control and area denial capabilities available in the region. A U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18C from VMFA-115 armed with live Harpoon at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni Japan, April 28, 2020., U.S. MARINE CORPS PHOTO/CPL. LAUREN BRUNE Of course, the U.S. Navy’s Poseidon is no stranger to the South China Sea, either, where earlier this year an example flew close to China’s Hainan Island, home to one the most important People’s Liberation Army Navy bases. On that occasion , the mission involved one of a number of specialized P-8As equipped with the secretive AN/APS-154 Advanced Airborne Sensor system. Standard Poseidons already have extensive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Regardless of where this Harpoon-armed P-8A flew in this recent sortie, it highlights another tool the U.S. military has for contesting or defending parts of the region against a maritime opponent. While the AGM-84D is the Poseidon’s primary anti-ship weapon at present, there are plans to increase its arsenal in the future, including the addition of the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), as addressed in this previous War Zone feature . The integration of LRASMs, as well as improved Harpoon variants , and other types of standoff munitions could mean the P-8 would be available to play a wider role in any future conflict in the region, for example using long-range weapons to strike targets on land, as well as at sea.

SUA All told, whether carrying anti-ship missiles or just using its powerful sensors, P-8A patrols offer another means of challenging China’s access to vital areas of the Pacific, such as the Bashi Channel and the South China Sea.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 20, 2021",The Navy Is Building A Network Of Drone Submarines And Sensor Buoys In The Arctic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has awarded the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution a contract worth more than $12 million to develop unmanned undersea vehicles and buoys , along with a networked communications and data sharing infrastructure to link them all together. The project is ostensibly focused on developing a overall system to support enhanced monitoring of environmental changes in the Arctic for scientific purposes. However, it’s not hard to see how this work could be at least a stepping stone to the creation of a wide-area persistent underwater surveillance system in this increasingly strategic region . The Pentagon announced the award of the contract in a daily notice on Sept. 29, 2020. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is managing what is officially called the Arctic Mobile Observing System (AMOS), which is also described as an “Innovative Naval Prototype” effort. ONR’s secretive Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature (NEMESIS) electronic warfare program and its work on an electromagnetic railgun, which you can read about, respectively, here and here , are also an Innovative Naval Prototype projects. “The work to be performed provides for the design, development, integration and testing of an acoustic navigation network, a distributed communication system, gateway buoy nodes and unmanned vehicle capabilities to support the Arctic Mobile Observing System,” according to the Pentagon’s contracting notice. Woods Hole’s work under this contract is expected to wrap up by the end of the 2024 Fiscal Year. ONR envisions the AMOS prototype as consisting of various kinds of unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV), including fully-autonomous types, along with fixed sensors. All of this would be tied together through a series of communications and data sharing nodes, suspended underwater underneath buoys installed on the surface of the ice. “AMOS will be designed to persist/endure for 12 months, have a sensing footprint goal of 100 km [approximately 62 miles] from the central node and have 2-way Arctic communications (vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to node and node to shore),” according to an official project website . An ONR briefing slide showing a very broad overview of the AMOS concept., USN The primarily publicly-stated goal of the AMOS program, which began in 2018, is provide a means of readily monitoring and assessing what is going on underneath the ice in the Arctic across broad areas. Receding ice and other environmental changes in the region as a result of global climate change has led to increased U.S. military activities in the region and prompted a new demand to better understand what is going on above and below the surface. Just being able to predict when and where significant amounts of ice will develop, or recede, which can be influenced by underwater conditions, such as water temperature, could have significant impacts on naval operations in the far north. “If the Navy’s thinking about having to run operations up there with submarines, surface vessels and aircraft, you really need to understand that operational environment,” Scott Harper, ONR’s Program Manager for Arctic and Global Prediction, told Defense News in an interview in May. “Where is that sea ice and how quickly is it retreating? And what is it doing to the upper water column in the ocean?” “You have satellites that can look down at the surface of the Arctic Ocean and the sea ice conditions,” Harper continued. “But what we don’t have [is] the ability to look under the ice and understand what the ocean conditions are, and that’s what we’re really trying to enable with Arctic Mobile Observing System prototype.” A map showing areas where satellites equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) were used to collect imagery of ice coverage in the Arctic during ONR’s earlier Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) Initiative in 2014., USN It’s also worth noting that AMOS is the latest in a series of research efforts aimed at addressing these challenges that ONR conducted since 2011. The proposed overall architecture for this new prototype system is, in fact, very similar to the one developed for the Stratified Ocean Dynamics in the Arctic (SODA) experiment in the Beaufort Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean, which concluded last year. USN USN If the AMOS prototype successfully meets the Navy’s goals, it possible that the service could expand the use of such networks in the Arctic or use lessons learned from this program to support follow-on efforts. ONR has indicated in the past that there are a number of “leap ahead technological goals” that will be necessary to achieve first in order for the system to work as intended. These technological milestones include the development of UUVs and buoys that can withstand the extremely cold conditions in the region for extended periods of time. There is also a requirement for an “under-ice acoustic navigation system” to make up for the fact that UUVs operating deep under the ice will find it difficult, if not impossible to utilize GPS. Satellite coverage in the Arctic is limited, in general, which also limits access to satellite navigation and communications and data sharing networks. USN “The fact that we can put sensors out that will know where they are without having to come to the surface to get a GPS fix – because they can’t come to the surface because there’s sea ice there for nine months out of the year,” ONR’s Harper said in his May interview with Defense News. “That’s a big win.” “You can go out there and you can put your sensors in the ice, but a lot of times they’ll fail,” Harper added. “And they’ll fail because they’ll get crushed in the ice or tipped over or toppled by changing ice conditions. And so the ability to deploy a buoy that is robust enough to survive the sea ice is one of the technological hurdles to doing this.” A system that networks together a fleet of UUVs, together with an array of fixed sensor and communication nodes for the purposes of monitoring activity underwater would also seem readily adaptable to other roles, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in Arctic waters, especially with regards to foreign submarine operations. Just being able to provide U.S. military commanders and American intelligence agencies with additional basic situational awareness of what’s happening under the ice, as well as above it, could be a major boon. A US Navy ocean glider type unmanned undersea vehicle, commonly used for underwater survey purposes. Concept art associated with the AMOS programs suggests these could be adapted to Arctic conditions to support the prototype system., USN The top of an Ice Mass Balance Buoy, a type already in use to measure shifts in polar ice, which could be a starting place for the AMOS sensor and communication nodes., US Army “We have significant domain awareness challenges, and that really begins in the high latitudes,” retired Admiral Paul Zukunft, who was previously the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, told a gathering at the 2020 Defense News Conference earlier in September. “Things start to get pretty dark once you get up higher than 72 degrees north.” “We sent a national security cutter to patrol that region in a relatively ice-free portion of the season,” he continued. “And we stumbled upon a joint exercise between Russia and China. Our intelligence community did not have awareness that this was going on. So we were the originators of this information and otherwise we would not have known. We need to continue to invest in domain awareness.” An armada of drone submarines patrolling even autonomously, tied together with a sensor network, could be a major step forward in gaining this kind of insight into how other navies are operating in the region. Navies around the world have long used the Arctic as a place to conduct discreet submarine operations that are difficult for potential adversaries to monitor. In many ways, this adaptation of AMOS would mirror other Navy efforts to develop new and improved underwater sensor networks, with both fixed nodes and unmanned vehicles, to help monitor submarine traffic and other maritime movements across broad areas of the open ocean. A ThayerMahan SeaWatch autonomous wave glider type unmanned vehicle, which the Navy is also experimenting with as a means of conducting maritime surveillance across a broad area., ThayerMahan The Navy is hardly the only one looking in expanding its underwater infrastructure, both in the Arctic and elsewhere. Russia is reportedly working on various projects in this vein in the Arctic, including potential underwater facilities and nuclear reactors to power them, that are again ostensibly for research purposes , but could easily have military applications. The Chinese have also established underwater monitoring stations , officially for scientific research, in the Pacific that could also be used to collect information about the goings and comings of foreign submarines and other vessels. When it comes to the Arctic, Russia is steadily expanding its overall military footprint in the region with the establishment of a constellation of bases, many of which are still growing significantly in size and scope. Work is notably in progress to dramatically extend the runway at Nagurskoye Air Base, Russia’s northernmost outpost, which you can read more in this past War Zone piece . Competition in the Arctic region will only grow in the near future as global climate change makes it more accessible, in general, opening up a host of new potential economic opportunities . This includes the exploitation of natural resources, from oil to fish, as well as lucrative maritime shipping routes. All told, the Navy’s AMOS project looks set to be an important effort, both with regards to its immediate objectives to collect important information about Arctic conditions and as a stepping stone to further developments to support an increasing U.S. military presence in the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 30, 2020",Listen To Intense Air Traffic Control Audio Of KC-130J’s Collision With An F-35B,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the early evening on September 29th, 2020, The War Zone was among the first to report on the collision between a USMC KC-130J Hercules tanker-transport and an F-35B Lightning II fighter from the same service in a military operating area (MOA) adjacent to the Salton Sea in Southern California. The Marines confirmed that the F-35B pilot safely ejected and the KC-130J made an emergency landing and everyone on board survived. Now, thanks to recorded air traffic control audio, we can hear exactly what communications were like before and after the collision occurred, as well as learn a number of new details about the mishap. The audio was posted by JetScan1 over at LiveATC.net , you can listen to it for yourself here . The KC-130J, which belongs to VMGR-352 “Raiders” based at nearby MCAS Miramar, was flying under the callsign RAIDER 50. In the recording, RAIDER 50’s crew requested to LA Center to fly into the high altitude block of the Kane West MOA, which sits mainly on the west side of the Sulton Sea, but also crosses over it at its midpoint. The MOA was active at the time, but the KC-130J crew was aware of the other traffic. They were cleared to enter into it at 17,000 feet. You can see the large Kane West MOA that straddles the west side and crosses over the Salton Sea. , VFRMAP.com Next, we hear LA Center reply to American Airlines Flight 237 that saw some sort of explosion on the ground near where it was flying over. Immediately after we hear RAIDER 50 declare an emergency: “LA Center LA Center, RAIDER 50 declaring an emergency, midair collision with VOLT 93. We have two engines out, we’re leaking fuel, and likely on fire, and in emergency descent at this time. RAIDER 50.” VMGR-352 “Raiders” flying over what appears to be the Salton Sea. , USMC The controller at LA Center then tries to confirm the KC-130 is in the Kane West MOA and asks to clarify if they are indeed “going down now.” RAIDER 50 comes back on frequency back and states: “We declare an emergency. We still have partial control of the aircraft. Two engines out. We are aiming towards uh…” RAIDER 50 then cuts out and the controller asks for clarification if they are heading towards NAF El Centro or the airport at nearby Imperial, both of which are located to the south of Kane West MOA. The controller tries to raise them again, but there is no response. Another voice comes on repeating that they think they said they had a mid-air and have two engines out. N979CF, a Hawker bizjet, states that they don’t want to clog the frequency and describes that there is a plume of black smoke on the ground in the Kane West MOA and notes it came into sight about the time RAIDER 50 called in the emergency. He adds “there’s at least one aircraft down it looks like.” LA Center thanks the voice and another comes on and says “impact looks like it was prior to his last transmission.” RAIDER 50 is once again talking to LA Center, but they cannot be heard in the recording, likely because they had dropped significantly in altitude. The controller asks RAIDER 50 to clarify that they were attempting to head to Thermal, an airport located just beyond the northern edge of the Salton Sea. That is confirmed. Then the controller says “RAIDER 50, I understand you are about 20 miles away and you are looking for the winds, let me get the winds for you. The wind is 150 at 08 knots.” RAIDER 50 then confirms engines number four and three are out and that they have the airport in sight at about 15 miles out. The controller then gives them a number to LA Center to call on the ground once they land and passes the airport’s UNICOM frequency to the crew. That’s where the recording cuts off. We know the aircraft didn’t land at Thermal, it ended up in a farmer’s field, badly damaged, on its belly, but still overall intact. Everyone survived. Truly amazing work by the crew. The professionalism and relative calm that is showcased in this recording by all those involved is truly remarkable. Although we only have limited details about this mishap, one thing is clear, RAIDER 50’s crew has one hell of a story to tell. UPDATE: We have video of the F-35B careening into the ground and updated info on this incident in this new post. Future updates will be posted there.

Video has emerged on social media showing a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fight crashing into the ground in a ball of flame after colliding with one of the service’s KC-130J Hercules tanker-transports over southern California yesterday, an accident that the War Zone was among the first to report. The F-35B’s pilot was thankfully able to eject safely and the entire crew of the KC-130J also survived after a harrowing emergency landing. You can listen to audio between the Hercules’ pilot and air traffic controllers in The War Zone’s follow-up piece on this mishap. The clip, seen below and taken by bystanders on the ground, who were also thankfully not harmed, shows the dramatic impact of the F-35B and the spectacular explosion that follows. A woman can be heard yelling “oh my god, you guys” in the background. The F-35B, which was using the callsign Volt 93 at the time, smacked into the KC-130J, callsign Raider 50, causing severe damage to both aircraft at approximately 4:00 PM local time. Both planes were assigned to the Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) Course at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona at the time of the accident, according to a subsequent report from Military.com . The KC-130J was from Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 352 (VGMR-352), the “Raiders,” while it remains unknown what unit the F-35B belonged to.

Joseph Trevithick and Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 27, 2020",Everything We Know About The Fighting That Has Erupted Between Armenia And Azerbaijan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new major conflict has erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the long-disputed mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region , with casualties being reported on both sides after just two days of fighting. The Azerbaijani military says that its expanding drone fleet, which may now include Turkey’s increasingly popular Bayraktar TB2 , has been particularly active already, destroying multiple Armenian mobile air defense systems, tanks, and other vehicles. Armenian-backed forces have also destroyed a number of Azerbaijani tanks and other military vehicles using anti-tank guided missiles. This latest round of fighting erupted on Sept. 27, 2020, with reported Azerbaijani attacks at various points along the so-called Line of Contact (LOC) separating them from forces in the self-declared, Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh, which controls the bulk of Nagorno-Karabakh. Both Azerbaijan and Artsakh have declared martial law and the latter has called for a full mobilization of its armed forces. Ethnic Armenian authorities in the breakaway region say they have lost at least 59 troops so far and that at least two civilians have died , and that dozens more military personnel and innocent bystanders have been wounded. Azerbaijan has yet to confirm any casualties, but say that there have been civilian casualties from Armenian artillery strikes. Armenian officials say that hundreds of Azerbaijani soldiers have died . A map showing the region. The light tan area marked “NKR” is the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is under the control of the self-declared Republic of Artsakh. That breakaway republic also claims the areas in yellow, which are under Azerbaijani control. The portions in red represent the areas that Azerbaijani authorities claimed they had taken control of in the first day of fighting., via Wikimedia The current dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is broadly recognized as Azerbaijani territory, but has a population that is predominantly ethnic Armenian, traces its roots back to 1988. That year, Soviet authorities moved to shift control of it from Azerbaijan to Armenia, both of which were Soviet Socialist Republics at the time, prompting an outcry from Azerbaijan. The reversal of that decision the following year did not quell tensions and ethnic Armenians declared the region to be an independent state in 1991 amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. This led to an all-out war between Armenian and Azerbaijan. Though a ceasefire deal came into effect in 1994, there have been major outbreaks of fighting, as well as persistent low-level skirmishing, since then. The last relatively large clashes came in 2016. There had been a worrisome burst of violence in July of this year , as well. There has been little independent confirmation of any personnel losses or how much territory either side may have captured or recaptured already in this latest round of fighting. However, both sides have released numerous videos showing the destruction of various military vehicles. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defense has released a succession of videos showing apparent drones strikes on Republic of Artsakh and Armenian forces. Other videos and photographs have also emerged on social media. Notably, Azerbaijani forces appear to have destroyed at least six 9K33 Osa and three 9K35 Strela-10 short-range air defense systems, both of which are Russian-made designs known to NATO as the SA-8 Gecko and SA-13 Gopher, respectively. Though Azerbaijani authorities have not said what type of drones have been employed in these strikes, it is likely that they involve Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s, which the country reportedly began the process of acquiring in June. The TB2, which is capable of launching small precision-guided munitions, has already proven itself in combat, especially against short-range air defenses, in Syria and Libya . In both countries, these unmanned aircraft have been responsible for the destruction of numerous Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense systems, among other targets. Turkish President Recep Erdogan stands in front of a Bayraktar TB2. , AP Azerbaijan has also acquired an increasing number of other kinds of drones over the years, including Israeli-made loitering munitions , such as the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harop . It’s unclear if any of these have been employed in strikes so far, but they have been used in skirmishes in Nagorno-Karabakh in the past. Armenia does not have anywhere near the drone capabilities that Azerbaijan does and operates no armed types. Other Azerbaijani drone and artillery strikes have damaged or destroyed multiple T-72 tanks , BMP-1 and BMP-2 infantry fight vehicles , trucks, and artillery pieces belonging to Armenian and Republic of Artsakh forces. Videos also show Armenian and Republic of Artsakh forces destroying or damaging a number of Azerbaijani T-72 tanks, as well as BMP-1 and 2 infantry fighting vehicles and at least one BTR-82 wheeled armored personnel carrier, using anti-tank guided missiles. These weapons have seen an explosion of use in various conflicts in recent years, especially in Syria on all sides, where they have proven to be a critical force multiplier and valuable multi-purpose tools , especially for non-state groups . In the mountainous terrain of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is already difficult for heavy armored vehicles to traverse, they appear to already be showing their worth against Azerbaijani ground forces. Armenian forces also claim to have shot down four Azerbaijani helicopters, one of which was reportedly an Mi-8 Hip transport, as well as various drones. Azerbaijani authorities have acknowledged the loss of one helicopter, but said that the crew survived. There is an unconfirmed video circulating online of what is said to be the crash site. There have been a host of other so-far unsubstantiated claims emanating from the region, as well, including claims for authorities in the Republic of Artsakh that Turkish F-16 fighter jets are actively taking part in the fighting and that Turkey has dispatched Syrian militants to the region bolster Azerbaijani forces. The Turkish Air Force did send F-16s to Azerbaijan at the end of July for an exercise there . The Turkish government has also facilitated the movement of thousands of individuals from Syria to Libya to fight in that country on behalf of its U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). Both Armenia and Azerbaijan do have their own arsenals of more advanced weaponry that do not yet appear to have made an appearance in the conflict, including combat jets from their respective air forces. Last year, Armenia took delivery of the first four of a planned fleet of 12 Su-30SM Flanker fighter jets and it has more than a dozen Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack jets in inventory. Azerbaijan also has Su-25s, as well as MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets. There is a video making the rounds on social media purportedly showing Fulcrums over Armenia’s capital Yerevan, but if that’s the case, these aircraft almost certainly belong to the Russian Air Force, which maintains a detachment of these jets in that country. Perhaps most concerning are countries’ arsenals of short-range ballistic missiles, which they have both expanded in recent years. Armenia is the first known buyer of Russia’s Iskander-E, an export variant of the Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile armed with a cluster munitions warhead and with a reduced maximum range of just under 174 miles to comply with the provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) arms control agreement. In addition, the Armenian military has a number of Scud and Tochka short-range ballistic missiles it inherited from the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan also gained Tochkas after the breakup of the Soviet Union and has since purchased newer Israeli-made LORA short-range ballistic missiles, as well. An Armenian transporter-erector-launcher associated with the Iskander-E quasi-ballistic missile system., Jonj7490 via Wikimedia An Armenian Tockha short-range ballistic missile on its transporter-erector-launcher., KarenWunderkind via Wikimedia Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, in the black suit, stands with military officers in front of a truck-mounted launcher for the LORA ballistic missile., Government of Azerbaijan The distance between the westernmost portion of Armenia and the easternmost end of Azerbaijan is less than 350 miles, and Armenia is only around 100 miles across, east to west, as its widest point. All of this means that much of both countries are well within the range of the other’s ballistic missile arsenals, raising the prospect that either side could choose to employ them against large, fixed bases or other similar targets if the conflict escalates. Since the fighting began this weekend, the Armenian Ministry of Defense has threatened to use its Iskanders, if necessary. There are also already reports from Azerbaijan that Armenian artillery has targeted critical infrastructure, including power and natural gas-related facilities. There have been concerns in the past fighting could threaten various pipelines that carry natural gas and oil out of Azerbaijan toward other countries, including those in Europe. It remains unclear how the conflict may evolve in the coming days and weeks. Azerbaijan’s dictatorial President Ilham Aliyev has already made ominous statements indicating he is looking to recapture all, or at least a significant portion, of Nagorno-Karabakh in this new burst of fighting. There have been appeals to Armenian nationalist sentiment, as well as that country’s predominant Orthodox Christian faith, as well. Azerbaijan is a majority Muslim country. Complex intertwined geopolitics will play a major part in the outcome of the current conflict, with Turkey having already come out very publicly in support of Azerbaijan and Russia, a prominent supporter of Armenia, having come out in opposition to the fighting. However, officials in Ankara and Moscow have worked to defuse tensions in the region in the past and it is very possible they could do the same here. This would mirror how Turkish and Russian authorities have engaged with each other over Syria and Libya even while their respective clients in those countries have been actively fighting each other. Iran, which has also cultivated ties with Armenia, in no small part due to its separate territorial disputes with Azerbaijan, has also offered to mediate between the sides to bring the new conflict to an end. The United States , as well as various other countries and international organizations, have also called for an end to the fighting and a return to the previous status quo. In the meantime, Azerbaijani drones and Armenian ATGM teams, among other forces on both sides, are continuing to inflict significant losses on each other as fighting rages on in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 1, 2020",Marine F-35B And KC-130J Collide And Crash In Southern California (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Information is very fragmented at this time, so details are bound to change, but reports state that a military aircraft has crashed somewhere near the Salton Sea in Southern California. Witnesses said they saw things dropping from the sky, possibly under parachutes, not long before an aircraft impacted the ground. We reached out to NAF El Centro , which is located nearby in the Imperial Valley, who told us that military and law enforcement air assets are on the scene, but they do not know specifically what crashed or even if it was one of the many Navy and Marine aircraft, mainly F/A-18 Hornets and T-45 Goshawks, that frequent the base and the nearby airspace for training. Navy and Marine helicopters also are regular visitors. Not long after we talked to the public affairs folks at NAF El Centro, they posted the following message on their Facebook page: Facebook There are other unconfirmed reports that the crew was able to get out of the aircraft and were found alive not far from the crash site. It is possible that the aircraft dumped its ordnance and flares before it went down, which could have resulted in the confusion. The area is a Mecca for military aircraft training. NAF El Centro itself is best known for being the home of the Blue Angels during the team’s winter training. It is very possible this could have been a civilian aircraft instead of a military one, but as it sits now, military is what we are hearing. We also don’t know if there was just one aircraft involved or more than one, which is always possible, especially in this area. We will update this post as soon as more information comes available. UPDATE: We are hearing about a possible incident with an F/A-18 Hornet and a KC-130J. This image of a crashed KC-130J from VMGR-352 ‘Raiders’ out of MCAS Miramar has emerged in NAF El Centro’s Facebook post commenting feed: UPDATE: NAF El Centro says it was not an aircraft that originated from its base. KC-130J appears to have been involved, making a crash landing. It isn’t clear if there was another type involved or what it was, although a tactical fighter is what is being discussed. The KC-130J is the Marines’ organic aerial refueling asset which can be a very tricky and even outright dangerous business . UPDATE: We have received an official statement from the USMC: MARINE CORPS AIR STATION YUMA, Ariz. (Sep. 29, 2020) — At approximately 1600 it was reported that an F-35B made contact with a KC-130J during an air-to-air refueling evolution, resulting in the crash of the F-35B. The pilot of the F-35B ejected successfully and is currently being treated. The KC-130J is on deck in the vicinity of Thermal Airport. All crew members of the KC-130J have been reported safe. The official cause of the crash is currently under investigation. Updates will be provided as information becomes available. UPDATE: KC-130J up over the crash site right now. The aircraft has a powerful FLIR system and can also provide additional command and communications functions. Additional surveillance functions are available via a bolt-on Harvest Hawk kit. ADSBEXCHANGE.com UPDATE: A better shot of the KC-130J, some significant damage. This was likely a very wild ride down. Amazing everyone walked away.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 25, 2020",Retired Singaporean KC-135R Tankers Look Set To Join U.S. Private Aerial Refueling Market,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged of an ex-Republic of Singapore Air Force KC-135R Stratotanker carrying the U.S. civil registration code N573MA and the nickname “Timothy Dalton,” almost certainly a reference to the British actor who played James Bond, among other roles. Reports suggest that private aerial refueling company Omega Air Refueling has bought this aircraft, as well as three others that Singapore retired last year. The sale comes as the U.S. Air Force is actively exploring multiple potential plans to hire contractors to provide badly needed aerial refueling support for non-combat activities. Photographer Hans Jacobs caught N573MA reportedly leaving Singapore’s Changi International Airport for the last time on Sept. 29, 2020. The aircraft had been stripped of its Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) markings and had a very worn gray paint job. In addition to “ Timothy Dalton ” written in black under the left side of the cockpit windscreen and the U.S. civil registration code on the side the rear fuselage, an American flag had also been painted on the tail and the word “experimental” appeared above the main crew door on the left side of the forward fuselage. Experimental in this case refers to a special type of airworthiness certificate from the FAA. It can apply to aircraft in a number of diverse categories beyond those in use for pure research and development purposes. This particular KC-135R also notably still carries its underwing probe-and-drogue refueling pods, as well as its rear refueling boom. Scramble was among the first to notice the appearance of all four ex-RSAF KC-135Rs, which are now registered N569MA, N571MA, and N572MA, on the U.S. civil register just last week. FAA’s online records show the registrant for N572MA and N573MA as “Wilmington Trust Co Trustee,” with an address in Wilmington, Delaware. The entries for N569MA and N571MA show that formal approval of their registrations is still pending. An Instagram account with the handle singaporean_aviation also posted a picture of N573MA on Sept. 29, saying that the aircraft was headed to join Omega Air’s fleet. The War Zone has already reached out to the Texas-based contractor to try to confirm whether or not this is the case. One of Omega Air’s existing Boeing 707 tankers refuels a US Navy E-2D Hawkeye., USN The RSAF had purchased these four aircraft in 1996 from among those the U.S. military had in storage at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. They were subsequently upgraded from KC-135As to the KC-135Rs, which included re-engining them with CFM International CFM56 turbofans. The also received the Pacer CRAG (Compass, Radar, And GPS) avionics upgrade originally developed for the U.S. Air Force. The Singaporeans retired all four of these KC-135Rs last year following the acquisition of an equal number of Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft. In July 2019, Defense News reported that at least one unnamed private company had expressed interest in buying the four Stratotankers. An April 2020 report the Air Force submitted to Congress also said that “one, and possibly two, commercial air refueling operators are in the process of acquiring used boom-equipped air refueling aircraft from a foreign government.” The basic idea of contracted aerial refueling services for non-combat activities is not new, with Omega Air notably having provided this kind of support to the U.S. Navy since 2001. However, up until very recently all of Omega’s private tanker fleet is configured with probe-and-drogue style refueling systems, the method that the Navy, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps and a large number of foreign countries, utilize. The U.S. Air Force, among others around the world, use the boom refueling method. Omega Air only acquired its first boom-equipped KDC-10 tanker , similar to the Air Force’s KC-10A Extender , which previously served with the Royal Netherlands Air Force, last year, making it the first company to be able to refuel aircraft in flight in this way. Omega Air’s KDC-10 tanker., Omega Air Refueling Omega would certainly be a company with an interest in acquiring the KC-135Rs to expand its boom-equipped tanker fleet. For years now, the Air Force, on behalf of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), has been exploring potential courses of action to greatly expand the use of contractor-operated tankers across the U.S. military, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . One of five potential options the Air Force examined was hiring contractors who would acquire surplus tankers from foreign sources. Aircraft that countries had acquired via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, such as the ex-RSAF KC-135Rs, have the additional benefit of having been built to U.S. military specifications and certified for use with U.S. aircraft by the Air Force in the past already. However, one potential concern with this plan is that KC-135Rs supplied to American allies and partners via FMS use what is called the “FMS boom.” This is a Boeing proprietary design that has only approximately 75 percent parts commonality with the “USAF High Speed Boom” found on Air Force Stratotankers . The remaining 25 percent of the parts that are not interchangeable between the two boom types and are also no longer in production, which could present sustainment issues in the future. A US Air Force KC-135R tanker., USAF Even if there is an issue with the boom in the long run, the ex-RSAF KC-135Rs also have the probe-and-drogue refueling pods, increasing their versatility. Beyond that, Omega Air has already become proficient at keeping old and tough to sustain fleets airborne and working hard day in and day out via their existing Boeing 707 tanker program. With TRANSCOM, through the Air Force, looking at hiring contractors to provide thousands of flight hours of aerial refueling support each year across the entire U.S. military, there is only added incentive on the part of companies, such as Omega, to solve any sustainability problems. This demand for aerial refueling services within the U.S. military may increase further in the coming years as the Air Force looks to retire a number of KC-135R and KC-10A tankers and future contracts are likely to be highly lucrative. As a result, competition for those deals is likely to be heated and the industry is already growing . In 2018, Lockheed and Airbus notably announced their own plans to team up to provide aerial refueling support using both contractor-owned-and-operated tankers and leased aircraft, including examples of the latter company’s increasingly popular A330 MRTT. If true, Omega’s decision to buy the former RSAF KC-135Rs would make good sense and help give it a leg up on potential competitors.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 8, 2020",Turkey And Azerbaijan Deny Turkish F-16 Fighter Shot Down Armenian Su-25 Attack Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey and Azerbaijan have categorically rejected a claim from the Armenian Ministry of Defense that a Turkish F-16 Viper fighter jet shot down an Armenian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft over Armenia proper. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been engaged in a major armed conflict since Sunday over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, as you can read about more in the War Zone ‘s initial reporting on the crisis. While there is no evidence to suggest this is the case so far, a direct intervention by Turkey on the side of Azerbaijan would represent a major escalation and could prompt other regional actors, such as Russia, to more actively enter the fray. Shushan Stepanyan, the Press Secretary of the Minister of Defense of Armenia, made the claim in a Facebook post on Sept. 29, 2020. The statement, released in Armenian, English, and Russian, said that the Turkish F-16 had been covering Azerbaijani air operations at the time and that the Armenian Frogfoot’s pilot “died heroically.” Nagorno-Karabakh has been a major point of contention between authorities in Armenia and Azerbaijan since the late 1980s. It was the focus of a major conflict between the two countries that ended in a nominal ceasefire in 1994, though fighting has continued on and off ever since. At present, the bulk of the region, which is broadly recognized to be part of Azerbaijan, is under the control of the self-declared Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh. Azerbaijani authorities subsequently responded by saying that no Armenian plane had been shot down at all and that the incident was merely a provocation. Armenian officials have said that the introduction of Turkish forces, including combat aircraft, into the conflict could trigger a broader response, including the use of the country’s Russian-supplied Iskander-E quasi-ballistic missiles against targets in Azerbaijan. “The Armenian claim is false,” Fahrettin Altun, a senior aide to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, later told Bloomberg . Turkish officials further lambasted the claim as a “cheap propaganda stunt,” according to that report. At the time of writing, Armenia has yet to provide any evidence to substantiate the loss of the Su-25 or that a Turkish F-16 was responsible. The English version of Press Secretary Stepanyan’s statement said that “the Turkish F-16 multifunctional fighter, according to the flight data recorder, was located at a depth of 60 km [inside Armenia], at an altitude of 8200 meters.” However, it is unclear how the flight data recorder in the Su-25 could have collected this information. The Frogfoot notably lacks a radar, which would have been the easiest method of recording the presence of other aircraft in the area. An Armenian Air Force twin-seat Su-25UBK Frogfoot. The Armenian Ministry of Defense did not say what variant of Frogfoot was purporedly shot down in the recent fighting, but the country also operates single-seat Su-25Ks., Armenian MoD Rudimentary translations of the Armenian and Russian versions of the statement however describe the source of this information as “objective control means,” suggesting that the English version is in error and this claimed information came from another source, such as a ground-based radar site. Regardless, Armenia has not released any associated data to support this assertion. Stepanyan’s Facebook post also says that the Turkish F-16 was operating from Azerbaijan’s Ganja International Airport. Satellite imagery circulating on social media dated Sept. 27, the day the conflict erupted, does not appear to show any activity associated with the presence of combat jets at that airport, but it remains possible that Turkey could have deployed the aircraft there after the fighting started. From the very beginning of this recent conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, there have been claims that Turkish F-16s have been taking part in the fighting, but with no substantiating evidence. Turkey did send Vipers to Azerbaijan for an exercise following clashes in the region earlier this year, which was seen as a signal of sorts to Armenia. There’s no indication, however, that those aircraft remained in the country after those drills ended. Another possibility is that one of Azerbaijan’s MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets shot the Su-25 down. As noted, though, Azerbaijani authorities have already disputed that any Armenian aircraft was shot down at all, an implicit denial that they were responsible. Regardless, there certainly is an air war going in the skies of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas in Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijanis have already made very notable use of their significant fleet of drones, including Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed unmanned aircraft and various Israeli-made loitering munitions . Armenia claims that it has shot down dozens of Azerbaijani drones, as well as a number of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, but those figures are disputed and there is limited evidence from which to independently verify any such losses. That being said, Azerbaijan has confirmed that at least one of its helicopters was shot down. There are also claims that Turkey has facilitated the movement of Syrian militants to the region to fight on the side of Azerbaijan, as well. The Turkish government has denied this and there are allegations that foreign mercenaries are fighting on the Armenian side, as well. However, the use of groups from Syria as proxy forces is something Turkish authorities have already done to bolster the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya. Still, the appearance of Turkish F-16s in the skies over Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as Armenia proper, would be a much more significant entry by Turkey into the fighting and, if true, could have much more serious ramifications. Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), as is Russia. As its name implies, CSTO members enjoy collective security provisions that Armenian authorities might decide to invoke, citing threats to its undisputed territory from not only Azerbaijan, but Turkey, as well. This, in turn, could potentially compel Russia to more actively take part in the conflict. Russia already maintains a military presence in Armenia, including a detachment of MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets. Needless to say, Russian and Turkish forces participating in the fighting would run the risk of the conflict becoming a more serious regional crisis. The Kremlin has called on its Turkish counterparts to support a new ceasefire plan , President Erdogan, so far, remains steadfastly supportive of Azerbaijan’s apparent attempt to recapture all or at least most of Nagorno-Karabakh. That being said, in conflicts in Syria and Libya, Russia and Turkey have found themselves backing opposing sides and have engaged with each other in those cases on multiple occasions to at least bring temporary halts to the fighting. It remains to be seen whether any evidence of Turkish F-16s flying the region will emerge, which would certainly have a major impact on how the conflict evolves. In the meantime, the fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh is showing no signs of slowing down.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020","Here’s The FAA Report, Full ATC Audio From The ‘Guy In A Jetpack’ Incident Near LAX","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On September 1st, 2020, The War Zone reported on a bizarre encounter involving multiple airliners on approach to Los Angeles International Airport and what was described by two aircrews as a guy with a jetpack flying off to their side thousands of feet above the ground. The story went viral and the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office took up the investigation, and rightfully so. The danger posed by some dude in a jetpack operating completely outside of FAA regulation in one of the most complex and crowded parcels of airspace in the world is very real. Now, nearly a month after it all went down, The War Zone has obtained an initial official FAA report regarding the incident, as well as the full audio that went with it. Even days after the incident occurred, the FBI went as far as to put out a call for information to the public on Twitter. The fact that the Bureau was still investigating the incident and found it credible enough to ask for the public’s help certainly lends credence to its overall validity. The FBI continues to investgate reports of a #jetpack near #LAX on 8/30. Anyone with info about activity on or above the ground at the location depicted here should call the FBI. The FBI takes seriously events that threaten US airspace & investigates alleged violations #SafeSkies pic.twitter.com/dLZcZeRDuc — FBI Los Angeles (@FBILosAngeles) September 4, 2020 The War Zone has now obtained a so-called Air Traffic Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR) via the Freedom of Information Act regarding this incident. A MOR needs to be submitted whenever an event occurs that matches one or more specific criteria that the FAA has laid out . This includes “Any instance in which communication with an aircraft was not established or not maintained as expected/intended, and results in alternative control actions or additional notifications by ATC, or a flight crew, or in a landing without a clearance” or “Any expression of concern or inquiry by any external entity to a management official/controller-in-charge (CIC) or to ATC on the radio concerning the proximity or operation of an aircraft, either airborne or on the surface, including near midair collision (NMAC) notifications from a flight crew.” The MOR for this incident is relatively straight forward: FAA via FOIA FAA via FOIA FAA via FOIA Most of the basic details are the same as were reported at the time. The report also says that a nearby Los Angeles Police Department “air support” asset, almost certainly a helicopter, was notified of the situation. Another notification about the incident was made through the FAA-managed Domestic Events Network (DEN), though it’s not clear who else may have received that alert. The DEN can be used to provide information to other U.S. government agencies, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA), regarding potential threats and hazards in domestic U.S. airspace. The air traffic control audio recording that The War Zone also received via FOIA includes the portions that were reported at the time, as well. The full clip that FAA released, which is approximately 15 minutes and 25 seconds long, contains additional exchanges about the incident, including another pilot chiming in after the one who said “Only in L.A.” to add “Or Louisiana.” Sadly, that person does not elaborate on that comment and any potential previous issues with individuals with jetpacks in that state. Various other airliners approaching LAX inquired about the reported “jetpack guy.” The audio clip includes an exchange between the tower at the airport and the pilot of Southwest Airlines Flight 535, which is as follows: Southwest 535: “Jetpack still out there?” Tower: “We’ve gotten no reports since the one and that about four minutes ago.” Southwest 535: “Bizarre.” Tower: “Agreed.” Later on, another aircraft reports seeing a cluster of “party balloons” at an altitude of approximately 5,600 feet. Toward the end of the clip, another air traffic controller at a different site calls the tower at LAX and the following conversation ensues: Offsite FAA individual: “Did you call in a helicopter in over there to you help?” LAX tower: “No.” Offsite FAA individual: “I see a helico-there’s something at 600 feet right up there, looks like a helicopter.” LAX tower: “Right underneath that Southwest arrival?” Offsite FAA individual: “Yeah, but that 10 mile final is literally north of me and I’ve been scouring it, I don’t see anything.” LAX tower: “I, I don’t know.” The air traffic controller at LAX thanks them for checking in and goes back to their more routine work. The audio clip ends without any further mention of the jetpack. No further information is given about the helicopter mentioned toward the end of the recording or whether it might have been the LAPD air asset mentioned in the Mandatory Occurrence Report. Of course, Los Angeles and surrounding areas are certainly no stranger to helicopter traffic, in general. You can listen to the entire air traffic control recording, which was prepared by the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility, or TRACON, below. Note that the official from the Southern California TRACON speaking at the beginning of the audio clip confusingly gives the date of the incident as Aug. 31, rather than Aug. 30. This is based on the time it occurred when converted to Coordinated Universal Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time, not local time in Los Angeles. The mention of “party balloons” at a similar altitude as to where the initial reporting aircraft were flying when they spotted the ‘jetpack guy’ is intriguing. It could provide one explanation for the sighting. At the same time, the party balloon-spotting pilot’s perception could have differed and misidentified it. Then again, it could have been a separate object altogether. We just don’t know at this time how this report has factored into all this. If it was clearly party balloons, two separate crews reporting the same description of such a uniquely unusual thing, a guy in a jetpack, would seem odd. As would a continuing investigation into the incident. Still, it is an interesting piece of evidence, without a doubt. The FAA also told The War Zone that additional records that fell within the scope of our request were found at the Los Angeles Flight Standards District Office, but that they were withheld entirely because they are part of an ongoing investigation. As already noted, the FBI is leading that inquiry. The War Zone has also reached out to the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office’s public affairs representative to get an update on this investigation, but has not yet received a response. We have also submitted a separate FOIA request for FBI records relating to this incident, to which we are still awaiting a response. Hopefully, eventually available documentation will have detailed pilot reports. They could help clear up this mystery or deepen it even further.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 8, 2021",This Is Our First Look At A Kuwait Air Force Super Hornet In Its Frontline Paint,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter for the Kuwait Air Force is now flying from Boeing’s St. Louis, Missouri, facility wearing its frontline paint scheme. That service is in the midst of a major modernization drive, which includes the acquisition of Eurofighter Typhoons, as well as Super Hornets. The accompanying photos, which Scramble was among the first to notice, were captured by Bryan Baisley, whose Instagram page is well worth checking out . The Super Hornet was making multiple touch-and-goes at the airfield — which Boeing shares with Lambert International Airport — on September 25, 2020. The single-seat F/A-18E wears the Kuwait Air Force (KAF) serial 803 and the U.S. Navy Bureau Number (BuNo) 169708. It’s the first of 22 F/A-18Es that are on order for the Gulf state, together with six twin-seat F/A-18Fs. This is not the first Kuwaiti Super Hornet we’ve seen on a test flight. Previously, on July 2, 2020, one of the F/A-18Fs under construction for that country, with the BuNo 169731, was noted flying at St. Louis, but was still wearing primer paint and was yet to receive its KAF serial. The Kuwaiti Super Hornets are an interesting hybrid. Often erroneously referred to as Block III jets, the standard for the KAF is actually somewhere between the existing Block II and the Block III that’s now in production for the U.S. Navy. BRYAN BAISLEY In the past, Boeing officials have been slightly coy about the exact equipment fit of the Kuwaiti jets. As reported by The War Zone back in May 2018 , Dan Gillian, Vice President of Boeing’s F/A-18 program, said there would be at least some overlap between the KAF fighters and the U.S. Navy’s Block III jets and that they would be the most advanced versions of the aircraft to date when they rolled off the production line. More recently, it emerged that the Kuwaiti order had actually helped fund parts of the Block III program and the KAF’s jets will receive some of the same upgrades, such as the Elbit Systems wide-area cockpit displays. The KAF fighter force currently operates F/A-18C/D Hornets, which it acquired in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War . These fighters equip two frontline squadrons and an operational conversion unit at Ahmed al Jaber Air Base. Total deliveries comprised of 32 single-seat F/A-18Cs and eight two-seat F/A-18Ds. To date, one Kuwaiti F/A-18C has been lost in a crash, which occurred on September 21, 2003, while another damaged in a separate incident was reportedly rebuilt. A Kuwaiti F/A-18C on exercise in the United States in 1993., DOD Of all the ‘legacy’ Hornets, the surviving Kuwaiti F/A-18C/Ds are among those in the best condition, and in the past, both Canada and Malaysia have expressed interest in buying them. They are also some of the most colorful, wearing a unique three-tone camouflage scheme, notably absent from the Super Hornet seen here. BRYAN BAISLEY A potential Kuwaiti Super Hornet deal worth up to $10.1 billion was announced by the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on November 17, 2016, notifying Congress that U.S. State Department approval for the purchase had been granted. At that time, the order was expected to comprise up to 32 F/A-18Es and eight F/A-18Fs, which would have been a one-for-one replacement of the existing Hornets. The full scope of the original package, as outlined by the DSCA, was as follows: 32 F/A-18E aircraft, with F414-GE-400 engines; 8 F/A-18F aircraft, with F414-GE-400 engines; 8 spare F414-GE-400 engines and 24 engine modules; 41 AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars; 44 M61A2 20mm Gun Systems; 45 AN/ALR-67(V)3 Radar Warning Receivers; 240 LAU-127E/A Guided Missile Launchers; 45 AN/ALE-47 Airborne Countermeasures Dispenser Systems; 12 AN/AAQ-33 SNIPER Advanced Targeting Pods; 48 Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS); 45 AN/ALQ-214 Radio Frequency Counter-Measures Systems; 45 AN/ALE-55 Towed Decoys; 48 Link 16 Systems; 8 Conformal Fuel Tanks; and 14 AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR Systems; ARC-210 radio (aircraft); Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems; AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles (NVG); Launchers (LAU-115D/A, LAU-116B/A, LAU-l 18A); Command Launch Computer (CLC) for AGM-88; ANAV/MAGR GPS Navigation; Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS); aircraft spares; Aircraft Armament Equipment (AAE); support equipment; aircrew/maintenance training; contractor engineering technical service; logistics technical services; engineering technical services; other technical assistance; contractor logistics support; flight test services; storage and preservation; aircraft ferry; Repair of Repairable (RoR); support systems and associated logistics; training aides and devices; spares; technical data Engineering Change Proposals; avionics software support; software; technical publications; engineering and program support; U.S. Government and contractor engineering; technical and logistic support services. At the time, the DSCA stated that the acquisition of the F/A-18E/Fs would allow for greater interoperability with U.S. forces, providing benefits for training and possible future coalition operations in support of shared regional security objectives. It also noted that the Super Hornets would initially supplement and eventually replace the KAF’s legacy F/A-18C/Ds, which have in the meantime been upgraded with AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods and new weaponry, including Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and AIM-120C-7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs). BRYAN BAISLEY BRYAN BAISLEY On March 30, 2018, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that Boeing had been awarded a contract worth up to $1.16 billion to produce and deliver 22 F/A-18Es and six F/A-18Fs for Kuwait by 2022. This deal covered long-lead non-recurring engineering required to develop a baseline configuration for the Kuwait jets as well as long-lead items including radar warning receivers and aircraft armament. Three months later, on June 27, 2018, Boeing received a $1.5-billion contract for the production and delivery of the 28 Super Hornets for Kuwait. Before the potential Super Hornet buy was even announced, however, Kuwait had signed a contract on April 5, 2016, for the purchase of 28 Typhoons, in a deal between the Kuwait Ministry of Defense and Italy’s Finmeccanica, acting as the Eurofighter prime contractor. This deal covers 22 single-seat and six twin-seat aircraft — the same force composition as chosen for the Super Hornet. The Typhoon contract includes training of an initial eight KAF instructor pilots, plus ground personnel, with the Italian Air Force and an upgrade of infrastructure at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait. An artist’s impression of a Kuwaiti Typhoon., EUROFIGHTER Kuwait’s Typhoons will be the first to combine the Captor-E active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with Phase Enhancement P3Eb software, including compatibility with MBDA’s Storm Shadow and Brimstone missiles and other air-to-surface weapons. Kuwaiti Typhoons will also use the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod. Although relatively small, the KAF is well equipped and trained. It also has recent combat experience, having supported the Saudi-led coalition’s military intervention in Yemen, conducting airstrikes against Houthi rebels. With the receipt of its new Super Hornets, the Kuwait Air Force will be in even better shape to tackle a wide range of regional threats.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Is This Concept Art Of A Mysterious Space Launch Mothership A Missing Link In Area 51’s Past?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On January 14th, 2019 Boeing released a series of concept art images showing a very large, high-speed, high-altitude, mothership aircraft and its payload, a reusable air-launched space vehicle. The images are quite interesting for a number of reasons. First off, the setting seems to depict Groom Lake, aka Area 51. Second, they closely match a patent for just such a launch system that was filed by Boeing in 1986 and awarded in 1989. Finally, this concept is pretty much identical to a rumored program that supposedly flew from the base during the last decade of the 20th Century and possibly into the 21st Century. The timing of the patent and concept drawings also correlates with a number of factors that would support the existence of, or at least the logic behind procuring such an exotic space access system. What we see in the images themselves is a huge mothership aircraft that features at least two types of propulsion. Air-breathing jet engines set in large boxy nacelles and a rocket engine that sits below a high T-style tail. The belly of the launcher aircraft is designed to fit the exact mold-line of a space-launch parasite vehicle. This vehicle appears to be a lifting body delta design with twin tails and a large set of payload doors atop its fuselage, presumably for deploying payloads into low earth orbit. The craft appears to have a heat shield similar to the one found on the belly of the Space Shuttle. Boeing The design of the mothership aircraft is clearly optimized for high speed and high altitude operations while also retaining a large internal volume for fuel storage. Boeing The next image shows how the spacecraft would be lowered below the fuselage and launched while in a high-speed and high-altitude climb: Boeing In another image, the space vehicle is seen recovering on a runway with a T-38 Talon in chase. It’s important to note that windows are present at least on the side of the nose section of the vehicle, indicating that it would have been flown by onboard pilots and not under an unmanned concept of operations. Boeing As I mentioned in the opening of this piece, what makes these renderings even more interesting is that they seem to show this combination of exotic aircraft being flown out of Area 51 . The hills in the background and the general details shown match up near perfectly with the clandestine flight test location. It’s interesting to think that concept art would include such specific details, especially in an age long before Area 51 was as known as it is today or tools like Google Earth existed. The chances of this being some coincidence seem low. Considering the tech being shown and the fact that these renderings remained unreleased for decades, it does make sense that they would show the system operating at its intended base of operations. A rough view from the old runway at Area 51 of the mountains that are something of an iconic backdrop to the secretive base. , Google Earth The Ford Bronco and the T-38 chase plane also dates the art back to at least the mid 1990s, but more likely the late 1980s. This is quite important because a Boeing patent from that time period describes a very similar space-launch system. Patent US4802639A that was filed in 1986 and granted to Boeing in 1989 describes its claims as such: “This invention is directed toward providing a transatmospheric launch system that is essentially totally reusable, provides wide flexibility in choice of orbit, and may be launched quickly on short notice. The system of the invention is a two-stage horizontal takeoff and landing system. An orbiter vehicle is integrated into the underside of an aircraft. Aircraft has a cavity opening aftwardly and downwardly to receive vehicle. Vehicle and aircraft are releasably connected by struts. Aircraft and vehicle proceed to staging conditions under air breathing and then rocket power. Rocket engine of aircraft is throttled to produce a thrust differential with rocket engine of vehicle. This differential causes vehicle to automatically pivot away from aircraft on struts. After pivoting out of cavity, vehicle is disengaged from struts and proceeds on its own to orbit. Aircraft makes a conventional landing. Following reentry, vehicle makes an unpowered horizontal landing. Separation is accomplished at a Mach number of about 3.3. In a second embodiment, the main engine of the orbiter is a scramjet instead of a rocket.” US4802639A US4802639A US4802639A US4802639A The patent goes on to talk all about why such a system is attractive over traditional rockets, including its attributes of reusability, unpredictability, flexibility, scheduling, turnaround time, infrastructure requirements, access to multiple orbits, and cost. It also delves into great detail about how the system would work, including the use of jet and liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fueled rocket engines on the mothership, and similar rocket engines on the space vehicle. What’s especially interesting is that another vehicle option is discussed in the patent—a hypersonic vehicle that uses a scramjet engine. The patent even shows the cutaway of a scramjet engine for the secondary payload aircraft and a drawing of that aircraft itself. It looks very much like a hypersonic airplane concept as we have come to know them, one that is far sleeker than its rocket-powered stablemate. So, one would infer that this system could be used to launch very high-speed suborbital flights and even flights well within the earth’s atmosphere as well as space launch missions. US4802639A US4802639A The Patent also discusses how the mothership could tank the spacecraft to replenish its fuel during pre-launch ascent and especially how utilizing an under-body carrying system makes mating the vehicles far easier than an over-fuselage mounting configuration. This design attribute also means many more airfields could be accessed by the system with minimal infrastructure requirements. But overall, we are talking about a multirole concept here that could haul larger stuff into space and potentially send a hypersonic craft on an unannounced overflight of overseas locales or even inserting small payloads into orbit. US4802639A Boeing’s patents also date to a time when the U.S. military is rumored to have been developing a two-stage-to-orbit system, like the one seen in the Boeing patent and renderings. This supposed system has been associated with a number of purported program codenames including Brilliant Buzzard, Snow Bird, Big Bird, and Blue Eyes and has been linked to the near-mythical Aurora aircraft . The U.S. military had already been interested in reusable space plane concepts for decades by this time, with the X-20 Dyna-Soar being among the earliest and most notable projects. The X-20, however, used a traditional rocket booster to get into orbit. Dyna-Soar was amazingly ahead of its time, but it never came to fruition. The program ran from 1957 to 1963., DoD There were other concepts that came and went throughout the Cold War as well. In fact, there are still classified elements of the A-12/SR-71 Blackbird family’s history , which could have been related to a possible space launch concept using a similar configuration as seem with the M-21/D-21 combination . M-21 and D-21 mated and flying as one., USAF The massive runway at Area 51 that would have been ideal for supporting such a heavily laden and high-speed, high-altitude optimized aircraft was upgraded in the latter 1980s. The runway was extended to the south by some 5,000 feet, which made it nearly 24,000 feet long, all including the northern runoff area. This extension was supposedly made partly due to winter flooding issues on the lakebed portion of the northern runway extension, but there were likely operational requirements that also prompted the construction project. The timing of this project would match with the possible advent of a high-speed mothership space launch system. The upper runway in this photo was built in the 1960s and has since been closed and replaced with the one just beside it, spanned nearly 24,000 feet, with an extension being installed in the late 1980s. , Google Earth Brilliant Buzzard, or any of the other reportedly associated programs, along with Aurora itself, have also been linked to a history of unexplained sonic booms , strange rumblings in the sky, and reported sightings of a large, high-performance mothership plane in California and Nevada throughout the 1990s. The most common descriptions of the aircraft from purported sightings claim it was white or light gray, had a large delta-wing planform, featured rectangular underwing engine nacelles, forward mounted canards, and vertical wingtip stabilizers. Overall, the aircraft was somewhat reminiscent of the abortive North American XB-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber. This led some to dub the rumored plane the “Super XB-70.” A variation of the Mach 3 capable XB-70 experimental bomber has long been referenced as the basis for a two-stage to orbit system, or at least an aircraft that resembles it. , USAF The reported sightings and rumblings over Southern California in the 1990s became so pronounced that both Aviation Week and Jane’s reported on the phenomenon, as well as many local outlets including the LA Times . Many of the deep booms emanated from off the Southern California coast where the military controls a vast training and testing range complex—a near ideal launching area for such a system. Others centered around the Mojave Desert, in the heart of flight test country and home to Edwards AFB. But there remains no conclusive evidence that a top-secret spy plane or mothership/space vehicle combination was the culprit. At the same time, the Air Force blamed some of the sonic booms on F-4 Phantom fighter jets operating in the area, but this explanation didn’t account for anywhere near all the reports. FAS.org Fast forward to the new Millennium, in 2006, Aviation Week reported on the possible existence of another two-stage-to-orbit system supposedly named Blackstar. It purportedly consisted of a large delta-winged supersonic mothership aircraft, notionally dubbed the SR-3, and an eXperimental Orbital Vehicle (XOV). Beyond also having a delta wing planform, the description of the SR-3 was significantly different from the purported configuration of the Brilliant Buzzard. Namely, the SR-3 carried the XOV underneath rather than on top of its fuselage, according to Aviation Week . This is the same unique trait seen in the Boeing patent and renderings. In a typical mission, the SR-3 would lug the XOV up into the stratosphere to an altitude of around 100,000 feet, according to the article. Once there, the space vehicle’s rocket motors would boost itself either to the edge of space or into orbit proper, depending on its payloads and mission profile. After the mission was over, the XOV would glide back to earth and be able to land on a conventional runway. Aviation Week and subsequent reports posited that the space vehicle could be useful for extremely high-altitude intelligence-gathering missions over denied areas, providing more flexibility than a traditional spy satellite and the element of surprise. The system would have offered a way to rapidly place satellites in orbit in case they were destroyed or otherwise rendered non-functional during a conflict and it would have also furnished a more clandestine and unpredictable way to insert payloads into orbit. There was also a possibility that it could have carried some sort of weapon system, either for attacking targets in space or on the ground. As with Brilliant Buzzard, there remains no official confirmation of this program. Aviation Week reported at the time that the Air Force had said it was unaware of any such program, leading to speculation that an intelligence agency, such as the super-secretive National Reconnaissance Office, might be the space vehicle’s actual operator. The fact that the Air Force did not necessarily claim the purported Blackstar at the time does not necessarily indicate it doesn’t or didn’t exist, even if only in concept, either. In January 2018, SpaceX launched a satellite called Zuma that Northrop Grumman reportedly built for a U.S. government agency. There is no question that that satellite exists , or at least existed, but both the Air Force and NRO have said it didn’t belong to them. This satellite could be part of a test program and still be contractor owned and operated, which could further obscure the U.S. government entity behind the program. Aviation’s Week ’s 2006 story includes certain details that could point to this being the case with Blackstar, as well. Alternatively, the USAF may have just decided to deny the existence of what would have been a highly sensitive program. Aviation Week’s Blackstar story received some criticism at the time of publishing. Pieces in both Space Daily and The Space Review were particularly skeptical of the content and cited Aviation Week ’s record of “revealing” non-existent advanced aviation projects in the past, such as claims about a Soviet nuclear-powered bomber in the late 1950s. But what is known now for certain is that during the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. Air Force, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and NASA did explore the potential of both single-stage- and two-stage-to-orbit systems as part of at least four publicly acknowledged, named programs. These were Science Dawn , Science Realm, Have Region , and Copper Canyon . The last of these projects may have directly led to the Rockwell X-30 National Aero-Space Plane (NASP). That was real, but highly ambitious single-stage-to-orbit space vehicle program, before its cancelation in 1993. Rockwell X-30., NASA Having a functional reusable space vehicle to rapidly deploy satellites would have fit especially well with the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative’s final space-based missile defense proposal, known as Brilliant Pebbles , which first emerged in 1987. This plan envisioned a massive constellation of small satellites each containing a small kinetic interceptor. The concept of operations would have required the quick deployment of additional interceptors in the aftermath of an attack to ensure continued protection against subsequent waves of missiles. The sensor layer of this proposed missile defense system was known as Brilliant Eyes and the use of the first word “brilliant” for both of these programs could potentially point to a connection with Brilliant Buzzard. A two-stage to orbit space-launch system based on a mothership concept seems like it would have been an ideal match for this program’s lofty goals, if not the only potentially attainable option at the time. This image shows a Brilliant Pebble anti-ballistic missile interceptor emerging from its protective “life jacket”, the white shell. This illustration shows an earlier model of the interceptor design with three fuel tanks, later designs had four much larger tanks wrapped around the missile body., USAF/Public Domain In addition, while the U.S. military and Intelligence Community have certainly been interested in reusable space planes for decades, the desire for a new system would have become much more pronounced after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in January 1986. Between at least 1982 and 1992, multiple Space Shuttle missions carried classified U.S. government payloads, reportedly including spy satellites. This had been part of the Space Shuttle plan all along and the orbiter’s cavernous payload bay had reportedly been designed specifically to accommodate the KH-9 Hexagon spy satellite. Just months after the Challenger incident, the final KH-9 mission failed , with the expendable Titan 34D booster rocket exploding after launch and destroying the payload. This event would have only created additional impetus for a new, more flexible system for satellite deployment. The Challenger disaster was also largely to blame for the Air Force’s decision to mothball Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 1987. The service would completely terminate plans for exclusive Space Shuttle operations not long after. This would have freed up funding for other space launch initiatives, possibly including an experimental two-stage-to-orbit system. A huge investment was made in SLC-6 at Vandenberg AFB for independent DoD Space Shuttle operations. The site was never used for this purpose having been mothballed after the loss of Challenger. , USAF Also, if the mothership aircraft was also capable of boosting a high-speed scramjet equipped aircraft to launch speed as Boeing’s patent clearly states, its development could have helped build the case for the retirement of the SR-71 Blackbird in 1990. The reactivation of a small Blackbird force in 1995 also pairs somewhat with the period of highest activity of the supposed craft. Whether or not Brilliant Buzzard, Blackstar, or any of the other reported mothership-based space-launch programs or reusable space vehicle initiatives actually produced flying aircraft and space vehicles, the U.S. military interest in such systems has hardly waned. In recent years, multiple programs of a similar nature have been officially confirmed, not to mention the Boeing’s operational X-37B . The X-37B after returning from another long mission in low earth orbit. The craft is much smaller than the ones rumored to exist on a number of mothership-based, two-stage to orbit concepts., DoD In 2017, DARPA hired Boeing to develop the new XS-1 hypersonic space plane , which has the stated mission of being able to rapidly deploy small satellites. Both the X-37B and XS-1 use a traditional rocket booster to get into orbit rather than a mothership aircraft, though. This drastically limits their flexibility when compared to a two-stage to orbit mothership concept. But in 2016, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) did indicate that it was still looking at two-stage to orbit concepts, as well. This new proposal returned to a configuration with the smaller orbital vehicle sitting on top of a high-speed mothership aircraft based on a U.K. based company’s concept known as Skylon . The Air Force and NRO are also sure to be watching developments in the private space sector very closely. All of this makes good sense. The U.S. military is in the midst of both expanding its space-based capabilities and coming to grips with the growing array of threats to those assets. As we at The War Zone have highlighted repeatedly, Russia and China , in particular, have been developing a variety of anti-satellite weapons in order to challenge the United States’ long-held advantages in space-based communications and networking , navigation and weapon guidance , early warning , intelligence gathering , and more. As we mentioned earlier, at present, programs such as DARPA’s XS-1 are specifically focused on providing options to quickly replace lost or otherwise disrupted space-based capabilities during a crisis, as well as increasing access to space for military purposes overall. Though the U.S. military and Intelligence Community have had a decades-long interest in two-stage to orbit mothership-centric concepts, making that capability a reality would be increasingly a priority now, if it doesn’t actually already exist in one form or another. Boeing’s XS-1 Spaceplane., DARPA There is also some potential evidence that a new mothership space-launch concept may be deep in development, or that an old system has been revived. The new massive hangar at Area 51 has dimensions and features that would make it ideal to house just this type of aircraft as I have discussed before in the past . Even the remote position of this hangar seems ideal for a highly classified project that features a very large and oblong aircraft that uses especially volatile fuel. It’s also worth noting that since that hangar was built, some reports of strange rumblings in Southern California have popped up again. All this may seem to build a somewhat compelling case that an aircraft like the one in shown in Boeing’s patent and artwork actually exists or existed. Certainly, the confluence of events in the latter half of the 1980s really seems like the perfect breeding ground for such a concept to be pursued. But we have no hard proof this was indeed the outcome. The truth is that the evidence remains largely circumstantial. It’s probably safe to assume that if a Brilliant Buzzard or Blackstar did become a reality, it either failed to produce the results that were expected of it, or it was sacked due to fiscal reasons, which is quite likely if this thing was born in the Reagan era and fought for its life in the post-Cold War military draw-down of the 1990s. And even if it did exist, it would have been an entirely experimental vehicle, or at best a very low density, high-value and highly classified asset, never really making it out of a semi-operational state and into larger production. It’s somewhat intriguing to think that once again we are in a near-perfect threat environment for such a concept to flourish into existence. And the strange nature of the new hangar at Area 51 does point to this possibility. With all the fiscal weight the Pentagon is now putting behind flexible space launch, hypersonic capabilities , and time-sensitive strike and reconnaissance , it’s almost a bit hard to imagine that companies like Boeing aren’t dusting off their old plans—or even old planes—and applying 30 years of technological advancement to them in an attempt to make the Air Force’s dreams come true.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2020",The Pentagon’s Highly Questionable Proposals For A Navy With Over 500 Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s forthcoming force structure review may call for a fleet with up to 534 ships and submarines, including various kinds of unmanned vessels . The is far bigger than the existing Congressionally-mandated goal of a 355-ship fleet , which has long proven to be a struggle for the service to achieve. Plans for an even larger force could run into significant budgetary, recruiting, sustainment, and other hurdles. Defense News got the scoop on the expanded fleet concepts after obtaining draft copies of naval force structure studies that the Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) and the Hudson Institute think tank produced for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Those reports date back to April 2020 and were meant to present a proposed ideal fleet composition and plans for obtaining it by 2045. The Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was also set to produce a study, the details of which remain unknown. Those studies have since been evaluated, including through simulated wargames, and have been incorporated, at least in some part, into the Navy’s Future Naval Force Study, according to Defense News . This new force structure plan was originally expected to be completed sometime last year, but has been repeatedly pushed back . At present, the plan is to use this final study to inform the next shipbuilding plan, which will accompany the service’s budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, a public version of which should come out sometime between February and March 2021. “The Future Naval Force Study is a collaborative OSD, Joint Staff and Department of the Navy effort to assess future naval force structure options and inform future naval force structure decisions and the 30-year shipbuilding plan,” Navy Lieutenant Tim Pietrack, a spokesperson for the service, told Defense News . “Although COVID-19 has delayed some portions of the study, the effort remains on track to be complete in late 2020 and provide analytic insights in time to inform Program Budget Review [FY] 22.” USN Changes to carrier, other surface vessel, and submarine fleets The proposed fleets from both CAPE and Hudson have significant differences compared to the Navy’s existing structure, which currently has around 290 ships and is expected to grow to 301 ships by the end of this year. Both of the plans notably recommended cutting the total number of supercarriers to nine from the service’s current total of 11 , which includes the 10 Nimitz class carriers and the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford . The first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford , in front, sails with the Nimitz class Harry S. Truman ., USN It is also worth noting that, by law, the Navy is compelled to always be working toward having a dozen active supercarriers, something that would have to change for either of these plans to go into effect. Hudson’s proposal also included four smaller light aircraft carriers in addition to the remaining supercarriers, something the service was considering in April, but publicly said it was no longer exploring , at least in the near term, the following month. CAPE also recommended a total of between 80 and 90 large surface combatants, a category that presently includes the Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Ticonderoga class cruisers, while Hudson favored reducing these number of these types of ships The Arleigh Burkes and Ticonderogas account for 89 ships in the service’s present fleet. There has also been talk about a future Large Surface Combatant that could replace both types, but the Navy is still just in the process of crafting the basic requirements for this vessel. The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Hue City sails ahead of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Oscar Austin ., USN The plan from CAPE called for around 70 small surface combatants, while Hudson proposed slashing that number to just 56. At present, the Navy’s two subclasses of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) are the only vessels it operates in this category. At the end of the day, the Navy expects to have bought 38 Freedom and Independence class ships in total, some of which are already being retired . The first-in-class USS Independence , in front, sails alongside the first-in-class USS Freedom . These are the leads ship in the two Littoral Combat Ship subclasses, USN The service is now also in the process of acquiring a new fleet of guided-missile frigates, presently referred to as FFG(X), which would also bolster the size of its small surface combat fleet. The first of these, at least , will be based on Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri’s European Multi-Purpose Frigate design , also known by the Franco-Italian acronym FREMM. An artist’s conception of the future FREMM-based FFG(X)., USN Both CAPE and Hudson were in favor of increasing the Navy’s number of attack submarines, but Defense News did not give the exact proposed submarine fleet totals for either study. The service is already looking to begin development of a new attack submarine with capabilities more akin to its trio of advanced Seawolf class boats, which were originally designed primarily as hunter-killers, rather than the more multi-purpose Virginia class. The Seawolf class submarine USS Connecticut ., USN A shakeup in amphibious and support ships Defense News said that the proposals from CAPE and Hudson called for between 15 and 19 amphibious warfare ships, with CAPE’s plan including 10 large amphibious assault ships, such as the Wasp and America classes , while Hudson’s notional fleet had only five. The first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS America ., USN This category also includes dock landing ships, such as the San Antonio class , and these figures represent what would a major reduction in the number of traditional amphibious ships in the Navy’s overall fleet. This is in line with new radical concepts of operation emanating from the U.S. Marine Corps under its present Commandant General David Berger, who has called for a major shift away from long-standing views of amphibious warfare. As such, CAPE and Hudson included between 20 and 26 Light Amphibious Warships (LAW) in their proposed fleets, a type of ship that the Navy is now working to acquire based on requirements from the Marines, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The Navy has publicly said it could buy as many as 30 LAWs. An artist’s conception of a so-called stern landing vessel design from Australian shipbuilder Sea Transport Solutions, which is reportedly one of the types the Navy and Marines are considering for the Light Amphibious Warship., Sea Transport Solutions Both plans included significant increases in the total number of logistics and support ships in the Navy. This included adding between 19 and 30 new “future small logistics” ships, which could potentially be a type of offshore support vessel-type ship, and increasing the number of fleet oilers, ships able to refuel conventionally powered ships, from 17 to between 21 to 31. Hudson’s proposal specially called for adding 19 command and support ships, as well. This is a category that presently includes an array of specialized vessels within the Navy, including its two Blue Ridge class command ships, Spearhead class expeditionary fast transports, expeditionary sea bases and transfer dock ships , and other logistics vessels . New unmanned fleets By far, the most significant additions in both plans are dozens of unmanned surface vessels (USV), including proposed “large” types that are the size of traditional corvettes , and large unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV). At present, the Navy does not formally include any vessels in these categories when talking about the size of its overall fleet. The notional fleets from CAPE and Hudson included between 65 and 87 large USVs and between 40 and 60 large UUVs. The Navy, as well as the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget , have all pointed to the inclusion of unmanned vessels as a way of finally reaching the existing 355-ship fleet goal. Their inclusion in the proposals from CAPE and Hudson meant that those notional fleets, which already included between 316 and 358 manned ships, would surge in size, with 534 total vessels between the maximum projected size among both studies. Two unmanned offshore support vessel-type ships the Navy, together with the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office, has already been testing as part of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program., USN An artist’s conception of Orca, a large unmanned undersea vehicle that Boeing is building for the Navy., Boeing In a vacuum, both of these proposals make sense in many ways, especially given U.S. military’s overall shift in focus to preparing for high-end conflicts and growing interest in distributed concepts of operation, including in the maritime domain, in recent years. The War Zone has explored these developments on multiple occasions in the past . In addition, as noted, the Marine Corps is undergoing a massive transition that includes a complete rethinking of how it conducts amphibious operations, especially in a distributed scenario in the Pacific region. The Navy, based on input from the Marines, and, to some extent, the Army , as well, has similarly begun re-evaluating how it might go about supporting ground forces during such operations. On top of this, China is rapidly expanding the size and scope of its own naval capabilities, including adding significant numbers of new , advanced warships , including multiple aircraft carriers , and submarines . The most recent Pentagon report to Congress on Chinese military developments highlight naval modernization and shipbuilding as key areas where the People’s Liberation Army is making major advances that challenge traditional American superiority. This, in turn, has already prompted calls for more funding for new Navy ships. Major hurdles ahead While there are very real strategic realities and concerns that are clearly driving these fleet proposals, it’s unclear how realistic the Navy’s plans for getting to the existing 355-ship mark might be, let alone increasing that total to over 500 vessels. In 2019, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessed that the shipbuilding plan the Navy had released that year, which envisioned hitting 355 by 2034, would cost the better part of a trillion dollars to implement. The Navy itself had acknowledged that, after getting to its desired 355-ship fleet, it would then need $40 billion every year just to operate and maintain all those ships, some 30 percent more than it spends annually now. Defense budgets always ebb and flow from year to year and it is especially hard, in general, to project how stable funding might be over a period of 15 to 25 years. Any basic budgetary concerns about this massive increase in the Navy’s overall fleet size are only exacerbated by the realities of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has already led to a pronounced recession within the United States and major global economic downturn. The fact of the matter is that the service is having trouble paying for the fleets it has now. The Navy, which has had trouble meeting recruiting goals in recent years, will still need to provide crews for the existing and new manned ships under both proposals, as well. The service has explored a variety of reduced and other novel crew concepts, as well as deployment mechanisms , to help ensure readiness with, at best, mixed results . New Navy recruits arrive at the service’s Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Illinois., USN There is clearly a hope that a heavy emphasis on smaller ships with smaller crews and unmanned vessels could help defray many of these costs and reduce maintenance, infrastructure, and recruiting demands. However, the proposals from both CAPE and Hudson preserve much of the service’s existing surface and submarine fleets and call for the addition of more traditional manned ships, not all of which would be small. There can only be questions about whether the Navy’s internal maintenance infrastructure, as well as the availability of contractors to provide additional shipyard capacity for repairs, could handle the increase in total ships, no matter how small they might be. The Navy’s shipyards are in notoriously poor condition . Although there have been some recent investments made to attempt to refurbish them, this reality has limited their ability to keep up with the workload they already have.  Two years ago, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), notably assessed that the service has lost more than two decades of operational time across its attack submarine fleets to maintenance backlogs. The Los Angeles class submarine USS Boise is something of a poster child for these issues and is presently set to return to service in 2023, after which it will have been out of commission over a need for routine repairs for approximately eight years . This submarine only entered service in 1992, meaning that it is set to have spent nearly a third of its career in the Navy so far sitting idle. The Los Angeles class submarine Boise, pierside at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia. When she returns to the fleet, scheduled to occur in 2023, she will have spent approximately eight years idle., USN Glaring concerns about shipyard capacity, and the rest of the industrial base , apply to building any new ships for the Navy and keeping that construction on schedule. Cost overruns and delays, which are hardly unheard of in the service’s shipbuilding programs, could easily have negative cascading impacts on its overall force structure plans. Pushback from Congress is something that has repeatedly undermined Navy shipbuilding plans, as well. So, there’s no guarantee that legislators will agree to fund whatever final proposal the Navy presents to them when asking for its 2022 Fiscal Year budget, either. All told, while the studies from CAPE and the Hudson Institute are certain to be valuable additions to the continuing debate around the Navy’s future fleet structure and shipbuilding priorities, it very much remains to be seen how much, if any of these recommendations will be implemented any time soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 27, 2021",General Atomics’ Sparrowhawk Drone-Launched Drone Breaks Cover,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics says that it has conducted captive carry tests of its Sparrowhawk, a new small drone that will be able to be launched and recovered in flight. The company says that Sparrowhawk is a demonstrator and was developed specifically to work with other larger unmanned aircraft that it builds, such as the MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1C Gray Eagle , offering an important stepping stone to all-new capabilities on those existing designs, as well as future ones. The California-based drone’s maker said the captive carry tests, in which the drone was carried aloft by an MQ-9, but was not launched, took place between Sept. 16 and 17, 2020. This kind of testing is done to gather data on how a system, as well as the launch platform in many cases, handles the stress of flight. A picture of Sparrowhawk that General Atomics released to The War Zone shows that the drone features a large main wing that is stowed parallel with the main fuselage before launch, after which is swings 90 degrees into a deployed position. The drone also has a v-tail and there appears to be at least one air intake for the propulsion system on the right side. It’s unclear what type of powerplant powers the air-launched drone. GS-ASI Sparrowhawk concept art that General Atomics posted on Twitter earlier in September showed a similar configuration, but with two fans at the rear of the fuselage. The company has said that the small drone will offer a reduced acoustic signature, as well as a visual one, compared to its larger designs, such as the MQ-9. We never stop innovating. Meet #Sparrowhawk … our airborne launch and recovery demonstrator aircraft. Flight tests this week to demonstrate avionics systems and autonomy engine. Stay tuned! #SUAS pic.twitter.com/fM0FCYEhY5 — GA-ASI (@GenAtomics_ASI) September 15, 2020 It’s not clear yet how General Atomics is planning to recover Sparrowhawk in flight and whether unmanned platforms, such as the MQ-9, will be able to carry out this task. “Sparrowhawk iterates on the DARPA Gremlins Program ,” according to the company. Dynetics, now a subsidiary of Leidos, beat out General Atomics, among others, to build the experimental Gremlins drone, now also designed the X-61A, as well as the airborne recovery system, which is presently mounted on a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. You can read more about Gremlins and the recovery concept, which includes the drone catching the end of a cable in flight and then being reeled in, in these past War Zone pieces . A X-61A Gremlins drone about to be reeled onto a C-130 Hercules during a flight test., Leidos It’s hard overstate how significant Sparrowhawk, and any further developments it spurs, could be for both General Atomics existing product lines and future unmanned designs. The ability of a large drone to launch smaller ones, all potentially working together semi-autonomously or even as part of a fully-autonomous swarm, could open the door to all kinds of new capabilities, while reducing the risk to the launch platform. “Sparrowhawk extends and multiplies MQ-9-based sensors, reduces manpower and increases ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] coverage,” David Alexander, President of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), said in a statement. Beyond providing far more flexible ISR over a larger geographical area, Sparrowhawks may also provide valuable stand-in electronic warfare jamming or even act as decoys to blind and confuse enemy integrated air defenses, which could drastically increase the survivability of the launch platform and even help clear a path for other manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as stand-off missile strikes. Sparrowhawks could potentially carry out their own kinetic strikes if they can be equipped with traditional explosive warheads, although there is no official information yet if arming these unmanned aircraft is a possibility. If it is indeed the case, these drones might able to act as loitering munitions , which would be able to conduct persistent surveillance of designated areas before then carrying out strikes on targets of opportunity or return for recovery and re-launch. General Atomics says that Sparrowhawk is intended to be an attritable platform, as well, despite being designed to be recovered and reused. Attritable designs are those that are low cost enough that commanders can employ them in higher-risk environments that would be off-limits to more expensive exquisite types. “With attritableONE technology that is survivable and precise, Sparrowhawk is a true game changer,” GS-ASI’s President Alexander said. This program is part of the U.S. Air Force’s expansive Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program, which is seeking to develop a host of new highly-networked technologies that will expand the service’s ability to gather information and then rapidly analyze and disseminate it, including targeting data that can then be passed to other U.S. military units in the air, on the ground, and at sea. As the name implies, attritableONE is focused on developing new attritable unmanned aircraft. In a recent major demonstration of various ABMS capabilities and associated technologies, an MQ-1C Gray Eagle launched an Area-I Air-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System 600 (ALTIUS 600) small drone, acting as an attritableONE testbed. The ALTIUS 600 then positively identified a target that the MQ-1C’s onboard sensors had first identified. An ALTIUS 600., US Army The U.S. Army has also been experimenting with the ALTIUS 600 as part of its Air Launch Effects (ALE) effort, which also envisions fleets of small drones performing various ISR, deception, and other tasks, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . During the recent ABMS demonstration, a General Atomics MQ-9 also carried a Rosetta Echo Advanced Payload (REAP) communications and datalink pod, which includes technology developed under gatewayONE and meshONE, which are also part of the broader ABMS effort. “The REAP pod has been developed under contract from the Air National Guard and demonstrated a communications relay capability for both Link-16 and the Silvus meshONE network providing seamless connectivity between air and ground participants in the demonstration area,” according to General Atomics. The MQ-9 with the REAP pod., GS-ASI All told, the Sparrowhawk looks to be an extremely exciting development. It also comes at a time when the U.S. Air Force, the largest operator of MQ-9s, is looking to stop buying those drones due to concerns that they are simply too vulnerable to be useful during a high-end conflict. The ability of Reapers to launch and recover smaller, attritable drones and, by extension, perform a wider array of tasks over a larger geographical area, even in contested environments, could breathe new life into that design. We at The War Zone are very eager to learn more about Sparrowhawk and what it can do. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Drones"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 18, 2022",Russian Warship Kazanets Collided With A Cargo Vessel In The Baltic Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian Navy warship has now left Danish waters after colliding with a civilian cargo ship in the Baltic Sea. The mishap involved the Parchim -class corvette Kazanets and the Swiss-owned cargo ship Ice Rose , which is registered in the Marshall Islands. The collision occurred yesterday, September 23, 2020, south of the five-mile Øresund Bridge that spans the strait between Denmark and Sweden. The Danish Armed Forces, or Forsvaret, announced the following day that the Kazanets had left the area and provided a photo of the damage to the Ice Rose , which subsequently headed north toward the Danish port of Odense. A large gash has been torn on the vessel’s starboard side, towards the stern, penetrating the hull above the waterline. With an 800-ton displacement and a length of just over 236 feet, the Kazanets is dwarfed by the Ice Rose , which is over 475 feet long and which has a cargo capacity of 14,567 tons. The Parchim -class corvette Kazanets. , Florstein via Wikimedia The refrigerated cargo ship Ice Rose ., via balticshipping.com The collision between the corvette and the refrigerated cargo ship took place in what the Danish Armed Forces Operations Center described as “very dense fog.” There were no reported injuries to those on board either vessel, the center reported. The Danish Armed Forces confirmed that no spillages of fuel oil or other pollutants had been detected after the collision. The case has now been handed over to Denmark’s civilian authorities. Soon after the incident, the Royal Danish Navy patrol ship Najaden (P523) arrived on the scene, as did the Swedish Coast Guard vessel Kbv 432, to assess the situation and take part in search and rescue efforts if required. The Ice Rose had departed St. Petersburg in Russia on September 21 and was headed to Gothenburg in Sweden. Following the collision, the cargo ship will be assessed by the Danish authorities to determine if it is still seaworthy. The route that was taken by the cargo ship Ice Rose , from the point of the collision south of the Øresund Bridge to Odense port, where it arrived on September 24, 2020., MARINETRAFFIC.COM According to the Maritime Bulletin website, the hull of the Kazanets was also breached above the waterline and after the collision, it proceeded toward the naval base at Baltiysk, in Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave. The Kazanets is one of six Cold War-era Parchim -class warships that remain in Russian Navy service. These vessels were built in what was then East Germany for the Soviet Navy and were primarily intended for coastal anti-submarine warfare. As originally completed, these vessels were armed with a single 76-mm caliber gun, one six-barrel 30-mm gun, two twin 533-mm torpedo tubes, two 12-round RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers , and two quadruple launchers for Strela-2 or Strela-3M surface-to-air missiles. Parchim -class corvettes on parade to mark Russia’s Navy Day in 2018., Russian MoD Unconfirmed reports suggest the Kazanets was operating with its Automatic Identification System (AIS) transmitter switched off. The AIS is a tracking system that provides ships with a picture of marine traffic in the area to help prevent collisions. However, the Kazanets was permitted to operate in Danish territorial waters and had notified the Danish authorities of its presence. The same day as the collision near the Øresund Bridge it emerged that Sweden had lodged a protest with Moscow after “two Russian corvettes which entered territorial waters near Gothenburg” without permission. The incident in question occurred on September 14. Two days later, a Danish military vessel also entered Swedish territorial waters without permission. A resurgent Russian military presence in the region means the Baltic Sea is of considerable strategic importance. The already busy waters — around 2,000 ships are underway in the Baltic marine area at any one time — are also regularly patrolled by Russian and NATO warships, as well as those from non-aligned Finland and Sweden. These frequently have to negotiate narrow straits and shallow waters. In the air, Russian military aircraft are regularly intercepted by NATO’s Baltic Air Policing (BAP) mission, operating from bases in Lithuania and Estonia to protect the Baltic States. Denmark had a recent close encounter with one Russian aircraft when a Su-27 Flanker fighter jet violated its airspace over the island of Bornholm while chasing a U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber. While it is not uncommon for Russian military aircraft to operate over the Baltic with their transponders switched off, the collision in the waters south of the Øresund Bridge suggests that the Kazanets may have similarly failed to identify itself.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 6, 2021",SAM System That Guards Washington DC Just Made Its Lowest Ever Intercept Of A Mock Cruise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military conducted the lowest ever intercept of a mock cruise missile using the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS , during a test earlier this month. Operationally, NASAMS helps protect the airspace around Washington, D.C. and the larger surrounding National Capital Region . This test follows a number of other cruise missile defense experiments in the past year or so , including a recent demonstration of the ability of a self-propelled 155mm howitzer to bring down such a weapon using a hyper velocity projectile . The test took place on Sept. 3, 2020 and involved a NASAMS situated on Santa Rosa Island, located off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, engaging a very low-flying unmanned BQM-167 Skeeter target drone simulating an incoming cruise missile. The U.S. Air Force’s 780th Test Squadron, based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and responsible for various conventional weapon testing , led the test as part of a program called Vermilion Stallion. A low-quality image the Air Force released from the Vermilion Stallion test., USAF The service’s 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron managed the launch and operation of the BQM-167, while personnel from the U.S. Army’s 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command and 1st Battalion, 204th Air Defense Artillery manned the NASAMS. The 263rd is part of the South Carolina Army National Guard, while 1-204th is an element of the Mississippi Army National Guard. The test had actually been pushed back due to Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura, which battered the region in August. More than $20 million worth of weapons and other equipment had to be relocated to safety before being sent back to Santa Rosa. “This live-fire made history as the lowest altitude surrogate cruise missile ever impacted with the system,” according to an Air Force press release. “The successful execution enabled the verification, validation, and re-characterization of the nation’s air defense system’s many upgrades.” Cruise missiles typically fly at low altitudes to avoid detection and intercept. The release did not offer any details about these improvements to NASAMS, which is a ground-launched version of Raytheon’s AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) that that company developed in cooperation with Norway’s Kongsberg Defense. The two defense companies have developed an extended range version of the system using a missile that combines components of the AIM-120C-7 and the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), another Raytheon product. In 2019, Qatar became the first country to officially buy NASAMS along with these AMRAAM-ER missiles. You can read more about NASAMS and the AMRAAM-ER in this past War Zone piece . Upgrades to the NASAMS, especially to be able to detect, track, and engage especially low-flying threats, make good sense given how important the systems are to the critical task of protecting the airspace over and around the nation’s capital. Though unknown to most Americans, NASAMS is the primary surface to air missile system in the National Capital Region. It is also supplemented by a number of AN/TWQ-1 Avenger short-range air defense systems at key locations. Air Force F-16C/D Viper fighter jets and Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin helicopters are also on call to respond to contingencies. This airspace is among the most heavily restricted and monitored in the world and any potential threats are taken very seriously. In November 2019, a possible intrusion triggered a lockdown at the White House and the Capitol, though that thankfully turned out to be a false alarm, as you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . This test also comes at a time when there has been a renewed focus on the potential threats posed by cruise missiles, both to American forces on the battlefield and U.S. territory, across the U.S. military. This was codified in the most recent Missile Defense Review that the Pentagon released last year. The previous review, which came out in 2010, was focused entirely on ballistic missile defense. Protecting the National Capital Region against cruise missiles, including those fired from submarines or other ships, potentially operating clandestinely offshore, has long been a concern for the U.S. government. This was the primary driver behind the U.S. military’s abortive Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, or JLENS, an aerostat-mounted radar system . This multi-billion-dollar program began in 1996 and finally came to end more than two decades later after numerous cost increases and delays. This new attention to the matter of cruise missile defense has translated into a number of different initiatives, including work developing and acquiring various means of detecting and intercepting such weapons. During a multi-day Air Force-led experiment earlier this month, a U.S. Army XM1299 self-propelled 155mm howitzer shot down another BQM-167 simulating a cruise missile with a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP), an unprecedented feat. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0QqomuuAeQ4 “That’s video games, sci-fi awesome. You’re not supposed to be able to shoot down a cruise missile with a tank,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said afterward. “But, yes, you can, if the bullet is smart enough, and the bullet we use for that system is exceptionally smart.” This experiment was primarily focused on exploring new networking capabilities able to link a wide array of weapons, sensors, and command and control nodes together. It also involved tests of HVPs fired from a 5-inch naval gun on a ground-based test stand a modified M107 self-propelled howitzer that appears to have been acting as a surrogate for the 155mm Advanced Gun Systems found on the U.S. Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers. An MQ-9 Reaper drone took down another BQM-167 with an AIM-9X Sidewinder, while an F-16C/D Viper shot down one more with a laser-guided 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) rocket during the event, as well. In both cases , the target drones were again meant to simulate incoming cruise missiles. NASAMS was also present at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for this experiment. This appears to be unrelated to the Vermilion Stallion test off the coast of Florida. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0hI5bMFzM-k The Army has also bought a small number of Iron Dome systems from Israel as an interim cruise missile defense system. The service curtailed that effort earlier this year, ostensibly over concerns about integrating it with the rest of its integrated air defense networks. There had also been questions about just how well suited Iron Dome might be to cruise missile defense. It is primarily designed to knock down lower-tier threats such as artillery rockets and shells, mortar bombs, and small drones. NASAMS successful interception of a mock cruise missile flying at very low altitude only underscores how important cruise missile defense is to the U.S. military at present, including when it comes to the defense of the nation’s capital.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A series of dramatic photos show a blaze that recently broke out aboard the U.S. Coast Guard’s Legend -class cutter USCGC Waesche while at sea in the Western Pacific. After the crew successfully tackled the fire, the vessel limped into port at Yokosuka, Japan. The fire broke out on September 19, 2020, while the Waesche was on a scheduled deployment in the U.S. Seventh Fleet’s area of operations. The first sign of the conflagration was black smoke emanating from the ship’s exhaust stack and surrounding areas. What the Coast Guard described as a “shipboard engineering fire” was extinguished after 90 minutes of firefighting by members of the vessel’s approximately 150-person crew. “The rapid response and courageous efforts from the crewmembers aboard Waesche to quickly contain and extinguish the fire are a testament to the bravery and skill of this crew,” said Capt Jason Ryan, the ship’s commanding officer. The arduous conditions that the crew faced are readily apparent in the following series of photos: U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY Five crew members received minor injuries while tackling the flames and required onboard medical treatment. Coast Guard spokesman Lt Cmdr Stephen Brickey told the Washington Examiner that the injuries included smoke inhalation, heat exhaustion, and one sprained knee. As for the Waesche , the cutter made its way to Yokosuka unaided, but will now require an inspection to determine what repairs are needed. When the vessel entered the Japanese port on September 22, the Coast Guard said it was still unsure as to the cause of the fire. Any necessary major maintenance to the Coast Guard cutter could very well be conducted at Yokosuka’s U.S. Naval Ship Repair Facility and Japan Regional Maintenance Center. Commissioned in May 2010 as the second of 11 planned Legend -class National Security Cutters , the 418-foot Waesche is home-ported at Coast Guard Island in Alameda, California. Coast Guard Cutter Waesche transits under the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, California, on August 23, 2020., U.S. COAST GUARD / PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS AIDAN COONEY With a range of 12,000 nautical miles, the vessel can support U.S. Navy operations in the wider Indo-Pacific region, where the Waesche comes under the tactical control of the Seventh Fleet, which is headquartered at Yokosuka. In a statement, the Coast Guard said that the cutter had been underway on “routine presence operations in support of the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.” The Waesche departed Alameda on August 22 for its patrol of the Western Pacific. According to the Coast Guard, it was in the region “to engage in professional exchanges and capacity-building exercises with partner nations.” USCGC Waesche approaches the San Francisco Bay Bridge as it departs its Alameda, California, homeport on August 22, 2020, for its Western Pacific patrol. , U.S. COAST GUARD / CHIEF PETTY OFFICER MATTHEW S. MASASCHI In addition, in the past year or so, Coast Guard cutters have been increasingly assisting with other missions in the Western Pacific. In 2019, the Waesche’s sister ships USCGC Bertholf and Stratton spent 326 days between them monitoring and gathering intelligence on vessels conducting ship-to-ship transfers in the East China, South China, and Yellow Seas to skirt sanctions on North Korea . The Bertholf was also involved in transitting through the Taiwan Strait in April 2019, together with the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur . This is not the first time in recent weeks that a blaze has interrupted operations by a Coast Guard cutter. In August, an electrical fire occurred on the USCGC Healy , an icebreaker , after it had departed Seward, Alaska, bound for the Arctic Ocean. The fire was put out within 30 minutes, with no injuries reported, but led the Coast Guard to cancel the planned deployment and have the ship return home. A fire onboard a ship has the potential to cause significant damage, and fast, as was the case with the U.S. Navy’s Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) that caught fire in July of this year. The fire burned for days and potentially destroyed the billion-dollar vessel. The U.S. Navy is investigating if the fire was started deliberately. Other fires broke out in July, on the future USS John F. Kennedy , a Ford -class aircraft carrier still under construction, and on Bonhomme Richard’s sister ship, USS Kearsarge . In both cases, the warships were in different shipyards in Virginia. Of course, any fire on a vessel underway at sea is hazardous for ship and crew. In this case, we should be thankful that the crew of the Waesche put out the fire as efficiently as they did.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 3, 2021",Russian Flanker Fighter Reportedly Downs Another With Its Cannon By Accident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S Flanker fighter jet reportedly gunned down a Su-30 Flanker during a recent close-air-combat training mishap. The loss of the Russian Aerospace Forces Su-30 was reported by Interfax , on September 22, 2020, the agency saying that the information had been confirmed by the Russian Armed Forces’ Western Military District. The twin-seat Su-30 is said to have come down in a forest within northwest Russia’s Tver region. Both Su-30 crew members apparently ejected safely before being picked up by a search and rescue helicopter. Details of an alleged ‘friendly fire’ incident then emerged, suggesting that the twin-seat Su-30 had in fact been hit by cannon fire from the single-seat Su-35S. The Russian state-run TASS news agency said that it had been told by local emergency services that, based on initial evidence, the Su-30 had indeed been accidentally shot down. “Preliminarily, the cause of the emergency is the accidental hit of a shell on the Su-30 during the exercise,” the unnamed source told TASS . “The shot was fired by another aircraft.” An unconfirmed account posted on a Russian military aviation forum said that the Su-35S had previously been on quick reaction alert (QRA) duty and so it had live 30mm ammunition loaded in its GSh-301 cannon . Su-35s can carry 150 rounds of ammunition for this weapon, mounted in the starboard wing root. The GSh-301 30mm-caliber cannon installation on a Su-35 fighter., CAPTAINM/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Due to the oversight, the Su-35S then launched for air-to-air training against the Su-30, with the gun still armed. The fighter’s air-to-air missiles had, however, been removed before the training sortie. According to another account on the Russian Telegram social media site, the Su-35S pilot pressed the trigger to record a simulated kill against the Su-30 — presumably using the gun camera — and, as a result, inadvertently fired a volley from the cannon. So far, the accounts haven’t specified the exact Su-30 variant that was shot down: the Russian Aerospace Forces operate the Su-30SM and the Su-30M2 , which are produced by factories in Irkutsk and in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, respectively. The 6th Air Force and Air Defence Army — headquartered in St Petersburg — that is responsible for providing airpower for the Western Military District operates the Su-30SM from Khalino air base near Kursk, suggesting this was the variant involved. Meanwhile, the district’s single-seat Su-35S fighters are stationed at Besovets and Khotilovo. While ‘blue-on-blue’ incidents are an unfortunate fact of wartime operations , they are not unheard of during combat training . If confirmed, this latest episode will be added to a previous inadvertent ‘kill’ credited to a Russian Aerospace Forces MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor. In that case, a MiG-31 shot down its wingman using an R-33 long-range air-to-air missile over a training range close to Russia’s border with Mongolia. Full details of that April 2017 incident are discussed in this previous War Zone story. As well as the time required to complete even a preliminary investigation into any such aircraft accident, Russia’s defense ministry is almost certainly less than eager to publicize such incidents against the backdrop of some high-profile aircraft losses and other mishaps. Considering it took almost two years for the truth to emerge about the inadvertent MiG-31 shoot down, and that there still remains no official confirmation about that incident, more details about what happened yesterday in the Tver region may also take some time to come out, if they ever do.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, has flown a CH-47 Chinook powered by two General Electric T408 engines, the same ones found on Sikorsky’s larger CH-53K King Stallion , for the first time. Pictures first emerged of this modified helicopter undergoing ground testing last year. These engines could give the type significantly greater performance. The Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s (CCDC) Aviation & Missile Center (AvMC) announced the first flight on Sept. 22, 2020. The command said that this test, which included hover and pedal turn maneuvers, of the NCH-47D testbed helicopter was conducted from Felker Army Airfield . part of Fort Eustis in Virginia. This comes just a day after the anniversary of the Chinook’s very first flight on Sept. 21, 1961. Variants of the helicopter have been in continuous production for more than five decades now and the design continues to evolve, including with the addition of the T408 engines. “The CCDC AvMC mission is to conduct innovative research, development, and engineering in order to provide new capabilities for our aviation warfighters, and the T408 program is a great example of this,” Army Colonel Justin Highley, head of the Aviation Technology, Systems Integration, and Demonstration arm of AvMC’s Technology Development Directorate, said in a statement, according to Vertical magazine . “Integrating a new engine onto a production aircraft is a huge undertaking, but our combined team did a great job moving the program from an engineering concept to flight test, which is a testimony to the capabilities the AvMC team brings to our soldiers.” Official pictures from the flight offer the first full view of the new, more square-shaped engine nacelles that are necessary to house the T408s, which are larger than the Honeywell Aerospace T55 engines found on existing Chinooks. The new engines are also heavier and, as a result, the pylons that attach them to the rear fuselage have been reinforced. There are additional reinforcing bars between the nacelles themselves and rear fuselage, as well. The modified NCH-47D testbed helicopter with the T408 engines during its first flight at Felker Army Airfield in September 2020., US Army US Army US Army Internally, there have also been changes to the helicopter’s drive chain to go along with the more powerful engines. Boeing also installed an off-engine torque measurement system from the Parker LORD Corporation on the NCH-47D. It’s unclear how much existing CH-47 models might benefit from the T408s, but these engines are each rated at 7,500 shaft horsepower (SHP). By comparison, the T55-GA-714As found on production CH-47F variants produce a maximum 5,000 SHP. Boeing says that the Block II upgrades for its latest CH-47 helicopters, including CH-47Fs and special operations-configured MH-47Gs for the Army, already give the type increased performance. The first Block II MH-47G, which Boeing delivered to the US Army in 2020., Boeing The Block II improvements were originally developed for the Army and included initial work to pave the way for the integration of improved engines in the future. Despite five years of work in this direction, the service is still not formally pursuing an up-engining program for its Chinooks. So far, the work that Boeing has been doing on the NCH-47D with the T408s had been funded through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, a mechanism that allows U.S. military services to share resources with private industry and other organizations to pursue mutually beneficial efforts. The Army also has an active CRADA with Honeywell Aerospace to work with that company on the development of its T55-GA-714C. That engine is rated at 6,000 SHP and also reportedly has 10 percent greater fuel efficiency over the T55-GA-714A. Though less powerful, Honeywell Aerospace is promoting this as an alternative to the T408, adding that its new T55 design requires virtually no airframe changes and fewer internal modifications. Part of the reticence to new engines on the Army’s part seems to be a product of a stated desire to move beyond the Chinook to a new heavy-lift rotary-wing aircraft of some kind as part of its over-arching Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. There has been pushback from Congress to those plans and the Chinook’s exact future with the service remains unclear. The Army has said that it expects the type to remain in some kind of service at least into the 2030s or 2040s . Still, the CH-47F is still very much in production, with India receiving its first examples last year. Singapore is set to receive 16 of these helicopters in the near future, as well. The United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom are looking to buy more Chinooks and could acquire Block II versions , too. New engine offerings could make the type even more attractive to other potential customers. Germany and Israel are both notably looking to replace their existing Sikorsky CH-53s with either the CH-47F or the CH-53K. Boeing could very well offer an engine upgrade package to existing Chinook operators, as well, as a relatively low-cost way to boost the capabilities of their fleets. Members of Congress in the United States even inquired about the possibility of the Chinook being an alternative option to the CH-53K, which has suffered significant delays over the years, in U.S. Marine Corps service. However, the Marines have stood by the King Stallion, which has seen significant progress is rectifying technical issues in recent years, and are moving ahead with putting that helicopter into service. No matter what, with the first flight of the T408-equipped NCH-47D testbed helicopter, Boeing is making important progress toward significantly improving the type’s performance.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",Behold A British Carrier Carrying The Most Stealth Fighters Of Any Warship To Date,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has embarked the largest number of aircraft on its deck ever, as F-35B stealth fighters from British and American squadrons have gone aboard for the next phase of maneuvers. The Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, and U.S. Marine Corps have been working up to this for weeks now, as you can read about in this previous War Zone piece . A total of 15 fighter jets from the Royal Air Force’s No 617 Squadron “Dambusters” and the U.S. Marines Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “Wake Island Avengers,” are now on the carrier, together with eight Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Merlin helicopters . The jets began to arrive on the carrier yesterday, September 22, 2020, and the photos released today show 14 F-35Bs on the flight deck, ten from the U.S. Marines Corps, and four from the RAF. This suggests that one additional British aircraft is either yet to embark or was in the ship’s hangar deck when the pictures were taken. The United Kingdom currently has 15 operational F-35Bs, in total, at RAF Marham. Another three are at Edwards Air Force Base in California for ongoing test and evaluation work, so there is the potential capacity to further expand the current fixed-wing air group. Until now, the biggest F-35B air group we have seen was on the USS America last year as it sailed in the eastern Pacific. There were 13 F-35Bs on deck and possibly even more stowed away in the hangar deck. This reflected the U.S. Marine Corps’ “Lightning Carrier” concept, which could see amphibous assault ships carry between 16 and 20 F-35Bs in total, something you can read more about this concept in this past War Zone feature . The U.S. Marines Corps declared that its F-35Bs had reached initial operational capability back in 2015 embarked them on an amphibious assault ship for the first time in 2018. That year, Marine F-35B went on to become the first American Joint Strike Fighters to conduct actual strikes, hitting targets in Afghanistan . UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE/CROWN COPYRIGHT UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE/CROWN COPYRIGHT Having 15 jets from two different frontline squadrons on deck is a major achievement for HMS Queen Elizabeth and the U.K.’s Carrier Strike capability. This became dormant in November 2010, after that year’s Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) axed the Royal Navy’s last fixed-wing aircraft carrier, HMS Ark Royal , together with all of its fixed-wing carrier-capable Harrier jump jets . UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE/CROWN COPYRIGHT The lead vessel of a two-ship class, HMS Queen Elizabeth went to sea for the first time in June 2017 to begin trials off the coast of Scotland. The first aircraft to land on its deck was a Royal Navy Merlin HM2 helicopter, which touched down in July 2017. The first Lightning operations on the carrier took place off the US east coast in September 2018 , involving F-35Bs from the Integrated Test Force (ITF) based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The first British-owned jets began operating from the carrier in October 2019, again off the US east coast . UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE/CROWN COPYRIGHT According to the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the air group currently embarked on HMS Queen Elizabeth includes the largest number of fighter jets to operate at sea from a Royal Navy carrier since HMS Hermes in 1983. However, it seems that HMS Illustrious went to sea in September 2001 with eight Royal Navy Sea Harriers and eight RAF Harrier GR7s, for a total of 16 fast jets. The 65,000-ton (displacement) aircraft HMS Queen Elizabeth departed its homeport of Her Majesty’s Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth on September 21, 2020, to begin exercises with allies in the North Sea, which will include the embarked F-35Bs. The maneuvers will include Joint Warrior , billed as NATO’s largest annual exercise, which is scheduled to take place off the northeast coast of Scotland from September 21 to October 15. UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE/CROWN COPYRIGHT As part of a so-called Group Exercise, the carrier will operate alongside seven other Royal Navy warships — destroyers, frigates, and auxiliaries — plus other supporting units. This is part of the workup before HMS Queen Elizabeth forms the centerpiece of a U.K.-led NATO Carrier Strike Group that is scheduled to begin a first operational mission next year. “This is an incredibly exciting time for 617 Squadron as we begin a new era of partnership with the US Marine Corps building towards next year’s operational deployment with HMS Queen Elizabeth ,” said Commander Mark Sparrow, the commanding officer of the RAF’s No 617 Squadron. “You need to go back more than three decades to find the UK operating anything on this scale or complexity and this is a first for fifth-generation carrier capability; the era of big-deck, fast jet carrier operations is back.” “The Wake Island Avengers are ready to work with the British sailors and aircrew on board HMS Queen Elizabeth , said Lt Col Joseph Freshour, commanding officer of VMFA-211. “We are looking forward to deploying alongside our British counterparts over the next few months, and we will work tirelessly as a part of this transatlantic naval force.

But this marks the first time we have brought them together in a cohesive, potent, fighting force. “HMS Queen Elizabeth will be operating with the largest air group of fifth-generation fighters assembled anywhere in the world. Led by the Royal Navy, and backed by our closest allies, this new Carrier Strike Group puts real muscle back into NATO and sends a clear signal that the United Kingdom takes its global role seriously.” UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE/CROWN COPYRIGHT Captain James Blackmore, the UK’s Carrier Air Wing Commander, added: “We are going to learn a huge amount from operating F-35Bs at sea with the USMC, they have had them longer and we can share ideas and practices. But this is much more than that; this is the trans-Atlantic alliance in action, demonstrating that two close allies can not only fly from each other’s carriers, but can fight alongside each other should we need to. This level of integration offers a decisive flexibility in times of crisis, conflict or war.” HMS Queen Elizabeth is expected to return to Portsmouth in late October. By embarking these two squadrons of F-35Bs, plus supporting helicopters, the U.K. has already made another important step towards reinstating its Carrier Strike Group capability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 21, 2020","Russia’s New Icebreaker, The World’s Largest, Is Heading To The Arctic For The First Time","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Arktika , the first of Russia’s new nuclear-powered Project 22220 icebreakers , the largest and most powerful such ship in the world at present, has set sail for its future homeport in Murmansk with plans to plow through ice in the Arctic before it arrives there. However, only two of the ship’s three engines are presently working, raising questions about just how close it really is to fully entering operational service. The icebreaker, which is set to be delivered soon to the state-run company FSUE Atomflot, part of Russia’s central nuclear corporation Rosatom, left the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg on Sept. 22, 2020. This follows the completion of initial sea trials in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland earlier this month. Rosatom says that Arktika will sail in the Arctic north of Franz Josef Land, a Russian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, and test out its ability to break through ice before turning south and heading to Murmansk. The entire trip will take approximately two weeks. Franz Josef Land notably includes Alexandra Land, an island that is home to Russia’s northernmost military outpost, which has seen significant expansion this year, something you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece .Â A map giving a sense of just how far north Arktika will sail on this voyage. From top to bottom, St. Petersburg, Murmansk, and Franz Josef Land., Google Maps “Many thanks to the shipbuilders and everyone who took part in the implementation of this project for your work,” Vyacheslav Ruksha, the Director of the Northern Sea Route Directorate of Rosatom State Corporation, said in a statement . “I am confident that the next Project 22220 icebreakers will be built and will ensure the fulfillment of all tasks for Russia in the Arctic Ocean.” Russia’s first Project 22220 icebreaker, Arktika ., Rosatom Arktika displaces around 33,000 tons and is 570 feet long and is around 168 feet tall at its highest point, giving the crew good visibility of the ice below and the rest of their surroundings. This makes them bigger than the previous largest icebreakers, Russia’s nuclear-powered Project 10520s, which displace around 25,000 tons. The first of the six Project 10520s, also named Arktika , entered service in the Soviet Union in 1975 . Only two of what these original Arktika class icebreakers, the Yamal and 50 Let Pobedy , remain in Russian service today, along with two other slightly smaller nuclear-powered icebreakers, Taymyr and Vaygach .Â Russia is the only country, at present, to operate nuclear-powered icebreakers and Project 22220s are powered by two RITM-200 pressurized water reactors, each rated at 175 megawatts, which supply electricity to three electric motors, each driving a single propeller. It is expected to be able to break through ice up to seven feet thick. Russia operates dozens of other smaller conventionally powered icebreakers and other ice capable ships, as well. The country is looking to further expand these fleets, including buying missile-armed corvettes with reinforced hulls capable of punching through ice, the first of which was launched last year. You can read more about these developments in this past War Zone piece . Arktika , the design of which was finalized in 2009 and construction of which began in 2012, has suffered a number of significant delays over the years. One particularly major issue was that the original design for the ship’s powerplant included turbogenerators from Ukrainian firm Turboatom. Needless to say, after the Kremlin’s illegal seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and its subsequent active support for pro-Russian separatists fighting the government in Kyiv, this was no longer an option. Subsequent U.S. government sanctions also blocked the delivery of components from General Electric that were necessary for the ship’s electric propulsion system.Â New domestic sources had to be found, leading to schedule slips in Arktika ‘s delivery, first from 2017 to 2019, and then from 2019 to this year. Further problems with the propulsion system had led to the ship only beginning sea trials in December 2019 using an auxiliary diesel powerplant. Then, in February 2020, one of the ship’s three main electric motors suffered a complete failure, leaving it with only two working propellers . https://youtube.com/watch?v=ipeFgaPMP8Q At present, this motor has not yet been replaced, limiting Arktika ‘s capabilities. Russia plans to accept delivery of the ship in this state and does not expect to conduct the necessary repairs until around this time next year , at the earliest.Â Earlier this year, FSUE Atomflot filed three lawsuits against the Baltic Shipyard seeking a total of 1 billion rubles, more than $13 million at the rate of exchange at the time of writing, for unspecified reasons. It’s hard not to believe that these are related, at least in part, to the continuing troubles with the Arktika and other Project 22220s, three more of which are already under construction. Even despite these issues, Arktika and her future sister ships certainly do reflect the Russian government’s significant Arctic ambitions and its position as the largest single operator of icebreakers in the world. Increasing geopolitical competition in the far north, driven in part by global climate change making it easier to access the region and its lucrative natural resources, from oil to fish, has shown a light on this disparity, particularly in the United States.Â At present, the U.S. government only owns two operational icebreakers, both of which the U.S. Coast Guard operates, and which are increasingly old and prone to mishaps. One of these ships, the USCGC Healy , suffered a fire and propulsion system fire in August, forcing it to abandon a planned mission in the Arctic and return home. The larger, but older USCGC Polar Star has experienced similarly serious accidents in recent years. The USCGC Healy ., USCG The Coast Guard is now set to receive three new heavy icebreakers , which will be conventionally powered, but of similar overall size to Russia’s Project 22220s. However, these ships are still years away from entering service and will act as just a minor measuring in closing the gap in icebreaking capacity with Russia. This is not a particularly new issue. On Sept. 21, Dr Elizabeth Buchanan a lecturer on strategic studies at the Australian Defense College and a fellow at the The Modern War Institute at the United States Military Academy, Tweeted a portion of a 1972 document found in the CIA Records Search Tool (CREST) archives discussing the implications of America’s small icebreaking fleets and how embarrassing it would be if one of those ships were to break down and get stuck in thick ice, requiring rescue from a Soviet icebreaker. At the same time, it’s worth noting that those concerns did not come at a time when a significant decline in polar ice in the Arctic was threatening to drive a complete strategic rebalance in that region. a 1972 'icebreaker gap' warning…c/o the CIA archives ðŸ‘‡ is anything really 'new' in the #Arctic strategic narrative? pic.twitter.com/OQ6eHzq3R4 — Dr Elizabeth Buchanan (@BuchananLiz) September 21, 2020 U.S. President Donald Trump, who has also advocated for exploring the possibility of the U.S. government acquiring nuclear-powered icebreakers, suggested in July 2020 that an effort was underway to secure additional icebreaking capacity, possibly for a foreign country, in the near term. There has been no public discussion since then about this plan and what it might actually entail. In the meantime, despite setbacks, Russia’s decision to send Arktika certainly shows its continuing commitment to modernizing and expanding its already remarkably large icebreaker fleet.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 12, 2021",Taiwan Displays Air-Launched Cruise Missiles At Air Base In Heart Of Taiwan Strait,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During a visit to the Republic of China Air Force’s Makung Air Force Base on the Penghu archipelago, on September 22, 2020, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen was shown a display of Wan Chien conventionally-armed air-launched land-attack cruise missiles. The weapons are carried exclusively by the air force’s fleet of F-CK-1C/D Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF) that are deployed to Makung AFB on a rotational basis. Tsai took the opportunity to praise Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) aircrew stationed on Penghu for their “heroic performance” in intercepting aircraft from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) over the Strait — an activity that’s become a more regular occurrence in recent weeks. “I’m aware that facing the provocative behavior of the communist planes that have encircled the island and damaged regional peace in recent days, your duty at the front line of the airspace in Penghu must be even heavier,” the president told ROCAF personnel at Makung AFB. President Tsai Ing-wen addresses ROCAF personnel in a hangar at Makung AFB on the Penghu Islands., TAIWAN TV NEWS SCREENCAP The significance of the indigenous Wan Chien missile within the ROCAF armory in particular is its ability to be launched from F-CK-1C/Ds operating above the Taiwan Strait and hit targets on the Chinese mainland. Basing jets on Penghu — a group of 64 islands between Taiwan and mainland China — brings them even closer to the PRC and provides a useful forward location to counter any potential invasion from across the Strait. Of course, it is arguable exactly how long the air base at Makung would survive in the case of an all-out attack by the PLA, which is well equipped with ballistic and cruise missiles tailored for just such strikes. Makung AFB on the island of the same name within the Penghu archipelago., GOOGLE EARTH A ROCAF officer at Makung AFB told the Reuters agency that the IDF jets are required to scramble to intercept PLA aircraft within five minutes. Another official confirmed that the fighter jets stationed on Penghu are currently being launched “almost every day” in response to PLA aircraft activity. Makung AFB is home to detachments of F-CK-1C/Ds drawn from either the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) or 3rd TFW, based on the main island of Taiwan and which are usually forward-deployed to Penghu between April and October each year. In peacetime, the presence of the Wan Chien missiles on Penghu is in keeping with Taiwan’s strategy of presenting Beijing with a credible deterrent, and should that deterrent fail, they would help defend against a PLA attack and possible invasion, during which their likely targets would include airfields, ports, missile sites, and radar stations. The missile’s standoff capability would allow it to be launched outside the range of many of the PLA’s ground-based air defense systems. The location of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait, between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland., GOOGLE MAPS These missiles, which first entered service in 2018, have a reported range of 155 miles and use GPS guidance. The Wan Chien — the name means ‘ten thousand swords’ — is broadly similar in appearance to MBDA’s Taurus KEPD 350 , with similar pop-out wings located at the top of the missile body, but with the air intake for the turbojet motor located below the rear section of the weapon. The missile can reportedly accommodate a range of different warhead options, comprising high-explosive, semi-armor-piercing, or submunitions. As well as the Wan Chien missiles on display on Penghu, which have a primary land-attack role, live AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles have also recently been seen carried by ROCAF F-16 fighters, as The War Zone discussed here . A single-seat F-CK-1C fighter armed with a pair of Wan Chien missiles under the wings., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Produced by the military-run Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST), the Wan Chien missile is an important part of a wide-ranging upgrade program that has been undertaken for the ROCAF F-CK-1 fighter fleet, which numbers 103 single-seat F-CK-1C and 26 twin-seat F-CK-1D aircraft, according to Flight International’s World Air Forces 2020 survey. The upgraded aircraft is officially known as Hsiung Ying, meaning ‘Brave Hawk.’ The president’s visit to the islands was clearly timed as a response to the notable increase in the antagonism between Taiwan and the PRC, as well as a spike in aerial activity by both nations over the Taiwan Strait. The PRC views Taiwan as a rogue province and both political and military tensions between the island and the mainland have ramped up significantly in recent years. Under the Trump Administration, the United States has intensified its military relationship with Taiwan. The current U.S. administration has secured unprecedented arms deals with the country, including the purchase of new Block 70 F-16C/D fighter jets for the ROCAF, and further weapons sales are anticipated . An infographic that the Taiwanese Air Force released in 2019 regarding its future Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, with the message “See You Soon!”, ROCAF The PLA’s recent maneuvers near Taiwan have been seen as a response to the visit to Taipei by Keith Krach , an economic representative from the U.S. government, described as “the highest-level official from the State Department to visit the island in decades.” Increased Chinese military activity around Taiwan has included high-profile incidents in which PLA aircraft have crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait that separates the highly sensitive channel and acts as an unofficial airspace boundary between the mainland and the island. However, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently argued that “The so-called ‘median line’ is non-existent,” adding that Taiwan itself “is an inalienable part of China’s territory.” Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu responded by describing the line as a “symbol of the status quo to avoid cross-strait military conflict and maintain peace and stability.” He further demanded that “the Chinese government stops everything that it has been doing.” While PLA aircraft entering Taiwanese airspace is not in itself unusual, the latest incidents have involved more assets than in the past and these have been approaching the area from different directions simultaneously. Apparently in response to Krach’s visit to Taiwan, a force of 18 PLA aircraft crossed the median line on September 18, then entered the island’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). The PLA aircraft included a pair of PLAAF H-6K bombers , at least one of which was carrying four YJ-12 anti-ship missiles . Also involved were eight J-16 fighter-bombers , four J-10 fighters , and four J-11 fighters. A PLAAF H-6K from the 10th Bomber Division carrying four YJ-12 anti-ship missiles during a flight over the Taiwan Strait., ROCAF Other officials in Beijing have also been reiterating the PRC’s claims to Taiwan, official news agency Xinhua quoting Ren Guoqiang , a spokesperson for the country’s Ministry of National Defense, as saying these exercises are “a necessary move aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Ren then issued the warning: “Those who play with fire will get burnt.” In a statement on Twitter, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense called for Beijing to “exercise restraint and refrain from escalating tensions across the Taiwan Straits. PLA’s military intimidation is deplorable and has caused resentment amongst people in Taiwan. We call on PRC cherish peace and maintain regional stability [sic].” A day later, September 19, the PLA was again back in force in the region, its aircraft crossing the median line and entering Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ. On this occasion, the aircraft involved were 12 J-16s, two J-10s, two J-11s, two H-6s, and a single Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft . The Republic of China Air Force said it responded by issuing radio warnings and scrambling fighters and that it “deployed [an] air defense missile system to monitor the activities.” Flight paths of the PLA aircraft that crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ on September 19, 2020., TAIWAN MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE The massed deployment of aircraft in the region is a tactic that Beijing has used before to demonstrate its displeasure with U.S. activity relating to the island. Back in August 2020 , formations of J-10 and J-11 fighters also crossed the median line, on that occasion apparently in response to a high-level visit to Taiwan by the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Clearly, the war of words between the PRC and Taiwan has escalated and, with it, Taiwan’s eagerness to demonstrate the high-tech weapons that it sees as an essential counterbalance to Beijing’s territorial ambitions.

In a “Monday Motivation” Tweet sent out late last night, Strategic Command (STRATCOM) provided figures for the longest-duration flights by the B-1B Lancer , B-2 Spirit , and B-52 Stratofortress . Before we look at those particular missions, it’s worth looking at the details of the Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-160 flight. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a pair of Tu-160s took off from their home base of Engels near Saratov in western Russia and then flew more than 12,427 miles over international waters, on a route that covered the central part of the Arctic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Barents Seas. The bombers then returned to Engels. The defense ministry confirmed that the Tu-160s were each refueled three times from six Il-78 Midas tankers and were also escorted by Su-35S Flanker fighters “along with foreign aircraft along certain sections of their route.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=5dmYCKTU2zY The foreign aircraft types included U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptors and an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, which encountered the bomber pair in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). #NORAD F-22 Raptors and an E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft, supported by KC-135 air refuelers, positively identified two Tu-160 bombers and two Su-35 fighter aircraft entering the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) three times last night. — North American Aerospace Defense Command (@NORADCommand) September 19, 2020 The crews for the two Blackjacks were led by Major-General Oleg Pchela and Lieutenant Col Sergei Volkovitsky. It wasn’t said exactly when the flight took place, but it was officially announced by the commander of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation branch, Lieutenant General Sergey Kobylash, on September 19. Some observers have suggested that Kobylash’s claim that “nobody has flown this type of aircraft longer” may not even stack up with regards to the Tu-160 and that Blackjack crews flew sorties of an equivalent length during the Soviet era. However, the Long-Range Aviation boss stated that the previous record for the type was set in 2020 and had a duration of 24 hours 24 minutes. No matter what, this recent flight is certainly not a world-record for the longest heavy bomber sortie, as American crews can attest. B-1B Lancer The record non-stop flights identified by STRATCOM begin with a mission lasting 30 hours by a B-1B in 2014. This refers to a precision-strike training mission flown by the 28th Bomb Wing from Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, by a pair of Lancers on May 13-14 of that year . The B-1B pair dropped inert munitions on targets on a range “near Guam ” before returning to Ellsworth. The flight covered around 13,200 miles. Final checks for a B-1B on the flight line at Ellsworth AFB on May 12, 2014 before the round trip, non-stop training mission to a range near Guam., U.S. AIR FORCE / AIRMAN 1ST CLASS REBECCA IMWALLE The 2014 B-1B mission was presumably just slightly longer than that flown by a Lancer on April 22, 2020, which took it from Ellsworth over the Bering Sea, past Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, and around Japan. According to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), the B-1 “flew a 30-hour round-trip sortie.” You can read more about that mission, and its wider importance, here . However, a pair of 28th Bomb Wing B-1Bs did actually fly a longer round-trip sortie over the South China Sea on April 29, 2020. The Lancers again flew from Ellsworth AFB as part of a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and STRATCOM Bomber Task Force mission, on this occasion recording a mission of 32 hours’ duration, according to a statement from PACAF . A B-1B from the 28th Bomb Wing launches from Ellsworth AFB on April 28, 2020, to support a Bomber Task Force mission in the Indo-Pacific region., U.S. AIR FORCE PHOTO / SENIOR AIRMAN NICOLAS ERWIN B-2 Spirit The longest-duration B-2 flight was a combat mission, flown against targets in Afghanistan in 2001. In the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, B-2 stealth bombers of the 509th Bomb Wing flying from their home base of Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, flew ultra-long-range strikes at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom. Six strikes occurred in all from October 7-9. The record Spirit mission was the third of these, conducted on the second night of the campaign, and involved the B-2 nicknamed Spirit of America flown by Major Melvin G. Deaile and Captain Brian Neal. Powered by ‘go pills’ to keep them alert, the two pilots took turns at the controls and sleeping before they entered Afghan airspace and dropped 12 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) on their targets. The B-2 was then scheduled to land at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean before the crew got the call to return to Afghanistan, where they dropped another four JDAMs. The bomber finally touched down at Diego Garcia after being airborne for 44 hours 22 minutes. In some ways, the entire mission for Spirit of America was significantly longer, since after touching down at Diego Garcia it remained on the tarmac, engines running, while it was refueled and serviced. Less than an hour later it took off and returned to Whiteman AFB — total mission time, over 70 hours. B-52 Stratofortress Surpassing even the record B-2 flight is the longest sortie recorded by the B-52, a remarkable 45 hours and 19 minutes achieved back in January 1957. Operation Power Flite was designed to demonstrate the Air Force’s ability to strike targets anywhere in the world and involved the first circumnavigation of the globe by a jet aircraft. A total of five B-52Bs from the 93rd Bombardment Wing at Castle Air Force Base, California, took part, each with its normal crew of six supplemented by an additional pilot, a navigator, and a crew chief, and with specific modifications including bunks, galley, and 20-man life rafts. The five bombers took off from Castle AFB on January 16, one soon experiencing technical problems and aborting, and another — a designated spare — landing in the United Kingdom. The mission included a simulated bomb run in Malaya, then still technically a colony of the United Kingdom, and required no fewer than 98 KC-97 tankers . After landing at March Air Force Base, California, each of the airmen involved in the mission received a Distinguished Flying Cross from General Curtis E. LeMay , then-commander-in-chief of Strategic Air Command (SAC). Why long-range still matters Long-range bomber missions have not only prestige value but are a key component of combat operations. All three bomber types operated by Air Force Global Strike Command have flown combat missions launched from bases in the Continental United States, while Russian Tu-22M3 , Tu-95MS , and Tu-160 bombers have all undertaken attacks on targets in Syria after launching from bases in Russia. In the era of standoff cruise missiles, the ability to launch a long-range bomber from your own territory and strike targets anywhere on the planet is of enormous strategic value. Manned bombers are the most flexible part of the nuclear triads in Russia and in the United States, and the importance assigned to the development of new-generation cruise missiles with which to arm them means their future looks secure. In recent months, U.S. Air Force bombers have demonstrated their capabilities with multiple high-profile Bomber Task Force missions over Europe , the Arctic, and the Pacific region . The same day that STRATCOM tweeted about its record non-stop missions, B-1Bs, B-2s, and B-52Hs flying from bases in Europe and the United States flew over eastern Europe and the western Pacific Ocean, integrating with NATO allies — including from Canada, Norway, and the United Kingdom — and other partners. “This mission demonstrates the U.S. Defense Department’s ability to command and control its bomber force for any mission, anywhere in the world, at any time, in support of the U.S. National Defense Strategy,” said the U.S. European Command in a press release. In this way, these missions broadcast a message to would-be foes just as clear as the Cold War endeavors, such as Operation Power Flite. With the manned long-range bomber seemingly enjoying a renaissance in Russia and the United States, and with sorties taking place at a prolific rate, it might only be a matter of time before more records are broken.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Work is continuing on the Next Generation Jammer-Low Band pod, or NGJ-LB , for the U.S. Navy. This is just one part of the larger Next Generation Jammer effort that will provide the service’s EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft with new, advanced capabilities, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone piece . Work on the NGJ-LB this year has including testing a prototype system at the Naval Air Systems Command’s science-fiction-looking anechoic chamber at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The anechoic chamber is one of the components of Naval Air Systems Command’s (NAVAIR) larger Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility (ACETEF). The Navy approved the release of the picture of the EA-18G with Northrop Grumman’s Demonstration of Existing Technologies (DET) prototype of the NGJ-LB pod, earlier this month, but did not say exactly when the tests had occurred. A previous NAVAIR press release in June 2020 stated that this testing was already complete by then. Anechoic chambers, some of which are absolutely giant , are designed to eliminate any ambient electromagnetic radiation, allowing for more accurate testing of how different electronic systems on an aircraft may or may not impact each others’ functioning. The emissions from one or more systems could interfere and have very negative impacts on others, which could in turn limit their functionality when they are needed most. It could also potentially prove dangerous if unexpected issues crop up during an actual flight test. A combination of black and blue-colored pyramid-shaped polyurethane and polyethylene spikes on the walls, ceiling, and floor, together with RF absorbing material, help deaden any electromagnetic waves in the chamber. The aircraft, in this case an EA-18G with the DET NGJ-LB pod, is then suspended from the ceiling in the middle of the room. The pod itself looks very similar to the one it replaces, as opposed to the new mid-ban jamming pod, which looks more like a missionized fuel tank than its more streamlined predecessor. USN When it comes to developing electronic warfare systems that are deliberately meant to hamper the transmission of certain kinds of signals, this kind of testing is especially important. The EA-18G Growler’s existing AN/ALQ-99 pods , which Northrop Grumman originally designed specifically for the EA-6B Prowler, required modifications to prevent them from scrambling the plane’s own AN/APG-79 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar, as well as other systems. In March 2020, NAVAIR had announced that the Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band (NGJ-MB), which Raytheon designed, had completed its developmental testing, including its own trip to ACETEF’s anechoic chamber. That system, also known as the AN/ALQ-249(V)1, had suffered notable setbacks, including concerns about significant drag from the pod and the system’s Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP). EIRP is a measure of how efficiently an antenna is transmitting and, by extension in this case, how capable the system is at jamming a target’s emissions. You can read more about these issues in this past War Zone story . An EA-18G with NGJ-MB pods under each wing, as well as an AN/ALQ-99 pod on the centerline, in NAVAIR’s anechoic chamber., USN Both the NGJ-LB and MB systems have undergone testing at ACETEF’s Facility for Antenna and Radar Cross Section Measurement ( FARM ), which is also at Patuxent River. As its name implies, this outdoor site is used to measure the effectiveness of antennas on aircraft and other airborne systems, as well their radar cross-sections. An F/A-18F Super Hornet with a prototype NGJ-LB pod on its centerline is seen here inverted on a test stand at the Facility for Antenna and Radar Cross Section Measurement., USN An EA-18G carried a prototype NGJ-MB pod aloft for the first time in August 2020. It’s not clear when the NGJ-LB pod may see its first flight, but the system began its final round of Demonstration of Existing Technologies testing in May. An EA-18G carries a NGJ-MB pod aloft for the first time in August 2020., USN The Navy is also still in the process of deciding on which prime contractor will build the Block 1 NGJ-LB systems. L3Harris was working on a competing podded system, no pictures of which have yet been seen. In 2018, Northrop Grumman also announced that it was working with the Harris Corporation on its design. Last year, L3 and Harris completed their merger, which means that Northrop Grumman is now both working with L3Harris as a supplier, while also competing against that company’s own separate NGJ-LB team for this contract. The complete NGJ family of systems, which could also eventually include a high band pod, is set to eventually replace the various components of the AN/ALQ-99 system, all of which you can read more about in this previous War Zone piece . The successful completion of testing of the NGJ-LB and MB pods in NAVAIR’s anechoic chamber was a key part of moving the development of these systems, which will give the Navy’s EA-18Gs important new capabilities, along. Author’s note: This story has been updated to clarify the relationship between Northrop Grumman and L3Harris with regards to the NGJ-LB program.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 28, 2021",The Navy’s New Jammers For Its EA-18G Growlers Cut Back Their Range More Than The Old Pods,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says that Raytheon’s Next Generation Jammer-Mid Band pod , of NGJ-MB, at least in its present form, further reduces the maximum range of the EA-18G Growler over the current system. This was one of the reasons why the service rejected the company’s proposal for the Next Generation Jammer-Low Band pod , NGJ-LB, and could present operational challenges in the future. This information and more is contained in a response from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) dismissing Raytheon’s protest of the Navy’s decision to award two separate contracts to L3 and Northrop Grumman for continuing development of the NGJ-LB in August 2018. While the GAO’s basic determination had been public knowledge since October 2018 , the document outlining the watchdog’s position in detail had been previously sealed under a protective order. It is now publicly available, albeit in redacted form. “Raytheon challenges the Navy’s criticisms of its proposed low band jammer with respect to size, drag, EIRP [Effective Isotropic Radiated Power, a measure of the efficiency of a transmitting antenna], and weight,” GAO explained. “We have reviewed all of Raytheon’s arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.” Raytheon’s NGJ-LB concept was derived from their design for the NGJ-MB, also known as the AN/ALQ-249(V)1, which has been in development since at least 2010 . At present, the Navy’s EA-18Gs carry three AN/ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System pods in both high- and low-band configurations, which first entered service in the 1970s. An exploded view of Raytheon’s AN/ALQ-249(V)1 Next-Generation Jammer-Mid Band pod., USN The NGJ-MB will replace the high-band ALQ-99 pods that Growlers carry under each wing, while the NGJ-LB will replace the third, low-band pod that the aircraft lug around on the centerline stores position underneath their fuselage. The Navy does plan to eventually procure an improved high-band jamming capability under the broader NGJ program, but it remains to be seen whether this will consist of additional systems inserted into one or more of the pods already in development or consist of a separate unit altogether. You can read more about these various components and other issues in our recent in-depth profile of the program here . The Navy found that Raytheon’s proposal for the NGJ-LB would be too big for the centerline stores position and expressed concerns about potential weight growth. Raytheon contended that the service had unfairly judged these parameters since it had already cleared the Growler to fly with a 480-gallon drop tank under the fuselage. This store is also outside the approved “volume” for that station. The Massachusetts-headquarters defense contractor also argued it would leverage weight reduction experience from its NGJ-MB work to help reduce risk. A graphic showing various systems the EA-18G typically carries during missions at prsent, including the three ALQ-99 pods., RAAF However, Raytheon’s planned NGJ-LB would have exceeded the maximum volume by a greater margin than the 480-gallon drop tank, which is also not a common store for the EA-18G during routine missions. The Navy reiterated that it had made it clear that any proposals needed to be within the set parameters, regardless. As to the weight issue, the Navy acknowledged it had miscalculated the potential growth that Raytheon’s pod might experience. At the same time, it said that the company couldn’t base its own projections on experience with the NGJ-MB, since the internal components inside the low-band pod would be significantly different. The separate requirements in antenna types and other components between the mid- and low-band pods, and their arrangement within the pod, was also what led the Navy to question the EIRP of Raytheon’s proposed configuration. The mid-band system itself has already had to undergo a major design overhaul due to difficulties in inserting the required jamming equipment and its power supply into the set size and weight parameters for that pod. But by far the biggest revelation from the GAO’s decision is that Raytheon’s NGJ-MB pods, which the Navy still intends to use on its EA-18Gs, produce more drag than the ALQ-99s and will reduce the overall range of the aircraft. This issue was the final reason why the service rejected the firm’s bid for the low-band pod. An EA-18G carrying the current AN/ALQ-99 pods., USN “The Navy explains that Raytheon’s proposal shows that mission radius decreases by [Redacted] NM [Nautical Miles] from [Redacted] NM to [Redacted] NM when two ALQ-99 pods under the aircraft wings are replaced with Raytheon’s mid band pods and the center pod (at station 6) is an ALQ-99,” GAO explained. “The Navy questions Raytheon’s claims that replacing the center pod with Raytheon’s proposed low band pod would decrease mission radius by only [Redacted] NM.” This is, at least in part, a result of how Raytheon crafted the power-generation system for its pod. When the jammers are running, two pairs of doors, one set on each side of the pod, open to allow air in to drive ram-air turbine. The ALQ-99s have small propellers at the front that perform the same basic function and also produce drag, but less than of the new design. It is worth noting that the Navy did not require the drag coefficient for either the mid- or low-band pods to be equal or less than that of the ALQ-99s. However, it still has the potential to create significant operational challenges depending on how pronounced the loss of range is. Enemy surface-to-air missile systems and their associated radars and other sensors , as well as the sensors suites on fighter jets and dedicated early warning aircraft are only increasing in range and capability. Shore-based anti-ship defenses are similarly improving. All of this will require American aircraft carriers to launch strike packages ever further away from their actual objectives. The video below shows various layers of present and future Chinese anti-air and air-ship defense systems that the country has and is developing as part of its strategy to deny its opponents access to broad areas during a potential conflict. These are just some of the threats American carriers and their air wings might have to contend with in the future. The Growlers typically fly with two drop tanks, but cannot carry any additional ones on the wings or underneath the fuselage and still perform their core mission. Those stores stations are taken up by the jamming pods. The EA-18Gs are capable of refueling in flight, but at present, Navy Carrier Air Wings have a severe lack of organic air-to-air refueling capability . Plans to field a fleet of unmanned carrier-based drone tankers, known as the MQ-25A Stingray , are still years away from coming to fruition. Other tankers from the U.S. Air Force or foreign partners may be another option, but would not necessarily be available during distributed or expeditionary operations . With these limitations, it could be harder for the Growlers to get to the target area and remain there on station for extended periods of time. Unless whatever low-band pod design the Navy chooses to procure in the future has equal or less drag than the existing ALQ-99, it could still exacerbate this issue, as well. It could also have repercussions for the proposed high-band pod. The Navy wants the pod to be open-architecture to allow for the rapid insertion of new hardware and software as time goes on, but it’s not at all clear if the existing size and weight parameters of the mid-band pod will be able to accommodate the desired high-band jammers. A US Navy briefing slide outlining the service’s plans for the Next-Generation Jammer program as a whole., USN Raytheon’s design may mitigate the issue somewhat in that the doors for the ram-air turbine do not need to be open all the time, unlike the ALQ-99’s front-mounted propeller, which is constantly exposed. Still, it appears that, by the company’s own calculations, there is still an overall loss in range with the current configuration. This, in turn, raises questions about whether the range reduction becomes more pronounced if the aircraft spend more of their flying time actually jamming. A more immediate solution would be for the Navy to acquire conformal fuel tanks (CFT) for the EA-18Gs. It is already working with the aircraft’s manufacturer, Boeing, to develop CFTs for its F/A-18E/Fs, but has not said whether those upgrades would extend to the Growler fleet. The added fuel will give Super Hornets an average of 100 to 120 miles of additional range depending on their stores loadout. There have also been long-standing discussions about an engine upgrade for the Super Hornets, which might also filter down to the Growlers. This could improve overall fuel efficiency and increase range. The Navy has not yet formally decided to pursue this update for either the F/A-18E/F or EA-18G, though. A graphic showing the comparable ranges of Super Hornets with and with conformal fuel tanks., Boeing The EA-18Gs have been in desperate need of new, more capable jamming pods for some time now, with the ALQ-99s having had noted reliability issues for years already. At the same time, electronic warfare capabilities will only become more vital to the Navy’s Carrier Air Wings and their ability to operate in high-risk environments as time goes on. The mix of higher- and lower-band electronic warfare capabilities will remain important even with the Navy’s introduction of the stealthy F-35C Joint Strike Fighter. The low-band pod, especially, will also be ideally suited to jamming longer-range, lower-frequency radars, which may be able to detect stealth aircraft. But for Growlers carrying the new pods to be most effective, the Navy will also have to find ways to ensure the aircraft can make it to the target area and stay there long enough and in sufficient numbers to adequately perform their mission.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In an official video released over the weekend, China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force appears to show H-6 strategic bombers taking part in a simulated attack on the U.S. Air Force’s Andersen Air Force Base on Guam — but all may not be quite as it seems. Entitled The God of War H-6K Goes on the Attack!, the video has also been tailored to showcase the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s (PLAAF) latest strategic bomber/missile-carrier. Derived from the Cold War-era Soviet-designed Tu-16 Badger , the H-6 is today used by both the PLAAF and the People’s Liberation Army Navy Air Force (PLANAF). Nicknamed God of War in Chinese service, the H-6K is a dedicated strategic missile-carrier that was first identified in the West in prototype form in late 2006. Essentially a completely redesigned H-6, it can be identified by its airliner-style forward fuselage, with the original glazed nose replaced by a huge radome. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fj1wCjIitIU Powered by two Russian-made Aviadvigatel D-30KP-2 turbofans, as used in the Il-76MD Candid airlifter , the H-6K has extended range, higher cruising speed, and an increased weapons load compared with its predecessors. An H-6K takes off from a desert runway at the beginning of the video., PLAAF SCREENCAP The roughly two-minute video, posted by the PLAAF to the Chinese microblogging site Weibo on September 19, 2020, begins with scenes of a desert air base — reportedly Lanzhou in northwest China’s Gansu province — with white-painted H-6Ks under camouflage tarpaulins and being prepared by groundcrew. The bombers are fitted with six underwing weapons pylons, but at the start of the video, these don’t have weapons fitted. At one point a large missile is seen being maneuvered on the ground by weapons technicians, but it is hard to identify exactly what type. The H-6K variant introduced new armament in the shape of KD-20 long-range cruise missiles , six of which can be carried externally. As well as the new-generation KD-20, the H-6K can also be armed with the older KD-63 cruise missile as well as YJ-12 anti-ship missiles . After the twin-engine H-6s are seen taxiing and taking off. We then switch to an in-cockpit sequence, although the six color multifunction cockpit displays introduced on the flight deck of the H-6K variant are not shown. This is immediately followed by a computer-generated missile launch seen from the pilots’ perspective, with a missile streaking towards an air base on an island’s coast, and footage of airstrikes that is made to look like it’s been harvested from targeting pod and missile seeker imagery. A missile streaks towards its target on a Pacific island., PLAAF SCREENCAP Following an enormous explosion, there’s more footage of airborne H-6Ks, this time clearly loaded with KD-20 long-range land-attack cruise missiles, and escorted by armed J-11 fighters . Based on comparison with previously released stills imagery, this sequence at least seems to be several years old. We then see a bomber landing at the desert airfield and the video ends with scenes of the flight line and jubilant aircrew. The missile warhead detonates., PLAAF SCREENCAP Perhaps the key part of the video, however, is the scene showing an aerial view of the “target” that has been identified by Reuters as Andersen AFB, a strategic U.S. military outpost in the Asia-Pacific region. The South China Morning Post , meanwhile, is a little more circumspect, describing the Pacific island airfield as having “more than a passing resemblance to the US facility on the island of Guam.” The reality is that the overhead satellite-like images are indeed of Guam, there is no ambiguity. The satellite image in the PLAAF video that appears to show Andersen Air Force Base., PLAAF SCREENCAP Andersen Air Force Base as seen in Google Earth imagery, dated January 2018., GOOGLE EARTH Andersen AFB’s strategic importance to the U.S. is reflected in the fact that a continuous presence of American bombers existed at the base for 16 years until April 2020 , and U.S. Air Force bombers continue to use the facility for temporary deployments . Its military value would put it among the prime targets for the PLA during any kind of shooting war with the United States. As well as manned bombers, China has an expanding force of ballistic missiles that could threaten the U.S. facilities on Guam — as well as other regional bases — in a conflict. The island has been directly threatened in the past by North Korea’s Kin Jong-un and has apparently experienced repeated incursions by mysterious unmanned aircraft . An aerial view of Andersen AFB, which dominates the northwestern end of Guam., GOOGLE EARTH While the rhetoric behind the PLAAF video seems clear enough — Beijing’s air arm is able to hold targets on Guam to risk at a time and place of its own choosing — the production of the footage isn’t original. Keen observers on Twitter identified certain scenes in the PLAAF film that had been ‘recycled’ from Hollywood blockbusters, including clips from The Hurt Locker and The Rock . Meanwhile, the sequence showing Andersen AFB under attack was apparently lifted from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen . The release of the video comes at a time of heightened tensions in the region . Its appearance coincided with People’s Liberation Army maneuvers carried out near Taiwan, and Chinese anger at the visit to Taipei by Keith Krach, an economic representative from the U.S. government. Krach was described by the New York Times as “the highest-level official from the State Department to visit the island in decades.” Moreover, under the Trump Administration, the United States has shifted its policy toward Taiwan , while relations with China have deteriorated. While China’s unusual approach to creating Hollywood-style propaganda may look odd to Western observers, this latest video’s real talking point lies in its more-or-less explicit use of a key American base as the fantasy target of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 25, 2020",Secretive Seawolf Submarine Makes Port Call In Europe For The Second Time In Two Months,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s first-in-class submarine USS Seawolf has appeared sailing on the surface in Scotland heading toward the major U.K. Royal Navy base in Faslane. This comes nearly a month after the service made the unusually public disclosure that this secretive boat, which is known to take part in sensitive intelligence missions , among other activities, had visited Tromsø, Norway . Iain Cameron , a ship and plane spotter in Scotland, grabbed shots of Seawolf heading toward Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde (HMNB Clyde) on Sept. 21, 2020. HMNB Clyde is home to the bulk of the Royal Navy’s submarine force, including its Vanguard class ballistic missile submarines and Astute class attack submarines. At one point a pilot launch boat is visible alongside the submarine, either helping guide it upstream toward the base or otherwise coordinating with members of its crew who are seen standing the hull aft of the sail. As a whole, the U.S. Navy is generally very tight-lipped about the activities of its submarine force, also known as the Silent Service. It typically offers even fewer details about the trio of Seawolf class boats, which are understood to have significant additional modifications to carry out intelligence gathering and other specialized mission sets. All of the nuclear-powered Seawolfs are homeported at Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State and it is unusual to see them anywhere else. Able to stay submerged for months at a time , there is a little need for them to make themselves visible, and by extension vulnerable to detection and monitoring, or worse in the cause of active conflict, by sailing on the surface or even making visits to non-U.S.-controlled bases at home or aboard. So, it’s certainly notable that Seawolf has now made visible appearances overseas twice in the space of two months. The Navy had previously made the unusually public announcement that this submarine had visited Tromsø in Norway on Aug. 21, before releasing equally uncommon photographs of the boat there conducting what was referred to only as “a brief stop for personnel.” At that time, the service also said that the submarine was attached to Task Force 69, the U.S. 6th Fleet’s standing undersea warfare task force. U.S. 6th Fleet is in charge of overseeing all Navy activities in and around Europe and Africa. Before Seawolf ‘s visit to Norway, the last time the Navy appears to have released any pictures of submarine of this class making a stop in a foreign country was when USS Connecticut visited U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka, an American base in Japan, in August 2018. It remains to be seen whether there will be any official announcement or official images about the submarine’s visit to the United Kingdom and what it is doing there. It is worth noting that other American submarines do regularly visit U.K. naval bases, including on the island of Gibraltar . HMNB Clyde is a particularly common port of call because its ability to handle the demands of nuclear-powered submarines. USS Connecticut at U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka in Japan in August 2018., USN The Navy originally bought the Seawolfs as advanced hunter-killers and had plans to acquire a full fleet of 29 boats. Rising costs coupled with the end of the Cold War led to the service to buy only the three examples, USS Seawolf , USS Connecticut , and USS Jimmy Carter . The last of those boats, Jimmy Carter , features a unique 100-foot-long addition to its hull known as the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), which you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . It is widely understood that the MMP, together with other modifications, enables this submarine to perform various covert and clandestine espionage missions, including inspecting, manipulating, and even collecting objects of interest from deep on the ocean floor. These nuclear-powered submarines are also well known for being able to cruise very quietly for extended periods of time, including under the thick ice in the Arctic . This, in turn, has made them particularly well suited to keeping an eye on foreign naval movements in that region, which has historically been a prime place for various countries to keep submarines hidden from prying eyes. The U.S. Navy’s newer Virginia class boats are simply not as well suited for sailing in this frigid waters. Seawolf ‘s relatively visible deployment to the northern European region certainly comes amid a period of increased friction between the United States and Russia. The submarine’s stop in Norway already appeared to be a signal to the Kremlin and shortly afterward Norwegian authorities announced that they were expanding naval facilities in and around Tromsø to better support visits from American and other allied submarines. Right now, submarines have to anchor in nearby fjords and have small boats take personnel and other items to and from them, limiting the kind of resupplying and other support that can be offered. USS Seawolf in a fjord near Tromsø in August 2020., USN “The U.S. and Norway have a great relationship, and our ability to use facilities in and around Tromso would provide a strategic location for our visits,” a U.S. defense official told Breaking Defense about the planned expansion. “It would give us flexibility for not only the U.S. but allied countries to exercise in the High North.” The Arctic is increasingly a site of geopolitical competition, especially between the United States and Russia, and Russian authorities have been dramatically expanding their military presence, including naval and air operations, across a constellation of bases there in recent years. You can read more about those developments in this previous War Zone piece . At the same time, monitoring such activities at high latitudes can be especially challenging, especially given the limited ability of spy satellites to observe the region and similar impediments to satellite communications and data sharing. “We have significant domain awareness challenges, and that really begins in the high latitudes,” retired Admiral Paul Zukunft, former Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, said during the 2020 Defense News Conference earlier in September. “Things start to get pretty dark once you get up higher than 72 degrees north.” “We sent a national security cutter to patrol that region in a relatively ice-free portion of the season,” he continued. “And we stumbled upon a joint exercise between Russia and China. Our intelligence community did not have awareness that this was going on. So we were the originators of this information and otherwise we would not have known. We need to continue to invest in domain awareness.” A map the Pentagon released in 2020 showing areas with high volumes of Russian, as well as Chinese, naval activity., DOD Beyond providing that kind of capability in the Arctic, Seawolf could also help the Navy keep an eye on foreign naval activity in northern European waters. Russian submarines leaving their bases in the northwestern corner of the country typically travel past Norway and the northern United Kingdom, toward an area known as the Greenland, Iceland, and United Kingdom (GIUK) gap , on the way into the north Atlantic. They return home the same way. The U.S. military has repeatedly highlighted concerns about a notable uptick in Russian Navy submarine operations in the Atlantic in recent years, which you can read more about in this past War Zone story . Seawolf ‘s latest European appearance also comes amid a succession of tit-for-tat posturing between the U.S. and Russian militaries in Europe, especially in the air , as well as elsewhere around the world, including in northeastern Syria. The U.S. Army recently redeployed Bradley Fighting Vehicles to that country in what observers have seen as a message to Russian forces in the region, who have been involved increasingly serious altercations on the ground with American troops. The service had previously sent Bradleys to Syria in October 2019, before quietly and unceremoniously withdrawing them less than two months later, which The War Zone was first to report . Whatever the purpose of Seawolf ‘s visit to HMNB Clyde may be, the U.S. Navy is clearly not hiding that this advanced submarine is there and, by extension, still prowling around in the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 28, 2018",How The CIA’s Adrift Maritime Branch Lost Four Men On A Doomed Spy Mission Against China,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Talk about a story with everything and a tragic one at that. A feature published by Yahoo News recounts the tragic story of four CIA operators that were sent into the nexus of the Philippine and South China Seas to place a camouflaged electronic intelligence gathering device used for monitoring suspicious Chinese military traffic. This was 12 years ago, before China’s manmade islands and militarization of the region emerged to become a foreign policy powder keg. It was also a time when the CIA’s Maritime Branch was adrift, struggling for validity. In the end, four men sailed directly into a hurricane in an attempt to accomplish the espionage mission and were never heard from again. Here is just a taste of the story: Stanek and Perich planned to dive on the island using commercial scuba gear that would be deniable in the event they were captured, whether by the Chinese or anyone else. There were to be no U.S. government fingerprints on any of their activities. Deployed from the small ship, the two divers would emplace a “pod” disguised as a rock and stuffed with classified technology just beneath the surface of the waves. It would then passively monitor electronic signals of Chinese naval ships. Once they returned to their ship, the crew would head for Japan, where they would cool their heels for a few weeks before returning and retrieving the device. Stanek would have closely examined the onboard weather radar system in those final moments before making his decision. According to his Navy service records as well as friends and teammates, Stanek was a patriot and a mentor, the kind of sailor admired by his peers for his hard work and can-do attitude. But he was also under pressure to make it work. The mission wasn’t just about placing a device on one island, it was a proof of concept that would demonstrate the continued relevance of the CIA’s Maritime Branch. The mission came as Maritime Branch was struggling to prove its reason for existence. Several U.S. Navy programs also made use of “covered” maritime assets, meaning ships that hid behind commercial cover. The CIA’s Maritime Branch was essentially in competition with the Navy, and this mission would help prove its worth. It’s impossible to know how much that played into Stanek’s decision, but gambling that the storm would change course as meteorologists predicted, he decided to go forward with the covert operation. … Maritime Branch is one of the CIA’s paramilitary components. Nestled within the agency’s organizational structure is the Special Activities Division, today known as the Special Activities Center, which includes Special Operations Group (SOG), which conducts paramilitary operations, and Covert Influence Group (CIG), which specializes in disinformation and propaganda operations. SOG has three paramilitary branches. Air Branch covertly maintains fleets of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft all over the world, including the CIA-operated, Russian-made helicopters that ran logistics and delivered troops in Afghanistan during and after the 2001 invasion. Ground Branch functions as the CIA’s version of Special Forces but operates under the agency’s covert action authorities; it often works in tandem with operations officers (the agency’s spies) and, at times, the U.S. military. Once filled with former Marines, today Ground Branch is home to many former Delta Force operators. Maritime Branch covertly operates sea vessels in South America, West Africa and a few other locations. They can be used to extract CIA officers or their assets if called upon. “Maritime Branch was trying to become relevant again in SOG and SAD,” a former CIA officer said, “because mostly it was just a place for former SEALs to hang out with between Ground Branch tours.” The piece offers a unique look into a real-world CIA operation that has all the trappings of a Hollywood movie—in fact, a very similar camouflaged signals intelligence pod was just featured on the final season of Showtime’s Homeland. But this would be a disaster movie, not triumphant espionage yarn. In the end, four of the stars of the CIA’s sacred Memorial Star Wall belong to these men.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 23, 2020",Mysterious Russian Mi-171Sh Hip Assault Helicopters Are Bound For China,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army is set to receive a new batch of Russian-made Mi-171Sh Hip combat transport helicopters, but their precise operator — and function — remains unknown. Photos of one or more gray-painted Mi-171Sh helicopters in People’s Liberation Army (PLA) markings began to appear on social media earlier this week. The images were taken from a Chinese TV news report showing a visit to the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant in the Russian Far East. The low-visibility markings and ‘tactical’ light gray color scheme suggest a new batch of helicopters might have been acquired to fulfill some kind of role in support of PLA special operations forces or combat search and rescue (CSAR). PLA Army Aviation rotorcraft are otherwise normally painted very dark green overall or in a green and tan disruptive pattern. Enigmatic Hips The light gray colors are actually more reminiscent of the PLA Navy’s chopper fleet, but there’s no sign of maritime modifications for this Mi-171Sh, despite speculation that the helicopters are destined for the PLA Navy Marine Corps . So far, the global Hip fleet has seen only very limited naval service and it’s previously been anticipated that the Type 071 amphibious transport dock and the new Type 075 landing helicopter dock will both be equipped with Chinese-made helicopter types. A still from the news report apparently showing two PLA Mi-171Sh airframes at Ulan-Ude., CHINA STATE TV SCREENCAP The Chinese Military Aviation blog recently noted a rumor suggesting that PLA Army Aviation might have ordered a new batch of Mi-171Sh aircraft together with a “complete” self-protection package including an electro-optical turret, armor, and countermeasures launchers. Chinese military aerospace observer Andreas Rupprecht is likewise skeptical that the Chinese Mi-171Sh helicopters are destined for Marine Corps service. The development is unexpected, Rupprecht contends, since the availability of China’s own Z-8G/L and Z-20 suggests there is no need for additional Mi-17/171s. He points to the combat capability of the Mi-171Sh suggesting they are intended to equip some kind of “special unit.” It could be that the new helicopters have been procured with the current border tensions with India in the Himalayas in mind. Here, Beijing and New Delhi are at loggerheads over a 2,100-mile border, known as the Line of Actual Control , and a clash with Chinese troops in June 2020 left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead . This is truly demanding terrain for helicopters, and the Mi-171Sh might offer a high-altitude capability currently lacking from the PLA’s indigenous rotorcraft. If the new helicopters are going to support some kind of special operations forces or fly CSAR duties, the Mi-171Sh may have been the most obvious choice, since these critical missions demand the most capable and mature airframe available. It could be that the PLA leadership considers that Russian equipment is still superior for this kind of work, at least in some respects, compared with the latest indigenous designs. An advanced five-screen glass cockpit in one of the Hips at the Ulan-Ude plant., CHINA STATE TV SCREENCAP The Mi-171Sh variant of the venerable Soviet-designed helicopter was not previously in PLA service. In Russian military use, the aircraft is designated as the Mi-8AMTSh . This, in turn, is broadly similar to the Mi-8MTV-5 that’s built by Kazan Helicopters in western Russia. These models share a rear ramp (rather than the previous clamshell-style loading doors), cabin with seating for up to 36 troops and sliding doors on each side, and a streamlined nose accommodating a weather radar in place of the old rounded, glazed nose. A view of the rear of the Mi-171Sh reveals the subdued PLA markings and countermeasures dispenser., CHINA STATE TV SCREENCAP Chinese Hips Today, the Mi-17 family is the PLA’s most important tactical transport helicopter, having entered service back in 1991, initially as a replacement for planned orders of Sikorsky S-70s that were scuppered following the U.S. arms embargo following the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The first of the Hips received by the PLA were Mi-8s, all since retired, but these have been followed by numerous sub-variants, now numbering around 340 examples in total. The Mi-17 and Mi-171 designations refer to export-specific versions of the Hip , which are otherwise known as Mi-8s in Russian military service. An early-model Mi-8 stored at Harbin after retirement by China Northern Airlines., AEROPRINTS.COM/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS In his authoritative work on PLA Army Aviation , Andreas Rupprecht provides a useful breakdown of the country’s military/paramilitary Hip orders, from 1991 onwards: 1991 Mi-17V-1 24 1996-1997 Mi-17V-5 60 1999-2000 Mi-171 15 2002-2003 Mi-17V-5 35 2003-2004 Mi-17V-7 25 2007-2009 Mi-171E 57 2006-2007 Mi-171E 24 2010-2011 Mi-171E 32 2012-2014 Mi-171E 52 In terms of equipment fit, the PLA’s Mi-17V-1 and Mi-171 aircraft were typically upgraded after delivery, receiving identification friend or foe (IFF) equipment, ASO-2V chaff/flare dispensers, and external pylons for fuel tanks, 12.7mm machine gun pods, unguided rocket pods, freefall bombs, and even TY-90 air-to-air missiles . Other kit that has been added to the fleet includes a searchlight, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) turret, satellite communications (SATCOM) antenna, and a locally made infrared jammer. Some aircraft have also appeared with a missile approach warning system and radar warning receiver sensors on the nose and tail boom. A rare, if poor-quality, shot of a PLA Mi-17 armed with TY-90 air-to-air missiles., VIA CHINESE INTERNET The Hip family has proven to be a popular choice for the PLA Army Aviation, and it has undertaken a wide range of roles, including transport of cargo/personnel, air assault, close air support, minelaying, airborne command post, medical evacuation, and search and rescue. Specialist roles have also yielded PLA-specific versions, including communications jamming , and battlefield surveillance. In the latter form, the Mi-171 is fitted with a retractable radar antenna. The Kazan-built Mi-17V-5 and V-7 that were supplied to China between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s differ chiefly from their predecessors in being powered by uprated Klimov TV3-117VM engines each rated at 2,000 shaft horsepower. They were also the first for the PLA with the reap ramp and streamlined nose, the latter leading to the local nickname “Hippo.” Interestingly, it’s alleged that these helicopters were imported from Russia on behalf of China United Airlines, but were then immediately transferred to the military. Like the previous versions, some of the PLA’s Mi-17V-5s and V-7s have been outfitted with external pylons, while some Mi-17V-5 are compatible with the KD-9 anti-tank guided missile . Other Mi-17V-7s are configured for search and rescue with an additional FLIR turret, searchlight, SATCOM antenna, and rescue hoist. Until the appearance of the latest Mi-171Sh aircraft at the Ulan-Ude factory, the latest version to join the PLA ranks was the Mi-171E from the same manufacturer. This seems to have been acquired chiefly for operations in mountainous terrain. These helicopters boast an advanced cockpit with a digital moving map display and some also carry SATCOM and/or a 12.7mm caliber machine gun firing through the side door. The PLA’s enduring relationship with the Hip looks set to continue, although previous suggestions of a deal for local assembly of Ulan-Ude-supplied airframes have never materialized. Local rivals It seems that plans to assemble the Hip in China may have been abandoned in favor of pursuing indigenous designs, including improved versions of the Z-8 and the Z-20 , the latter bearing a close resemblance to the U.S. Black Hawk family. One of the first Z-20 helicopters for the PLA., VIA CHINESE INTERNET With local helicopter programs making rapid progress , the appearance of these new Chinese combat rotorcraft at their Russian production facility is something of a surprise. However, the fact that the Hip series has fulfilled so many different roles within the PLA — and has been successively upgraded with local enhancements — means it’s hard to predict how and where the new Mi-171Sh will eventually be fielded.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the successful destruction of a cruise missile by a Hyper Velocity Projectile in a land-based test, the case for the U.S. Navy’s stealthy Zumwalt -class destroyers adopting the fast-flying ammunition has strengthened. These warships are arguably the Navy’s most advanced and survivable, but also its most controversial — you can read more about them here — but their main guns, which take up the entire forward third of the 16,000-ton displacement vessels, lie dormant . During the recent trial, an Advanced Gun System (AGS) mounted on an M110 8-inch self-propelled Howitzer fired a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) that downed a cruise missile target over the White Sands Missile Range. It was part of the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) test that ran from August 31 to September 4, 2020. You can read more about this major multi-faceted series of trials in this past piece of ours. Although the HVP was originally designed to be fired from an electromagnetic rail gun , propelling it to speeds of over Mach 7 and to a maximum range of over 100 nautical miles, it has also been adapted to work with existing naval guns that use traditional chemical propellant, including the Mk 45 deck guns found on existing U.S. Navy Ticonderoga -class cruisers and Arleigh Burke -class destroyers, and 155-millimeter tube artillery. As the test proved, the HVP can also be fired from a modified version of BAE Systems’ Mk 51 Advanced Gun System (AGS) that arm the Zumwalt -class destroyer. These guns are currently dead weight, with no suitable projectile fielded. At present, a pair of 30mm cannons are the Zumwalt ’s only usable guns. The Hypervelocity Projectile shot from an Advanced gun System (AGS) tube mounted on a M110 8-inch howitzer chassis during the Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Onramp 2 at White Sands Missile Range pic.twitter.com/xYuE6MaPvb — 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) September 17, 2020 The most recent land-based ABMS test — termed an “on ramp” by the Air Force — was intended to demonstrate how the system can “detect and defeat efforts to disrupt U.S. operations in space in addition to countering attacks against the U.S. homeland, including shooting down a cruise missile “surrogate” with a hypervelocity weapon,” the service explained. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wy38zaDU_ZM https://youtube.com/watch?v=o0LrICKwDfY As the test showed, at least indirectly, combining the HVP-armed AGS with the three Zumwalt -class hulls could add a significant new air defense capability to the already advanced warships. In particular, the new projectile could give the destroyers an effective and relatively low-cost counter to anti-ship cruise missiles or unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as conventional manned aircraft. USS Zunwalt with one of her AGS guns pointed into the air. , USN “If you think about the kinds of threats you might face in the Middle East, the lower-end cruise missiles or a larger UAV, now you have a way to shoot them down that doesn’t require you use a $2-million ESSM or $1-million RAM because a Hyper Velocity Projectile — even in the highest-end estimates have it in the $75,000 to $100,000 range, and that’s for the fanciest version of it with an onboard seeker,” Bryan Clark, from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments told USNI News last year . The three types of HVP rounds. , Joseph Trevithick The Zumwalt -class warships’ 155-millimeter/62-caliber AGS was originally expected to fire the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP). When the costs of the munition escalated to $800,000 for a single round, the Navy ditched it on fiscal grounds and began to look at other options, including the Raytheon Excalibur 1b and BAE Systems Multi-Service Standard Guided Projectile (MS-SGP). Another BAE Systems product, the HVP, had been discussed as at least partial replacement for LRLAP, but it now appears to be a more tangible candidate for finally making the Zumwalt- class’s deck guns relevant again. The types of missions the HVP will be able to undertake will depend on the gun system and platform, but currently, they include “naval surface fire, cruise and ballistic missile defense, anti-surface warfare and other future naval mission areas” according to BAE Systems. As such, the weapon could give the AGS a dual-role capability, tackling surface and land targets as well as airborne threats. USN Firing the HVP from the AGS on the Zumwalt class would also provide greater range than from the far more common 5-inch Mk 45 guns. Those guns can supposedly reach out to a maximum of between 40 and 50 miles with the HVP round. According to available documentation, the HVP could be able to reach out to as far as 70 miles when fired from the AGS. This is approaching the range of the original LRAP rounds that proved too costly to procure for just the three Zumwalt class destroyers. Even if it turns out the range of the HVP and AGS combo is less, its anti-air capabilities offer more flexibility than the now-defunct LRLAP rounds ever did. BAE Systems As originally schemed, the Zumwalts were expected to provide long-range fire from littoral positions to support troops storming enemy beaches and fighting inland, but the ethos of the stealthy destroyers has since changed to focus to blue-water operations. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the three destroyers were designed around two AGS installations each, and the Navy needs to find a way of making use of them — unless it decides to remove them altogether . While the AGS aboard the Zumwalts has not yet fired the HVP, the projectile has been tested at sea previously . During the RIMPAC 2018 multinational exercise, the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Dewey (DDG 105) fired 20 HVPs from its standard Mk 45 mounting. Another phase of at-sea testing might well involve one or more of the three Zumwalts , especially since the Navy decided to assign them to Surface Development Squadron 1, or SURFDEVRON, a dedicated experimental unit that is tasked with investigating a broad range of cutting-edge technologies. It is a concept you can read more about here . There is also an initiative underway that will examine equipping the Zumwalt class with another type of hypersonic weapon — the new Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic missile , providing a fast-response standoff attack capability against enemy ships and targets on land. These plans would involve the removal of the warships’ Mk 51 AGS installations, so a decision may have to be made over which of these high-speed weapons to prioritize. A land-based test of the AGS prior to installation aboard USS Zumwalt . , USN The Zumwalts will also likely receive the SM-6 missile, which is primarily an anti-air weapon, but it has secondary anti-ship and land-attack capabilities that are growing more prominent. These missiles, when used to attack targets on the surface of the Earth, would act as quasi-ballistics missiles and would have terminal velocities approaching hypersonic. They can also be housed in the Zumwalts ‘ existing Mk57 vertical launch system cells. You can read more about this promising and hugely versatile weapon here and here , but it combined with an HVP-capable AGS would give these ships a relatively wide array of highly-flexible additional strike and air defense capabilities. What we don’t know is what modifications would be needed to the Zumwalt class destroyers’ guns and their complex ammunition handling systems to make the HVP round work in an acceptable manner. Still, remodeling the guns and their below-deck infrastructure to work with the HVP may be a far more attractive and less costly option than ripping them out in full and replacing them with something totally different. We are still some way off seeing the full potential of the HVP, but it clearly shows considerable promise for lower-cost air defense both on land and at sea, as well as its other strike-related abilities. If the Zumwalt- class’s already installed AGS can be adapted to accept it, it would address the embarrassing issue of a $23-billion program that has yielded three gun-armed warships with no ammunition to fire from them.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 15, 2021",Storm Clouds Gather Over F-35B Lightning As United Kingdom Prepares Defense Review,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the United Kingdom prepares its next defense review — the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy — experts close to the program are increasingly talking about a significant cut in the country’s orders for F-35B Lightning jet fighters. Reports in the British media last month suggested that the United Kingdom may only buy 70 F-35Bs, rather than the 138 aircraft originally planned. Although a reduction in numbers had been long rumored, the story in The Times cited sources close to the government’s defense review — details of which are planned for release later this year. Meanwhile, the UK Ministry of Defence has steadfastly held to the 138-aircraft figure in its communications. Yesterday, September 15, 2020, a group of experts provided the Defence Committee with an update on the progress made by the UK’s F-35 and Carrier Strike programs, with an eye on how they could impact the ongoing Integrated Review. To date, the United Kingdom has committed to buying 48 Lightnings by the end of 2025, at a cost of £10.5 billion, according to the National Audit Office , the body that scrutinizes public spending. The target of 138 aircraft purchased across the lifespan of the program was included in the UK government’s last Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in 2015. However, the Commons Defence Select Committee later admitted that the figure of 138 was taken “following some hesitation.” The UK is purchasing the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, which is operated by mixed-personnel Royal Air Force and Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm squadrons. The F-35B variant was selected to operate from the Royal Navy’s two new Queen Elizabeth -class aircraft carriers, although exactly how many jets will regularly deploy onboard is unclear. One of four No 617 Squadron F-35Bs on HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first Carrier Sea Training by an operational UK squadron in June 2020. , CROWN COPYRIGHT The F-35B “numbers game” While the Queen Elizabeth -class carriers are designed to operate a maximum of 36 F-35Bs (equivalent to three squadrons), officials have said that 24 Lightnings are a “credible complement” for the Carrier Strike role. The 2015 SDSR included plans to have 24 F-35Bs available on the carriers by 2023. To date, 18 aircraft have been handed over to the United Kingdom, of which 15 are based at RAF Marham, Norfolk. The remaining jets are used for test and evaluation work at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The figure of 70 F-35Bs has been suggested as a “credible minimum,” reflecting concerns about the costs of the program as the government looks at its future plans across foreign policy, defense and security ahead of the integrated review that’s scheduled to be completed in November. Speaking to the Defence Committee yesterday, Nick Childs, Senior Fellow for Naval Forces and Maritime Security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said he considered a number “significantly higher” than 48 F-35Bs would be required to meet the ambition of 24 jets available for Carrier Strike. Taking into account training and other demands, a figure of 60-70 jets would be reasonable, Childs contended. Meanwhile, Capt Royal Navy (Rtd) Dan Stembridge, Deputy Chair, Air Power Group at the Royal Aeronautical Society, said the F-35B fleet needed “in the order of 70-80” aircraft, but that this total would also depend on the speed at which they were bought. Buying aircraft too slowly means the initial examples show signs of wear and tear first, and then require replacement themselves. Capt Stembridge added that he considered four squadrons of 12 aircraft each to be the requirement for continuous high readiness, able to put 24 on a carrier, with the option to “surge” to 36. Justin Bronk, Research Fellow in Combat Airpower and Technology at the Royal United Services Institute, had a slightly more pessimistic take on these calculations. He pointed out that the RAF Typhoon fleet of 145 provides a “force element at readiness” of around 40 jets only. This can be increased to “70-80 at a push” with the risk of “breaking the whole system.” Bronk said he thought at least 60 F-35Bs would be required to provide a surge capacity of 18-24 jets on the carrier, but the total would likely have to increase to 70 aircraft in the longer term, based on the need for attrition replacements. Furthermore, Bronk warned, the fleet would have to be increased “significantly beyond 70” if the F-35B was also required to conduct missions over and above Carrier Strike. This is another point that it is hoped the Integrated Review will clarify. While the F-35B numbers game has focused on the demands of Carrier Strike, the wider Armed Forces enterprise is hoping the stealth fighter can fulfill other high-end warfighting roles too, including penetrating defended airspace from land bases. F-35Bs from the Royal Air Force (top) and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) over the east coast during the first visit by the type to England in July 2016., CROWN COPYRIGHT Lightning versus Tempest A decision on the future size of the overall British Lightning fleet comes at a time when increasing focus is being directed towards the next-generation Tempest fighter program, which is being led by the UK with the aim of fielding a Typhoon replacement from around 2035. The Tempest project was formally launched under the country’s new Combat Air Strategy at the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2018. It’s being pursued as part of the wider Future Combat Air System Technology Initiative (FCAS TI), which aims to bring together the Ministry of Defence and industry partners to deliver more than £2 billion of technology investment by 2027. Bronk said he thought the 138-aircraft target was an “aspiration unlikely to be funded,” and argued that the United Kingdom needs to decide whether or not more than 100 F-35Bs are required to meet all requirements. If yes, Bronk contended, then serious cuts would have to be made elsewhere. If the decision favors the Tempest — as a replacement for the current Typhoon and a means to stimulate the defense industry — then equivalent cuts would need to be made. Above all, UK defense planners will have to make a choice between prioritizing the F-35B or the Tempest. Pictured top to bottom: HMS Northumberland , HMS Dragon , and HMS Queen Elizabeth (with a single F-35B on deck) during Exercise Westlant 19., CROWN COPYRIGHT On the industry side, Team Tempest brings together British companies including BAE Systems (responsible for advanced combat air systems and integration), Leonardo (sensors, electronics, and avionics), MBDA (weapon systems), and Rolls-Royce (power and propulsion systems), under the leadership of the RAF Rapid Capabilities Office. Of course, the United Kingdom’s defense industry sector has a stake in the Joint Strike Fighter program too, but, Bronk argued yesterday, the country’s Tier 1 status ̦— the result of a £2-billion buy-in — is “no longer really a factor,” since it covered the research and development and initial production phases. On the other hand, buying 48-60 Lightnings would knock the United Kingdom down from being the second-largest export customer to “somewhere pretty far down,” among the ranks of small to medium air forces. “There would be consequences,” with such a move, Bronk noted. These could perhaps affect future Lockheed Martin production decisions, affecting UK industry and jobs. While the Tempest will be a manned fighter it will operate as a “system of systems” alongside unmanned loyal wingman-type drones, as The War Zone discussed here . Exactly how the launch of the Tempest might affect the United Kingdom’s F-35 program has long been unclear, officials only reiterating that the country still planned to buy 138 Lightnings over the life of the program. But the latest developments suggest this may now have changed and the emphasis is now being put on Tempest — an all-new fighter that offers complete national control. One Ministry of Defence official told the author: “The work on deciding the timelines and numbers of F-35 to be purchased after [the initial 48 aircraft] will be considered as part of the wider Combat Air Strategy to ensure that the UK has the optimum mix of combat aircraft.” Another likely factor in determining eventual F-35B numbers is the plan to upgrade a significant proportion of the RAF’s existing Typhoon fleet, including advanced radar. The United Kingdom recently made it clear that it wants to integrate a unique active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar on its Typhoons, as The War Zone discussed in detail here. Last month The Times quoted an unnamed defense source who confirmed that no final decisions in the review have been taken. “The guiding principle of the [Integrated Review] is to ask ourselves what the threat is, and whether we have the capability to meet it,” the source explained. If consideration is being given to a reduced fleet of F-35Bs, it may finally lay to rest the idea of a split buy of STOVL variants and conventional take-off and landing F-35A models. There are long-standing rumors that this is the long-term option preferred by the RAF, although it would reduce the number of jets that could deploy onboard the aircraft carriers, which are equipped with a ski jump to help launch the F-35Bs , that then recover via vertical landing or a short rolling landing . With a force of just 70 Lightnings, the case for a split buy would likely become redundant. In the past, an argument was made for purchasing land-based F-35As after the initial 48 carrier-capable F-35Bs. The F-35A is cheaper to purchase and operate, offers a longer range, greater agility, and increased payload (including 2,000-pound-class weapons), as well as a much larger international user base. However, for these advantages to pay off, it would require F-35As to be purchased in significant numbers, which currently seems an almost impossible prospect. A pair of No 617 Squadron F-35Bs on the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth ., CROWN COPYRIGHT A report from the National Audit Office in June entitled Carrier Strike – Preparing for deployment pointed out the potential pitfalls in the United Kingdom’s aim to reinstate its Carrier Strike capability. It pointed to the lack of funding for enough Lightning jets to sustain Carrier Strike operations over its lifespan into the 2060s. It also noted that the UK will receive seven of its confirmed 48 F-35Bs in 2025, a year later than planned, “in response to wider financial pressures.” According to National Audit Office figures, the cost of the UK’s Lightning program has risen by 15% since 2017, from £9.1 billion to the current £10.5 billion. This increase was attributed to “capability upgrades, integration of UK weapons and sustainment costs.” The report stated that costs will continue to grow as the fleet is upgraded with new software and weapons . The United Kingdom joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a formal partner in 1995, initially with a view to replacing the Royal Navy’s Sea Harrier on the Invincible-class carriers. The UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and agreed to pay $200 million, amounting to 10% of the concept demonstration phase. Another MoU followed in 2001, committing the UK to invest $2 billion towards development costs as a Tier One partner status during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase. A year later, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that the Royal Navy and RAF would operate the F-35B variant, with a tentative plan to acquire 150 aircraft. UK Lightning’s path to service The first F-35B operations aboard the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth were recorded in September 2018, involving instrumented test jets belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps, and you can read more about this operation here . The F-35B achieved initial operational capability in January 2019 and in June that year the U.K. Ministry of Defense announced that RAF F-35Bs had begun been flying combat patrols over Iraq and Syria, flying from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea. The United Kingdom became the third country to deploy its F-35s for combat , after Israel and the United States. In October 2019 the first British jets operated from the carrier, during the Operational Testing (OT-1) campaign off the US east coast. These tests included mission planning, arming the aircraft with inert Paveway laser-guided bombs, and ASRAAM missiles using the ship’s Highly Automated Weapon Handling System, flying missions, and debriefing. An F-35B on HMS Queen Elizabeth during night-time operational testing off the coast of the United States in November 2019., CROWN COPYRIGHT Operations by British Lightnings in home waters commenced in January 2020, when jets from the Marham-based No 207 Squadron, the operational conversion unit, went to sea on board HMS Queen Elizabeth under Exercise Lightning Fury. This involved carrier qualifications for six Royal Navy and RAF pilots. The Ministry of Defence plans to declare initial Carrier Strike capability in December 2020, followed by full operating capability in December 2023. The next major milestone for the UK Lightning Force and HMS Queen Elizabeth will be the first operational cruise — Carrier Strike Group 21, or CSG21. Planned for the fall of 2021, this will take the carrier and its jets to the Far East and will also involve F-35Bs from the U.S. Marine Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 “Wake Island Avengers.” While the National Audit Office has warned that the United Kingdom’s Carrier Strike capability will be “constrained” if it has fewer jets than the planned 138, it seems that leading analysts see a reduction in Lightning numbers as very possible. As such, the UK Armed Forces may once again be asked to do more with less. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Around The Globe Europe News & Features United Kingdom"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video of the Air Force’s secretive X-37B opening its bay doors has come to our attention. It shows the 29-foot-long X-37B in an upright position, with its doors swinging open and its solar array, which fits conformally inside the bay, beginning to deploy. It isn’t exactly clear when the clip first emerged, but it has been used by Boeing as part of the Air Force Association’s ongoing annual convention. @DutchSpace spotted the clip and worked to blow the video up a bit for better viewing. The X-37B’s payload bay is widely described as roughly the size of a large pickup truck’s flatbed. The miniature space shuttle’s bay is a major feature that gives it such a high degree of flexibility. Aside from a handful of experimental technologies , very little is known about what the highly maneuverable spacecraft has been carrying into orbit for such long periods of time, but it is widely thought that experimental reconnaissance and communications payloads are a major part of the program. Rumors have circulated for years that it could also be used to release small ‘cubesats’ into orbit, support testing of anti-satellite technologies , and more. The video gives us a better idea of just how voluminous the bay is for the size of the craft and how its solar panels and radiators fit inside. Like the Space Shuttle Orbiter, a large portion of the spaceplane’s design includes empty volume. Once the solar panel system is deployed via its integrated arm, there is plenty of room to store various smaller payloads or even a relatively larger unitary payload. Boeing This fresh look at the X-37B comes just days after China launched and recovered its own small reusable spacecraft, one that is likely very similar to the X-37B. India is also working on a similar capability and Russia has been pursuing its own reusable unmanned spacecraft designs. As space becomes an increasingly contested warfighting domain , these types of highly flexible and reusable spacecraft will take on a more predominant role. Still, the U.S. maintains an edge in this department. So far the X-37B has taken to orbit and recovered back on earth five times, with it first venturing into space a decade ago. The last mission, which ended a year ago, lasted nearly 780 days. A sixth mission is underway now.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The word is out on the identity of the U.S. Air Force’s first F-35A unit to be permanently based overseas. The 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, eastern England, will reactivate the 495th Fighter Squadron as it welcomes the stealth fighters to the base from late 2021. UK-based aviation photographer @THE_DON_TOG — who regularly works with the Lakenheath wing — was among the first to mention the news, posting on his Facebook page that the 495th Fighter Squadron is currently looking for suggestions for a name, with submissions required by September 18, 2020. The 495th traces its lineage back to World War II when it was established as the 495th Fighter-Bomber Squadron as part of the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group at Key Field, Mississippi. The unit was last active as the 495th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS) operating the F-111F Aardvark strike aircraft from RAF Lakenheath, where it had been re-established in April 1977 as a fourth squadron within the wing which now had 91 F-111s assigned. In April 1986, F-111s from the 495th TFS were involved in the El Dorado Canyon strikes against targets in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. This unit was the only one to lose an F-111 during the Libyan raids, when “Karma 52” was posted missing, together with its two crew , Maj Fernando L. Ribas and Capt Paul Lorence.

The infrastructure projects include a flight simulator facility, a maintenance unit, new hangars, and storage facilities to accommodate the Joint Strike Fighters. “Breaking ground on this project takes us one step closer to becoming a more lethal and ready force as U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa’s premier combat wing,” said Col William Marshall, 48th Fighter Wing commander, at the time. Since then, there have been reports that construction work has run over budget and over schedule , but there’s no indication that this will affect the timeline for the arrival of the F-35As.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 22, 2022",Here Is The Surprise Choice To Become Germany’s Standard Assault Rifle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a surprise move, Germany plans to ditch its Heckler & Koch G36 rifle in favor of a new weapon from a lesser-known local manufacturer, C.G. Haenel. The decision on the future assault rifle was disclosed yesterday, September 14, 2020, by the Germany Defense Ministry, during a session in Berlin’s federal parliament. The weapon that’s been selected is Haenel’s fully automatic AR-15/M4 patterned MK556 in 5.56mm caliber . A semi-automatic version of the same weapon, the CR223, is already used by certain police forces in Germany and law-enforcement agencies in other countries. The defense ministry confirmed the decision today, September 15, 2020. However, it’s possible that the selection will be subject to a protest or a judicial review before a contract is formally awarded. Heckler & Koch released an official statement confirming that neither of its offerings — the HK416 and the modular HK433 — had been accepted. “Subject to an extensive legal review, we regret this decision,” said Heckler & Koch’s CEO Jens Bodo Koch . “At the same time, we are absolutely convinced of the quality of both the HK416 and the HK433. This quality was also confirmed to us by the Bundeswehr within the framework of the tender. With our products, we do not need to fear any competitors.” Koch added that the firm would now “examine the legality of the decision in detail and examine all judicial opportunities.” Germany’s successor to the G36 is being procured under a program known as System Sturmgewehr, or Assault Rifle System. This tender was launched in April 2017 when the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) specified a requirement for up to 120,000 new rifles at a cost of around €245 million. At the time, the first deliveries of series-manufactured weapons were planned for the third quarter of 2020. The tender followed a directive from the then German Defense Minister, Ursula von der Leyen, after extensive criticism of the G36 rifle, which had been introduced by the Bundeswehr back in the mid-1990s. The catalog of faults associated with the G36 included problems when operating when hot (i.e. after prolonged periods of firing) or during rapid changes in ambient temperature; these resulted in decreased accuracy. While the Bundeswehr confirmed that no soldier had actually been endangered as a direct result of the G36’s deficiencies, user experience — especially on foreign operations — highlighted a significant degree of dissatisfaction with the weapon, particularly in conditions of dust, heat haze, or crosswinds. A German Navy combat swimmer armed with a G36 assault rifle., BUNDESWEHR The System Sturmgewehr requirement for the new rifle specified either 5.56 x 45 NATO or 7.62 x 51 NATO calibers and interchangeable long- and short-barrel versions of the rifle. The weapon had to have ambidextrous features for left- or right-handed soldiers and a maximum weight of 7.9 pounds without the magazine and optics. The gun’s housing was required to have a lifetime of at least 30,000 rounds fired, while the barrel life called for a minimum of 15,000 (NATO ball) or 7,500 (armor-piercing) rounds fired. Among the accessories specified were a bayonet, silencer, drum magazine, and bipod. Based in Suhl, a traditional center of small arms manufacture, in the eastern province of Thuringia, Haenel was originally established in 1840. Before the reunification of Germany, the firm operated in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as the VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk named after Ernst Thälmann, the interwar leader of the Communist Party of Germany. During the Cold War, it was engaged in the licensed manufacture of Kalashnikov assault rifles for the GDR and foreign clients. Finally, in 2008, it resumed operations as a start-up under the historic Haenel name. Today it’s a part of the Merkel Group, in turn, a component of the Tawazun Holding based in the United Arab Emirates. Border guards from the German Democratic Republic on patrol in 1979, armed with Kalashnikovs., U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Haenel has already gained some experience in producing firearms for the post-reunification German Armed Forces, which have used its G29 sniper rifle since 2016. However, the bulk of the Bundeswehr’s rifles, machine guns, and other personal weapons have for many years been provided by Heckler & Koch, based in Neckar, southwest Germany. A German Special Forces Command (KSK) sniper trains with a G29 sniper rifle., BUNDESWEHR Haenel’s MK556 — the MK stands for “Maschinenkarabiner,” or machine carbine — was first unveiled in 2017 and owes much to the design of the American AR-15/M4 , although it uses a gas piston system for cycling instead of the direct impingement arrangement found on the traditional AR-15/M4/M16 family of rifles. The piston configuration is becoming more common these days for higher-end AR-15/M4 patterned rifles, as it brings the same adaptability and ergonomics of the AR-15/M4, but with enhanced reliability, especially when run for longer periods of fire and in harsh environments without cleaning. HK’s HK416 family of rifles, including the HK433, also uses the gas piston arrangement, as do an increasing number of small arms manufacturer’s offerings, such as Sig’s MCX series . According to a report from the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA), extensive tests demonstrated that the Haenel design is “somewhat better” suited to the System Sturmgewehr requirements than its rival from Heckler & Koch and is also cheaper. Other companies that were expected to take part in the bidding process included a joint venture between Rheinmetall and Austria’s Steyr-Mannlicher (offering the RS556 rifle ), plus Sig Sauer (SIG MCX), but both withdrew. According to Die Zeit newspaper , Sig Sauer was unhappy with what it saw as unfair treatment in the process, resulting in limited access to test ammunition. The latest news from Germany is undoubtedly a blow to Heckler & Koch, which began supplying its first G3 assault rifles to the West German Armed Forces in 1959. More recently, however, the company has won significant contracts to supply its HK416 assault rifle to France and Norway. The same rifle is a popular choice among armed forces in the United States , where it was made famous when used by SEAL Team Six in the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden ; it has since been adopted by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. So what happens next for the Bundeswehr’s new rifle? According to Soldat & Technik magazine , the G36 successor will be procured in four lots, a deal for the first of which should be negotiated in the federal parliament at the end of 2020. The remaining lots will then follow, together with related laser sighting modules and weapon optics. Thereafter, Haenel will face a tough job to dislodge Heckler & Koch as the preeminent supplier of small arms to the German Armed Forces. But if it succeeds in its bid to replace the G36, the company will certainly be on the right path. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Assault Rifles Land Small Arms"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In his address on the second day of the Air Force Association’s virtual Air, Space & Cyber Conference, on September 15, 2020, Dr Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, revealed that a previous undisclosed demonstrator for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program has begun flight testing. “We’ve already built and flown a full-scale flight demonstrator in the real world,” Roper confirmed to Defense News , “and we broke records in doing it. We are ready to go and build the next-generation aircraft in a way that has never happened before.” Whether the demonstrator should be understood as a true prototype for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) is uncertain — of course, it may also be an unmanned aircraft — but it’s clear that the U.S. effort to field a new-generation fighter is accelerating now that it has reached the inflight testing phase. Based on the nature of the NGAD program, it seems most likely that the aircraft in question is a technology demonstrator that will be used for risk-reduction efforts and to help prove major concepts that could underpin the NGAD program. Perhaps coincidentally, there has been a notable uptick in flight-test activity in the Southwest of the United States of late, which could point at least in part to NGAD-related testing. While Roper’s reference to breaking “records” might conjure up images of manned X-planes pushing the limits, it could equally refer to advances made in the aircraft’s design and development path, which is known to make use of the digital engineering espoused in the Air Force’s new “ eSeries .” A Northrop Grumman NGAD concept., NORTHROP GRUMMAN Whatever the case, the Air Force has built and flown some kind of experimental aircraft in secret, but Roper provided no more details to suggest if more than one example has been completed, or how many sorties might have been recorded so far. The manufacturer(s) of the aircraft also remains a mystery, as does its designation. The last known new U.S. fighter prototypes to take to the air were the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed Martin X-35 that competed in the Joint Strike Fighter program back in the early 2000s. The announcement of any new combat aircraft is an unusual event and the secrecy surrounding the NGAD initiative makes this latest disclosure all the more fascinating. While we can only hope that more details emerge soon, the track record of the NGAD program suggests we probably shouldn’t hold our breath. That being said, there are other areas of this story that we will be exploring in the very near future. Stay tuned.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 17, 2020",Greece Is Buying French Rafale Fighters In Light Of Tensions With Turkey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the standoff between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean rumbles on, Athens has announced steps to modernize all three branches of the Hellenic Armed Forces. The most significant development is Greeceâ€™s intention to purchase 18 Rafale jet fighters and four new multirole frigates. The Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced plans during an address on the state of the economy at the Thessaloniki International Fair on September 12.Â â€œIn recent years, the defense sector has experienced disinvestment after a period of high costs and neglected the armament programs,â€ Mitsotakis said . â€œItâ€™s time to balance needs and opportunities. It is time to strengthen the Armed Forces as a legacy for the security of the country. But also as a supreme obligation to the Greeks, who will bear the cost. It is the price of our place on the map.â€ Rafales for the HAF The 18 Rafales are set to replace the Hellenic Air Forceâ€™s (HAF) older Mirage 2000s that have not been brought up to the more advanced Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2 standard. Prime Minister Mitsotakis has said that the HAF will receive six new-build Rafales and 12 second-hand examples diverted from French Air Force stocks. According to unconfirmed French sources, the second-hand jets will be delivered in the F3-O4T standard that includes RBE2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, DDM-NG infrared missile warning system, OSF-IT optoelectronics system , and improved cockpit displays. Rafale C and Rafale B in flight., DASSAULT AVIATION / K. TOKUNAGA â€œI am delighted with this announcement, which reinforces the exceptional relationship we have had with Greece for nearly half a century, and I thank the Greek authorities for their confidence in us once again,â€ said Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation. â€œDassault Aviation is fully mobilized to meet the operational needs expressed by the Greek Air Force, and thus contribute to ensuring Greeceâ€™s sovereignty and the safety of the Greek people.â€ For Dassault, the planned Greek acquisition of the Rafale is a major breakthrough. Once signed off, it will be the first European export order of the multirole fighter, which has already been ordered by Egypt, India , and Qatar. â€œArmed Forces Minister Florence Parly welcomes the choice announced today by Prime Minister Mitsotakis to acquire 18 Rafale aircraft,â€ the French Ministry of Defense said in a statement. â€œThis choice strengthens the link between the Greek and French armed forces and will allow them to intensify their operational and strategic cooperation.â€ According to the same source, a contract for the Rafales should be signed â€œin the coming months.â€ According to Prime Minister Mitsotakis, the first Rafales for the HAF should arrive in Greece in the middle of 2021.Â Recent military cooperation between France and Greece has also involved Rafales. On August 13, French Air Force Rafales arrived at Souda-Chania Air Base on Crete for joint training with Greek F-16s. The French Ministry of Defense described the deployment as a â€œtemporarily strengthening [of] their presence in the eastern Mediterranean.â€ A french #Rafale at Souda AB Crete . #France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· and #Greece ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· on joint drills in the Greek #EEZ eastern part  where #Turkey ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· violates as of 2 days now. #Orucreis #Kemalreis pic.twitter.com/d28wSVpOg8 — CrisP (@crispSV) August 13, 2020 The spending plan also includes new guided missiles for the air force. While these remain undisclosed, itâ€™s highly likely that this element comprises weapons for the Rafales. The HAF already employs MBDA MICA air-to-air missiles on its Mirage fleet, which also carry AM.39 Exocet anti-ship and SCALP-EG conventionally armed cruise missiles from the same manufacturer. All three of these weapons, and more , can be carried by the Rafale too.Â In a time of conflict, the Rafales would likely be expected to secure air superiority over the region, including operating from dispersed island bases, while also prosecuting long-range land-attack missions and anti-shipping strikes. You can read all about how Greece and Turkey currently stack up against each other air combat-wise in this past feature of ours. Â A Rafale loaded with six MICA air-to-air missiles. , DASSAULT AVIATION Some sources erroneously state that the deal will include the modernization of 10 of the HAFâ€™s earlier Mirage 2000s to the more advanced Mirage 2000-5 configuration. This, however, runs counter to reports from Greece that the Rafales will replace the surviving non-upgraded Mirage 2000s. It seems that these reports of Mirage modernization have conflated the latest plans with the previous contract to upgrade 10 Mirage 2000s to 2000-5 standard, now completed. Meanwhile, in December 2019 further contracts were signed for the continued maintenance of the Greek Mirage 2000-5 fleet. This â‚¬260-million deal covered upgrade and sustainment of the jetsâ€™ electronics and its engines over a seven-year period, with work to be conducted by Dassault Aviation, Safran Military Engines, and Thales.Â A long-term observer of the Hellenic Air Force told The War Zone that they expect the older Mirage 2000s to be sold back to France or possibly to Cyprus. The latter would seem surprising since it doesnâ€™t currently operate any fixed-wing combat equipment. The Greek decision to opt for the Rafale could signal the end of official interest in the F-35 Lightning II. In December 2019, Prime Minister Mitsotakis revealed that he would be discussing a potential purchase of the Joint Strike Fighter with U.S. President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House the following January. â€œWe can deepen our defense cooperation even further, for example in the sector of drones. We will also begin a discussion on eventually acquiring F-35 aircraft, once fiscal conditions permit,â€ Mitsotakis told Greek newspaper To Vima , at the time.Â The Greek prime ministerâ€™s mention of â€œfiscal conditionsâ€ suggests that an F-35 purchase may have been shelved on cost grounds, with the Rafale option coming in cheaper. On the other hand, the HAF has long operated fighters from both France and the United States, perhaps to ensure a continued supply chain for at least one of the fleets, should a potential conflict trigger sanctions or other restrictions. Dassaultâ€™s Greek odyssey Greece has been an enthusiastic customer of French-made combat jets for over 45 years. This began with an order for 40 Mirage F1CG fighters in June 1974. Unusually, the Greek Mirage F1s were armed with American-supplied AIM-9P Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and had a primary air defense tasking. After serving with two squadrons â€” 334 and 342 Mira â€” the last HAF Mirage F1s were retired in 2003. The F1CG variant was the first Mirage to see Hellenic Air Force service., HELLENIC AIR FORCE In 1985, Greece chose to supplement the swept-wing Mirage F1 with the delta-wing Mirage 2000, placing an order for 36 single-seat Mirage 2000EGs and four two-seat Mirage 2000DGs. After Dassault Aviation launched the more advanced Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2, Athens in 2000 chose to buy 15 examples and upgrade 10 of its existing Mirage 2000EGs to the same standard, with much of the modernization work handled locally by HAI. The HAF â€˜Dash 5sâ€™ are designated Mirage 2000-5EG (single-seat) and Mirage 2000-5BG (two-seat). As well as the 10 new-build Mirage 2000-5EGs and 10 Mirage 2000EGs rebuilt to the same standard, the HAF received five new-build two-seat Mirage 2000-5BGs. HAF Mirage 2000s are divided between 331 and 332 Mira both based at Tanagra. The new-look â€˜French contingentâ€™ within the HAF will likely see the Rafales assigned to 331 Mira while the Mirage 2000-5s serve with 332 Mira. A two-seat Mirage 2000DG., HELLENIC AIR FORCE Naval regeneration When the news was first announced, some observers presumed that the new frigates would be from French shipyards, but this is not necessarily the case. A U.S. investor took over Greeceâ€™s troubled Elefsis Shipyard earlier this year, which would provide the option to construct at least some of the warships locally. The planned acquisition of MH-60Rs also suggests that the warships could be of American design. Alongside the four new frigates of an undisclosed type, the Hellenic Navyâ€™s four existing MEKO 200HN frigates will undergo a mid-life upgrade. The 3,200-ton MEKO 200HN, or Hydra class, is the Greek variant of the MEKO family of warships designed by the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Germany. The first of four Hellenic Navy vessels was constructed in Germany and commissioned in 1992 while the other three were completed locally by Hellenic Shipyards at Skaramagas. The Hydra -class frigate Salamis (F455) during an exercise with Standing NATO Maritime Group Two in the Aegean Sea., NATO / GBR N LPHOT PAUL HALL Improvements to the Hydra class had been expected . Plans to upgrade the vessels were announced in April 2018, and in May 2019 the Joint Chiefs of General Staff Council decided to launch a modernization program albeit in a basic form, due to budgetary constraints. The full-scale mid-life upgrade is expected to address the radars, sensors, and electronic combat systems. The maritime spending spree doesnâ€™t end there, as Athens also plans to buy four new MH-60R Seahawk naval helicopters and provide its five air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines with new heavyweight torpedoes. The Hellenic Navy previously received eight S-70B Aegean Hawk helicopters â€” representing the previous-generation Seahawk â€” from the mid-1990s. The fleet added another three S-70B Aegean Hawks by 2005, these being configured to an improved standard including Raytheon AN/AAS-44 forward-looking infrared (FLIR) for prosecuting anti-ship missile attacks using Hellfire or Penguin missiles.

Also announced is a drive to improve digital technology across the Armed Forces, including hardening systems and infrastructure against cyberattacks. As part of an overall expansion effort, the Hellenic Armed Forces will add another 15,000 personnel to its ranks over the next five years. The Greek military had around 107,600 servicemen and women in active service as of last year , a figure that has steadily increased since 2014.Â Industrial overhaul On the industry side, the rescue package for Elefsis Shipyard is expected to be followed by foreign investment in the countryâ€™s other major naval shipbuilder, Hellenic Shipyards at Skaramagas, according to local media . A tender has been launched for the privatization of Hellenic Vehicle Industries, the countryâ€™s only manufacturer of wheeled and tracked vehicles.Â Finally, Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI) is expected to be reorganized with the aim of specializing in aircraft maintenance and overhaul.Â Strategic issues While the latest round of modernization for the Hellenic Armed Forces includes measures to boost the countryâ€™s defense industry, it should also be seen in the light of the ongoing tensions between Greece and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean. These chiefly relate to disputes over energy claims and maritime rights in the region. Sporadic clashes between the two countries are nothing new, but recent months have seen rival naval exercises, controversial drilling surveys, and a high-profile collision between Greek and Turkish warships . New and modernized frigates and maritime helicopters, plus heavyweight torpedoes , demonstrate that the Hellenic Navy is expected to flex its muscles in the Aegean, where both Greece and Turkey have claims on overlapping areas, including important gas reserves â€” especially in the waters off Cyprus. The Mediterranean island remains a flashpoint between Ankara and Athens, with Turkey insistent that the islandâ€™s natural resources should be shared. In August, Turkey reacted with anger when Greece signed a deal with Egypt to establish an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Aegean. This followed an agreement between Turkey and Libya in November 2019, which sought to create an EEZ stretching from Turkeyâ€™s southern coast to northeast Libya, and which was protested by Greece and Egypt. Meanwhile, Greeceâ€™s plan to buy 18 Rafale fighters signals a determination to establish a technological lead over the Turkish Air Force. Significantly, Turkeyâ€™s plans to acquire the F-35A were dramatically derailed after the countryâ€™s refusal to give up its purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems . Should Ankara now seek to acquire a batch of fighters to match the Rafale, itâ€™s options will be more limited. Turkey has been connected with the Russian Su-57 Felon in the past, but this fighter is still not yet in frontline service in Russia. A possible acquisition of the Su-35 is also on the table. It could be that the Turkish Air Force will have to wait until the indigenous TF-X enters service â€” optimistically scheduled for 2028 â€” until it can introduce new fighter equipment to offset the Greek Rafales, but this seems unlikely due to the need to replace aging types, including F-4 Phantoms. The new frigates and Rafales will represent a significant improvement in the Hellenic Armed Forcesâ€™ capabilities in the Aegean. The planned purchases also send a clear message to Turkey that Greece is willing to invest to defend its interests in the region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Carrier catapult launches are violent affairs . Something of an ultimate E-ticket ride , they accelerate 25-ton flying machines from zero to 130 knots in about 300 feet, resulting in roughly four times the force of gravity being induced on the jet, its crew, and whatever stores it is carrying. In this case, an F/A-18E Super Hornet had a 480-gallon centerline fuel tank attached as it rushed down the catapult track . Then, just after the “thump” of the catapult shuttle hitting the end of the track can be heard, the tank is seen dropping away from the jet. It then tumbles into the sea right in front of the ship, with fuel spilling into the water as the carrier continues to plow ahead. And yes, it is all set to a “Surfing USA” soundtrack with what sound like sailors giving some candid commentary. You can watch the video here . Because of its odd orientation, here are some screengrabs so you can more clearly see what happened: Tick Tok screencap Tick Tok screencap Tick Tok screencap Tick Tok screencap It isn’t clear what happened here. It seems as if the tank wasn’t secured properly or an electronic fault caused the jettison. Otherwise, the pilot jettisoned it on command due to an issue, although it doesn’t look like they received a ‘cold cat shot’ in which the catapult does not produce enough forward motion to get the aircraft airborne safely. You can read all about this terrifying situation here . Regardless, the tank made a quick trip to Davy Jones’ Locker. Thankfully, nobody was hurt. Such a loss isn’t financially significant in terms of the overall cost of combat aviation, with a drop tank costing thousands of dollars, not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, like some munitions, but this won’t be the case in the future. The Super Hornet is set to receive an advanced Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system mounted in the nose of a 480-gallon tank that will be installed on the aircraft’s centerline station. It will cost exponentially more than its standard gas-carry cousin. In fact, losing the tank with its sensor and computer system, by demand or otherwise, could end up becoming a major mishap depending on just how much the pod costs, in the end. The Super Hornet’s IRST21 sensor pod is slated to be operational next year. You can read the most in-depth discussion about the upgrade and its capabilities anywhere in this recent War Zone feature.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Africa Command says that at least two MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets , possibly piloted by shadowy Russian mercenaries, have crashed in Libya. Jared Szuba, the Pentagon correspondent for AI-Monitor , Tweeted out that one of the jets was apparently lost on June 28, while the other went down on September 7, 2020. This information had come in a statement from Rear Admiral Heidi Berg, U.S. Africa Command’s (AFRICOM) director of intelligence. Another tweet indicates that Berg believes that “Russian fighter aircraft,” presumably MiG-29s too, but potentially also Su-24 Fencer strike aircraft , have conducted airstrikes in Libya. AI-Monitor ‘s Szuba follows that up by repeating AFRICOM’s assertion that the Russian aircraft are being operated by paramilitary contractors from the Wagner Group. This organization has very close connections to Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, better known by the Russian acronym GRU. Perhaps not coincidentally, a video emerged on social media earlier this week apparently showing a Russian-speaking pilot after their aircraft went down in Libya. The second half of the clip suggested he was about to be picked up by a Mi-24 Hind gunship helicopter . That two-minute video was not dated and it was inconclusive as to whether it showed a genuine rescue effort to retrieve a just-downed pilot, or if it was footage from a combat search and rescue (CSAR) exercise. While the video showed items consistent with ejection from a single-seat Russian-made fighter jet, and the pilot mentions that he ejected from his aircraft, no evidence of aircraft wreckage or smoke is visible. The video was notably posted to YouTube on September 7, without explanation, by a user with the handle Fighterbomber. The same poster subsequently took to Instagram to claim that it actually showed a CSAR exercise, pointing to the lack of wreckage or smoke, and other supposed discrepancies, including the pilot’s lack of flying suit, and contending that the R-855 emergency radio beacon would not normally be carried on a combat mission. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ivan Ivanov (@fighter_bomber_) At least 14 Russian-sourced jets have been operating in Libya since May in support of Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which has its main hub in the eastern city of Tobruk. The LNA is engaged in a civil conflict with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), headquartered in Tripoli. The MiG-29s arrived at multiple bases in LNA-controlled eastern Libya following a brief stopover at the Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. In June, unconfirmed reports suggested that at least one of the Libyan-based MiG-29s had flown a mission over the strategic coastal city of Sirte . The sighting came as GNA forces attempted to regain control of the area before the opposing sides agreed to a ceasefire in August. Annotated satellite imagery provided by U.S. Africa Command showing two MiG-29s at Al Jufra Air Base, May 2020., AFRICOM While AFRICOM has periodically released images of the Russian jets operating in Libya in the past, it may be hoped that similar visual or some other confirmation might be provided soon to confirm these two MiG-29 losses.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 10, 2020",NASA Is Hiring Private Contractors To Retrieve Moon Dust,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The new space race continues to accelerate as hints of the commercialization of space and the exploitation of space-based materials loom. Just today, NASA issued an unprecedented solicitation titled “Purchase of Lunar Regolith and/or Rock Materials from Contractor.” The solicitation asks contractors to bid on an effort to retrieve between 50g and 500g of lunar regolith, or moon dust, and bring it back to Earth before 2024. The amount of material retrieved does not affect the overall price of the contract, and the contract will be awarded on the basis of being “low price, technically acceptable.” Offers are due by October 9, 2020. Contractors must provide stringent proof of collection, including giving NASA imagery of the collection, the collected material, and a means of identifying the exact location from which the regolith was retrieved. Collected materials may be any type of lunar regolith, including dusts, rocks, or even ice. NASA reserves the right to independently verify that actual collection took place. A lunar rock sample collected during Apollo 15., Public domain According to the solicitation, “NASA will determine and use such independent verification methods that will not interfere with Contractor’s activities.” All analysis and assessment of materials will be conducted by NASA. NASA astronauts exploring the lunar surface during the Apollo 17 mission., Public domain Nearly the entire surface of our Moon is covered in regolith, made up of small, loose fragments of rock produced by billions of years of meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts. There is also lunar soil or lunar dust, a finer subset of regolith with fragments smaller than 1cm. The terms lunar regolith and lunar soil are often used interchangeably, and from the wording of NASA’s solicitation, it doesn’t seem like the space agency is too picky about what types of regolith are brought back to Earth. Lunar regolith collected during Apollo 17 on display at the National Museum of Natural History., Public domain Between 1969 and 1972, a total of 842 pounds of lunar rocks and dust were brought back to Earth from the lunar surface during the Apollo missions. As recently as last year, NASA was still opening pristine, unopened samples from those missions in order to better understand the lunar surface. “We are able to make measurements today that were just not possible during the years of the Apollo program,” said Dr. Sarah Noble, a scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, about opening and examining a previously unopened Apollo sample in 2019. “The analysis of these samples will maximize the science return from Apollo, as well as enable a new generation of scientists and curators to refine their techniques and help prepare future explorers for lunar missions anticipated in the 2020s and beyond.” Astronaut Harrison Schmitt attempting to collect lunar regolith samples., NASA This latest NASA solicitation is part of a growing scientific effort to collect extraterrestrial geological samples and return them to Earth. In 2019, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Hayabusa2 spacecraft shot a small projectile into the surface of Asteroid Ryugu and collected the dust generated from the impact. Hayabusa2 is slated to return the samples to Earth later this year. NASA and the European Space Agency proposed a joint mission earlier this year known as Mars Sample Return which would send robots to Mars to collect regolith and bring the samples back to Earth for analysis. The Moon is quickly becoming a site of strategic importance as China has turned its eye to our planet’s satellite after years of rapid progress in space exploration. China recently sent the Chang’e 4 lander to the far side of the moon , triggering fears of a new space race that will see the militarization of the moon . The Moon could also become strategically vital not only for the future of space exploration and possible colonization, but the future of energy production on Earth. The Moon is an abundant source of the isotope helium-3 (He-3) which is a source of fuel for potential thermonuclear fusion power technologies. China and India have both explored mining the lunar surface for He-3 which, if successful, could prove to be a key resource in the burgeoning space-based economy . The space races of previous decades led to the development of many world-changing technologies and scientific breakthroughs. This latest space race will no doubt follow suit. The only question is whether it will bring humanity closer together or push us farther apart as superpowers vie for dominance in the final frontier. Regardless, jump-starting the private sector’s lunar ambitions by paying them to go to the Moon and actually return some part of it back to Earth is certainly an exciting step towards whatever future the moon holds for America in space.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 19, 2021",U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs Are About To Go Aboard A British Carrier And They Might Be There To Stay,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ten U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs that touched down in the United Kingdom recently are preparing to embark aboard the Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth . It’s set to be the start of an enduring relationship between the warship and F-35B units of both countries. The short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “Wake Island Avengers,” touched down at RAF Marham, Norfolk, in the east of England, in two waves, on September 3, 2020, having flown from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. While U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs have visited the United Kingdom before , this is the first time for VMFA-211, and Marine F-35Bs have never before made such an extensive deployment to the country. Spinning-up After a period of work-ups, and assorted exercises flown from their temporary land base at RAF Marham, home of the United Kingdom’s Lightning Force, the “Wake Island Avengers” will put their jets aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth . The Royal Navy’s flagship is going to sea with British and American jets on board as it spins up for its first operational deployment, which will be to the Pacific region next year under the banner of Carrier Strike Group 21, or CSG21. This, too, will involve significant VMFA-211 participation. Currently, the 10 U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs are working alongside their counterparts from the Royal Air Force’s No 617 Squadron, the “Dambusters” — the first of the frontline U.K. Lightning units. Since so much of the training involved in the Joint Strike Fighter enterprise is synthetic, the U.S. pilots initially worked in Marham’s simulators , becoming familiarized with the local airspace and procedures. As the United Kingdom builds up toward the carrier strike role , and a debut operational cruise for HMS Queen Elizabeth , September 10 saw VMFA-211 and No 617 Squadron take part in Exercise Point Blank 20-4 . This didn’t include the carrier, but pitted the F-35Bs against RAF Typhoon fighter jets that worked as Red Air adversaries . Other assets involved came from the U.S. Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing at nearby RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, as well as the Royal Netherlands Air Force. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B takes off from RAF Marham on September 10, 2020, during Exercise Point Blank., CROWN COPYRIGHT Later this month, the “Wake Island Avengers” and “Dambusters” will go aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth and then undertake carrier qualification training to ensure all pilots are able to operate from the vessel during both day and night. The two F-35B squadrons will then team up with two embarked Merlin helicopter squadrons to take part in Exercise Joint Warrior, due to begin on September 21. Training will include the delivery of live and inert weapons. Joint Warrior is a biannual set of maneuvers that takes place in and around Scotland and Northern England. It is described by the U.K. Ministry of Defence as the “largest military exercise in Europe.” It typically brings together participants from the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, and the British Army, as well as foreign forces. The at-sea phase won’t be the end of VMFA-211’s sojourn in the United Kingdom. Once Joint Warrior is over, the two F-35B squadrons will return to RAF Marham to take part in Exercise Crimson Warrior. According to the U.K. Ministry of Defence, this will comprise “high-end training, alongside other platforms, in a contested environment with this year’s focus being on Multi-Domain Operations.” F-35Bs aboard Queen Elizabeth during a test cruise off the east coast of the United States. , Royal Navy While a precise definition of Multi-Domain Operations has yet to be provided, it generally implies a level of tactical integration beyond conventional “Joint” operations. This suggests that Crimson Warrior will see F-35Bs acting very closely alongside other air, land, and sea assets, likely making use of their much-vaunted data-sharing capability . Back to the boat Meanwhile, on the south coast of England, HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed from HM Naval Base Portsmouth on September 9, after a delay due to an outbreak of COVID-19 among the ship’s crew. The warship will conduct trials before returning to Portsmouth and taking on the stores required before embarking more aircraft — including the F-35Bs. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) had left the Royal Navy without any fixed-wing aircraft carrier. As a cost-cutting measure, the U.K. Ministry of Defence axed the navy’s last strike carrier, HMS Ark Royal , from the Invincible class, together with the warship’s complement of Harrier GR9 strike fighters. On November 24 that year, the last four Harriers left the deck of Ark Royal and returned to their land base at RAF Cottesmore, Lincolnshire, where the jets were decommissioned . View from the cockpit of a Harrier as the pilot prepares to take off from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal ., CROWN COPYRIGHT With the United Kingdom now back in the fixed-wing carrier business, officials have described a 24-aircraft Lightning air group as a “credible compliment” for the Carrier Strike role. Although the Queen Elizabeth -class carriers are designed to operate a maximum of 36 F-35Bs (equivalent to three squadrons), this is not expected to be a regular occurrence, though. HMS Queen Elizabeth left port with at least six Merlin HM2 anti-submarine helicopters arranged on deck, but this is just the beginning of what the Royal Navy has promised will be its biggest carrier aviation embarkation “since HMS Hermes .” This earlier-generation carrier was retired by the United Kingdom in 1984 but had previously served in the Falklands conflict with an air group of 16 Sea Harriers, 10 RAF Harrier GR3s, and 10 Sea King helicopters. It should be remembered that HMS Hermes , and the subsequent STOVL carriers of the Invincible class, were much smaller ships than the Queen Elizabeth -class, with considerably less space for embarked aviation. The Merlin HC4 is also planned to go aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the next at-sea phase, but the delayed Merlin Crowsnest variant, outfitted with a roll-on/roll-off airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) suite, is not yet ready to go to sea. A Merlin HC4 of 845 Naval Air Squadron, also due to embark on the carrier this month., CROWN COPYRIGHT Crowsnest is considered a vital capability for the Carrier Strike Group, which will normally also include at least one destroyer, an anti-submarine warfare frigate, plus ships for support and resupply. A nuclear fast attack submarine will also likely join the flotilla. There have been continuous concerns over the Royal Navy’s ability to provide these additional vessels for carrier strike group cruises, especially with two carriers to support. Regardless, without Crowsnest, the group’s ability to conduct long-range air, sea, and land surveillance — including detecting, tracking, and identify threats beyond the horizon — is notably diminished. The Royal Navy does expect to have five Crowsnest helicopters available to deploy for CSG21, although full operational capability will have to wait until May 2023. Exactly what the first iteration of the Anglo-American carrier air group will look like is unclear, but we do know that it should contain more aircraft than were aboard the Invincible-class carrier HMS Ark Royal in 1987, for example. This comprised of 12 Sea Harriers, six RAF Harrier GR3s, and four Sea King helicopters, for a total of 22 aircraft. In September 2001, another large-scale embark involved the Invincible -class carrier HMS Illustrious going to sea with eight Sea Harriers, eight RAF Harrier GR7s, and five Sea King helicopters, for a total of 21. The Royal Navy has confirmed the 2020 cruise will involve “near enough double” the number of aircraft, though this presumably refers to only the fixed-wing types in the September 2001 cruise — 16 in all. The​ plan versus reality So, how realistic is this plan? The United Kingdom currently has 15 F-35Bs at RAF Marham. Another three are at Edwards Air Force Base in California for ongoing test and evaluation work, and three more are planned for delivery this year, although the timeline may be delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Add to this the 10 jets from the “Wake Island Avengers” now in England, and, on paper, it’s possible that the Royal Navy plans to put as many as 25 Lightnings on the warship later this month. This number would roughly tally with aspirations outlined in the past involving a future Carrier Strike Group comprising 24 F-35Bs, 14 Merlin HM2s, and two or three Merlin HC4s that operate in the amphibious assault/logistic support role. A slide from a Royal Navy briefing in 2016 showing a planned Carrier Strike Group., THOMAS NEWDICK While there are 15 British-owned F-35Bs at RAF Marham now, it must be remembered that these are shared between the initial frontline unit, No 617 Squadron, and the operational conversion unit, No 207 Squadron, which is tasked with training the personnel to operate the jets as the force expands. In addition, not all of the aircraft are likely to be in a state in which they are ready for shipboard deployment. The F-35 is significantly maintenance-intensive and there are parts shortages and other hurdles that are still being felt across the entire F-35 enterprise in the form of depressed readiness rates. As such, it is more likely that significantly fewer than the 15 airframes at Marham will be sent alongside their USMC cousins to the ship for the high-profile deployment. That the U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs may outnumber their RAF brethren on the deck of the Royal Navy’s flagship has been the cause of some consternation within sections of the British media , but this air group has been planned for some time. British F-35Bs aboard the Queen Elizebeth during a training and test cruise. , Royal Navy An initiative to deploy U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs on the British carrier was announced back in September 2016 and formalized the following December with an agreement signed between the then U.K. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and his U.S. counterpart, Ash Carter. Indeed, in September 2016, Commodore Jerry Kyd, the then-commander of HMS Queen Elizabeth , announced his aspiration to embark both U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs and MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors on the carrier for a period of up to nine months. There’s no confirmation yet as to whether MV-22s will also take part in CSG21, but it’s clear that the U.K. military is keeping an eye on the tiltrotor program , which could provide a useful carrier on-board delivery capability and possibly other roles, as well, like an aerial refueling tanker asset. A U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey helicopter lands aboard HMS Ark Royal during Exercise Auriga in the Western Atlantic in 2010., CROWN COPYRIGHT Embarking American aircraft on the British carrier has therefore long been the objective, filling in the numbers as the United Kingdom works incrementally toward a planned fleet of 24 carrier-available jets by 2023 — as laid out in the government’s last SDSR in 2015. Currently, 48 F-35B jets are under contract. This would theoretically provide for a 24-aircraft Carrier Strike complement on each of the two Queen Elizabeth -carriers simultaneously, but, even if achievable, such a deployment seems extremely unlikely. As well as boosting aircraft numbers, VMFA-211 will be able to share plenty of F-35B experience with the U.K. Lightning Force . The “Wake Island Avengers” was the first operational U.S. Marine Corps F-35B unit to go to war, deploying aboard the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Essex in mid-2018 and flying combat missions in Afghanistan , Iraq, and Syria. F-35Bs from the RAF and from VMFA-211 at RAF Marham., CROWN COPYRIGHT Long-term, the number of U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs jets likely to be operating aboard Royal Navy carriers will depend heavily on the fate of U.K. orders beyond the 48 now jets committed to. Reports in the British media suggest that the original plan to acquire 138 F-35Bs across the life of the program could be cut by as many as half , which could mean U.S. Marine Corps jets remain regular tenants aboard British carriers. Even if the United Kingdom presses ahead with a 138-aircraft Lightning fleet, there’s every chance that U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs — and potentially other types too — will continue to undertake “cross-deck” operations with their British counterparts. The United Kingdom and the United States have a uniquely close military relationship , and with the U.S. Marine Corps and RAF/Royal Navy operating the same aircraft type, there is plenty of scope for integrated operations. The U.S. Navy is now down one of its big deck amphibious assault ships after USS Bonhomme Richard suffered extreme damage due to fire. This could make Marine deployments aboard the Royal Navy’s new carriers that much more enticing, at least for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, if all goes according to plan, the U.K. Ministry of Defence will declare initial Carrier Strike capability in December 2020, and the personnel and aircraft of VMFA-211 will play an important part in attaining that milestone.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 16, 2021",This Is The Royal Air Force’s First Aggressor Eurofighter Typhoon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jet has been repainted in a long-awaited aggressor color scheme. The jet, serial ZJ914, broke cover yesterday at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, after a period in the paint shop there. It’s been known for a while that the RAF planned to paint at least some of No IX (Bomber) Squadron’s Typhoon FGR4s in new “shark gray” colors befitting their “fourth-gen aggressor” function. “In this role, [the Typhoon] will provide a sterner training test to RAF and NATO fast jet pilots, as they will play the role of opposing aircraft which match their speed and maneuverability while using the latest real-world dogfighting and air combat tactics against them,” the service said in a press release. The squadron’s “Bomber” title doesn’t reflect its current mission, but is a nod to the rich heritage of the unit, which was formed in 1914 and which thereafter has served mainly in a bombing capacity, including the 1944 operation to sink the German battleship Tirpitz , at which time it flew the Avro Lancaster . Some areas of the jet have not been repainted including the radome and various antennas associated with the Typhoon’s Defensive Aids Sub-System (DASS). The scheme has been described as a dark shade of gray, but appears closer to black, and is superficially similar to the “Blackbird-style” paint job that has been used by Nellis Air Force Base’s 64th Aggressor Squadron (AGRS) flying F-16s in Nevada. A black-painted 64th Aggressor Squadron F-16C., 57TH WING COMMANDER’S FACEBOOK PAGE The RAF and the Royal Navy each have a squadron of black-painted Hawk T1s used for adversary work, but their color schemes are common across that fast jet training fleet, rather than being role-specific. Plans to establish another two frontline units within the U.K.’s Typhoon Force date back to the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) of 2015, when it was declared that these would utilize the more basic Tranche 1 aircraft that offer only a limited capacity for upgrade . A member of the No IX (Bomber) Squadron groundcrew., CROWN COPYRIGHT In July 2018, the then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Steven Hillier, announced that No IX (Bomber) Squadron would be the first of the new Typhoon Tranche 1 units to be established. Accordingly, No IX (B) Squadron was disbanded as a Tornado GR4 operator at RAF Marham, Norfolk, on March 31, 2019, before being immediately re-formed at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland. Once at “Lossie,” the unit became the Scottish base’s fourth quick reaction alert (QRA) unit, a task that will continue alongside its new aggressor role. Prior to No IX (B)’s arrival, the base was already home to No 1 (Fighter), II (Army Co-operation), and 6 Squadrons, all flying the Typhoon in a frontline capacity. A No IX (B) Squadron Tornado GR4 training for deployment to Afghanistan., CROWN COPYRIGHT The SDSR-sanctioned growth of the RAF Typhoon Force by two units (No 12 Squadron is the other and is also a former Tornado GR4 operator) providing the United Kingdom with the seven Typhoon squadrons originally planned. However, both the new units have important second-line roles that mean they can’t be fully committed to frontline duties. While No IX (B) will provide a Red Air capability at Lossiemouth, No 12 is currently a joint British-Qatari unit at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, where it’s training personnel for the Qatar Emiri Air Force’s forthcoming Typhoon fleet. At one time, it was expected that the RAF’s 24 single-seat Tranche 1 Typhoons would be retired early, with the force concentrating its resources on the truly multi-role capable Tranche 2 and 3 jets. However, the Tranche 1 aircraft is judged to be still capable of air defense and specialist aggressor work. These older jets will now be retained until around 2030. The Tranche 1 two-seaters have been less fortunate, however, having been withdrawn and broken down as spares sources in a process known as Reduce-To-Produce (RTP). For most student pilots, the path to the cockpit of a frontline Typhoon is now achieved without the use of a two-seat version of the fighter. Meanwhile, under Project Centurion , 67 Tranche 2 and 40 Tranche 3 Typhoons are undergoing the Phase 2 Enhancement (P2E) upgrade that adds MBDA’s Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) and Storm Shadow conventionally armed cruise missile, while the follow-on P3E update added the MBDA Brimstone air-to-ground missile, providing a low-collateral, high-precision strike capability that would otherwise have been lost with the retirement of the Tornado GR4. Tempest, Lightning, Typhoon, and Tornado represent RAF combat air, past, present, and future. The Typhoon, second from right, displays the Project Centurion weapons options., CROWN COPYRIGHT The Typhoon Force units flying from RAF Lossiemouth are responsible for QRA coverage of the northern part of the United Kingdom and also have an increasingly important role providing defensive cover for the RAF’s new P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, nine of which are being acquired, and which will eventually operate from the same base. Between them, the Typhoon and Poseidon are expected to provide a defensive shield for the United Kingdom’s submarine-based nuclear deterrent and two new Queen Elizabeth -class aircraft carriers . For QRA work, two Typhoons are held at high readiness around the clock, ready to scramble to meet any unidentified aircraft approaching from the north, over the North Atlantic and the North Sea. Further jets are kept at a lower state of readiness, available to respond to any potential escalation. Typhoons from RAF Lossiemouth intercept two Russian Tu-160 Blackjack bombers and escort them while in the UK area of interest, September 2018., CROWN COPYRIGHT Although the RAF’s own website declares that No IX (B) Squadron is “at the heart of the UK’s Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Force, ready to take off within minutes of an alert being triggered,” Air Commodore Mark Chappell, the Typhoon Force commander has confirmed that the unit’s main role will be adversary support. In this way, No IX (B) Squadron might be expected to switch to QRA duties when sister squadrons are deployed overseas, for example on Operation Shader in the Middle East, or contributing to the Baltic Air Policing mission. Tranche 1 jets will likely fly all the adversary work, while the unit’s pilots will strap into fully upgraded Tranche 2/3 jets for QRA duty. One of No IX (B) Squadron’s Typhoon FGR4s in the standard color scheme., CROWN COPYRIGHT Currently, Lossiemouth’s Typhoons and Poseidons have been temporarily relocated, while work continues to resurface the airfield’s runways. The maritime patrollers and Typhoon training have moved to nearby Kinloss Barracks, while the Typhoon QRA facility is at Leuchars, another Scottish air base. Work at Lossiemouth is expected to be completed between November 2020 and spring 2021. “Customers” for the new RAF Red Air unit are likely to be found chiefly among the growing force of F-35B Lightnings at RAF Marham, Norfolk, and across the rest of the Typhoon Force at Lossiemouth and Coningsby. Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, is likely to make use of the aggressor Typhoons too, perhaps also during multinational exercises, such as the Point Blank series. An F-35B Lightning at RAF Waddington. Typhoon aggressors will play an important role in providing high-end air-to-air training for these jets., CROWN COPYRIGHT The Typhoon’s Red Air role will also extend to support of land and maritime forces training, which will likely make good use of the jet’s Defensive Aids Sub-System (DASS). High-end aggressor and readiness training of this kind is in particular demand in the United Kingdom after it shelved its ambitious Air Support to Defence Operational Training ( ASDOT ) project in early 2019. This was intended to fulfill a whole range of U.K. military training requirements, from air-to-air adversary to airspace battle management and live gunnery. Teams led by Babcock Aerospace, Cobham Aviation Services, Leonardo (partnered with Top Aces and Inzpire), and Thales UK were all pitching to provide contractor-owned and operated (COCO) aircraft. In the end, it became impossible to match the roughly £1.5-billion cost with the demands of the 10-year contract, and it was quietly scrapped. The recent expansion of private firms into the aerial adversary realm has been impressive, especially in the United States . In the United Kingdom, by contrast, hopes of rapidly introducing a high-end contractor-provided Red Air have fallen flat. But with a dedicated Typhoon aggressor unit taking shape, the RAF has a Red Air platform to rival any other in terms of performance and capability. In fact, the Typhoon will probably be the most advanced aggressor anywhere — at least until the F-35 takes on the role .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 10, 2021","MQ-9 Reaper, Howitzer, Rocket Toting F-16 All Shoot Down Mock Cruise Missiles In Huge Test","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone used an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile to shoot down a target drone simulating a cruise missile during a recent demonstration of the service’s still-in-development Advanced Battle Management System command and control network. A manned F-16 Viper fighter jet also destroyed another mock cruise missile with a laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II rocket. It was the second test of this weapon in this role and the first to occur over land. This follows reports that a U.S. Army XM1299 155mm self-propelled howitzer blasted yet another surrogate cruise missile out of the sky using a Hyper Velocity Projectile during this same large scale experiment. The Air Force has been steadily providing new details about the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) Onramp #2 event , which ran from Aug. 31, 2020, until Sept. 3, and involved various demonstrations in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as training ranges adjacent to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A combined operations center and intelligence fusion cell at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland also support the experiments. The public affairs office at Creech Air Force Base revealed the new information about the cruise missile defense components of the experiment on Sept. 9. “This truly was a combined effort to make this demonstration a success,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Michael Chmielewski, the commander of the 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron, said in a statement. “While early in development, this successful test opens the door to further explore integration opportunities the aircraft and cockpits could provide to JADC2 [ Joint All-Domain Command & Control ], as well as counterair capabilities and roles beyond the typical counter-terrorism role assumed by the MQ-9.” The 556th was the unit that flew the MQ-9 when it fired AIM-9X, reportedly an advanced Block II variant which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , at the BQM-167 Skeeter target drone during the demonstration. The 26th Weapons Squadron and unspecified industry partners, likely including Sidewinder manufacturer Raytheon, were also instrumental in the successful shootdown, according to the Air Force. The MQ-9 from the 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron armed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder during the ABMS Onramp #2 event., USAF This is only the second time an MQ-9 has fired an AIM-9X at an aerial target. The first launch was during another successful test of the drone’s ability to engage other aerial threats with the Sidewinder in 2018. The Air Force had previously armed at least some MQ-1 Predators, the Reaper’s now-retired predecessor, with air-to-air versions of the Stinger missile for self-defense as early as 2003, which you can read about more here . It’s also interesting to note that the Air Force is looking to stop buying MQ-9s and pursue a replacement for its Reapers that would be more survivable in a higher-end conflict. The cruise missile defense mission could potentially breath additional life into these drones. The recent ABMS event also reportedly included the employment of ground-launched AIM-9X, but details remain limited about that portion of the experiment. The U.S. Army has been testing a number of ground-based short-range air defense systems in recent years that could potentially have been the one to fire the Sidewinder. The AIM-9X Block II features a two-way data-link and added range, as well as high-off boresight targeting and lock-on-after-launch capabilities. Together with thurst vectoring and an advanced imaging infrared sensor, the weapon is more agile and accurate that any previous Sidewinder variant. The weapon’s increased range and adaptive flight profiles makes it easier for them to engage more diverse threats, such as cruise missiles. A 2016 US Navy briefing slide showing various advanced methods of employing the AIM-9X Block II, including against cruise missiles., USN The F-16 from the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron also brought down a BQM-167 with its Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS) rocket, also known as the AGR-20A, the first such test over land during ABMS Onramp #2. The Air Force first demonstrated the ability of this weapon to be employed as a low-cost anti-cruise missile interceptor in December 2019 during a test off the coast of Florida, seen in the video below. Using the APKWS II as an air-to-air weapon opens up a host of possibilities for Air Force combat jets, including shooting down cruise missiles, as well as small unmanned aircraft. Being a fraction of the cost of other air-to-air weapons, including the AIM-9X and the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), as well as fired from a pod capable of holding multiple rockets, APKWS II could offer a cheaper means of engaging these threats, as well as greater magazine depth to do so. The Air National Guard is also in the process of upgrading its F-16C/Ds with AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radars , an active electrically-scanned array type, that will greatly improve their ability to spot and track threats, even smaller ones, with greater precision at longer ranges. This could make them particularly effective platforms for detecting and engaging cruise missiles, including the AGR-20A. Cruise missile defense was a major component of the ABMS Onramp #2 experiments beyond these air-to-air engagements. A U.S. Army XM1299 howitzer notably brought down yet another BQM-167 from the ground with a Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP). The HVP, originally designed to be fired out of the electromagnetic railguns the U.S. Navy and Army have been testing , is now being adapted for use in conventional guns, including 155mm howitzers and five-inch naval guns . A five-inch naval gun on a ground-based test fixture was also present at the recent ABMS test, as was a modified 175mm M107 self-propelled gun that the Army uses for test purposes. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0QqomuuAeQ4 The HVP was originally designed as a kinetic projectile with no explosive warhead that would destroy its target by crashing into it. However, the versions that have been in development for conventional guns are said to have a high-explosive payload that could make it easier to engage a flying target, such a cruise missile. Railguns were supposed to propel the HVP up to hypersonic speeds, Mach 5 or greater. Conventional guns cannot accelerate projectiles to the same speed, but the goal has been to find ways to get them up to at high supersonic velocities around Mach 3. From top to bottom, mockups of HVPs loaded into discarding sabots to fit inside five-inch naval guns, 155mm howitzers, and electromagnetic railguns., Joseph Trevithick A briefing slide showing additional detail about the variants of the HVP for use in different guns, including versions with high explosive payloads., USN This is fast enough to make it feasible for surface-based guns to engage fast-moving aerial threats, even smaller ones, such as cruise missiles. The goal for HVP has always been for it to be a multi-purpose weapon able to engage targets on land, at sea, and in the air. A graphic showing the many potential uses for the HVP, including cruise missile defense., USN “Just for the record, [a] tank shooting down cruise missiles. That’s just awesome,” Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said , referring to the self-propelled howitzer bringing down the drone during the ABMS Onramp #2 event. “That’s video games, sci-fi awesome. You’re not supposed to be able to shoot down a cruise missile with a tank. But, yes, you can, if the bullet is smart enough, and the bullet we use for that system is exceptionally smart.” It is important to note that all of the cruise missile defense capabilities demonstrated during the recent ABMS event are still very much in the experimental stage. It’s likely there is still much work to be done before the U.S. military would ever employ them in an actual operational context. However, the ever-growing threat of enemy cruise missiles, both to friendly forces on land and at sea, has been a major concern for the U.S. military as a whole for some time now. The Pentagon’s latest Missile Defense Review , which came out in 2019, added an entirely new emphasis on the need for additional defenses to protect against these weapons. The previous Missile Defense Review, which was published in 2010, focused entirely on ballistic missile defense. This notably drove the U.S. Army’s decision to purchase Israel’s Iron Dome as an interim cruise missile defense system, an initiative the service brought to an end earlier this year over concerns about integrating it with its own new integrated air defense network. There were also questions about whether the system, which is designed to shoot down lower-tier threats, such as incoming artillery rockets and shells and mortar bombs, could reliably engage cruise missiles. An Israeli Iron Dome system fires one its Tamir interceptors., AP Photo/Dan Balilt The Air Force sees the ABMS network as the glue that will hold all of these other cruise missile defense capabilities, as well as a host of others, together. The idea is to develop an overarching network infrastructure that will allow for the rapid exchange of all kinds of information between various platforms in the air, on land, and at sea, and in space , including high-quality targeting information. The service often talks about ABMS as a way to ensure the right sensors are linked to the right shooters whenever they need to be. ABMS could well find itself tied into other similarly broad networking initiatives that the Navy and the Army have been working on, especially the former’s Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Navy Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) architectures. The ABMS events already follow a host of other networking experiments and demonstrations across the U.S. military in recent years. The next ABMS experiment is presently expected to occur early next year. It will be exciting to see what new “firsts” might come out of that event.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 5, 2020",Major New Fire Is Burning In Beirut’s Devastated Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A serious fire has been raging in Lebanon’s Port of Beirut, which was decimated by a deadly explosion last month, for more than three hours now. Lebanese authorities said a warehouse full of tires and oil caught fire, producing a massive tower of thick black smoke, but say the risk of a new blast is low. There have still been reports of panic as residents sought cover fearing another major catastrophe. The Lebanese Army was among the first to issue a formal statement about the blaze on Sept. 10, 2020, and its causes. It added that helicopters were being brought in to assist firefighters on the ground. So far, there have been no reports of casualties. However, videos and photos of the blaze had begun to emerge well before any official statements. With little official information about what was going on initially and no formal guidance about evacuating or otherwise keeping clear of the area, some of the clips showed some panicked residents leaving the city in their cars. There were other reports of people hiding under tables or in the center of their houses, as well as opening windows to reduce the chance of flying glass. The massive blast that devastated the port on Aug. 4 had shattered windows well away from ground zero, causing many injuries. That explosion killed at least 190 people, injured more than 6,500, and left thousands homeless. Lebanon is still very early in the process of recovering from that disaster. “We opened all windows and are in the corridor right now,” Dana Awad, a mother of two girls in a Beirut neighborhood told the Associated Press . “I am still feeling the earth shake. Living a flashback.” Officials eventually called on people to avoid roads leading to and from the port to allow quicker access for firefighters’ vehicles. In all, around 100 personnel are involved in the effort to bring the fire under control, including teams from the fire department, civil defense, and military. Today’s blaze is not the first to hit the port in recent days. A smaller fire on September 7 was quickly extinguished. Michel el-Murr, head of a fire rescue team on site, told The Independent newspaper they believed this new fire was begun by workers using an electric saw to cut through metal debris in the port during the clean-up operation after this earlier disaster. Port director Bassem al-Qaisi later clarified to Voice of Lebanon radio that the fire started in a warehouse containing barrels of cooking oil before spreading to an area to store tires. Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper reported that Beirut police spokesman Colonel Joseph Msalam said his officers had no information about what was happening at the port, with the army maintaining control over the facility. Admitting he did not know what caused the fire, Msalam added: “It could be containers. I really don’t know what is there.” This all has shades of the events leading up to the August explosion, which Lebanese authorities said was the result of the detonation of around 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate – widely used as an agricultural fertilizer – following another warehouse fire. The ammonium nitrate had been sitting in unsecured storage at the port for six years after being seized by customs officials. In the days after that explosion, chemical experts assessing the damage identified more than 20 other containers filled with dangerous chemicals. These were then moved to safer locations away from the port. Earlier this month, however, the Lebanese Army said it had uncovered more than four more tons of ammonium nitrate stored in four separate containers near the port. “We still do not know exactly what is inside the warehouse which is on fire, we cannot rule out explosive materials — but we think it is unlikely,” el-Murr said. Hopefully, firefighters will be able to get this new fire under control quickly and without further incident. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 6, 2020",New F-16s Will All Be Sold In A Single Base Model Configuration With A Standardized Price,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin says that it plans to “commoditize” its F-16 Viper fighter jet line by offering jets in a single standardized configuration, based on the latest Block 70/72 variant, with a standard base price tag. The goal here is to streamline things for both the manufacturer and potential customers, especially foreign buyers, and it follows a massive U.S. Air Force-managed contract for the production of Vipers for export over the next decade. FlightGlobal was first to report on Lockheed Martin’s new plans for its F-16 product line on Sept. 4, 2020. The Air Force had awarded the company an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, valued at up to $62 billion over 10 years, to build at least 90 Block 70/72 Vipers – 66 for Taiwan and 24 for Morocco – for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers on Aug. 12, 2020. “The development of the pricing, and the back and forth with the country on the pricing, and then the actual pricing when we deliver it to them in the form of an offer and acceptance letter, that takes a very long time,” J.R. McDonald, the Vice President of Business Development for Lockheed Martin’s Integrated Fighter Group, told FlightGlobal . “And, it takes a lot of money to develop those individual contracts for each individual country.” “It’s a way to streamline contracting, make the pricing as transparent as possible in an [Foreign Military Sales] environment,” he continued, referring to the new plane for a standardized base F-16. “Everybody knows what the baseline is.” An artist’s conception of a Block 70/72 F-16 Viper., Lockheed Martin The new standard Viper configuration will have a default set of “avionics, mission systems, an active electronically scanned array [AESA] radar, electronic warfare suite, Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System and an engine,” according to FlightGlobal , though it is not clear what those specific systems will be. Lockheed Martin has already been pushing toward standardizing the Viper line with its Block 70/72 F-16s and the related F-16V upgrade package that brings older jets up to a similar configuration. These versions, outgrowths of the F-16IN Super Viper variant developed for India, all feature the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), an AESA type from Northrop Grumman that you can read about in more detail in this recent War Zone piece , as well as other common avionics and other mission systems. Lockheed Martin presently offers Block 70 F-16s with General Electric F110 engines and Block 72 variants with Pratt & Whitney F100s. A page from a Lockheed Martin brochure from 2016 regarding its pitch at the time to sell Block 70 F-16C/D Vipers to that country that specifically mentions that configuration becoming the new baseline variant., Lockheed Martin Another slide from the same brochure highlighting some of the mission systems found on Block 70 Vipers, including the AN/APG-83 AESA radar., Lockheed Martin McDonald told FlightGlobal that the baseline configuration will have the lowest price point, but did not say what that might be. Like when one buys a car, Lockheed Martin will continue to offer other features and functionality for customers who want specific capabilities and are willing to pay for them. However, these additions will be handled under separate contracts, effectively as modifications to base variant aircraft. The country-specific version of the Viper that Lockheed Martin is presently pitching to India, which it is marketing as the F-21, is a prime example of what the company could offer on top of the base variant. The F-21, compared to Block 70/72 types, has a completely different cockpit arrangement with a single large flat panel multi-function display, a probe-and-drogue refueling system that fits inside a modified conformal fuel tank, and an enlarged dorsal spine, seen on other F-16 variants, capable of holding various mission systems, among other features. You can read more about this advanced Viper in detail in this past War Zone piece . The U.S. Air Force’s System Program Office first proposed the idea of a standardized Viper to Lockheed Martin as a way to help simplify FMS cases by creating a universal price list that a potential customer could review, according to FlightGlobal . The company also said that it expects virtually all future F-16 sales to go through the U.S. government-managed FMS process via contracting vehicles such as the multi-billion dollar IDIQ deal it received in August. The F-21 pitch to India will remain an unrelated direct sale, no doubt in part due to the Indian government’s requirement for companies competing in the tender to supply 110 new fighter jets to the Indian Air Force to offer significant industrial cooperation packages as part of their offers. Beyond helping with the contracting process, a standardized F-16 would also help simplify production, supply chain management, and sustainment. Back in 2017, Lockheed Martin announced that it would move its Viper production line to South Carolina from Texas as part of a restructuring at the latter facility to focus more on building F-35 Joint Strike Fighters . The South Carolina site was smaller, but could also concentrate more on F-16 work, amid what appeared to be at the time dwindling demand for the older jets. Even after building more than 4,600 F-16s of all types, and with some 2,280 still in service worldwide, Lockheed Martin is optimistic that there will be more new Viper sales on the horizon. In addition to the Block 70/72 jets it is building for Taiwan and Morocco, it is also producing additional examples for Bahrain and Bulgaria . Indonesia, among other potential customers, has also considered new Vipers to meet its future fighter jet needs . “Those are in the end of service life and countries around the world are having to find themselves in a situation where they need to replace them,” McDonald told FlightGlobal , specifically referring to fleets of older Soviet-era combat jets, such as MiG-21s and MiG-23/27s , as well as early MiG-29s , that remain in service around the world. In addition, the outlet noted that some countries that still fly these and other Soviet-designed types have faced challenges in modernizing them or otherwise extending their service life due to U.S. sanctions on Russian aviation and defense companies. Operators of these jets, many of which are former Soviet republics, as well as other countries that have been in its sphere of influence during the Cold War, are a major potential market for U.S. firms looking to sell new advanced fourth-generation fighter jets. Many of them, including some that are now NATO members, are looking to modernize their fleets, but are very unlikely to be able to secure approval to buy the F-35 , opening the door for the F-16. All told, the F-16’s future already seems very bright still and Lockheed Martin’s new effort to simplify production and sales can only help keep the Viper front and center for countries looking for new fighter jets for the foreseeable future.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 4, 2020",China’s Secret Spacecraft Looks To Have Landed At This Remote Base With A Massive Runway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery that The War Zone has obtained from Planet Labs and other data suggest that China’s recently tested experimental reusable spacecraft may have touched down at a remote air base with a massive runway near the Lop Nor nuclear test site in the northwestern portion of the country this weekend. The object’s return to earth occurred after spending approximately two days in orbit. This strongly points to the secretive craft being a spaceplane of some kind that lands on a traditional runway. The U.S. government has also now cataloged two new as yet unidentified Chinese objects in space, which could be small satellites, that appear to be linked to this spacecraft’s brief trip. China launched the spacecraft, about which little is known, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center located in the Gobi Desert, also in the northwestern end of the country, on Sept. 4, 2020. You can read more about what kind of craft this might be and its potential uses might be in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting . Chinese authorities announced that whatever it was had returned to Earth on Sept. 6. Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported from Jiuquan that the spacecraft had returned as planned, but did not actually say where it had touched down. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, was among those that noticed the possible connection to the air base near Lop Nor, which has a runway more than 16,400 feet long, or over 3 miles in total length, making it one of the longest in the world. He said the available data indicated that the craft orbited along a path that eventually took it right over the site for its final orbit. A high-resolution satellite image of the base in question that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs dated Sept. 8, does not show anything that appears to be a spaceplane, but heavy equipment is visible at the northern end of the runway. These items are then missing from a subsequent image of the site. The mysterious massive runway near Lop Nor. , PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

There a number of large and small vehicles that are also visible, along with various structures that sit off the runway and taxiway.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Like NASA’s Space Shuttle or the U.S. Air Force’s X-37B, the latter of which you can read more about in these previous War Zone pieces , a similar Chinese spaceplane would likely sit on the runway for some time after it is recovered as it is serviced, its volatile fuels are removed, and it is readied to be towed to a safe spot for unloading and processing for transport. The American X-37B after landing. , USAF Given the official statement that the spacecraft landed at Jiuquan, it’s also possible that this base in the vicinity of Lop Nor was an alternate landing site in case of an emergency or some other issue such as weather. This is a common practice for space programs involving craft designed to return to Earth. For example, the NASA’s space shuttle program similarly identified and maintained dozens of potential airstrips that the orbiter could use, if necessary. Either way, this potential link between China’s experimental reusable spacecraft and this base further suggests China launched a spaceplane in the same vein as the secretive X-37B mini-space shuttle. This kind of aerospace vehicle would need a long traditional runway to land on and this airstrip would provide ample distance for an experimental design to safely come to a stop. The Air Force’s X-37B., USAF Images that emerged in 2007 of a possible prototype Chinese reusable spaceplane, known as Shenlong, underneath an H-6 bomber., Chinese Internet There was already other evidence pointing to the experimental spacecraft being a spaceplane design. This includes the unusually large payload fairing seen on top of the Long March 2F carrier rocket before launch, which also appears to have required modifications to the launch site. If China’s reusable space vehicle isn’t a spaceplane configuration, it is possible that a capsule-like reusable spacecraft could also have landed in the desert near the air base. Doing so would allow ground personnel to stage nearby and quickly make their way to the vehicle before securing it and taking it back for to airfield to prepare it for transport. Still, a reusable space shuttle-like craft would be ideal for rapidly deploying small satellites, and any other payloads, in space. It’s possible that China’s experimental design did just that on its recent brief orbital journey. On Sept. 6, Space-Track.org , an online space launch database that the U.S. military’s Combined Space Operations Center and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command maintain, added a new entry, labeled 2020-063G. At the time of writing, this object is still listed as “TBA,” or “to be assessed” and there is no date for when it appeared in orbit. The entry’s code links it to 2020-063, which is the base identifier for the Chinese experimental spacecraft launch. 2020-063A was the craft itself, while 2020-063B was the body of the Long March 2F space launch rocket. The U.S. military assessed objects 2020-063C through F to be debris from the launch. The entries in Space-Track.org’s database related to the Chinese experimental spacecraft launch at the time of writing., Space-Track.org It will be interesting to see if the U.S. military eventually updates this entry or otherwise speaks to it publicly. A number of small, highly maneuverable Russian “inspector” satellites have been observed in recent years deploying other, even smaller satellites . In July, Time published a piece on the U.S. military’s newest branch, Space Force, in which Chief of Space Operations General John “Jay” Raymond, that service’s top uniformed officer, publicly declared at least one of these events to have actually been a test of an on-orbit anti-satellite weapon. China’s experimental spacecraft launch and the appearance of this unknown additional object in space follow the release of a Pentagon report that highlights that the Chinese are pursuing similar capabilities. “The PLA [People’s Liberation Army] continues to acquire and develop a range of counterspace capabilities and related technologies, including kinetic-kill missiles, ground-based lasers, and orbiting space robots, as well as expanding space surveillance capabilities, which can monitor objects in space within their field of view and enable counterspace actions,” this review of Chinese military capabilities, which is produced by law annual for Congress, said. A US Defense Intelligence Agency graphic showing the various ways that one satellite might attack another in orbit., DIA “China has built an expansive ground support infrastructure to support its growing on-orbit fleet and related functions including spacecraft and space launch vehicle (SLV) manufacture, launch, C2, and data downlink,” it also said. “Additionally, the PRC [People’s Republic of China] continues to develop counterspace capabilities—including direct ascent , co-orbital, electronic warfare, and directed energy capabilities—that can contest or deny an adversary’s access to and operations in the space domain during a crisis or conflict.” These are very real threats that China, as well as Russia , among others , are developing, all, as noted with an eye toward neutralizing various space-based capabilities an opponent may have. Orbital space is a broad area where the United States has traditionally had a clear advantage and includes assets that support early-warning , intelligence collection , navigation and weapon guidance , communications, and more. U.S. forces have become highly dependent on these advantages. As such, potential adversaries see neutralizing them as a way to level the playingfield during a conflict while also throwing American forces off balance. Wherever this new Chinese spacecraft landed and whatever it is meant to do, authorities in that country have been extremely tight-lipped about it. Hopefully, now that it is back on Earth, more information about it and its potential uses will begin trickling out.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Trump Discloses Supposed Existence Of A Secret New Nuclear Weapon System To Bob Woodward,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump disclosed that the U.S. military has a potentially previously unknown secret nuclear weapon in an on-the-record interview with Washington Post associate editor and veteran journalist Bob Woodward for his new book. Other sources reportedly confirmed the existence of the weapon system in question, but offered no additional details about it. Woodward conducted 18 interviews between December 2019 and July 2020 with Trump for the book, titled Rage , which will begin shipping to the general public later this month. The Washington Post published various details from it, along with audio from Woodward’s conversations with the President, on Sept. 9, 2020. “I have built a nuclear – a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about,” Trump told Woodward. “We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. There’s nobody – what we have is incredible.” There are throngs of secret Defense Department programs ongoing at any given time. According to Steve Trimble, Defense Editor at Aviation Week, the DoD is planning on spending a whopping $71.4B on classified programs just next year. For comparison, that is nearly half the amount of the Air Force’s entire 2021 budget and does not include the intelligence community’s clandestine budget, either: Though Woodward’s sources said that Trump was speaking about a real system, and they were surprised he did so at all, they do not appear to have confirmed any specifics about it. These kinds of comments from Trump are not necessarily new. The President certainly has a known penchant for touting advanced American military and intelligence capabilities , including openly discussing sensitive topics , including in public . He has also talked up the strength of America’s nuclear arsenal , and the efforts under his administration to continue modernizing it , on a number of occasions . However, it is also known that Trump doesn’t always appear to have a firm grasp of the topics in question, leading him to make false pronouncements about certain weapon systems and their capabilities. Perhaps the best-known example of this is the case of the “ super-duper missile ,” which he referenced while speaking to reporters during an event at the White House in May 2020. He claimed this weapon was “17 times faster than what they have right now,” referring to comparative Russian and Chinese developments . It ultimately turned out to be a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that the U.S. Army and Navy are collaboratively developing that the Pentagon had previously publicly stated had an estimated peak speed of Mach 17. When it comes to nuclear weapons, and many of their delivery systems, these are some of the most secretive systems within the U.S. military’s arsenal, even if their existence is publicly known. Their exact capabilities generally remain undisclosed in order to prevent opponents from developing countermeasures that could limit the utility of America’s nuclear deterrents . As such, it is possible that Trump was talking about a still-secret nuclear weapon, about which little is known, but which has been publicly acknowledged. A prime candidate may be the still-nebulous W93 warhead , which, if the program proceeds, could eventually go on top of the Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The U.S. military has been coy about just how new or not the design of this weapon might be. The Navy also deployed the W76-2 warhead, a lower-yield variant of the W76 series, on some of its Tridents for the first time earlier this year. Work is also still ongoing on the nuclear-capable B-21 Raider stealth bomber, the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb , and the new Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the U.S. Air Force, as well. In August, that service also indicated that it might be interested in a nuclear-armed hypersonic weapon as a potential warhead for the GBSD in the future, as well. On the other hand, Trump could be referring to something far more exotic that does not exist currently in the public domain in any concrete manner. Russia has been actively pursuing so-called “super weapons,” some of which are of an exotic nature, including nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missiles and ultra-long-range torpedoes . It is possible that Trump let slip something along these same lines that is truly unique. It remains to be seen whether any new details about the weapon system Trump mentioned to Woodward will emerge now that the interview is public record, but someone is sure to press Trump further on it. We will keep you up to date with what he says and any other info that emerges about it.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today, many airlines are desperate to dispose of older aircraft equipment and Iran is no exception, but the types it wants to unload are old. Really, really old. A bid deposit of around $4,000 will secure your chance to buy any one of a dozen ex-Iran Air airliners — comprising examples of the Airbus A300 and A310 , as well as the Boeing 727 , 747 , and the rare 747SP. The full list of aircraft up for auction is as follows: Airbus A300B2-200  EP-IBT  c/n 185 Airbus A300B2-200  EP-IBV  c/n 187 Airbus A300B2-200  EP-IBZ  c/n 226 Airbus A310-200  EP-IBN  c/n 375 Airbus A310-200  EP-IBQ  c/n 389 Boeing 727-200  EP-IRR  c/n 20946 Boeing 727-200  EP-IRS  c/n 20947 Boeing 747-100  EP-IAM  c/n 21759 Boeing 747-200  EP-IAG  c/n 21217 Boeing 747SP  EP-IAA  c/n 20998 Boeing 747SP  EP-IAB  c/n 20999 Boeing 747SP  EP-IAD  c/n 21758 Of the Airbus types, the A300 is the European manufacturer’s first-generation widebody twin-jet, while the A310 is a shortened derivative, introduced in 1982. The U.S. equipment consists of the classic trijet 727, two of the earliest 747 variants — the 100 and 200 Series — and the short-bodied 747SP . Iran Air is selling some of her older civil airplanes. The list includes @Boeing 727, 747, 747-SP & @Airbus A300, A310. The 747 SPs are the most antique ones as only 45 were produced. The bid deposit is around $4,000. pic.twitter.com/StkGtObOFU — Mehdi H. (@mhmiranusa) September 8, 2020 Admittedly, these aircraft are all now very old — the trio of 747SPs being the most antiquated, the earliest having been first flown in 1976 — and it’s hard to see they could have much use as part of a viable commercial venture. Most of these aircraft were grounded some years ago and Iran Air is now giving them up entirely, on account of their age, reduced overall passenger numbers, as well as the significant difficulties the carrier faces in getting the spares required to fly them. Iran Air A300B2-200 EP-IBV at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport, Spain, in August 2011., CURIMEDIA/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS In all likelihood, the dozen jetliners are simply too old to be economically refurbished and returned to regular service. Stripping them down as a source of spare parts is a more viable option, or simply breaking them up for their scrap value. But beyond the question of what a customer is actually going to do with one or more of these veteran airliners, there’s the very real problem of U.S. sanctions, under which American companies are forbidden from dealing with Iran . Iran Air, specifically, is a sanctioned entity, according to the U.S. government. Even if a potential non-U.S. customer manages to get around these sanctions, there’s still no guarantee that these aircraft could be returned to flight. It’s not clear if Iran Air’s aircraft are sanctioned specifically themselves , but U.S.-based companies would be wary about dealing with them regardless. Foreign companies could be reluctant, as well, for fear of getting hit with secondary sanctions . It has been suggested that the airliners might have a useful scrap value, which could make them attractive to a breaker, but the United States is also likely to be watchful of exactly where any spare parts end up. “Iran Air also has a history of diverting spare aircraft parts intended for civil aviation to military-linked entities and for military purposes,” notes the Federal Register , the official journal of the U.S. federal government. Boeing 727-200 EP-IRR at Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, in May 2010., KHASHAYAR TALEBZADEH/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Bearing in mind these potential hurdles, it might be that another Iranian-based airline emerges as the most probable recipient of the aircraft, in which case they are most likely to serve as a spare parts source. Candidates could include Caspian Airlines (747-100/200), Iran Airtour (A300 and A310), Mahan Air (A300 and A310), Meraj Airlines (A300), Qeshm Air (A300), and Taban Air (A310). As for the 727 and 747SP, these have otherwise disappeared from Iranian service. If there’s no domestic airline interest, another potential taker for the 747s could be the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). In August, reports emerged of damage sustained to an IRIAF 747-200 during an engine test and it was suggested that an ex-Iran Air 747SP could serve as a donor providing replacement engines . The 747 provides the IRIAF with an important aerial refueling and long-range transport capability, including support of the Iranian contingent in Syria, and additional spares could be highly prized. According to figures provided by Flight International’s World Air Forces 2020 , the IRIAF operates seven transport-configured 747s and another three outfitted as air-to-air refueling tankers. An IRIAF Boeing 747 Cargo has been spotted in Belgrade, Serbia. I wonder what it was doing there… https://t.co/HgUHUlRHxA pic.twitter.com/uT0JpwxpPf — Aᴍɪʀ (@AmirIGM) May 27, 2020 Among the aircraft up for grabs, the Boeing 747SP is almost certainly the most interesting. While it retained the appearance of the 747, the SP (for Special Performance) was around 48 feet shorter, losing around 100 seats in the process. The resulting aircraft offered reduced fuel consumption and longer range, as well as improved performance across the flight envelope. Only 45 of these ‘mini Jumbos’ were ever built, examples serving with prominent operators including Korean Air Lines, Pan Am, QANTAS, and TWA. In its latter period of commercial service, Iran Air was the major operator, until it finally withdrew the type in 2016. The three 747SPs now being offered were retired in 2013 and 2014 . Ultimately, the 747SP found its niche as a VIP transport for governmental customers in the Middle East , while one other example, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy , or SOFIA, serves NASA as a laboratory carrying a 106-inch reflecting telescope. For Iran Air, the latest aircraft disposals reflect its aim of rationalizing its fleet, which is now dominated by Airbus twin-jet types, as well as a fleet of ATR 72-600 turboprops for regional connections. The last American equipment in the fleet is a pair of MD-82s and a single 747-200 used for cargo transport. On approach to London Heathrow Airport in May 2009, this is Boeing 747-100 EP-AIM., MIKE P/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS In recent years the airline has faced many hurdles, with sanctions preventing an overhaul of its aging fleet and reducing the availability of spares. At the same time, operations have been severely limited by a ban on its A320, 727, and 747 fleets from the European Union over safety concerns. The 2015 nuclear deal saw sanctions relaxed and provided the impetus for Iran Air to place orders with the ‘big two’ commercial manufacturers. Tehran had ordered for 80 Boeing jetliners valued at around $16.6 billion, plus 118 Airbus aircraft worth around $25 billion. Additional regional aircraft orders were placed with ATR and Bombardier. However, the related contracts were suspended after President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal in 2018 and to impose a new round of sanctions. In the meantime, just three of the Airbus aircraft and a few ATR turboprops had been delivered to Iran. It’s just possible that a buyer might see the potential in these aircraft and snap them up — providing it’s not deterred by the sanctions. In the meantime, these decrepit airliners serve as an unfortunate symbol for the parlous state of Iran’s flag-carrier airline. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",Video Reportedly Shows Russian Pilot On The Ground In Libya After Ejecting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video that recently appeared on social media purportedly shows a Russian-speaking pilot after their aircraft went down in Libya who is about to be picked up by an Mi-24 Hind gunship helicopter . The clip shows a white-and-orange parachute on the ground, along with other equipment, including a helmet often worn by pilots of Soviet-era and more modern Russian combat jets, suggesting that they bailed out of just such an aircraft. This comes months after the U.S. military first said that Russian pilots were flying MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters and Su-24 Fencer combat jets in support of rogue Libyan general Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army. In the two-minute video, which is undated, but appears to have first emerged online on Sept. 7, 2020, the pilot filming speaks Russian as he pans across the deployed parachute, flying helmet, a radio beacon with antenna, and other items arranged on the ground in a rock-strewn desert landscape. He mentions that he ejected from his aircraft. There is then a break in the video before filming resumes to reveal an approaching Hind helicopter, which may be arriving to retrieve him. There is no visible wreckage to give any clues as to the type of aircraft the pilot was flying, however, and they do not say whether they were shot down or experienced some kind of in-flight emergency that forced them to eject. There is also the possibility that this footage could be from some sort of combat search and rescue exercise. The face of the pilot, who is seen in a seated position on the ground at the end of the video, is obscured. There are no obvious landmarks in the desolate landscape to readily identify where the video was shot. The Hind does not appear to have any clear markings, but does have the same camouflage scheme as examples that the Libyan National Army (LNA) operates. The Hind helicopter seen in the video of the Russian-speaking pilot on the ground purportedly after their aircraft crashed Libya., YouTube capture The video below shows a captured LNA Hind helicopter in Libya with a similar camouflage scheme. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fF9y-EvEU0 The Mi-24 is an attack helicopter, but also features a unique passenger compartment in the central fuselage. This makes it particularly well suited to combat search and rescue missions, among others. As already noted, the helmet, which has five visible ports on top, is commonly used by pilots flying various Soviet-era combat jets, as well as newer Russian-made designs. This, combined with the pilot, in this case, saying they ejected from their aircraft, strongly points to them having been flying a combat jet of some kind prior to bailing out. The helmet with the five ports on top seen in the video purportedly from Libya., YouTube capture A Russian pilot in Syria wearing the same style of helmet, but with a bracket to hold a mount for night vision goggles installed on the front, climbs into an Su-35 Flanker combat jet., AP Russian President Vladimir Putin seen wearing one of these helmets, but in blue, while seated in a two-seat Su-27 Flanker fighter jet., TASS However, it is known Haftar’s LNA received at least 14 Russian-made combat jets, a mix of MiG-29s and Su-24s, earlier this year. The Su-24 is a two-seat aircraft, while the MiG-29 is a single-seat fighter. As such, that there is only one pilot in this footage reportedly from Libya could point to the loss of a Fulcrum. A satellite image that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs showing Su-24 combat jets at Al Jufrah Air Base in central Libya in July., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Annotated satellite imagery that U.S. Africa Command released showing two MiG-29s at Al Jufra in May 2020. , AFRICOM The U.S. military has also said that Russian mercenaries affiliated with a private military company called Wagner , and even possibly actual members of the Russian military, have been flying these aircraft on behalf of the LNA. Wagner has at the very least extremely strong ties to Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, which is more commonly referred to by the Russian acronym GRU. “USAFRICOM [U.S. Africa Command] estimated that Russian support to the LNA this quarter included approximately 3,000 Wagner Group mercenaries and approximately 2,000 Syrian mercenaries sponsored by Russia,” a recent Department of Defense Inspector General report , covering various military activities in Africa between April and June 2020, said. “USAFRICOM stated in the press release that ‘there is concern that these Russian aircraft are being flown by inexperienced, non-state [Wagner Group] mercenaries who will not adhere to international law; namely, they are not bound by the traditional laws of armed conflict.'” The LNA, which receives support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as Russia , among others, is presently locked in a civil conflict in Libya with the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). Turkey is presently the GNA’s primary benefactor . A map showing approximate areas of control in Libya as of June 2020., DOD Though there is no evidence of a shootdown from this recent video, both sides have reportedly been deploying an increasing number of air defense assets across the country as the air war has heated up, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . It’s certainly possible for a MiG-29 to be brought down by even fairly unsophisticated air defense systems, especially when operating at low altitudes and if the pilots a relatively inexperienced. Another annotated satellite image AFRICOM released showing a Russian Il-76 Candid transport aircraft at Al Khadim Air Base in eastern Libya in July 2020. Su-24 combat jets and Pantsir-S1 air defense systems, both said to be operated by Wagner (written here as Vagner) mercenaries, are also highlighted. , AFRICOM The Fulcrums in Libya appear to be first-generation variants – the original 9.12 Fulcrum-A and the ‘hump-backed’ 9.13 Fulcrum-C – which are not typically provided with sophisticated self-protection systems . In April, the GNA claimed the destruction of two Chinese-made Wing Loong drones and a Mi-24 Hind helicopter, using ground-based air defenses. Should the latest footage of the ‘downed’ pilot be proven credible, it will be interesting to see how Moscow responds. When photos emerged of the MiG-29s at Khmeimim, Russian officials said they were former Russian MiG-29s that were to be handed over to the Syrian Air Force. While Syria could certainly make good use of additional, albeit second-hand equipment, to boost its worn-out fleet , there’s no evidence that the anonymous-looking MiG-29s stayed in the country. The Kremlin has also publicly denied sending any combat jets of any kind to Libya, despite the available evidence to the contrary. In the past, in Syria, the Russian government has also denied any ties to Russian private military contractors fighting alongside forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, even after major skirmishes with American troops in that country. The LNA is not the only one to be employing foreign mercenaries, either, with Turkey having also facilitated the deployment of thousands of militants from Syria to fight on the side of the GNA this year. The GNA has also employed foreign mercenaries to fly its own combat jets in the past, including at least one American , who was also a U.S. Air Force veteran, though not a former pilot. All told, it seems unlikely that the Kremlin will feel any pressure to acknowledge a link to this Russian-speaking pilot and the reported loss of their aircraft in Libya. However, if independently confirmed, it would only provide more evidence of Russia’s increasing involvement in the Libya conflict.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 9, 2020",India Claims To Have Successfully Tested A Hypersonic Scramjet Powered Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to India, they have joined the hypersonic club with a successful first flight-test this morning of its indigenous Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle. A product of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the vehicle supposedly utilizes air-breathing scramjet technology to propel it to hypersonic speeds. Eventually, it’s hoped that the technology demonstrator will inform the development of future hypersonic cruise missiles. The hypersonic cruise vehicle was launched at 1103 hours on September 7, 2020, from the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Launch Complex at Wheeler Island, off the coast of Odisha, in eastern India. A scramjet typically only functions properly at high speeds, requiring some kind of booster, generally a rocket motor, to accelerate it to operating velocity. Then, the scramjet — an airbreathing jet in which the airflow is supersonic throughout the entire engine — kicks in. Hypersonic speeds are normally defined as Mach 5 or above. The Agni-I carrying the HSTDV lifts off from the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Launch Complex at Wheeler Island., DRDO The Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV) was launched atop an Agni-I rocket — based on a short-range ballistic missile — which took it to an altitude of 18.6 miles and hypersonic velocity, according to a statement from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). At this point, the aerodynamic heat shields fell away and the cruise vehicle separated from the launch vehicle. The air intake for the scramjet deployed and the vehicle continued to fly for more than 20 seconds at a speed of around Mach 6. The scramjet engine was powered by kerosene fuel. Computer-generated concept art of the HSTDV cruise vehicle., DRDO “The critical events like fuel injection and auto ignition of scramjet demonstrated technological maturity,” the DRDO announced. “The scramjet engine performed in a textbook manner.” The entire test was monitored by telemetry stations, electro-optical systems, and tracking radars — including a research vessel in the Bay of Bengal. The latest demonstration proved a number of key technologies that will now inform further hypersonic developments, including the aerodynamic configuration of the cruise vehicle, separation mechanism, scramjet ignition, and sustained combustion in the hypersonic realm. On Twitter, the DRDO celebrated the achievement, describing the test as “a giant leap in indigenous defense technologies.” The organization also noted that the mission “demonstrated capabilities for highly complex technology that will serve as the building block for NextGen Hypersonic vehicles.” DRDO with this mission, has demonstrated capabilities for highly complex technology that will serve as the building block for NextGen Hypersonic vehicles in partnership with industry. — DRDO (@DRDO_India) September 7, 2020 According to local media, the HSTDV will pave the way toward a practical weapon in the next five years. Other nations to have tested the technology required for a hypersonic cruise missile are the United States, China, and Russia. A first test by the DRDO in June 2019 had been less successful. On that occasion, the Agni-I rocket reportedly failed to achieve the required altitude from Wheeler Island, apparently due to weight issues, although few details were provided. There’s currently plenty of activity in the field of hypersonic missiles, as leading military nations seek a way of penetrating increasingly sophisticated enemy air defenses. Flying at tremendous speed and using an atmospheric flight profile, hypersonic weapons, in general, are a challenge to spot, track, and intercept. An Edwards Air Force Base test B-52H Stratofortress carrying two AGM-183A ARRWs for a captive-carry test flight., AIR FORCE PHOTO BY MATT WILLIAMS Not all hypersonic missiles are powered, however, with some like the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon , or ARRW, utilizing an unpowered boost-glide vehicle. A scramjet powerplant, on the other hand, offers the opportunity for sustained cruise and a more dynamic flight profile, making it potentially harder still to intercept and more flexible to employ. An artist’s concept of a HAWC follow-on weapon intended for the U.S. Navy., JOSEPH TREVITHICK In the United States, under the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept program, or HAWC, Northrop Grumman has teamed up with Raytheon to work on a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile, which is competing against a rival design from Lockheed Martin. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the HAWC program in 2014, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and recently announced the first captive-carry flight tests of prototype missiles from both design teams. It appears test flights are now imminent. Yet another U.S. scramjet effort involves the Air Force’s Mayhem program . This seems geared toward examining the more advanced end of powered hypersonic development, with the aim of fielding an expendable air vehicle to test exotic turbine-based combined cycle engines. This type of powerplant combines a ramjet or scramjet with a conventional jet turbine, meaning it can operate at lower speeds too. The U.S. Air Force’s Mayhem program is expected to examine turbine-based combined cycle designs, a type of engine that could power future hypersonic aircraft, such as Lockheed Martin’s in-development SR-72 ., LOCKHEED MARTIN The Indian HSDTV, however, is probably closer in concept to the scramjet-powered X-43A hypersonic test vehicle developed for NASA, being a technology demonstrator rather than a prototype for a true weapon system. To date, the X-43A remains the fastest jet-powered air vehicle, achieving a speed of Mach 9.6 in a 2004 flight test. Unlike the HSDTV, the X-43A, together with its booster stage, was air-launched, from under the wing of a NASA NB-52 test aircraft. In the United States, the X-43A was followed by Boeing’s experimental X-51A Waverider , another scramjet-powered design. The ‘waverider’ concept involves the vehicle ‘skipping’ on top of the shockwaves produced during high-speed flight to produce additional lift. This same concept is now being used in the Northrop Grumman/Raytheon design for HAWC. The Boeing X-51A Waverider., U.S. AIR FORCE While the X-43A and X-51A were carried aloft by a B-52 before being accelerated by a booster motor, previous U.S. hypersonic tests , like DARPA’s Project Falcon , have relied on rockets with a ballistic trajectory to get the test vehicle up to the required speed. It’s no surprise, therefore, that India took this approach with its HSDTV. Alongside the HSTDV, India is also continuing to work with Russia on the scramjet-powered Brahmos-2 hypersonic cruise missile, with a preliminary agreement signed back in 2012 and involving both the DRDO and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyenia. It’s unclear how the two programs are related, if at all, but plans call for the Brahmos-2 to be made available in versions launched from land, sea, and aircraft platforms. The Brahmos-2 may also leverage technology from the NPO Mashinostroyenia 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile , for which there are plans to arm a range of Russian Navy warships and submarines. As it embarks on a new realm of hypersonic weapons development, India no doubt also has one eye on its regional rival China, which is already making rapid progress in this area . With a hypersonic renaissance already well underway in the United States, and with similar programs known to be active in China and Russia too, India’s latest ‘successful’ hypersonic test couldn’t be more timely.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 21, 2020",Austria Wants To Offload Its Unwanted Eurofighter Typhoons On Indonesia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Eurofighter Typhoon may be heading toward an undignified exit from Austrian service after the Central European country’s defense minister confirmed that she planned to begin talks to sell the jets to Indonesia. A report in the Austrian newspaper Krone yesterday, September 6, 2020, stated that Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner of the Austrian People’s Party had officially confirmed Indonesia’s interest in buying the 15 Typhoons and that she plans to enter “concrete sales negotiations” with her counterpart in Jakarta, Prabowo Subianto. According to the same source, the Austrian General Staff is meanwhile looking at how the deal — which, as it stands, would leave the Austrian Air Force (Luftstreitkräfte) without any fighter jets — could be sealed. Indonesian interest in the 15 jets was confirmed in July 2020, when a letter sent to Tanner by Subianto was published in the Austrian press , requesting talks over the Typhoon purchase, “to achieve my target of modernizing the Indonesian Air Force.” That neutral Austria — which is not a NATO member — wants to offload its Typhoons is no secret. Vienna controversially selected the Typhoon over the Saab JAS 39C/D Gripen in 2002 and finished paying off the €2-billion purchase costs for the 15 single-seat jets in 2014. The Swedish fighter had been judged more expensive than the Typhoon, but since then the defense ministry has called into question the jet’s operating costs and lack of certain critical capabilities — including the PIRATE infrared sensor , a helmet-mounted display , and the EuroDASS self-defense suite. At the same time, the Austrian jets have no beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile and lack any air-to-ground capability. Two Austrian Eurofighters join a Lufthansa Airbus A380 in formation overhead Austria in 2011., BUNDESHEER/MARKUS ZINNER Back in July 2017 the then Austrian Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil outlined plans to phase out the Typhoons by 2023. At this time it was envisaged they would be replaced by 18 new fighters, which would also supersede the country’s veteran Saab 105 jet trainers , which also have a limited air policing role. “It was necessary to stop the overflowing costs of the Eurofighter which does not have the full capabilities needed for our sovereign air surveillance ,” said Doskozil, before declaring that “the Eurofighter in Austrian service is history!” Doskozil argued that retiring the Eurofighter would be up to €2 billion cheaper than upgrading them, based on expenditure up to 2049. However, the October 2017 parliamentary elections in Austria saw Doskozil’s Social Democratic Party lose its majority to the Austrian People’s Party and, for the time being, the question over the Typhoon’s future was postponed. The Austrian Typhoon deal has always been fraught with difficulties. The original 2003 contract was renegotiated in 2007, cutting the number of airframes from 18 to 15 and exchanging the more advanced Tranche 2 jets for the baseline Tranche 1 standard with its more limited capabilities. Furthermore, six of these jets would be supplied as second-hand airframes from the German Luftwaffe . The equipment fit was ultimately reduced to the most basic standard, since it was argued the Typhoons would only be needed for peacetime air policing over neutral airspace. In the background of these latest machinations is the high-level lawsuit filed in February 2017 by the Austrian Defense Ministry against Airbus and Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH — the companies now responsible for fulfilling the Austrian Typhoon deal. The claim alleged “willful deception and fraud from 2002 up to 2007 in delivering the final product to Austria.” In particular, the ministry alleged that they had been misled about costs, industrial offsets, deliverability, and the jets’ equipment standard. The investigation was brought to a close by a Viennese court in April 2020, and the accusations dismissed, but a wider criminal investigation of suspected bribery in the same deal continues. Now, current Defense Minister Tanner has once again declared that giving up the Typhoon is the “declared goal” and that this reflects the ministry’s “responsibility to all taxpayers.” She also noted, however, that the proposed sale of the jets to Indonesia will be a “very complex and difficult” process. During a state visit to Austria by the then President of Turkey, Abdullah Gül, two Typhoons escorted his aircraft when it entered Austrian airspace., EUROFIGHTER The final decision on the sale requires not only a political consensus in Austria, but approval from the four Eurofighter partner nations — Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom — as well as the United States. The latter is responsible for key items of equipment in the jet, including the Typhoon’s GPS. The fighters are judged to have around two-thirds of their service life remaining, equivalent to another 20 or so years. Tanner explained two possible options to finalize the sale to the Krone . In the first scenario, the four parent nations would agree for Airbus to provide a new end-user certificate that would allow Austria to sell the aircraft direct to Jakarta (with U.S. approval). The second option would involve Airbus buying the jets back from Austria and then selling them on to Indonesia. The transfer of the fighters to Southeast Asia could also face opposition from within Indonesia itself. Parliamentarians opposing the purchase have pointed to the country’s Law No. 16/2012, which prioritizes domestic defense companies for award of major weapons deals. Furthermore, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has spoken out against acquisition of “obsolete and outdated weapon systems,” suggesting that future fighter purchases would involve new-build jets. On the other hand, in 2011 Indonesia purchased 24 used F-16C/D Block 25 jets from the United States, selecting these over new-build Block 52 Vipers. One of 24 F-16C/D Block 52IDs for Indonesia departs Hill Air Force Base, Utah, on its delivery flight, in 2017., U.S. AIR FORCE/ALEX R. LLOYD Before delivery, Indonesia’s latest batch of Block 25 Vipers was brought up to a Block 32+ standard, also known as Block 52ID, and local media suggests that a modernization package could be a possibility for the Typhoons, too. While the United Kingdom has chosen not to undertake a major upgrade of its Tranche 1 jets, Spain, for example, has taken a different approach, integrating Tranche 2/3 equipment on its Tranche 1 jets, including a computer symbol generator, digital video and voice recorder, and Rafael Litening laser designator pod. A similar procedure could be an option for Indonesia, perhaps with local industrial involvement from state-owned aircraft manufacturer PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) to satisfy Law No. 16/2012. Jakarta’s interest in the Austrian Typhoon fleet could indicate that the country’s $1.1-billion plans to acquire 11 Russian-made Su-35 Flanker fighters — first announced in July 2017 — have run into serious trouble. According to unnamed sources in Indonesia, Washington pressured Jakarta into shelving the deal with Moscow, threatening sanctions in response. However, in March 2020 Dmitry Shugayev , director of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation insisted that the Su-35 deal was still on. A Su-27SK is nearest the camera in this formation of Indonesian Air Force Flankers and Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18s in Exercise Pitch Black 2012., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA The Indonesian Air Force already operates previous versions of the Flanker in the form of five single-seat Su-27SKs and a pair of two-seat Su-30MKs delivered from 2003, along with nine two-seat Su-30MK2s received from 2008. These serve alongside the survivors of 12 F-16A/B Block 15OCU fighters delivered from 1989, plus the 24 upgraded F-16C/Ds, one of which was written off in an accident in 2015. Beyond the Typhoon, Indonesia remains involved in the KF-X new-generation fighter as a minority partner alongside Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI), with a 20% share. The first prototype of the KF-X is now taking shape in South Korea and PT DI is expected to remain involved in its design and, subsequently, production. Indonesia could buy 48 of the KF-X fighters, but with series production not expected until sometime between 2026 and 2028, the ex-Austrian Typhoons could be a useful stopgap. The Austrian Typhoons would, with a modest upgrade, provide Indonesia with a useful fleet of air defense fighters. The country occupies a very strategic position at the southern end of the South China Sea and the air policing mission is set to be an increasing issue in the future. However, the jet wouldn’t necessarily feature the kind of air-to-ground capability that might be required to counter the growing number of domestic terrorist groups, for example. As for a potential delivery timeline, Austria’s current service contract for the Typhoon expires in spring 2022, which could be the point at which the jets are transferred to Indonesia. That, in turn, doesn’t leave Vienna with long to find a Typhoon replacement. An Austrian Typhoon pilot prepares for a mission. , BUNDESHEER Should it manage to dispose of its unloved Typhoons, Austria will be left with the problem of how to adequately defend its airspace against high-end threats, especially since as a non-aligned nation it can’t rely on NATO support. An idea of these types of opponents was provided by Doskozil in 2017, when he admitted he didn’t feel confident if he had “to launch my pilots against a renegade Su-27 and its pursuers coming in from the east…” At this point, the Gripen option might be back on the table, and Saab has previously said it could supply 18 new-build JAS 39C/D Gripens, rather than the more expensive JAS 39E/Fs . The F-16 Block 70/72 is another type that has been mentioned in the past by air force officials, and by selecting the U.S. fighter, Austria would follow the path taken by its neighbor Slovakia. If Austria wants to get its hands on a Typhoon replacement quickly, then second-hand, upgraded F-16s could be an option, or a leasing deal for used JAS 39C/Ds from the Swedish Air Force . The Austrian Saab 105 fleet is mainly used for training but has a secondary air-policing role. , AUSTRIAN ARMED FORCES PHOTOGRAPH/WOLFGANG GREBIEN Then there’s the question of replacing Austria’s Saab 105 fleet, with the trainers due for retirement at the end of this year. Austria’s Green Party earlier this year called for the replacement of both the Saab and the Typhoon with the Leonardo M-346 Master , an advanced jet trainer that offers light combat capabilities. Austrian Typhoon pilots already train on the M-346 in Italy and in many ways it would seem to make an ideal replacement for the two-seat Saab. However, it lacks the raw performance and sophisticated avionics of a modern fighter jet, which would render it less suitable for the air policing role now undertaken by the Typhoon. Other potential candidates to replace the Saab 105 include the BAE Systems Hawk or Aero Vodochody L-39NG . Whatever happens with the Indonesian deal, it’s clear that the Typhoon is unwanted in Austria. How exactly the country will dispose of these jets — and if that’s even possible — remains to be seen.

Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 15, 2020",The Air Force Just Tested “Robot Dogs” For Use In Base Security,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. They look like they were cast straight from an episode of Black Mirror , and eventually, their mission could be similar in some ways, but for now, robot dogs are stretching their legs in the big test exercise environment for the United States Air Force. Last week, the U.S. Air Force hosted the second demonstration of its new Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a digital battle network system designed to collect, process, and share data among U.S. and allied forces in real-time. The ABMS has already undergone several tests, including a live-fire exercise earlier this year conducted with data and communications provided, in part, by SpaceX Starlink satellites. The highlight of last week’s demonstration was the use of multiple distributed sensors to detect and shoot down mock Russian cruise missiles. The system involves 5G and 4G networks, cloud computing systems, and AI systems to provide an unprecedented level of situational awareness and course of action decision making. ABMS is a top modernization priority for the Department of the Air Force, which is dedicated $3.3 billion over five years to develop and deploy the architecture and related systems. Senior Air Force leaders cite the system as one of the most pressing capabilities for success in several key theaters of operations. This latest ABMS demonstration was described as being one of the largest joint experiments in recent history, involving 65 government teams from every service including the Coast Guard, 35 separate military platforms, and 70 different industry partners. The exercise spanned 30 different geographic locations and four national test ranges. Air Force personnel test virtual reality headsets as part of this month’s ABMS exercises., USAF/SrA Daniel Hernandez Dr. Will Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the demonstration was intended to test the ability of ABMS to collect and fuse data instantly across geographically-separated forces. “Future battlefields will be characterized by information saturation. One of the key objectives of this onramp was to present a dizzying array of information for participants to synthesize, just like they would see in a real operation,” Roper said in a USAF press release . “This compelled commanders and operators to trust data analytics and artificial intelligence to understand the battle. Valuing data as an essential warfighting resource, one no less vital than jet fuel or satellites, is the key to next-gen warfare.” In addition to testing the data-gathering and sharing systems, the event also saw the Air Force using quadrupedal “dog” robots for perimeter defense at Nellis Air Force Base . The robots were built by Ghost Robotics and were intended to be a part of the ABMS test which took place earlier this year, but bandwidth issues prevented their use during that event. The specific model tested at the September ABMS test at Nellis AFB is known as a Vision 60. The Vision 60 is what Ghost Robotics calls a Q-UGV, or Quadrupedal Unmanned Ground Vehicle. The Vision 60 is designed for tasks such as remote inspection, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, mapping , distributed communications, and persistent security. The Vision 60 walking alongside USAF security forces., USAF/Sgt. Cory Payne There are few details about the specific technologies tested on the Vision 60 robots used during the ABMS exercise, but images appear to show various configurations, some with a pair of antennae on its back, and another with what appear to be a variety of sensors or communications equipment where its “head” would be. The fact that bandwidth issues prevented an earlier test of the Vision 60 robots points to the fact that the robots are data-linked and can communicate with other systems. According to the Ghost Robotics website, the Q-UGVs are nearly “unstoppable” and their modular design means they can execute a wide variety of missions: Beyond all-terrain stability and operation in virtually any environment, a core design principle for our legged robots is reduced mechanical complexity when compared to any other legged robots, and even traditional wheeled-tracked UGVs. By reducing complexity, we inherently increase durability, agility and endurance, and reduce the cost to deploy and maintain ground robots. Our modular design even supports field swapping any sub-assembly within minutes. Strategic partners can build solution-specific Q-UGVs for virtually any use-case with their choice of sensors, radios and even size the robot to suit specific requirements by licensing our reference designs. The Ghost Robotics Vision 60 Q-UGV, USAF/Sgt. Cory Payne Other units and branches have tested unmanned ground vehicles in the past, but the Vision 60 is a step ahead in some regard to the wheeled or tracked vehicles that have been regularly seen in previous demonstrations . Legged robots are not necessarily new either to the U.S. military when it comes to testing and demonstration events, but the manner in which Vision 60 is smaller, highly modular, and meant to support non-load-bearing tasks is somewhat different. The Ghost Robotics Vision 60 Q-UGV, USAF/Sgt. Cory Payne All manner of robotic systems could soon be conducting operations alongside human personnel. Many mundane, dangerous, or physically demanding tasks could soon be offloaded to a soldier’s robotic counterpart. It isn’t hard to see how Vision 60 could play a key role in patrolling perimeters, scouting areas ahead of its human comrades on the battlefield, and investigating objects of interest that could potentially be deadly to a soldier. The latter of which is really an extension of what bomb-squad robots have been doing for decades, although they are far less agile and adaptable to multiple missions. A ‘robot dog’ like this is also capable of carrying critical information gateways and computer systems that can better link those on the front lines with command and control assets far away, as was the case in this exercise. Even being able to continuously map their surroundings could alert human operators to unseen and potentially dangerous changes to their environment. With the modularity intrinsic to this design, one could image robot dogs outfitted to intercept and geolocate enemy communications or even being used to charge and neutralize threats so humans don’t have to. It will be interesting to see where Vision 60, and other concepts like it, head in the near future, but clearly what were science-fiction dreams of robots working alongside even the individual soldier just years ago are quickly becoming a reality.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021",The Army Is Working To Field A Ground-Launched Strike Version Of The Navy’s SM-6 Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Army is working hard to reorient itself toward expeditionary peer-state warfare across huge geographical areas, namely in the vast Pacific Theater. Unbridled by the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, whole categories of land-based missiles that can reach out over long distances to make pinpoint strikes are now once again an option for the service. These missiles could be cruise and ballistic types, as well as hypersonic ones. With an eye on fielding longer-range strike capabilities in Asia to counter-balance China’s growing military might and to deter Russia in the Europen theater , the question becomes how can the Army get these long-dormant capabilities re-deployed in a relatively short period of time. The answer is to adapt missiles that other services already have. This is a no-brainer for the Navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile , which is now a multi-role weapon that is able to hit surface targets as well as ones on land, and it can even be retargeted in flight. The Tomohawk’s land-based cousin, the BGM-109G Gryphon, served as a major component of the nuclear deterrent in Europe during the last decade of the Cold War. So, this type of application is far from unfamiliar when it comes to America’s venerable land-attack cruise missile. With this in mind, a version of the new and greatly improved Block IV “Tactical Tomahawk” in a forward-deployed, ground-launched format is the closest thing there is to a mature capability available for the Army’s use. Such an initiative is already underway, which you can read more about in this past piece of ours , and the U.S. Marines are slated to receive the weapon for a similar application soon. In the background is the Tomahawk ground-based launcher used to test the missile in such a format shorty after the INF treaty ended a year ago: At the same time, hypersonic technology development is moving ahead at a rapid pace and the Army has its own plans to field these extremely fast, precision-strike weapons in the relatively near future, which you can read all about here . But these weapons will be prohibitively expensive and will be primarily reserved for ripping apart the enemy’s most critical defenses and strategic infrastructure. They are also still anything but ‘off-the-shelf’ in terms of availability and even viability. So what’s left? Well, it would seem the Navy’s SM-6, and the Army clearly agrees. During a Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) webinar interview dubbed A Conversation on Army Readiness and Modernization, Bradley Bowman and General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, had the following exchange : BOWMAN: That’s great. Let’s transition, if I may, to the long-range precision fires, which is, as you know well, the Army’s number one modernization priority as I understand it. Can you very quickly, if you wouldn’t mind, just explain to the average listener, what is long-range precision fires, and why is it so important to the Army? MARTIN: A couple aspects. There’s strategic, there’s operational, and there’s tactical. Because we’ve got efforts going on in each and every one of those. So strategic. We’ve got a couple of capabilities we’re developing. The long-range cannon, the strategic long-range cannon . This thing’s going to shoot 1000 miles and be able to deliver multiple rounds simultaneously on a target. The beauty of that capability, artillery has been around for a long time, but it’s never shot that far, but it’s literally undefendable when you can shoot those number of rounds at that rate over that distance. Additionally, long-range hypersonic weapons. Those are game-changers in defeating exquisite enemy capability. Once again, because you can’t defend against a long-range hypersonic weapon. It moves very quickly and strikes its target very quickly. It’s going to allow us to penetrate the anti-access area denial layers. By the way, those capabilities, the long-range hypersonic weapon, fourth-quarter 23, we’ll be fielding our first battery of that. Operational. We got the precision strike missile. What the precision strike missile will do for us is it allows us to exceed the capability of our ATACM . It’ll go several hundred kilometers beyond that, but we’re also in the process of coordinating with other services to bring some other mid-range capabilities into play. Think about Tomahawks and think about shorter-range hypersonic weapons. We’re looking at land-based, land launched Tomahawk Missiles and SM-6s, which are in the Navy’s inventory. We’re looking at launching those from the land. That capability is coming third quarter of ’23. Then in tactical, we’ve got the extended-range cannon artillery. That’s a 155-millimeter capability where our typical artillery right now can shoot as far as 30 kilometers, we’re looking to shoot beyond 70 kilometers. That bridges a gap with our near-peer adversary’s artillery capability, providing us the ability to counter their longer-range artillery, which can’t range this particular system. That’s also coming in fourth quarter of ’23. For long-range precision fires, that’s actually our number one modernization program priority. We’re going to make artillery great again, that’s the focus. SM-6, also known as the Standard Missile-6 or the RIM-174 Standard Extended Range Active Missile (ERAM), is primarily a surface-to-air missile, with the capability to swat down air-breathing threats, such as aircraft and cruise missiles, over great distances, while also having a terminal ballistic missile defense capabilities. Raytheon/DOD It fits well with the arsenal aboard U.S. destroyers and cruisers as it can add a last line of defense against ballistic missiles, especially anti-ship capable ones , that SM-3 mid-course interceptors may miss. This capability exists alongside offering additional traditional anti-air capabilities that complement the venerable SM-2 series, from which the SM-6 was derived, including being a networked weapon with its own active radar seeker. DoD What most don’t realize is that the missile has secondary land-attack and potentially even anti-ship capabilities. In that manner, it is something of a quasi ballistic missile that is already intrinsically multi-role in nature. It is also fast. We don’t know specifics, but it likely would descend on ground or surface target at very high supersonic or even hypersonic speeds, making it more survivable than say a Tomahawk. DoD So, the Army could leverage what the Navy has already paid for and thoroughly tested for their land-based needs. What’s more exciting is that with additional development dollars from the Army, a joint SM-6 program effort could greatly accelerate the ongoing development of the missile, especially in its new second-generation, larger form-factor configuration. There is even a real possibility the SM-6 could be adapted for air-launch as a very long-range air-to-air missile, as well as a land-attack and anti-ship weapon. This could make it truly a joint tri-service program. You can read all about the SM-6 and its capabilities here , and its next big evolution in this past feature of ours . The idea that the Army could get a networked, precision land attack and anti-ship quasi-ballistic missile, and maybe even a long-range anti-air weapon, all in one package by adopting the SM-6 is undoubtedly a very attractive proposition. This is especially true for a service that is trying to find its way in a new strategic reality where air and sea capabilities seem to have stolen the stage. Land-based SM-6s and Tomahawks could also potentially use the same launch system as they were both designed around the naval Mk 41 vertical launch system’s constraints. As a long-range networked weapon, the SM-6 can engage targets that are beyond the detection range of the ship it is launched, using another platform’s sensor data, like say from an F-35 or E-2D, to provide targeting information from a forward position. , DoD One can imagine how ringing contested areas like the South China Sea with forward-deployed and even road-mobile SM-6 missiles could drastically complicate China’s anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) strategy. In theory, it could be used to dismantle critical components of that A2/AD strategy from inside its huge protective umbrella during the opening moments of a conflict. China is certainly investing in all forms of ballistic missiles, including anti-ship ones , both long-range and short-range . While a U.S. strategy of deploying its own missiles directly into and around contested areas that China says it holds claim over would be a major step in countering Beijing’s abilities to militarily back-up those claims, getting friendly countries to allow for U.S. missiles to be based in their territory remains the biggest question mark surrounding such a strategy. Doing so would put host countries right in China’s military and diplomatic crosshairs. As such, even though it is pretty clear that the Army could field cruise and ballistic missiles ashore soon, it isn’t clear if there will be countries within their relevant ranges that will actually accept to host them. The CM-401 is a short-range ballistic missile that is guided by an active seeker, allowing it to engage surface targets. , Chinese Internet Europe is a different equation altogether, especially when it comes to whether or not any of these ‘new’ U.S. weapons will be nuclear-armed like their predecessors, the Gryphon and Pershing II. Still, finding hosts in Europe would likely be easier than in parts of Asia. Regardless, the SM-6 could very much end up being the Army’s super versatile, hard to defend against, quick-strike weapon of choice in the years to come. Considering its growing prominence within the U.S. Navy’s own quiver, we could see its secondary capabilities rapidly expanded in the very near future.

Case in point is this video that shows a formation of F/A-18 Hornets refueling from a KC-130 at night that has a full-on lightning storm as a backdrop. The clip is downright evil-looking in its intensity. The video comes from one of our favorite Instagram follows, Combat_Learjet , and has little in the way of an explanation to go with it. Generally, flying through a lightning storm is far from ideal, but this is especially true when your jet is attached to a flying gas station via a hose that has hundreds of gallons flowing through it every minute.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics says that it has successfully integrated and flight-tested Agile Condor, a podded, artificial intelligence-driven targeting computer, on its MQ-9 Reaper drone as part of a technology demonstration effort for the U.S. Air Force. The system is designed to automatically detect, categorize, and track potential items of interest. It could be an important stepping stone to giving various types of unmanned, as well as manned aircraft, the ability to autonomously identify potential targets, and determine which ones might be higher priority threats, among other capabilities. The California-headquartered drone maker announced the Agile Condor tests on Sept. 3, 2020, but did not say when they had taken place. The Reaper with the pod attached conducted the flight testing from General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc.’s (GS-ASI) Flight Test and Training Center in Grand Forks, North Dakota. “Computing at the edge has tremendous implications for future unmanned systems,” GA-ASI President David R. Alexander said in a statement. “GA-ASI is committed to expanding artificial intelligence capabilities on unmanned systems and the Agile Condor capability is proof positive that we can accurately and effectively shorten the observe, orient, decide and act cycle to achieve information superiority. GA-ASI is excited to continue working with AFRL [Air Force Research Laboratory] to advance artificial intelligence technologies that will lead to increased autonomous mission capabilities.” Defense contractor SRC, Inc. developed the Agile Condor system for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), delivering the first pod in 2016 . It’s not clear whether the Air Force conducted any flight testing of the system on other platforms before hiring General Atomics to integrate it onto the Reaper in 2019. The service had previously said that it expected to take the initial pod aloft in some fashion before the end of 2016 . An infographic showing the basic components of the Agile Condor pod., SRC, Inc. A top-down view of the pod itself., SRC, Inc. “Sensors have rapidly increased in fidelity, and are now able to collect vast quantities of data, which must be analyzed promptly to provide mission critical information,” an SRC white paper on Agile Condor from 2018 explains. “Stored data [physically on a drone] … creates an unacceptable latency between data collection and analysis, as operators must wait for the RPA [remotely piloted aircraft] to return to base to review time sensitive data.” “In-mission data transfers, by contrast, can provide data more quickly, but this method requires more power and available bandwidth to send data,” the white paper continues. “Bandwidth limits result in slower downloads of large data files, a clogged communications link and increased latency that could allow potential changes in intel between data collection and analysis. The quantities of data being collected are also so vast, that analysts are unable to fully review the data received to ensure actionable information is obtained.” This is all particularly true for drones equipped with wide-area persistent surveillance systems, such as the Air Force’s Gorgon Stare system, which you can read about in more detail here , that grab immense amounts of imagery that can be overwhelming for sensor operators and intelligence analysts to scour through. Agile Condor is designed to parse through the sensor data a drone collects first, spotting and classifying objects of interest and then highlighting them for operators back at a control center or personnel receiving information at other remote locations for further analysis. Agile Condor would simply discard “empty” imagery and other data that shows nothing it deems useful, not even bothering to forward that on. A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone carrying the Gorgon Stare wide-area persistent surveillance system., USAF “This selective ‘detect and notify’ process frees up bandwidth and increases transfer speeds, while reducing latency between data collection and analysis,” SRC’s 2018 white paper says. “Real time pre-processing of data with the Agile Condor system also ensures that all data collected is reviewed quickly, increasing the speed and effectiveness with which operators are notified of actionable information.” At least at present, the general idea is still to have a human operator in the ‘kill chain’ making decisions about how to act on such information, including whether or not to initiate a lethal strike. The Air Force has been emphatic about ensuring that there will be an actual person in the loop at all times, no matter how autonomous a drone or other unmanned vehicle may be in the future. Still, developments such as Agile Condor will significantly reduce the amount of necessary human interaction in various parts of the targeting process, as well as general intelligence collection and initial analysis, and potentially much more , as time goes on. It could also fuse various forms of sensor data and other available intelligence together to specifically weight possible areas of interest over others and prioritize certain targets. The Air Force has also said that this system could use these capabilities to enable drones to navigate and detect and avoid potential threats automatically, including at times when its links to a control center or the GPS satellite navigation system are disrupted or blocked entirely. An Air Force Research Laboratory briefing slide showing a concept of operations for how a drone might use Agile Condor to sense and avoid threats autonomously., USAF Agile Condor is hardly the first project the Air Force, or the U.S. military, as a whole, has initiated looking for ways to streamline these processes. One of the best known of these efforts is Project Maven , which has also focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) to parse through mountains of persistent surveillance imagery to rapidly identify useful pieces and information. This now a push to take technology developed under that effort and leverage it elsewhere across the U.S. military. The actual Agile Condor technology inside the pod is designed to be as lightweight as possible and use modular and open-architecture design elements to make it easy to add in new and improved functionality and capabilities in the future. While it has been flight tested on the Reaper, it’s not hard to see how the technology could be applicable to any other unmanned aircraft capable of carrying it, as well as manned platforms , where the system could assist onboard human sensor operators and analysts. There are already programs in the works to develop AI “copilots” that can provide various kinds of assistance to the crews of manned fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. It’s also very possible that the technology could have naval and ground-based applications, as well. All told, Agile Condor is just another example of a broader push across the U.S. military to leverage AI and machine learning to improve autonomous capabilities across the board. The Air Force in particular has a number of publicly acknowledged autonomous unmanned aircraft programs ongoing now, the most notable of which is Skyborg , an effort seeking to develop a suite of systems able to autonomously operate drones in the loyal wingmen role supporting manned aircraft, as well as part of fully independent swarms . This technology could even potentially go into a fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). At the same time, the Air Force is looking to hold a mock dogfight between an autonomous unmanned aircraft and a manned fighter aircraft next year. Just recently, the service held a competition in which various companies developed AI-driven software to fly simulated fighter jets in a virtual environment, after which the winning team put their work up against a real fighter pilot. The AI pilot won a “ flawless victory ” against the human pilot, in the end, an outcome that has already stirred up much debate inside the U.S. military and out. However the use of AI and machine learning continues to grow and evolve in the U.S. military, it is certainly a major area of focus broadly and systems such as Agile Condor are paving the way for this new era in warfighting.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 28, 2019",U.S. Confirms China Has Launched What Could Be Its Version Of The X-37B Spaceplane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Beijing says it has successfully launched an uncrewed “reusable experimental spacecraft” from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center located in the Gobi Desert in northwest China. Space-Track.org , a U.S. government online database of public space launches that the U.S. military’s Combined Space Operations Center and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command maintain, confirmed that the “PRC TEST SPACECRAFT” successfully made it into space. The as-yet-unknown space vehicle was delivered into low Earth orbit atop a Long March 2F carrier rocket on September 4, 2020. The launch was the 14th mission for the Long March 2F rocket and was apparently the result of months of preparations at Jiuquan. The exact purpose of the mission remains unclear. “After a period of in-orbit operation, the spacecraft will return to the scheduled landing site in China,” announced a report from state news agency Xinhua . “It will test reusable technologies during its flight, providing technological support for the peaceful use of space.” There have been many rumors that the test involves a new type of spaceplane. This is a vehicle designed to use its wings and body to generate lift to glide like a conventional aircraft inside Earth’s atmosphere and maneuver like a spacecraft while in space. Aside from their reusability, other key advantages of spaceplanes include reduced turnaround time between launches and the ability to be configured to carry a wider array of payloads, which can be returned to earth, and to perform various other specialist missions . Potentially, their reusability could ultimately bring down space access costs, but this really hasn’t been proven to any large degree. There’s already speculation that the new space vehicle involved is a Chinese equivalent of the Boeing X-37B or the planned European Space Agency Space Rider . The mysterious X-37B began its sixth mission on May 17, 2020, when it was launched atop an Atlas 5 rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The U.S. Air Force’s X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle Mission 5 lands at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility, October 2019., USAF The Pentagon’s highly secretive X-37B operates much like a mini-space shuttle, launching atop a conventional rocket. The uncrewed craft has been operating for years with few official explanations of its actual mission. Recently, however, it was confirmed that the spaceplane has been involved in experiments using the Photovoltaic Radio-frequency Antenna Module (PRAM), which is planned to eventually be able to harvest energy using solar panels and send that power back down to Earth in the form of microwaves. You can read more about those experiments here , as well as an interview with the scientist who developed it . A slide from a 2019 Defense Intelligence Agency report showing a range of ways in which satellites can attack each other. , DIA A vehicle like the X-37B would have the potential to carry reconnaissance payloads and even undertake offensive missions in space on behalf of the People’s Liberation Army. These could include jamming or blinding enemy satellites, releasing microsatellites that could interfere with or damage other satellites, and more. You can read about some of these potential in-orbit anti-satellite capabilities here . Of course, a Chinese spaceplane could also be utilized for a wide range of non-offensive experiments or other risk-reduction efforts, as well. Many of these missions could also be achieved by a recoverable capsule, which would be less technologically challenging to realize than a spaceplane. So far, however, no official details of the new Chinese spacecraft have been disclosed and there are reports that additional security was in place around the space center prior to launch, presumably to prevent unwanted ‘leaks’ of imagery on social media. According to Andrew Jones, a journalist who tracks China’s space program, the launch tower at Jiuquan underwent significant modifications ahead of the latest launch. This led to rumors that the latest mission involved a payload of increased dimensions than previous Long March 2F cargoes. In its past launches , the first of which took place in 1999, the Long March 2F has been used for both crewed and uncrewed Shenzhou spacecraft missions and has also transported two Tiangong space labs. The rocket is thought to be capable of carrying a payload of around 18,5000 pounds to low Earth orbit — this is greater than the 11,000-pound launch weight of the X-37B as declared by the U.S. Air Force . A computer graphic of a notional Chinese spaceplane, bearing a strong resemblance to the Cold War-era X-20 Dyna-Soar ., CAAA As long ago as 2017, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) unveiled questionably ambitious plans to launch a reusable spaceplane. However, a report from Xinhua at the time quoted CASC researcher Chen Hongbo as saying the spacecraft “will fly into the sky like an aircraft,” suggesting it would be capable of conventional (horizontal) take-off, rather than requiring the assistance of a traditional space launch rocket. Early details of this spaceplane provided by the Chinese media indicated that it would be a questionably ambitious design able to transport people or a payload into orbit before returning to Earth. The spacecraft launched today could potentially be a technology demonstrator, or at least a more modest vehicle, perhaps preceding the development of a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) spaceplane, which would be able to venture to space without the need for a carrier rocket or additional fuel tanks and boosters. However, as aerospace consultant Jean Deville explains in his excellent overview of Chinese spaceplanes , the country has been working on the design of spaceplane vehicles since the 1980s, paralleling similar efforts in Europe, Soviet Union , the United States, and elsewhere. By the early 1990s, Beijing seemed to have shelved spaceplanes due to the technological challenges and instead concentrated on the more conventional Shenzhou spacecraft that could be realized more easily in the near-term. A Chinese concept for a notional two-stage-to-orbit aerial space launch system, with a smaller spacecraft riding atop a high-speed mothership., CAAA Chinese interest in reusable spaceplanes then returned in the mid-2000s, with a view to eventually bringing down the costs involved in putting payloads into orbit. At this point, Deville observes, China envisaged a three-step plan, of increasing complexity: (1) a vertical take-off, horizontal-landing vehicle, (2) a two-stage-to-orbit horizontal take-off, horizontal-landing vehicle, and (3) a horizontal take-off, horizontal-landing SSTO spaceplane. A screen capture showing computer modeling of an H-6 releasing the Shenlong spaceplane., CCTV The first images of the Shenlong spaceplane carried below an H-6 bomber., CHINESE INTERNET Meanwhile, China was also working on the Shenlong spaceplane demonstrator , which first appeared in a photo showing it carried under the belly of an H-6K bomber , in December 2007. This may have undertaken atmospheric and suborbital test flights in 2010 and 2011, but little more is known about it. In the second part of his analysis , Deville provides a look at some of the Chinese spaceplane projects disclosed so far, including those thought to have been abandoned, and in the process provides this very useful infographic : CHINA-AEROSPACE.BLOG / JEAN DEVILLE Of course, until more details are revealed it’s impossible to say which — if any of these projects — was taken into orbit by the Long March 2F carrier rocket earlier today. While some are clearly highly ambitious programs unlikely to appear as hardware any time soon, at least one, the Tianxing-1 developed by a Chinese start-up, has supposedly already recorded some test flights . A computer-generated concept of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology spaceplane., HAN PENGXIN / CHINA ACADEMY OF LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY Flight profile of the spaceplane proposed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology., HAN PENGXIN / CHINA ACADEMY OF LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY China’s extensive list of spaceplane projects also includes those with expressly civilian applications — at least initially — as the country looks toward the burgeoning space tourism industry . You can read about the 20-seat autonomous suborbital spaceplane proposed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) in this previous article . Back when it was announced in 2016, the CALT team reportedly expected their spaceplane to begin flight tests in 2020, without passengers. However, there’s no evidence that today’s launch is related to this proposal. Wind-tunnel tests of a model of a two-stage-to-orbit space launch system from the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics., CAAA Last year, we also saw the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA) reveal images of wind-tunnel tests of a model of a so-called two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane launching from the back of a mothership aircraft. In this concept, rather than use a space launch rocket, it would rely on a fast- and high-flying scramjet-powered mothership aircraft to carry it on top of its fuselage. The spaceplane would then be launched at a very high altitude, using its own rocket motor to climb into orbit. Regardless of China’s ongoing interest in spaceplane technologies, most of which likely remain far off in the future, at best, it’s clear that China is investing heavily in the idea of reusable space launch systems as it seeks to further establish itself as a major space power. This craft could represent a major step toward realizing those ambitions and it could offer China a highly agile and reconfigurable ‘space truck’ to accomplish a wide variety of missions in order in relatively short order.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 28, 2020",B-52 Bombers Fly Unprecedented Patrol Along Edge Of Russian-Controlled Territory In Ukraine (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In another unprecedented show of force aimed at Russia, U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers flew from the United Kingdom to Ukraine airspace earlier today. After arriving there, they orbited for an extended period right at the edge of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and near areas under the control of Kremlin-supported separatists . These sorties are the latest in a flurry of geopolitical posturing between Washington and Moscow and come a week after a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet performed a potentially dangerous maneuver in front of another B-52H flying over the Black Sea. Three B-52Hs, with the call signs Julia 51, 52, and 53 departed RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom on Sept. 4, 2020. There are conflicting reports about whether the third bomber took part in the mission to Ukraine, but only two of them were ever visible on online flight tracking software. Regardless, the bombers subsequently returned to Fairford, where a total of six of them – all of which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons – have been forward-deployed as part of a Bomber Task Force mission since Aug. 22. After they had entered Ukrainian airspace, the B-52Hs flew to the southeastern portion of the country and entered a racetrack-like orbit along the coast of the Sea of Azov . The orbit’s southwesternmost point was over the Ukrainian port city of Henichesk, which is around 20 miles, at its closest, from the Crimean Peninsula. The northeasternmost tip of the route was just south of the city of Melitopol, around 115 miles or so from areas under the control of separatists in Eastern Ukraine that Russian forces are actively supporting. There are unconfirmed reports Ukrainian Su-27 Flankers flew with the bombers during the sorties. In May 2020, Ukrainian Flankers, as well as MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, flew with B-1 bombers in the region. At least one U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) Eurofighter Typhoon , flying all the way from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, also appears to have joined the bombers for a time.

This included an Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy plane, as well as an RAF Airseeker , which is derived from the Rivet Joint. A RAF Sentinel R1 , a radar platform based on the Bombardier Global Express business jet, was also present for a time. USAF B-52(H) JULIA51 JULIA53 (NOW IN UKRAINE AIRSPACE) USAF RC-135 RIVET JOINT SALMA44 (BLACK SEA) RAF SENTINEL R1 ZJ692 (BLACK SEA) USN P-8A POSEIDON NOREG (BLACK SEA) LOCATIONS AT 08:50Z pic.twitter.com/1dTp7mOTtm — BlueSky (@AirSpecInt) September 4, 2020 The heavy ISR presence makes good sense as these B-52H sorties could only have prompted various responses from Russian forces in Crimea and elsewhere in the region. The RC-135V/W, Airseeker, and Sentinel R1 aircraft are all capable of collecting various signals and electronic intelligence, and would have been well-positioned to gather information about how Russia’s integrated air defense networks and other command and control nodes reacted to the B-52s. The ability of the RC-135V/Ws and the Airseeker, especially, to detect, classify, and geolocate various types of emitters, including air defense radars, means that they would have had a particularly good opportunity to help add to the known “ electronic order of battle ” of Russian forces in the broader Black Sea region. Russia has established a heavy air defense presence in Crimea since it illegally occupied it in 2014, including the deployment of both S-400 and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems at nine different sites.

In 1994, a B-52, along with a B-1 bomber and KC-10A Extender aerial refueling tanker flew to Poltava Air Base in northwestern Ukraine to mark the 50th anniversary of Operation Frantic during World War II. Operation Frantic was a so-called “shuttle bombing” effort in which U.S. bombers flew from bases in the United Kingdom and Italy, struck their targets in Germany and elsewhere, and then landed in bases in Ukraine, which was then a Soviet Socialist Republic. The last of these missions took place in September 1944. Third. B-52 (with B-1B and KC-10A Extender) already were in Poltava in  1994 and in B-1b were over Ukraine in May, 2020 pic.twitter.com/IY5MNG1Fmu — Sovinskiy (@_Sovinskiy) September 4, 2020 These latest sorties could ostensibly be intended to mark the anniversary of the end of Operation Frantic, but this seems unlikely. This year is the 76th anniversary, not typically one the deserves special attention, and the bombers did not fly near any of the three bases that supported the World War II bombing missions. It seems much more likely that flying at least two nuclear-capable B-52s into Ukraine, and this particular part of the country, is meant to demonstrate America’s support for Ukraine. At the same time, it presents a visible challenge to Russia with regards to its continued occupation of Crimea and its support of separatists fighting authorities in Kyiv. The Sea of Azov was also the site of a very serious altercation between the Ukrainian Navy and Russian security forces in November 2018, in which Russia detained 24 Ukrainian sailors and impounded three Ukrainian vessels for nearly a year. Ukrainian authorities said the two gunboats and the tug were in extremely poor condition when Russia eventually returned them, something that the Kremlin vehemently denied. This latest B-52H mission would be in line with a number of past bomber operations in the region, as well. Russian Flankers intercepted at least one of these bombers flying over the Black Sea on Aug. 28, with one of them conducting a possibly dangerous “thumping” maneuver very close to the American aircraft. The bomber was one of four that sortied out that day from Fairford to fly over the airspace of all NATO members in Europe, in an unprecedented demonstration of the alliance’s solidarity to any potential adversaries, including Russia. A Russian Flanker also followed one of the B-52s into Danish airspace during that mission. There seems to have been a deliberate decision to keep the bombers inside Ukrainian airspace this time, which would have reduced the chance of any kind of intercept. In addition, as noted, in May 2020, B-1 bombers also trained in the region together with Ukrainian fighter jets, including conducting mock anti-ship operations clearly meant to send a signal to the Kremlin and the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet. Last year, a B-52, also part of a detachment at Fairford for a short-term deployment, made a run in the Black Sea at Crimea that mirrored what one might expect to see in an actual strike on targets there involving the employment of air-launched cruise missiles, too. This latest B-52 operation is just the latest in a string of tit-for-tat shows of force and other posturing between the United States and Russia in both Europe and the Pacific, which the War Zone has been following closely and that you can read about in more detail in this recent story . NATO is also meeting today to discuss how it might respond to the assassination attempt against a major Russian opposition political figure, which involved a secretive chemical weapon that strongly ties the attack to the Kremlin. Sending B-52s to southeastern Ukraine is sure to draw new responses from the Kremlin, which may feel a need to further escalate with its own shows of force in response. UPDATE: 12:50pm EST U.S. European Command (EUCOM) has confirmed that three B-52 bombers took part in the mission over Ukraine today, as did Ukrainian fighter jets, in a press release . The full release is as follows: “Three U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft from the 5th Bomb Wing, Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, conducted vital integration training with Ukrainian fighters Friday inside Ukraine’s airspace.” “Friday’s strategic bomber mission is part of the long-planned deployment of six B-52s to RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England. The mission provided partners valuable midair training. In addition, the mission demonstrated how forward-located aircraft and crews, such as those in the B-52 units, enable collective defense capabilities and provide the U.S., NATO Allies and partners strategic and operational breadth to deter Russia and assure Allies and partners.” “More than 200 related missions have been conducted since the Bomber Task Force launched operations in the European theater two years ago. These ongoing bomber missions showcase the U.S. Air Force’s ability to continually execute flying missions, sustain readiness and support Allies and partners across Europe, regardless of external challenges to include the current global COVID-19 crisis response.” UPDATE: 2:55pm EST The Ukrainian Air Force has now released video footage showing its Su-27 Flankers and MiG-29 Fulcrums flying with all three B-52s over Ukraine.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2021",Photos Show South Korea’s Next-Generation Fighter Jet Rapidly Taking Shape,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently released photos and video show the initial prototype of the KF-X next-generation indigenous fighter — which is being built by Korea Aerospace Industries , or KAI, in Sacheon — starting to take shape. KAI is also receiving assistance from Lockheed Martin on the project, which has an estimated total value of $7.4 billion, and is aiming to roll out the completed prototype by April of next year. So far, the bulk of the fuselage and the wings have been completed and major subassemblies are now in the process of being mated together on the production line. The fuselage seems to have been completed in three major components: forward fuselage including the cockpit, center fuselage ‘barrel’ with integral wings, and a tail unit, to which the flying surfaces have not yet been added. KAI KAI asdsa Judging by the color of the components, most of the structure seems to comprise composite materials. This would parallel the approach taken in other new-generation fighter designs, in which advanced composite construction helps with reducing radar signature , while also providing a light and strong airframe. Like its new-generation counterparts — the Chinese FC-31 , the Indian Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), and the Turkish TF-X — the KF-X is a twin-tailed multi-role fighter with a configuration broadly similar to the F-22 Raptor or F-35 Lightning II . All these designs share the outwards-canted twin tails, low-observable shaping, and parallel alignment of edges that are characteristic of modern ‘stealthy’ fighters. The shaping of the KF-X’s inlets is especially reminiscent of those on the F-22. An earlier wind-tunnel test model of the KF-X reveals similarities with the F-22 and F-35., KAI From the outset, the KF-X was planned to offer better kinematic performance than the F-16C . KAI has stated it hopes the jet will have a maximum speed of 1,370 mph and a ferry range of 1,800 miles, as well as a total payload capacity of 17,000 pounds. The two engines that will give the jet its power have yet to be installed in the prototype. These powerplants will be a specially adapted version of the 22,000-pound-thrust-class GE Aviation F414 known as the F414-GE-400K. GE Aviation delivered the first F414-GE-400K for the KF-X in May 2020. In a press release, the company said the KF-X “will deliver significantly greater mission capability, extended combat radius and longer lifespan compared to current aircraft.” A look at the rear of the KF-X prototype showing where its two F414-GE-400K engines will eventually go., KAI GE Aviation will provide South Korea with 240 F414 production engines plus spares. The same basic powerplant is used in the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler , Sweden’s JAS 39E/F Gripen , and is set to power the Indian Tejas Mk 2 . Photos showing the cross-section through the center fuselage of the KF-X reveal troughs in the bottom of the aircraft for semi-recessed weapons carriage. In its initial form, the KF-X is not planned to feature internal weapons bays, but these are expected to be incorporated in later developments of the jet. A view of the underside of the KF-X prototype’s center fuselage showing elements of the semi-recessed weapons carriage arrangement., K-FORCE TELEVISION STATION CAPTURE Another view showing parts of all four of the troughs that will hold missiles semi-recessed under the fuselage. You can also see a nice cross-section of the aircraft’s serpentine air ducts. This helps hide the engine faces from radar., K-FORCE TELEVISION STATION CAPTURE All told the pictures and video footage show that KAI has made substantial progress since it last revealed a picture of the prototype under construction that the company released in July 2020. At that time, only portions of the front and center fuselage sections were shown. A picture of the KF-X prototype under construction that KAI released earlier this year., KAI Current plans reportedly call for the initial-production Block 1 variant to be completed without internal weapons bays , but to be compatible with them, suggesting there will be enough space within the fuselage to allow for their later introduction — presumably without requiring too much invasive structural work. Subsequently, the Block 2 versions are expected to be completed with internal bays from the outset. As for armament, in November 2019, Europe’s MBDA Missile Systems announced it had been awarded a contract to integrate its ramjet-powered Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) with the KF-X. “We’re very pleased to mark this next and important step in our partnership with KAI and the Korean Defence Acquisition Program Administration,” said Éric Béranger, CEO of MBDA, at the time. “South Korea is a strategic market for MBDA, and we’re proud that Meteor will be providing KF-X with the world’s most potent air-to-air capability.” The Meteor BVRAAM will be complemented by the infrared-guided IRIS-T short-range air-to-air missile produced by Germany’s Diehl Defence. In addition to those missiles, the aircraft will have also have a built-in 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon firing through a port on the top of the fuselage on the lefthand-side behind the cockpit. Earlier this year, South Korea selected the precision-guided munitions and guidance kits that it plans to integrate with the KF-X. These comprise the Boeing GBU-31 and GBU-38/B Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), GBU-54/B and GBU-56/B Laser JDAMs , and GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I), and the Raytheon GBU-12 Paveway II bomb, plus Textron’s CBU-105 Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD). All of these weapons are already in use with the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF), but the integration process with the KF-X is expected to take six or seven years to complete. A mock-up of the KF-X, complete with mock external stores at the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition in October 2019. , KAI Concept artwork of the KF-X has also depicted the jet with external targeting and navigation pods — something that is generally omitted from the design of many fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35 , to improve their stealthy characteristics. However, being able to carry these podded systems, which may have capabilities not found in the aircraft’s built-in sensors, could be valuable for when the aircraft does not need to operate in its most stealthy configuration. This could also allow for the more rapid integration of sensors or other systems with new or improved functionality without major changes to the airframe. Concept art of a KF-X equipped with external targeting and navigation pods under the engine intakes., South Korean Defense Acquisition Program Administration The KF-X’s active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar is being developed in South Korea by Hanwha Systems. This company has in turn contracted Israel’s Elbit Systems to provide terrain following/terrain avoidance technology for the jet’s avionics suite. Flight tests of a technology-demonstration fighter radar have taken place in both Israel and South Korea using Elta’s Boeing 737 testbed , in a project that involves Hanwha, Elta Systems, and South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development (ADD). This picture of the KF-X prototype shows the plane’s radar, or a mockup thereof, installed on the nose., KAI A closeup of the KF-X prototype’s nose without anything installed., K-FORCE TELEVISION STATION CAPTURE Hanwha is also developing an infrared search and track (IRST) system for the jet. IRST offers an alternative to radar when it comes to spotting and tracking hostile aircraft, including stealth types.  These systems, which are also very useful in environments where there is a high risk of electronic warfare jamming, are becoming increasingly standard on fighter jets, either built into the plane or in a podded form . You can read more about the benefits they offer in this recent War Zone feature . Development of the KF-X first began in January 2016, with the preliminary design getting was finalized in June 2018. A critical design review of the fighter was completed in September 2019 and a mock-up then debuted at the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition that took place the following October. In late 2019, it was confirmed that KAI had begun building the first prototype for the KF-X and the firm now aims to roll out the completed aircraft in April 2021. Production of six prototype fighters and 15 F414 engines are due for completion by the end of 2021 and these will then be used in the flight-test program that’s expected to finish by 2026. A first flight is planned for May 2022. The six prototype fighters are anticipated to comprise four single-seaters and two twin-seaters. If all goes to plan, Seoul expects to issue a production contract for the KF-X as early as 2024, leading to deliveries of the Block 1 variant in 2026, before the test campaign is wound up. The ROKAF has a requirement for 120 KF-Xs, intended to replace the existing F-4E Phantom II and F-5E/F Tiger II fleets by 2032. It remains to be seen whether South Korea will be able to meet that goal. Developing a new fighter from scratch is a daunting prospect and one that’s often beset by delays and cost overruns — especially when low-observable technology is involved. South Korea does appear to have laid out an incremental approach to KF-X that is less ambitious at the outset with an eye toward rapidly bringing the first iteration to the prototype stage. The choice not to include fully internal weapons bays in the first block of jets inherently makes them less stealthy, but is an indication of a potentially less risky developmental approach. The South Koreans are then expected to pursue further block upgrades that would incrementally reduce the fighter’s radar signature. This, of course, runs the risk of increasing costs in the long term to realize the aircraft’s full potential. The KF-X prototype’s forward fuselage section., K-FORCE TELEVISION STATION CAPTURE In addition, overall, KAI hopes that it could sell more than 350 examples of its indigenous fighter, including a number on the export market. There are long-standing hopes that Indonesia could buy 50 of the new jets, with that country’s PT Dirgantara Indonesia also working as an industry partner on the project. Originally, Indonesia committed to paying for 20% of the total KF-X development costs, however, Jakarta has since sought to renegotiate its involvement in the program and has reportedly got behind in its payments. KAI has enjoyed notable export success with its T-50 , TA-50 , and FA-50 Golden Eagle series of advanced trainers and light combat aircraft. Like the KF-X, these designs received assistance from Lockheed Martin, are powered by General Electric engines, and, in their most advanced forms, feature Israeli-made Elta radars. While the company will hope to replicate some of this success with the KF-X, the U.S.-supplied engines mean it will be subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions, which could block export sales if they are seen to go against Washington’s foreign policy objectives. There are other factors, too, that should accelerate the KF-X fighter’s path to service entry. By selecting European-made air-to-air missiles as the initial armament, and an Israeli co-developed radar, Seoul avoids having to wait to receive permission from Washington to integrate U.S.-made weapons and avionics, which can be a lengthy process. Fielding the jet initially without internal weapons will also speed things up, allowing weapon launch and separation trials from the bays to be postponed until the Block 2 version is ready. Finally, potential foreign involvement — together with design cooperation from the outset — could also help get the jet into service quicker. Whatever the case, KAI certainly seems to be making significant progress in the construction of the initial prototype KF-X and the program seems to be one to watch when it comes to new stealth fighter developments around the world.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. High winds from Typhoon Maysak caused a floating dry dock to break free of its moorings at Russia’s Vostochny Verf shipyard in the country’s far eastern port city of Vladivostok. Once free, it drifted into a number of ships and submarines belonging to the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet , causing untold damage. Maysak, which has been moving north for days now, passing over both Japan and the Korean Peninsula, where it had built up enough strength to produce gusts of wind in excess of 100 miles per hour , with the possibility that it could still become more powerful. It’s not clear exactly how strong the storm’s winds were when it reached Vladivostok. Video footage and pictures of the incident so far show that the floating dry dock did not have any ship or submarine inside it at the time. It still presents a major hazard and has reportedly already smacked into various ships and submarines. The imagery that has emerged on social media so far shows a particularly dramatic collision between it and a cluster of moored Project 1241.1 Molniya class missile corvettes. These ships each displace just under 550 tons with a full load and can carry up to 16 Kh-35 Uran anti-ship cruise missiles as their primary armament. The Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet has around 11 of these ships. A Kilo class attack submarine was also reportedly struck as the dock went floating along. The Russian Pacific fleet has six of these boats. The extent the damage remains unclear, but this is just the latest in a string of calamities to befall the Russian Navy in recent years. In 2018, a fire broke out on a Kilo class submarine in Vladivostok. Russia later claimed had just been an exercise, but this seems highly improbable and the exact circumstances surrounding that incident remain unclear. Also in 2018, PD-50, the Russian Navy’s largest floating dry dock sunk at the 82nd Shipbuilding Plant at Roslyakovo near Murmansk after an apparent electrical malfunction that caused its ballast tanks to get stuck in the open position. Russia’s sole aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , was inside at the time, undergoing a major overhaul. A fire on Kuznetsov last year, which reportedly caused 350 million Rubles worth of damage , more than $4.6 million at the present rate exchange, further called into question when and if the ship will return to service . Again in 2018, Russia’s future Project 22600 icebreaker Viktor Chernomyrdin caught fire while it was under construction at Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg. Then, last year, the Russian Navy’s top-secret Losharik spy submarine also had a fire during training off the coast of northwestern Russia. That accident, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces , killed 14 sailors. On top of these naval incidents, Russia has seen a number of other major military accidents in recent years. These include the accidental explosion of an apparent nuclear-powered cruise missile prototype and a massive explosion and shockwave, followed by a huge fire , at an ammunition depot in the country’s Siberian region, both of which occurred last year. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 4:20pm EST Another video has emerged more clearly showing the dock plowing into one of the Kilo class submarines at the base.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 2, 2020",Russia’s Novichok Chemical Weapon Returns In Attempted Assassination Of Opposition Figure (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. German authorities say they have “unequivocal evidence” that Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who remains in a coma, was poisoned by a nerve agent from a secretive family of such chemical weapons known collectively as Novichoks . The first known instance of one of these agents being used was in a failed assassination attempt against ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom and its appearance again strongly points the finger at direct involvement by the Kremlin in this latest attack, despite its denials. The German Federal Government announced that it had found the evidence of a Novichok in Navalny’s system on Sept. 2, 2020, based on findings from a special military medical laboratory within the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin hospital in the country’s capital. Navalny had first presented symptoms of poisoning while on a flight from the Russian city of Tomsk to the country’s capital Moscow on Aug. 20, after which the plane flew to Omsk, where he was rushed to a hospital. On Aug. 22, he was flown to Germany to receive more specialized medical care. Navalny’s associates believe the poison was added to his tea at the airport in Tomsk, but it remains unclear when and how the chemical agent was administered. https://youtube.com/watch?v=zuVDtFTO_I0 “It is a startling event that Alexei Navalny was the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia,” German authorities said in a statement. “The federal government condemns this attack in the strongest possible terms. The Russian government is urged to explain itself to the incident.” “The Federal Government will inform its partners in the EU and NATO about the results of the investigation via the Federal Foreign Office in the channels provided for this purpose,” it continued. “It will discuss an appropriate joint reaction with the partners.” German officials also said that they would notify the Russian Ambassador to Germany of the findings. They would inform the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international body that oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention , to which Russia is a party, as well. “With this, it is certain that Alexei Navalny is the victim of a crime,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel subsequently said . “He was meant to be silenced and I condemn this in the strongest possible manner.” BREAKING: Merkel says #Navalny ’s poisoning is “a crime” that “raises questions only #Russia Gov can and must answer.” German Gov confirmed that Russian opposition figure was poisoned with nerve agent. He is in German hospital pic.twitter.com/77xQ31RmqJ — Joyce Karam (@Joyce_Karam) September 2, 2020 “There are very serious questions now that only the Russian government can answer, and must answer,” she continued, further describing the poisoning as “the attempted murder by poisoning of one of Russia’s leading opposition figures.” Alexei Navalny at a march in 2019 in memory of assassinated Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, AP Little is known publicly about the Novichoks , or “newcomers,” development of which began in the 1970s with the immediate aim of defeating NATO protective gear and chemical weapons detection systems. They are organophosphate nerve agents, which function in the same way as better known types, such as Sarin or VX . They effectively prevent the body’s nervous system from communicating with other organs, impairing normal muscle function, typically causing victims to die by suffocation or cardiac arrest as they can no longer control their breathing or heart rate. Novichoks are reportedly much more lethal than previous nerve agents, but also safer to handle and employ. This may be in part due to some being binary compounds, with two compounds that are harmless until mixed together. Active development work on these agents continued at least until the fall of the Soviet Union 1991, and possibly afterward, with an additional eye toward circumventing the Chemical Weapons Convention by using precursor chemicals the agreement does not regulate or monitor. This agreement was first signed in 1993, after years of negotiations, but did not enter force until 1997. A Novichok was also employed in the failed attempt to assassinate former Russian spy and double agent Sergei Skripal in March 2018. Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, was also sickened in the attack, but both survived. In June of that year, British citizens Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess came into contact with a discarded container that had held the agent, and Sturgess sadly died . British personnel wearing protective gear example a site for potential Novichok contamination in the wake of the Skripal assassination attempt in 2018., Andrew Matthews/PA Wire via AP At the time, then-U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May described these incidents as a “brazen act of war” and demanded an explanation from Russian authorities, threatening “extensive measures” if they did not comply. The Kremlin denied any involvement, and spun a number of conspiracy theories in response, with the U.K. authorities eventually expelling 23 Russian diplomats in response. There is also evidence that Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev may have been targeted in another failed Novichok attack in 2015. Russian Banker Ivan Kivelidi, as well as his secretary Zara Ismailova, died in 1995 after reportedly being poisoned with VR nerve agent , a Soviet equivalent to VX, development of which reportedly aided in the crafting of the subsequent Novichoks. The Skripal assassination attempt has since been tied to an element of Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, better known by the Russian acronym GRU, known as Unit 29155 . There is also evidence tying members of this unit to the attack on Gebrev . Unit 29155 has also been linked more recently to a reported campaign to incentivize the Taliban and other terrorist and criminal elements in Afghanistan through cash bounties to attack American and other foreign troops in that country. In 2018, GRU agents targeted the offices of the OPCW in The Netherlands in what may have been an attempt to gain insight into the Skripal investigation or otherwise disrupt that work. Russia has a well-established history of using misinformation and disinformation to distract from various malign activities, including attacks on opposition figures and dissidents, often accusing opponents of being responsible for the exact same kinds of acts it stands accused of. An annotated picture that the Dutch Ministry of Defense released showing equipment authorities in that country recovered from a vehicle belonging to Russian GRU agents near the OPCW offices in 2018., Dutch Ministry of Defense via AP Of course, these are only some of the politically motivated assassinations and assassination attempts, inside the country and out, linked to the Kremlin since the fall of the Soviet Union and especially under the leadership of Russian President Vladimir Putin. One of the most infamous of these attacks was the killing of Alexander Litvinenko , another former Russian intelligence officer, in London in 2006 using a lethal dose of radioactive isotope polonium-210. It’s not necessarily clear why the Russian government may have targeted Navalny in this way now, having been content to jail him on no less than 13 occasions in the past. However, these sentences had not succeeded in pushing him out of Russian politics and there are indications that the Kremlin’s attitude toward him may have been changing in recent years already. In 2017, still unknown assailants sprayed him in the face with what initially appeared to be green antiseptic dye , but was later reported to be a possible chemical mixture of some kind that caused him to lose 80 percent of his vision in his right eye. Navalny blamed Russian authorities for orchestrating that attack and then failing to investigate. A photo Navalny provided to the press after the 2017 attack., Navalny courtesy photo via RFE/RL This also comes at a time when Putin is under particular strain, especially over the country’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic . In July, he was able to secure changes to the country’s constitution that notably included changes to presidential term limits , allowing him to run for two more six-year stints as the country’s head of state. Putin has been President since 2012 and also held the post between 1999 and 2008, following Boris Yeltsin’s resignation. He won his latest highly-controversial re-election after a poll Navalny was notably barred from taking part in, in 2018. There have been significant protests against Putin in Russia’s Far East Region this year and he has no doubt been looking at his smaller neighbor Belarus, where popular demonstrations have besieged that country’s dictatorial president Alexander Lukashenko and show no signs of letting up despite major crackdowns. Attempting to knock out one of Russia’s biggest opposition political actors would certainly be one tactic to try and put a chill through protestors critical of Putin. It would certainly be in line with past assassinations of the president’s critics. It remains to be seen how the German government will respond after consultations with its allies and partners in NATO and the EU, as well as how Russian authorities will react. Navalny’s condition was said to be improving, but he is still in a medically induced coma. If he were to die, that would undoubtedly change the calculus on all sides. What is clear is that there is little doubt now that Russia is willing to use its Novichok agents for politically motivated assassinations inside and outside of the country. UPDATE: 1:10pm EST The U.S. National Security Council has now issued a statement on Twitter saying that the U.S. government is “deeply troubled” by the German findings and “will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable.” Contact the author: Joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 2, 2020",Russia Spins Theories As U.K. Blames It For Second Chemical Attack,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two British citizens are still in critical condition after coming into contact with a nerve agent similar to the one that almost killed former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in a failed attempt earlier in 2018. Whether this second attack was deliberate or an accident byproduct of the first, in its typical style , the Kremlin has moved swiftly deny any involvement, make its own conspiratorial counter-accusations, and otherwise muddy the waters surrounding the first incident. Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, who have no apparent connection to Skripal or the Russian government, fell ill in Amesbury on June 30, 2018. The town is less than 10 miles from Salisbury, where the first attack occurred on March 4, 2018. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who came into contact with the same poison as her father, have both since recovered, but it was a long and reportedly arduous process . “It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on,” U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said in a statement to members of the country’s parliament on July 5, 2018. “It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison.” According to Javid, the United Kingdom had not yet determined whether or not the compound that had sickened Rowley and Sturgess was the same type or from the same batch as the one that put the Skripals into intensive care. He did, however, make clear that specialists had determined it was a so-called “ Novichok ” agent. Personnel wearing protective gear inspect a site potentially contaminated with a Novichok nerve agent in Amesbury in July 2018., Andrew Matthews/PA Wire via AP Translating broadly as “newcomer” in English, the Soviet Union reportedly began developing the Novichok family of chemical weapons in the 1970s in order to defeat NATO’s improving defensive measures. It remains unclear how long the program continued or if it might still be ongoing today under a different name. Post-Soviet Russian officials have at various times denied the project ever existed, either in part or in full , or under that specific name ,. The most significant official disclosure came when the Kremlin accused Lev Fyodorov and Vil Mirzayanov, scientists who say they worked on the program in 1992 of disclosing state secrets in talking about the project in interviews with Moskovskiye Novosti . Mirzayanov now lives in the United States. The Novichok family is reportedly both more lethal but safer to manage than other organophosphate nerve agents, such as Sarin or VX , often coming in a binary state with two distinct compounds that then mix to form the lethal substance. They function in the same way as the earlier chemical weapons, interrupting regular muscle movement and preventing the victim’s heart and lungs, among other things, from functioning normally. The “leading line of inquiry” is into the possibility that the two innocent bystanders came into contact with either a secondary contaminated site that Skripal never made it to or some leftover debris for that attack, such as a vial that held the nerve agent to begin with, according to Javid. Establishing a link between the chemical signatures between the two compounds could help support this theory, but the Home Secretary said that it might not be possible to make this connection conclusively after so much time has passed. Home Secretary Sajid Javid., David Mirzoeff/PA Wire via AP That the Novichok agent could be potentially deadly after so much time could already indicate that it is particularly persistent. It also raises the worrisome possibility that other remnants of the attempt on Skripal’s life might be strewn elsewhere in the immediate vicinity of Salisbury. Another possibility is that the Russian President Vladimir Putin or his government, or any middlemen it might have employed to carry out the initial operation, deliberately launched this second attack on random bystanders to cast aspersions on its involvement in any Novichok attacks past and future. A widely circulated and completely unsubstantiated conspiracy theory after the first poisonings was that U.K. authorities were behind the entire affair in order to justify foreign and domestic policies, as well as sanctions aimed at the Kremlin and the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two countries have had strained ties for years for a variety of reasons, not least of which concerns the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , another former Russian intelligence officer, who died in London in 2006 after getting duped into taking a lethal dose of the radioactive isotope polonium-210 . The United Kingdom accuses the Russian government of having been behind that assassination, as well. Russia and the United Kingdom also disagree on a host of other issues, including the Kremlin’s illegal seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region and support for separatists in that country, as well as its involvement in the conflict in Syria . In April 2018, British forces joined their American and French counterparts in launching strikes aimed at Syrian government chemical warfare sites, which officials in Moscow promptly denounced as illegal. Russian President Vladimir Putin., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP Since Rowley and Sturgess came into contact with the nerve agent in Amesbury, the Russian government has been quick to deflect from any possibility that it is responsible and instead accused the United Kingdom of being the ones who actually at fault. As we at The War Zone have noted, this is part of an increasingly structured and routine response from the Kremlin. Now, Russian officials have gone so far to suggest that the United Kingdom and its allies are the ones who are really spreading misinformation about the two chemical attacks. “Instead of genuine cooperation London is doing everything possible to muddy the waters, to confuse and frighten its own citizens,” an unnamed press officer at the Russian Embassy in London said in an official statement on July 5, 2018. “One can only guess what the reasons behind such a line of behavior are.” “We call on Theresa May’s government to put an end to the conspiracies with chemical agents and not to hamper the investigation into what happened to the Russian citizens in Britain,” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s top spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on the same day . She added that the accusations had been putting Russia through “ hell ,” especially as it is hosting the World Cup. Russian officials have used this latter point to insist that they could not have been involved in this latest attack, despite the possibility that the agent could have been sitting in the United Kingdom undiscovered since March. It is also just as easy to say that the World Cup would offer a good cover for such an attack precisely because it affords this sort of plausible deniability. This narrative, among others, is already spreading online on social media and elsewhere, another common component of Russian disinformation tactics. The Kremlin has the tools to readily boost any such counter-argument, no matter how unrealistic, to the point that those ideas take on an organic life of their own and become hard to differentiate from the original state-sponsored propaganda. It’s not clear whether the new war of words will have any impact on the two countries’ already cold relationship. U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May already described the assassination attempt on the Skirpals as being a “ brazen act of war ” that could have serious ramifications if the country conclusively determined Russia was involved at a state level. At the same time, May’s government is in a tough spot , particularly over its handling of the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union, also known as Brexit , which has also strained the country’s relationship with its traditional European partners. In addition, U.K. authorities have increasingly butted heads with U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration, which might have otherwise been sure to back up and course of action British officials decide to take. Despite unanimous agreement within the U.S. Intelligence Community, Trump continues to question the nature and extent of Russian meddling in the 2016 Presidential Election even as concerns mount that the Kremlin could be looking to influence the outcome of the upcoming 2018 mid-terms . It is increasingly clear that Russia had at least some impact on the referendum that led to Brexit, too. On July 4, 2018, a delegation of Republican members of congress held meetings in Russia where they reportedly raised the question of Russia’s election meddling, but not the Skripal incident or the latest poisoning. Russian lawmakers reportedly took the opportunity to quickly brush off the concerns about any impact they might have in the mid-terms. President Donald Trump walks with U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May., Olivier Douliery/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Vyacheslav Nikonov, a member of Russia’s parliament, or Duma, said the questioning around the election issue was ““was one of the easiest ones in my life,” according to The Washington Post . “One shouldn’t interfere in elections – well, we don’t interfere,” he said repeating the Kremlin’s official line on the matter that stands in conflict with ever increasing evidence to the contrary. Trump himself is scheduled to meet Putin later in July 2018 . The chemical attacks in the United Kingdom may not even rise to the forefront of those talks, though, which are expected to cover arms control and nuclear weapons issues, the status of Crimea , Russia’s involvement in Syria , and support for separate diplomatic endeavors regarding North Korea . But if political crises and other priorities in the United Kingdom and the United States end up pushing this issue to the side, it could easily embolden Putin to continue his long-standing campaign to silence opponents at home and abroad. The Russian president recently won a highly controversial re-election bid and will now be in charge of the country, barring some dramatic event, through at least 2024. “Those who serve us with poison will eventually swallow it and poison themselves,” Putin said dismissively of Skripal in March 2018, seeming to imply that the Kremlin was in fact behind that attack. This would seem to make it clear that if the United Kingdom and its allies can’t rise to the challenge we can only expect more such attacks in the future, which may end up threatening the lives random bystanders, such as Rowley and Sturgess, as well.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",Here’s What All Those Black Helicopters Were Doing Zipping Around Los Angeles Last Night,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of our readers reached out early this evening—September 1st, 2020—letting me know he saw a formation of four MH-6 Little Birds flying in tight formation over Interstate 5 near downtown Los Angeles. I joked at the time that it will be just a matter of hours until people start freaking out due to the urban training operations they were likely about to execute. Just like clockwork, a few hours after the sun had set, the social media posts began emerging. People couldn’t understand what they were seeing, and how can you blame them? Watching blacked-out little helicopters, most of which usually run with no lights, ripping low over rooftops, landing on tall buildings and quickly departing, and even flying down city streets, is certainly concerning—any action movie will tell you that. But the reality is that it’s only the world’s best helicopter pilots that are tasked with the hardest missions practicing to fight future wars and to respond to terrorist incidents in what the Pentagon has dubbed ‘megacities.’ There is no synthetic range that can provide a suitable training surrogate for such a demanding combat environment. So, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers, skip across the United States throughout the year to major cities getting this type of training in. They are often joined by Navy SEALs , Rangers , MARSOC , and Delta Force operators that they are traditionally tasked with carrying into battle. Sometimes they even work with federal law enforcement direct action teams, like the FBI’s vaunted Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) and folks from the intelligence community. This type of military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) training is precisely what people are seeing over downtown Los Angeles tonight. Check out the videos below: It was just a year and a half ago that the 160th SOAR took their tricked-out MH-6 Little Birds and a couple of MH-60 Black Hawks to the City of Angels to give a performance the likes of which we had never seen. They descended in unison into parking lots, literally flew down city streets , and “assaulted” a government building in Long Beach resulting in this spectacular picture . It is customary for there to be little if any warning to the public that these drills are scheduled to begin, which always causes everything from great concern to outlandish conspiracy theories. The reality is that there is no mystery, it is all just part of the regular training America’s most elite helicopter crews and the special operators they ferry around do, from New York to Miami to Denver to Portland. MH-6 Little Bird dropping off some operators on a government building in Long Beach during the unit’s 2019 visit to the Los Angeles area for urban training operations. , US Army In this first night of operations, the MH-6s can be seen whizzing around Downtown Los Angeles and landing and taking off from the top of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) building. Usually, four MH-6s fly from place to place at night in tight formation, with just the lead helicopter with its lights on. The crews wear night-vision goggles and use their advanced electronics to navigate precisely as a division. This is really spectacular to see in person. It’s only once you are beneath them you realize there are indeed four helicopters there, not one.. Once they arrive in an operating area, they seem to be a force many times their actual size, as they zip around a city for hours, dropping off and picking up on various rooftops and even skyrise ledges. The night bends the public’s senses and perceptions, making the whole thing even eerier from the bystander’s point of view. Obviously, with everything going on in the country right now and a spotlight on law enforcement and surveillance, the Night Stalker Little Birds are likely to draw even more hysteria than usual from an uninformed public.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 13, 2020",Test Aircraft Have Been Lugging DARPA’s Prototype Hypersonic Cruise Missiles Around,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency says it has successfully conducted captive-carry flight tests of prototype air-breathing hypersonic missiles from Lockheed Martin and Raytheon . The goal now is now to proceed to actual free-flight testing before the end of the year. These tests, which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) revealed had taken place in a press release on Sept. 1, 2020, are part of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) program. A captive-carry flight test means that the missiles remained attached to a test aircraft throughout the duration of the flight, which is typically done to gather data about how a particular design, as well as the aircraft carrying it, handles the basic stresses of being carried aloft and taken through various maneuvers. DARPA did not say where or where the testing had occurred or what aircraft carried the missiles. The U.S. Air Force had previously said that the B-52H Stratofortress bomber would be the test platform for the HAWC  program, as well as a number of other hypersonic weapons development efforts. B-52Hs have been used already for captive carry testing of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). A B-52H bomber carrying two AGM-183A prototypes during a captive carry test., USAF However, HAWC is largely a technology demonstration effort, so there would be no need to necessarily to integrate them onto an operational platform, such as the B-52. Northrop Grumman’s Stargazer, a heavily modified Lockheed L-1011 Tristar more commonly used a mothership for the Pegasus XL space launch rocket, but which has been used for captive-carry flight tests in the past , was notably observed on flight tracking software making a curious flight from Edwards Air Force Base, the Air Force’s premier flight test facility, in August. “Completing the captive carry series of tests demonstrates both HAWC designs are ready for free flight,” Andrew “Tippy” Knoedler, the HAWC program manager within DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said in a statement. “These tests provide us a large measure of confidence – already well informed by years of simulation and wind tunnel work – that gives us faith the unique design path we embarked on will provide unmatched capability to U.S. forces.” Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, the latter of which has partnered with Northrop Grumman for this effort, have been working on competing HAWC designs since at least 2019. DARPA had first initiated the project four years earlier in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force Laboratory. Little is known about either of the prototypes, though they are both known to be air-breathing using some form of high-speed scramjet engine . Scramjets traditionally do not work properly at low speeds and, generally, aircraft or missiles using this kind of propulsion require some kind of rocket booster to first accelerate them. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have also said that their design is a “waverider” type. This means that it “skips” along on the shockwaves that are produced as it flies along at hypersonic speed, defined as anything above Mach 5, which produces additional lift to help keep it in the air. Concept art Raytheon and Northrop Grumman previously releasd of their HAWC entry., Raytheon/Northrop Grumman When it comes to hypersonic aerospace developments, these kinds of air-breathing designs represent a much more significant technological leap than unpowered boost-glide vehicles, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . As a result, there has been much more secrecy surrounding them. HAWC flight testing was scheduled to take place during the 2020 Fiscal Year, which ends on Sept. 30. “We’re on track for both to have flights … before the calendar year ends,” Dr. Steven Walker, then-head of DARPA, told reporters on May 1, 2019 , referring to both HAWC and the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program. “[When] you actually get into the building of these things and qualifying the hardware, … things tend to slip,” he noted at the time. As already noted, DARPA and the Air Force have viewed HAWC as a technology demonstration project meant to lead into an actual air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile development program. In August, the Air Force announced that it would be considering designs from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon for “a solid-rocket boosted, air-breathing, hypersonic conventional cruise missile, air-launched from existing fighter/bomber aircraft.” Concept art of what Lockheed Martin has said reflects a possible follow-on to its HAWC design., Joseph Trevithick “In addition, DARPA is working in cooperation with military services and agencies, including the Missile Defense Agency , U.S. Navy , and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to validate, and eventually transition key technologies,” the agency announced in its press release regarding the HAWC captive-carry tests. “The extensive flight data collected is intended to increase the confidence in air-breathing hypersonic systems and reduce the risks to potential future acquisition programs across the U.S. government.” A slide from a Missile Defense Agency briefing at the 2020 Space and Missile Defense (SMD) Symposium, which notes that it expects to be involved in future HAWC testing, as well as TBG flight tests, to help it in the development of systems to track potential incoming hypersonic threats., MDA via Steve Trimble HAWC is just one of a number of known air-breathing hypersonic aircraft and weapons development efforts ongoing now across the U.S. military. Most recently, the Air Force announced a new project, called Mayhem. This program is focused at least in part on advanced scramjet development and appears to be aimed at acquiring an expendable air vehicle to test those engines, as well as various other technologies at hypersonic speeds. This is just a segment of a broader push within the U.S. military to develop various hypersonic capabilities, which does also include hypersonic boost-glide vehicles as warheads for long-range missiles. Notably, the Air Force recently let slip that it might be interested in acquiring a nuclear-armed boost-glide vehicle in the future, an indication of a potential shift away from a standing conventional-only policy when it comes to hypersonic weapons developments. Many of these efforts are being driven in no small part by knowledge of similar efforts ongoing among other countries, especially potential adversaries, such as Russia and China. Russia has already fielded a nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide weapon, called Avangard , on at least a limited scale. “China has placed a heavy emphasis on developing and testing hypersonic glide vehicles,” the Pentagon said in its latest report to Congress on Chinese military developments, which it also released on Sept. 1. “In August  2018, China successfully tested the XINGKONG-2 ( Starry Sky-2 ), which it publicly described as a hypersonic waverider vehicle. The PLARF [People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force] also paraded the DF-17 missile for the first time as part of the PRC’s 70th anniversary parade in 2019.” Hopefully, as testing of the HAWC prototypes continues, we will get additional information about the respective designs, what they look like, and their capabilities. These missiles look set to be an important stepping-stone in the U.S. military’s development of new air-breathing hypersonic weapons and other air vehicles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 11, 2020",New Mobile Operations Center Used To Support B-2 Stealth Bomber Deployment To Diego Garcia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has been using a first-of-its-kind mobile operations center as part of the deployment of three B-2 Spirits to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia . The service says that this readily deployable command post is an essential component of new expeditionary concepts of operations for these stealth bombers. Expanding the number of locations that the B-2 can operate from is something it has already been experimenting with, including by sending the bombers for the first time ever to Wake Island in the Pacific and Iceland in the North Atlantic in recent years. The “overseas mobile operations center” is a physical temporary facility that Air Force personnel erected specifically for this latest short-term B-2 deployment to Diego Garcia and it has since provided communications, mission planning, and other operational support for those aircraft. The bombers left their home base at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on Aug. 11, 2020, and arrived on the island 29 hours later. They have conducted a number of training missions over the Indian Ocean and Australia since then, which you can read about more in the War Zone ‘s previous reporting on this deployment . “Our objective out here is to create an ability to move a B-2 unit to any location in the world and generate combat sorties, as the Air Force Global Strike [Command] 2020 Strategic Plan outlines,” Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Conant, Bomber Task Force commander. “This is the future of bomber mission planning.” Satellite imagery of the three B-2 bombers at Diego Garcia on Aug. 18. The containers seen in the image next to some of the B-2 Shelter System hangars, some of which are more readily visible in the inset closeup, appear to be recent additions. , PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The B-2 is presently America’s most capable bomber aircraft and a key element of the country’s nuclear deterrent triad , presenting the ability to penetrate through dense integrated air defense networks to carry out both nuclear and conventional strikes deep inside enemy territory. Being able to launch those missions from an increasingly large constellation of bases around the world only adds to its already impressive capabilities. A B-2 Spirit stealth bomber sits on the ramp at Diego Garcia on Aug. 17, 2020., USAF Air Force Global Strike Command’s (AFGSC) 2020 Strategic Plan, which it released in October 2019 , is heavily influenced by the Dynamic Force Employment concept found in the latest National Defense Strategy. Dynamic Force Employment revolves around the idea of replacing routine rotational deployments with shorter-term, more irregular ones that are more difficult for opponents to anticipate and otherwise plan around. The U.S. military, as a whole, has been working to integrate Dynamic Force Employment into their concepts of operation, but it has been particularly visible with regards to the Air Force’s B-2, as well as B-1 and B-52 bomber fleets . In April, the service notably ended its Continous Bomber Presence missions to the strategic U.S. island of Guam in the Pacific, which had involved a new detachment of bombers arriving every six months since 2004. The War Zone was first to report on this significant operational shift, which has been followed by a surge of more dynamic bomber deployments in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as Europe. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, has been increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of established bases to strikes in the opening phases of a major conflict. In turn, there has been a growing focus on the development of new expeditionary concepts of operation to ensure that various units, especially those operating advanced stealthy combat aircraft , are still able to forward-deploy and otherwise stage closer to the action, when necessary. Dynamic Force Employment is certainly less so if there is only a limited number of known bases that can readily support America’s most capable aircraft. The Air Force has already made significant strides in being able to rapidly deploy stealthy aircraft to forward locations, with the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter community being pioneers in this space with the now years-old Rapid Raptor concept, which you can read about in more in this past War Zone piece . However, the ability to support more sustained operations at potentially austere and remote locations with robust and secure communications assets, as well as elements to safeguard them physically and in cyberspace , will be a key component of these kinds of operations going forward. A B-2 takes off from Diego Garcia on Aug. 15, 2020., USAF The challenge of just operating from Diego Garcia, a well-established facility that supported bombers flying strikes in Afghanistan and then Iraq in the years immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, was underscored after sending a detachment of B-52s to the island on short notice in April in response to a spike in tensions with Iran. “Flying combat operations from a remote island presented the 20 EBS [20th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron] with unique challenges to overcome, from logistics to communication,” the Air Force said in an official news item about that deployment. AFGSC’s new deployable mobile operations center is clearly meant to address at least some of these challenges, particularly when it comes to communications and the ability to perform more robust mission planning and execution independent of regional command centers that may be hundreds or even thousands of miles away, not to mention being potentially under attack or otherwise unreachable during a major crisis. “Our communications warriors are absolutely amazing,” Lieutenant Colonel Conant said. “They overcame numerous challenges to get this system operating.” “What we are doing out here is demonstrating expeditionary operations,” Air Force Major Justin Spencer, a weapons officer from the 393rd Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, the unit to which the B-2s on Diego Garcia are assigned, added. “This initiative will allow us to operate more dynamically than ever before.” USAF If AFGSC’s new mobile operations center is at all tailored to the very specialized communications capabilities of the B-2, it’s possible, if not highly probable, that will also be able to support its future B-21 Raider stealth bombers on similar deployments. It may well be able to support other bomber types, such as the B-1 and B-52, on expeditionary deployments, too. Beyond that, it seems very likely that other Air Force commands, as well as other units across the U.S. military, could leverage its capabilities to support an even wider array of aircraft, as well as other assets, at distributed forward-deployed locations. There are still other significant logistical challenges to overcome when it comes to these kinds of expeditionary operations, especially with regards to notoriously maintenance-intensive stealth aircraft. Keeping the vital stealth coatings on aircraft such as the B-2, which are highly sensitive to the elements, from deteriorating can be particularly difficult in a deployed setting. Diego Garcia does have specialized B-2 Shelter Systems (B2SS) in place to help protect the bombers and their stealth skins. Interestingly, satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained of the bombers on Diego Garcia on Aug. 18 did not show them using these facilities at the time the photos were taken. The Air Force also released pictures itself showing at least one of the aircraft out in the rain on Aug. 15. Air Force ground personnel work in the rain at Diego Garcia to prepare a B-2 for a sortie on Aug. 15., USAF Still, despite there being notable hurdles left to overcome, the first-ever employment of AFGSC’s new deployable operations center in support of B-2s on Diego Garcia represents another important step forward in ensuring that the Air Force can send these aircraft where ever they might need to go during a major conflict.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 11, 2019",Over 200 Guard And Reserve F-16s Can Now Carry The Dragon’s Eye Radar Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has been known that the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve have been quietly working on fielding the Northrop Grumman AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye active electronically-scanned array, or AESA , radar pod on the F-16, but now we know just how widespread this capability has become. In a LinkedIn post, Colonel Tim Bailey, the F-16 Systems Program Manager, stated that over 200 Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Vipers can now carry the advanced radar system. This gives these F-16s a massive leap in all-weather precision engagement and surveillance capability that can be efficiently bolted on and off the aircraft as the mission dictates. Bailey writes : Hurricane evacuations, snowstorms, and COVID quarantines weren’t enough to stop our field teams from upgrading over 200 US F-16s with the Northrop Grumman Dragon’s Eye Radar pod (ASQ-236) in a single year. This lethality upgrade gives Guard and AF Reserve Vipers an all-weather multi-target detection, track and engagement capability. The field team approach to the upgrade saved 40K hours of aircraft downtime and $15M compared to the traditional approach. Now more Vipers can “see, scan, shoot!” Since the pod’s inception, the F-15E Strike Eagle has been its primary platform. Now, over a decade since it entered service, it has become remarkably widespread across the F-15E community, with units deploying with the pod en masse now. You can read all about the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye pod and how it has matured within the Strike Eagle community in this past piece of ours . An F-15E Strike Eagle carrying the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye, with a white arrowing pointing to the pod., USAF Expanding this capability to the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard F-16 fleets, some of which are oldest in the inventory, makes great sense. While some of the Air Force’s Vipers are getting AN/APG-83 AESA radars, also known as the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), to replace their mechanically scanned AN/APG-68 radar sets, which will bring fantastic new capabilities to this middle-aged fighter jet force, the Dragon’s Eye pod offers plenty of capabilities for those jets that don’t get the new radar sets. It also offers additional capabilities that are not necessarily replicated by the AN/APG-83, as well. This includes being optimized for side-scanning and certain ground and surface surveillance and targeting modes. In fact, an F-16 with the new SABR in its nose and a Dragon’s Eye pod on its centerline would be an amazingly capable combination, but it will be even more essential for those jets that don’t have or are not slated to get a built-in AESA radar. Aside from the F-16, we know that the AN/ASQ-236 has been flown on AC-130 gunships and B-52s for testing purposes . It isn’t clear if either of those types will actually field the pod operationally. Dragon’s Eye hanging on a B-52. , USAF Regardless, now even the oldest Vipers in the Pentagon’s stable have a top-of-the-line AESA sensor that will allow them to bring a whole new level sensor fidelity to the fight, especially as networked weapons, in particular the GBU-57/B Small Diameter Bomb II , come online . It seems that this new capability was acquired for the F-16s quite efficiently as the development of the pod was already paid for and a more agile concept of fielding the system was adopted, as Colonel Bailey notes. This isn’t surprising, the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve have made incredible use of limited funds to keep their tactical aircraft up to speed technologically. Often times this has included innovating in their own way, including adopting off the shelf systems that have already been proven and their development paid for. Considering that the F-16 will serve within the USAF for decades to come , Dragon’s Eye will get a lot of use and will help breathe new life into the venerable Viper.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020",Airline Pilots Landing At LAX Report A Guy In Jetpack Flying Alongside Them,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As if 2020 couldn’t get any weirder, airline pilots landing at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Sunday, August 30th, reported seeing “a guy in a jetpack” flying about 300 yards off their wing while on final approach to the bustling airport. What makes the reports even stranger is that, like a scene out of The Rocketeer , the airliners were descending through 3,000 feet when jetpack guy showed up next to them. Fox 11 broke the story and has the air traffic control audio clips which you can listen to here . The exchanges went like this according to their report: American Flight 1997: “Tower, American 1997, we just passed a guy in a jetpack.” Tower: “American 1997, OK, thank you. Were they off to your left or right side?” American Flight 1997: “Off the left side, maybe 300 yards or so, about our altitude.” Fox 11 reports a Skywest pilot confirmed the sighting: Skywest Flight: “We just saw the guy passing by us in the jetpack.” Then the tower alerted an incoming Jet Blue flight to the reported hazard: Tower: “Jet Blue 23, use caution, a person in a jetpack reported 300 yards south of the LA final at about 3,000 feet, 10 mile final.” Jet Blue 23: “Jet Blue 23, we heard and we are definitely looking.” Another pilot chimed in: “Only in LA.” The airspace around LAX is some of the busiest and most complex in the United States. Having some dude barreling through the skies in some sort of a jetpack around the approach path to the airport, especially at the same altitude as the aircraft that are making their way through the landing corridor, isn’t just bonkers, it’s absolutely dangerous. There are a number of new jetpack-like designs that are remarkably capable , but all have very limited range and most have only very low-altitude flight envelopes. Yves “Jetman” Rossi’s winged jetpack is definitely capable of such a feat, but his flights have always occurred under highly controlled and well-coordinated circumstances and in sanitized airspace. They are also very high-profile in nature and require a mothership to launch from, such as a helicopter, or at least a very high point to leap from. So, apparently, someone has a system that is similarly capable, but they are stupid enough to actually use it in incredibly congested airspace as part of an undeclared stunt. It is possible that this was some sort of a drone that was made to look like a dude with a jetpack, although that seems like a longshot. The only other thing we can think of is that this may have been some sort of flying car/mobility solution that was just described as a jetpack. Flying at jet approach speeds and at 3,000 feet, among other issues, still seems like a reach with this scenario. Regardless, the dangerous realities of such a stunt are the same irrespective of the technology behind the craft that was involved. Pilots certainly see and report some weird things while plying their trade , but this is unique even by our standards . We are going to look into it. In the meantime, this serves as yet another reminder of the strange times we are living in. Author’s note: Hat tip to our buddy Matt Hartman for bringing this one to our attention!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A highly customized MH-60 special operations Black Hawk belonging to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , also known as the Night Stalkers, crashed on San Clemente Island late Thursday night. Two were killed and three more were injured in the tragic incident. 10 News San Diego, the local ABC affiliate, was first to report on the mishap . San Diego Union-Tribune later quoted J. Elise Van Pool, a U.S. Army spokeswoman, as stating: “At this time we are not releasing anything beyond the statement provided… We are still in the process of making next of kin notifications and will not release any additional information until that process is complete.” Another official made it clear to the Union-Tribune that the crash occurred on San Clemente Island, which lies off the coast of Southern California. They also confirmed with an unnamed official that the 160th SOAR was the unit involved. The island is really a massive military installation with a bombing range, radar and telemetry support infrastructure, a large airfield, and more, including a sprawling special operations training area on its northern tip. This area is dominated by an elaborate military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) training complex that I was the first to profile six years ago. You can read all about it here . It is unclear at this time if the crash happened at this complex or somewhere else nearby, but extremely dynamic flying does occur at the MOUT site and the 160th SOAR are regular visitors there. Waterborne infiltration and exfiltration, aerial refueling, ship boarding, and many other special operations training tasks occur around the island that could involve the 160th SOAR, as well. The MOUT on San Clemente Island is part of a larger special operations complex that takes up the northern tip of the Navy-controlled island. It includes a small city and a nearby fishing village, which simulate urban environments where U.S. special operators may find themselves on real-world missions. The U.S. Navy SEALs, which are based nearby in Coronado, primarily use the complex, but other special operations units visit it, as well. , GABRIEL ZEIFMAN The 160th SOAR is tasked with the most challenging helicopter flying on earth and they regularly train with special operations personnel from across the services and federal law enforcement. They are widely regarded as the most capable helicopter pilots on the planet, often operating at night, at very low altitudes , and in tight terrain , which is increasingly urban in nature. This terrible incident comes just three weeks after seven Marines and a Sailor drowned near the island while inside an AAV amphibious vehicle.

Details are still limited, but a U.S. Navy E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft assigned to Airborne Command & Control Squadron 120, or VAW-120, crashed and burned near the town of Nelsonia on Virginia’s eastern shore. The pilot and three crew members bailed out safely before the plane hit the ground. The first reports of the incident began to emerge at around 4:00 PM local time after Accomack County Sheriff’s Office and Virginia State Police responded to alerts of a possible plane crash. The E-2 reportedly came down near the intersection of Berry Road and Mason Road, which are also Virginia State Routes 680 and 681 respectively. The aircraft was said to be “ fully involved ” with a fire after hitting the ground. Navy Commander Jennifer Cragg, a spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic, subsequently provided the following statement to The War Zone : An E-2C Hawkeye, assigned to Airborne Command & Control Squadron (VAW) 120 Fleet Replacement Squadron on board Naval Station Norfolk, crashed in the vicinity of Wallops Island, Aug. 31. The E-2 crashed at approximately 4:05 p.m. The two pilots and two crewmembers bailed out of the aircraft safely. At the time of the crash, the E-2 was conducting a training flight. VAW-120 reports to Airborne Command & Control and Logistics Wing commanded by Capt. Michael France. Initial reports indicate no structures or personnel on the ground were damaged or injured in the mishap. The cause of the mishap is under investigation. As the Fleet Replacement Squadron for the E-2, VAW-120 is responsible for training new pilots and mission system operators, as well as maintainers, on the type. A Hawkeye typically has a crew of five , consisting of a pilot and co-pilot, as well as a combat information center officer, air control officer, and radar operator. The newest E-2D Advanced Hawkeye has the option for the co-pilot to act as another mission systems operator, but generally in addition to the three individuals already working in the rear of the aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NATO says that a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet committed a “significant violation” of Danish airspace while intercepting a U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress in the Baltic Sea region last week. The incident occurred as six of these heavy bombers, including four from a detachment presently forward-deployed in the United Kingdom, were conducting overflights of all 30 members of the Alliance, including the United States and Canada. Over the weekend, the Pentagon released video showing another Flanker turning directly in front of one of a B-52 that was taking part in this unprecedented mission as it flew over the Black Sea, which The War Zone previously reported on . NATO’s Allied Air Command says that the Su-27, operating from Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea, intercepted the B-52 as it was approaching Denmark’s Bornholm Island on Aug. 28, 2020. Rather than turning back, the command says the Flanker followed the bomber “well into Danish airspace over the island,” resulting in a serious breach “of airspace of a NATO nation.” “This incident demonstrates Russia’s disrespect of international norms and for the sovereign airspace of an Allied nation,” U.S. Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, head of Allied Air Command, as well as U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), said in a statement. “We remain vigilant, ready and prepared to secure NATO airspace 24/7.” A still picture of the Su-27 flying alongside the B-52 as it approached Bornholm Island on Aug. 28., NATO A map showing Bornholm Island in the Baltic Sea, as well as Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave to the east., Google Maps The Royal Danish Air Force launched their own quick reaction force of F-16AM/BM Viper fighter jets in response to the incident, but they were unable to intercept the Russian Su-27 before it turned back for Kaliningrad. The video below shows Danish F-16AM fighter jets flying alongside a B-52 during the flights on Aug. 28 that took the bombers over all 30 NATO members. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6LnN8vcZbHc Russian intercepts of NATO aircraft in the narrow confines of the Baltic Sea are common, as are NATO intercepts of Russian aircraft , and airspace violations are certainly not unheard of. In September 2019, Estonia, another member of the Alliance, said a Russian Su-34 Fullback combat jet flew into its airspace along the Baltic. In 2016, Finland registered a complaint about a similar intrusion by a pair of armed Flankers into its airspace in the adjacent Gulf of Finland. There is an especially long history of Russian intercepts of NATO intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as those from other European countries the region, flying near Kaliningrad, which is an immensely strategic Russian territory. In 2014, Russian fighters chased a U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy plane into Swedish airspace in the Baltic. A year later, the Pentagon announced a “sloppy” and “unprofessional” intercept of an RC-135U Combat Sent in the region. The enclave, which is home to the Russian Navy’s Baltic Fleet , as well as a unit equipped with Iskander-M nuclear-capable ballistic missiles and a major air base, is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania, who are both NATO members. However, this latest airspace violation over Danish territory comes amid a noticeable increase in friction between Washington and Moscow, in particular. As noted, this incident occurred on the same day that another Flanker performed the potentially dangerous “thumping” maneuver in front of the B-52 over the Black Sea. These are just some of the incidents in a recent spate of tit-for-tat signaling and other posturing between the United States and Russia that you can read more about in this recent War Zone piece . This Danish airspace violation by a Russian Su-27 shows that whatever combination of present geopolitical factors might be driving these incidents, they are truly multi-faceted in nature and show no sign of slowing down at the moment.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though this iteration of the biennial Rim Of The Pacific (RIMPAC) international naval exercises off Hawaii is smaller than in years past, the highlight of the drills, where a real ship is sunk with live weaponry, wasn’t dropped from the program. For the sinking exercise, otherwise known as SINKEX , the ex-USS Durham , a mothballed amphibious cargo ship that was pulled from service in 1994, was the target. The Navy has released the first video of its demise, which appears to show a succession of no less than three anti-ship cruise missiles ripping through the ship’s hull and detonating, along with a showering of shrapnel or submunitions from another weapon. Still-frames from the video show an anti-ship cruise missile, very likely an RGM-84 Harpoon , skimming just above the waves before punching through the left side of the ship’s hull and detonating. This is followed by two more missiles, striking amidships, just above the waterline, in a remarkably compact cluster. Between missiles two and three, a showering of objects appears to impact the water next to the ship. An object flies into the frame from left to right just prior to the splashes appearing. This appears to have been a cluster/area effects weapon, like an air-burst shell from a deck gun, or possibly an older air-launched JSOW or guided rocket artillery . You can see the anti-ship cruise missile about to hit the hull in this screengrab. It appears to be a Harpoon. , Youtube Screencap Missile #2., Youtube Screencap Missile #3, notice the impacts on the water in the foreground. This appears to have been another weapon or deck-gun shell. , Youtube Screencap The Harpoon starred in the last SINKEX, as well, in a test that led to the venerable anti-ship missiles being reintegrated onto some of the U.S. Navy’s nuclear attack submarines. You can read all about this and the latest version of Harpoon here and here . Often times, the Navy will steadily release more info about the SINKEX and who and what was involved as time goes on, but they have already offered this statement with some general details: Live fire from ships and aircraft participating in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise sank the decommissioned amphibious cargo ship ex-USS Durham (LKA 114), Aug. 30. The sinking exercise (SINKEX) provided participating units the opportunity to gain proficiency and confidence in their weapons and systems through realistic training that could not be duplicated in simulators. “Simulation is a critical part of our training but there is nothing better than to conduct live fire training,” said Royal Australian Navy Capt. Phillipa Hay, commander, RIMPAC 2020 Task Force One. “Sinking exercises are an important way to test our weapons and weapons systems in the most realistic way possible. It demonstrates as a joint force we are capable of high-end warfare.” Former Navy vessels used in SINKEXs, referred to as hulks, are prepared in strict compliance with regulations prescribed and enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency under a general permit the Navy holds pursuant to the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. Each SINKEX is required to sink the hulk in at least 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet) of water and at least 50 nautical miles from land. Surveys are conducted to ensure people and marine mammals are not in an area where they could be harmed during the event. Prior to being transported for participation in a SINKEX, each vessel is put through a rigorous cleaning process, including the removal of all liquid polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from transformers and large capacitors, small capacitors to the greatest extent practical, and all trash, floatable materials, mercury or fluorocarbon-containing materials, and readily detachable solid PCB items. Petroleum is also cleaned from tanks, piping, and reservoirs. A Navy environmental, safety and health manager and a quality assurance supervisor inspect the environmental remediation conducted in preparation of a vessel’s use in a SINKEX. Upon completion of the environmental remediation, the manager and supervisor provide signed certification of the work in accordance with EPA requirements.

UPDATE: 2:10AM PST— Upon a closer examination of the video, I noticed that there appears to have been a 4th missile that arrives just prior to the first perpendicular impact of the string of three missiles. It appears to have been a low aspect/head-on attack profile shot and the missile seems to of just missed or glanced off the hull. Typically, we never see these types of engagements, with the anti-ship cruise missiles making their terminal runs at the sides of the ship, where the vessel presents the best aspect (largest target) and signature. I am curious if this was an intentional low-aspect shot test of some sort. If it did hit, it would have skewered the ship with two missiles attacking from perpendicular vectors and impacting at roughly the same time. Regardless, we know at least one other anti-ship missile was fired at the doomed vessel, making the count four confirmed. It still isn’t clear what the area effects weapon was.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 11, 2020",Russian Submarine Sets Off Alarm Bells After Surfacing Near Alaska Amid Rash Of Posturing (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Pacific Fleet has claimed that the surfacing of the guided-missile submarine Omsk in the Bering Sea off Alaska yesterday was “routine,” despite it being a highly unusual event that set of alarm bells within the U.S. military. This sub is presently taking part in the largest Russian naval exercise in this area since the fall of the Soviet Union, which is tied to the country’s increasing military activities in the strategic Arctic region . This comes amid a host of other instances of military posturing between Washington and Moscow, including the U.S. Navy’s recent and equally rare decision to publicize a visit by the highly advanced, first-in-class USS Seawolf to Norway. Russian state-run media outlet RIA Novosti published the comments downplaying Omsk ‘s activities on Aug. 28, 2020. The day before, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) had publicly announced that it was monitoring the activities of an unspecified submarine sailing on the surface in international waters near Alaska. At that time, NORTHCOM said that it was prepared to render assistance to the boat, if necessary, suggesting it might be experiencing an emergency of some kind, but there has been no indication since that this was the case. “If it’s not a casualty [breakdown of some kind] on board the submarine, it’s a clear signal that Russia is deploying near our waters,” Aaron Amick, a veteran U.S. Navy submariner and War Zone contributor , said. “It appears to be a response to the U.S. Navy public message [with Seawolf in Norway]. Let’s see if it’s a casualty first.” Omsk is a Project 949A, or Oscar II class , submarine, which have a distinctively wide hullform. This is because these boats have long compartments on either side, set between the inner and outer hulls. A picture of the Oscar II class submarine Smolensk highlighting the distinctive wide-bodied design., via Reddit Each of these two spaces contains a dozen launchers for the massive P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missile, which NATO also refers to as the SS-N-19 Shipwreck , giving the Oscar IIs a total load of 24 of these weapons. The submarines also have four 533mm torpedo tubes, which they can use to launch heavyweight torpedos, as well as the RPK-6 Vodopad anti-submarine missile, or SS-N-16 Stallion, a unique weapon that you can read about more in this past War Zone story . Omsk is just one of approximately 50 warships and submarines that have been taking part in the live-fire exercises the Bering Sea. On Aug. 27, the Russian Ministry of Defense had released a video, seen in the Tweet below, from the drills that included a clip of this boat firing one of its Shipwreck missiles. Russian authorities have said that the Project 1164 Slava class guided missile cruiser Varyag fired at least one of its P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship cruise missiles, as well. Another unspecified warship or submarine also launched a P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missile as part of the drills. The drills in the Bering Sea are of an unprecedented scale, with some 40 aircraft also participating, and has been drawing increasing public attention, even beyond the Omsk sailing on the surface. “We were notified by multiple fishing vessels that were operating out [in] the Bering Sea that they had come across these vessels and were concerned,” U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Kip Wadlow told the Associated Press on Aug. 27. The Russian drills are juxtaposed against the latest iteration of the U.S. Navy-led Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise is getting close to wrapping up. RIMPAC 2020, which began on Aug. 17 and runs through Aug. 31, is the U.S. military’s premier Pacific exercise and is also a live-fire event. It is also a multi-national event, with allies and partners from around the world taking part. Unfortunately, do the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s exercise was notably scaled back . “Originally, RIMPAC 2020 had planned to include up to 30 countries, more than 50 ships and submarines, more than 200 aircraft, and 25,000 personnel – 4,000 of those ashore for operations and support functions,” Navy Vice Adm. Scott Conn, head of U.S. 3rd Fleet, said in a pre-recorded video marking the beginning of the exercise. “That would have been the largest RIMPAC to date. We have scaled that down to 10 nations, 22 ships, one submarine, and approximately 5,300 personnel, all at sea. On Aug. 28, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper Tweeted out a video showing him watching the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Lake Erie and the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Chung-Hoon fire their own missiles at RIMPAC 2020, before the social media post was deleted for unknown reasons. For its part, the Russian Navy has specifically linked its drills to the Kremlin’s broader push to increase its military presence in the increasingly strategic Arctic region. “We are building up our forces to ensure the economic development of the region,” Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, the Russian Navy’s top officer, said in a statement . “We are getting used to the Arctic spaces.” For years now, Russia has been dramatically expanding its military activities in the Arctic, as well as establishing a constellation of new and expanded bases across the region. Earlier this month, The War Zone obtained satellite imagery showing major construction in progress to extend the runway and improve other facilities at Nagurskoye Air Base, which is part of the Russian military’s northernmost military outpost. Competition in the Arctic, as well as the potential for conflict , has been growing as global climate change has made it easier for military forces, as well as commercial interests , to operate in and otherwise access the remote region on a more regular basis. Rights to undersea resources, from fish to oil, as well as sovereignty over potential shipping lanes, are likely to be increasing points of contention in the future. In March 2020, a pair of Russian Tu-142 Bear long-range maritime patrol planes flew over a base camp on an ice floe in international waters that was supporting a U.S. Navy Ice Exercise (ICEX) involving multiple American submarines. U.S. Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force jets intercepted the Tu-142s and escorted them out of the area, but the messaging was clear. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OnK3oKNsXYo On Aug. 28, 2020, NORTHCOM announced that Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters had intercepted three groups of two Tu-142s, six in total, that had entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) overnight. Those aircraft remained in the ADIZ, but in international waters no closer than 50 miles to Alaska, for five hours. “This year, we’ve conducted more than a dozen intercepts, the most in recent years. The importance of our continued efforts to project air defense operations in and through the north has never been more apparent,” Air Force General Glen VanHerck, who is presently head of NORTHCOM, as well as the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said in a statement. Omsk running on the surface close enough to Alaska to trigger the equally unusual public response from NORTHCOM is another indication of the kinds of shows of force that look set to be increasingly common in the region in the future. As noted, the Russian submarine’s apparently quite visible appearance near Alaska could also have been a tit-for-tat response to USS Seawolf ‘s publicized stop in Norway last week. For years, the Navy has been warning itself about increasing Russian submarine activity , especially close to America’s shores in the Atlantic . Omsk’s surfacing near Alaska demonstrates Russia’s continued ability to conduct operations in the Pacific, as well. This all comes amid a notable uptick in posturing between the United States and Russia on various fronts. Just today, four B-52 bombers took part in a mission to fly through the airspace of all of NATO’s European members, with some 80 other allied aircraft also taking part, another unprecedented show of force and demonstration of alliance unity. Two more of these bombers conducted sorties over the United States and Canada. A total of six B-52s, all nuclear-capable, had first touched down at RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom for a short-term deployment to the region last weekend. The bombers had flown from their home base in North Dakota via a polar route that mimicked a flight profile they could employ during an actual strike on targets in Russia. American and Russian troops were also involved in a serious dustup in northeastern Syria earlier this week , the most recent in a string of increasingly worrisome altercations . Authorities from both countries continue to dispute who was at fault for this latest incident, in which a Russian military vehicle struck a U.S. vehicle, leaving seven Americans with various injuries. While it’s not entirely clear what is driving this significant increase in signaling between Russia and the United States, the posturing is definitely increasing in both size and scope in various areas around the world with no indication that either side will be slowing things down anytime soon. UPDATE: 3:20pm EST Hans Kristensen, the Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, has now put together some data indicating where the exact sighting of Omsk may have taken place, which has not been publicly announced by Russian or American authorities. Local news in Alaska indicates that the fishing boats that encountered the Russian vessels taking part in the exercises had been sailing approximately 80 miles west of St. Matthew Island in The Bering Sea. This may be where the submarine was also spotted. The Russian Ministry of Defense has also now confirmed from its side that Tu-142s did take part in a flurry of aviation activity that included sorties in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Baltic Sea in Europe in the past 24 hours. A total of eight Tu-142s, along with four Il-38 May maritime patrol planes, two Su-24M Fencer combat jets, two Tu-95MS Bear bombers, and one Il-78 aerial refueling tanker took part in these flights, though Russian authorities did not say which aircraft flew over what bodies of water specifically.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 31, 2020",Pentagon Releases Terrifying Video Of Russian Su-27 Turning Directly In Front Of A B-52,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has released what is possibly the most troubling video we have seen of a so-called ‘unsafe intercept’ between one of its aircraft and Russian fighters. The incident occurred on August 28th, 2020, when the U.S. Air Force sent six B-52s, including four from a contingent forward deployed to RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom, to traverse every NATO member country’s airspace in a show of strength and solidarity for the alliance. This included flights over Eastern Europe and the tense Black Sea region, where the intercept took place. You can read all about this highly unique large-scale bomber mission in this recent War Zone piece . The maneuver the Su-27s executed is sometimes referred to as ‘thumping’ or a ‘head-butt’ and it has the potential to be extremely dangerous depending on how it is performed. Regardless, it’s never welcome. In the video, can see the Su-27 pull up close to the B-52’s left-wing before pulling forward, up, and crossing in front of and above the bomber’s forward path. It’s easy to miss, but another clip towards the end of the video shows a Su-27 doing a similar maneuver, but directly in front of the nose of the B-52 at incredibly close range. To call the maneuver dangerous or unprofessional would be an understatement. The Pentagon states: At approximately 11:19 a.m. on Aug. 28, 2020, two Russian Su-27 Flanker pilots intercepted a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber that was conducting routine operations in the black sea over international waters. The Russian pilots flew in an unsafe and unprofessional manner while crossing within 100 feet of the nose of the B-52 multiple times at co-altitude and while in afterburner causing turbulence and restricting the B-52’s ability to maneuver. The B-52 Stratofortress aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace exercising our freedom of navigation and overflight. The U.S. Air Force routinely operates aircraft in the region in accordance with recognized international safety standards as prescribed in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules of flight. Just for reference, at cruise speed, a B-52 covers about 750 feet per second. So, crossing 100 feet or so near perpendicular to the bomber’s direction of travel is literally a blink of an eye away from a collision. The Su-27 Flanker seen in the video likely originated out of Crimea. A contingent of the heavy fighters are deployed to Russia’s primary airbase on the peninsula and are tasked with standing alert to intercept NATO aircraft venturing east over the Black Sea. B-52s and B-1Bs have been active in the area in recent months, including practicing launching cruise missile strikes , an act that Moscow is clearly not pleased with. We constantly hear of unsafe intercepts between U.S., Russian , and Chinese aircraft , but rarely have we seen such remarkable footage that highlights exactly what went on. In fact, the lack of good video evidence has been an issue in the past . Considering that the B-52 crew was ready and waiting with a video camera in the cockpit shows that this is now changing. This incident is yet another sign that we are barreling into a timeframe of peculiarly strong posturing on both sides. You can read a summary of these recent events here .

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 4, 2020",Six B-52s Are Flying Over All 30 NATO Nations In An Unprecedented Show Of Force (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a dramatic demonstration of NATO airpower, six U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress strategic bombers, four in Europe and two in North America, have teamed up with other alliance aircraft to perform overflights of all 30 member nations on August 28, 2020. The mission, dubbed Allied Sky, is being billed as an extension of the latest regular Bomber Task Force (BTF) deployment to Europe. Currently, six nuclear-capable B-52Hs from the 5th Bomb Wing at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota are operating out of RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England. You can read more about this latest B-52 deployment to Europe in this recent piece of ours. Since 2018, routine BTF deployments have taken place in the European theater of operations and involve regular coordination between USAF bombers, including B-1s and B-2s , as well as B-52s, and other aircraft â€” chiefly fighters and air-to-air refueling tankers â€” from allies and partners. They also provide an opportunity for bombers to train in the European environment alongside other forces on the ground and at sea.Â According to a statement from U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), Allied Sky â€œis intended to demonstrate NATO solidarity, enhance readiness and provide training opportunities aimed at enhancing interoperability for all participating aircrews from the U.S. and NATO allies.â€ Two B-52s overhead RAF Fairford, England, on August 22, 2020., U.S. AIR FORCE PHOTO BY SENIOR AIRMAN EUGENE OLIVER In order to cover all 30 NATO member nations, Allied Sky made use of two â€œteamsâ€ of aircraft. Four of the six B-52s deployed to RAF Fairford covered the European portion of the mission. For the North American leg of the mission, another pair of 5th Bomb Wing B-52s are operating from their home station of Minot AFB, for flights over the United States and Canada. The bombers on tour through Europe are working alongside fighters and aerial refueling tankers from other NATO nations, with the various assets meeting up in the skies over each host nation. So far, we have had confirmation of Czech and Hungarian Gripens fighters meeting up with the bombers, as well as Romanian MiG-21 LanceR fighters. Refueling assets have included a Turkish Air Force KC-135R Stratotanker, a type that was used to top up U.S. Air Force B-1 bombers for the first time during training in the Black Sea last May.

A Czech Air Force JAS 39C Gripen fighter accompanies a B-52., U.S. EMBASSY PRAGUE VIA TWITTER With so many assets from different nations operating as part of a complex mission, Allied Sky is clearly a huge undertaking and one that offers an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate and test the interoperability of NATO air arms, as well as the allianceâ€™s command and control procedures. These capabilities could be called upon during a major conflict in Europe, or elsewhere, where the alliance would act together on a large scale. A show of strength and solidarity is particularly important at the moment given the strains that NATO is under. Recent diplomatic cracks in the alliance have included President Donald Trumpâ€™s war of words on Germany in particular due to its lack of investment in NATO, and the Trump administrationâ€™s general claim that member countries are not paying their way when it comes to collective defense. â€œU.S. security commitments to the NATO alliance remain ironclad,â€ explained General Tod Wolters, the EUCOM commander. â€œTodayâ€™s Bomber Task Force mission is another example of how the alliance sustains readiness, improves interoperability and demonstrates our ability to deliver on commitments from across the Atlantic.â€ A B-52 takes off from RAF Fairford on August 27, 2020., U.S. AIR FORCE PHOTO BY AIRMAN 1ST CLASS JESSE JENNY The six B-52s now at RAF Fairford arrived at the base on August 22, when it was noted that â€” unusually â€” all were apparently in a nuclear-capable configuration. Earlier BTF missions usually involved a mix of conventional and nuclear-capable Stratofortresses. â€œBTF missions are long-planned and not in response to any current political events occurring in Europe,â€ EUCOM stated, but Allied Sky does come at a time of particularly strained relations between Russia and the West. A Romanian Air Force MiG-21 LanceR and a B-52 meet up over Romania., ROMANIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE VIA TWITTER Since arriving in Europe, the B-52s have taken part in high-profile maneuvers with Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16s and F-35As off the coast of Norway. The same country has seen recent activity by the U.S. Navyâ€™s secretive submarine USS Seawolf . In an unusual move â€” perhaps tailored to send a message to Moscow â€” the U.S. Navy released a number of pictures of the nuclear-powered attack submarine surfaced in a fjord near TromsÃ¸. Then thereâ€™s the situation in Belarus, where demonstrations opposing the countryâ€™s authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko show no sign of diminishing. Lukashenko has stated that he expects Moscow to help ensure his countryâ€™s security if required, but thereâ€™s little indication of what this support might consist of â€” providing Russia does indeed decide to come to his aid.

Currently forward deployed to Poland â€” which neighbors Belarus â€” are 18 F-16s from the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany. The fighter jets are participating in bilateral training with the Polish Air Force under a regular Aviation Detachment at Åask Air Base. Although Allied Sky is thought to be a one-off event, itâ€™s almost certain that NATO will continue to use the Bomber Task Force deployments to Europe to signal the allianceâ€™s unity. Itâ€™s also a powerful means of demonstrating the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s airborne nuclear deterrent to would-be foes. UPDATE: 3:05pm EST Russian Air Force Su-27 Flanker fighter jets apparently intercepted at least one of the B-52s flying through Europe today as it passed through the Black Sea.
